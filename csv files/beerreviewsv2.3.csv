"Citra forward (pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine etc), mild bitter finish, it is good but doesn’t really stand out from the crowd though that said it is still quietly very good"
What?!?! This beer is hop magic!
"The stamp is a bit smudged, but it looks like the bottom of the can: says: ""CANNED ON 08/02/18 F4392 09:30"""
Wow isn't that the most meanest & toughest beer can artwork that I have laid eyes on. It looks the part of an IPA. I was expecting more an east coast IPA that had a fair amount of malts to go along with bitter hoppiness that these beers tend to bring to the table. I am a little disappointed in this IPA guys. Well it does taste edgy & bold as what is expected with this type of beer can artwork. Cheers! B-
"Aggressive but good. Citrus aroma, nice color and good Hoppiness. I still have a couple to enjoy."
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip 
"Poured from a 16 OZ can into a pint glass at Beer Head Pub in Schaumburg, IL. I loved this beer. The appearance was a cloudy gold orange color with a nice white head. The aroma was citrus and hops. Outstanding taste."
"Had on tap at the Firehouse in Normal, IL."
This beer has been on my 'bucketlist' for quite some time. Finally distributing out to CO.
Received a 4pack thanks to Beer Temple Chicago’s great online service. 
World class.
The best I've ever had. Perfect piney/citrus balance with strong hops. Not boozy at all.
"I'm not sure how this beer got such high ratings. To start, I was very put off by the dark branding of the can. At least with Stone's shitty branding, you usually get decent beer. Totally stealing this review from another reviewer, as he put it perfectly."
Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 16 oz. can into an El Catador teku glass.
From tasting notes 10/20/17
"Draught in Minneapolis Airport: This one pours a cloudy, golden color. There was pretty much no head or lacing. Good nose. Lots of tropical hops, with pine, citrus and some pineapple. The taste is very good. Tropical hops dominate, but much more bitter than expected with all those other hops in there. Pine and citrus flavors also."
"Had on tap at Butcher and the Boar. The beer had a murky, dark orange appearance with big bubbly white head. Aromas were rich in pineapple while the taste included sweet orange and pineapple upfront with bitter end. Pretty decent carbonation for the mouthfeel. Overall, really good."
"Poured from a 1 pint can into a Shaker pint glass, ""canned on"" date 3-7-18."
Just like a Toppling Goliath's Sue.
"Pours a brilliant bright orange with good carbonation. Huge tropical aroma with slight pine. One of the best beers to nose. Tastes of pineapple, citrus, and orange. Mellow hop flavor. Wonderful mouthfill that coats the tongue in tropical leftovers."
"Great beer, too bad it's so pricey"
yes. Drink it till the Uber drops you at the door. It's worth the morning after. And yes...you should have one more.
Poured into a snifter. Hazy deep Orange color with a good bit of sediment. Strong tropical aroma. Good tropical flavor with a good bit of malt coming through. Good Solid hoppy finish that I like quite a bit. All in all sweeter than I typically like but a good solid beer.
"Pours a slightly hazy dark orange. Not pulpy, but it just looks juicy. Head production is strong, and retention is very good."
This might be the only IPA that's just as delicious to drink at room temperature than from a cooler. Impeccable consistency.
A big thank you to Matt for this.
"16 ounce can, canned December 14th 2017. "
August 2015
"16 oz can, canned 10/26/17. Pours super hazy yellow orange with a medium fluffy white head that retains well and laces the glass some."
"Lots of floating sediment in the can. One downside to a can vs. a bottle is being able to see the sediment coming and avoid pouring it into the glass. The aroma is full of pine and tropical fruit. Clean hoppy flavor, with enough malt to back up the hops. There's a long lingering bitter finish here, with a great dryness. Overall, it's another solid beer from Surly"
From memory.
Pours an orange-gold color with a small white head that breaks rather quickly leaving a small island of bubbles in the middle. There is little lacing. Some suspended particulates as well. 
Poured from tap in MSP airport. Perfect dark yellow hue with some cloud. Great aroma of citrus with equally great taste. Great amount of hops and no lingering bitterness. Great finish on palat.
Canned 7 weeks ago.
One of my favorites. Great balance. Prefer this to Surly Furious.
"From a 16 oz can (canned October 12, 2017) to a tulip glass. "
"A - Cloudy orange body, with tiny white flakes suspended within, a full head, and extensive lacing."
Poured from a 16oz can into glass. Bottom of can is stamped 'CANNED ON 08/31/17 F3970 10:02'.

"16oz, canned on 09/14/17"
Poured from a 16oz can with a canned on date of 9/21/17;into a tulip (as recommended on the can).
"Pour great golden color, but mine had some white shit in the glass, unsettled stuff. Great smell in this beer. Smooth with slight crisp feel and a great taste."
"Pours hazy, orange in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is grapefruit, mango, and a touch of pine and orange. Bitter, medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. One of the better Surly beers I have had. Really good IPA...Glad I picked up a four pack...Will get this again."
1 PINT can
"Canned 8/31. Pours a hazy golden orange with a thin white head. Smell is floral with a strong mango scent. Taste is mango, grapefruit, and a lingering bitterness. Malt sweetness is present but not center stage. Feel is medium-heavy with a good amount of carbonation. One of the best IPAs around here, only lackluster thing is the smell."
"What a great New Beer Sunday (Week 656)! I warmed up/tuned up during the Viqueens/Stillers game today with several Surly beers that I had previously reviewed, but once I got up a good head of steam, The CANQuest (tm) kicked into gear & I really began to have a good time. "
"Hops are harsh and unbalanced with some chemical byproducts. To be fair though, this was consumed several months from the canned date. Will revisit if I obtain a fresh can."
Can dated 6/13/17. Poured into Teku glass.
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass.
"From a can that was already 2 months old. Despite the relative lack of freshness, this is insanely hoppy yet balanced. Crazy pine and tropical notes, with an intense and prolonged bitterness and a chewable mouthfeel. Some nice dankness too. Worth the hype in my opinion."
So great! Love Todd the axeman. One of the few beers I've tasted and instantly liked.
"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy amber orange with white head. Aroma is pine and citrus notes. Taste is heavily bitter. Flavors of resin, grapefruit, orange, papaya, pine, caramel, toffee. Very nice bitter IPA."
"16 oz bottle- Pours very hazy with a medium white head that reduces to a collar and a bit of lace. Aroma is juicy, tropical fruits, has that NE style IPA aroma, pine resin mingling in with all the tropical notes. Taste is similar, juicy tropical fruitiness, mango, papaya, grapefruit, all mixed with pine resin and medium light level bitterness that somehow clings and lingers long after the swallow. Blown away by this beer, wonderful brew."
"Tried the Todd the Axe man on tap at Surely and it was top of the line for smell, look and taste."
"Bright, citrus, crisp. Damn if this beer doesn't hit everything I look for in an IPA. For my tastes, the new-breed hazy IPAs are too tropical/pungent and the old school west coast style lacks citrus to balance the bitterness. This beer doesn't just fall between those bookends, but it stands above most beers in either camp. "
One of the best IPAs that I've ever tasted. Nice light straw color with a beautiful aftertaste. Slightly piny and earthy. You cant really tell by the aroma just how good this beer is. Love it!!!
Cloudy dark amber appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a very pleasant citrus with some hint of hops. Taste is also a very pleasant citrus with slight hint of hops.
Every Minnesotan and their mum may say that Surly Furious is their beer of choice - and it is by all measures a very well-made IPA; but Todd Haugen's namesake beer is at least one step above it. 
Picked up a 16 oz can from TW Arrowhead 3-12-17 for $5.49. Canned on 2-9-17 and stored in the beer fridge since purchase.
Glad to see that others have found this unfiltered now! Floaties are present and it threw me off with the picture on the Surly website.
"Was 3 months old, I'm sure it's much better fresh."
2 month old can poured into a snifter 
Can poured into a Russian River Brewing Co nonic pint glass
"Look: Orange, some what hazy, with 1 inch head that recedes quickly. Medium low carbonation."
Cloudy orange with decent initial head that disappears entirely in time.
Thanks to umichfan for this beer. Poured from the can. 
"Wow!!! Light, refreshing as hell, way way great taste. I will buy this every time I see it. Hard beer to find for me in Florida and I bought on the Surly name and was sooo glad I did."
"16oz can. 2/9/17 can date. Appearance: Deep golden, hazy, with a moderate white foam cap. Aroma: Grassy with strong tropical fruit (passionfruit, mango), some citrus peel, and a touch of bready malt. Taste: Light bready maltiness with an intense tropical fruit of mango and pineapple hop character that slowly builds to an intense resinous bitterness. Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied with a low to moderate carbonation. Finish: Very dry. Lingering resinous bitterness with some mango and pineapple fruitiness Overall: A really good IPA, with a fairly heavy body and a distinct tropical fruit aroma and flavor of mango and pineapple that dominates the profile. Completely different than the typical pine resin and citrus IPA hop character"
Pours a hazy golden peach color with fluffy head.
"Thanks to greenkrusty for swiping one of these from leftpaw/nachos. Another one of those Mosaic and Citra beers. All the rage, for good reason."
First beer from Surly!
Wow
My beer was going on 2 months old. It was already starting to malt forward.
"Pours a fiery orange with a solid level of haziness in such a way that when held up to the light, it looks like a Dragon Ball. Head foams up to a finger in height and white in color. Lacing nearly non-existent. Aroma is dripping with hops. Tropical fruit, papaya, pineapple, with a good resin stick in the back. Biscuit and sweet malts help substantiate the aroma. Flavor profile is less tropical fruit then the aroma, but still features papaya, with a hint of tropical fruit beyond that. Biscuit, sweet, and bready malts give the flavor profile a hearty drinking consistency. Finish is resin, with a glimpse of pine hops. Mouth feel is medium in thickness, with a smooth feel. It has a little bit of a watery feel around the edges. Overall, a flavorful IPA that throws out quite a lot of hop notes in a balanced, and non-bitter way. "
Can poured into a teku glass
"Pours light hazy, copper. Thick, medium, white head. Lasts a bit."
Thank you Wasatch for this
Revisit: 7 Nov 17
Presentation: 16 oz can canned on 02/09/17 poured into a pint glass.
poured 16 oz. can into a tulip hazy apricot
"Great citrus and floral nose. Pours coppery haze with substantial head and lacing. Hop nose is decidely tropical. The taste is world-class IPA. Not too murky, not too bittter, hop flavors are showcased with clean, supporting malt not getting in the way. Very drinkable American IPA - as good as the style gets. Not too over the top, with a juicy hop profile that's second to none."
"When this first came out, it was phenomenal. Now, I fear their quality is declining since Todd Haug left for 3 Floyds."
poured from a 16 oz can.
"Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City spiegelau IPA glass."
Nice citrus finish
"Killer nose on this one, not that sort of generic, yeast ester high fruitiness that so many NE-style IPAs offer, no, this is hop-driven tropical fruit, highlighting the best parts of Citra and Mosaic, lightly pungent too for depth. Palate ably balances soft tropical notes, a touch of malt sweetness, and a very carefully balanced bitterness, really approachable stuff. This is a fine, fine DIPA that I'd be happy to drink again."
"Deep orange color with rich foam and sticky lacing. Smells of citrus, malt, hops, and some floral/sweetness. The taste is great, bursting with hoppy goodness and a mix of citrus, floral, and maltiness. You get the dryness of the grapefruit also on the finish which is medium. Overall this was a very impressive beer."
"16oz can into snifter. Murky dark orange body with a fine ring of lacing and a small head that dissipates quickly. Not hazy like the current craze, more just...murky. Not the prettiest beer but that seems to be of little import for hoppy brews these days."
"Poured from a can, dark golden and a little hazy. As soon as I popped the top I was slapped with hops! One of the hoppiest beers I've ever smelled. Was disappointed with the taste, very watered down with hardly a hop to have. (Canned a month ago)"
"Drank this out of a English pub pint. Its a hazy yellow with soft white foam. The citrus hop smell is so intense I could smell it during pouring, a lot of hops went into this beer. The taste is intensely hopped, with a juicy citrus flavor. The body was somewhat full to back the high hop addition with lots of sweetness. I could drink this beer all night."
This was the first beer I had after landing in MN. Pours a perfect orange and the aroma is very appealing. It is very citrusy and a great IPA that can be had all day. Loved it!
A: deep golden orange to amber. Thin white bubbles
"Apricot color, hazy, with a medium sized head and nice lacing. Aromas are sweet pungent hop. Notes of whole juiced grapefruit, dank pine, melon and stone fruit. Medium, clean, crushable and lightly dry. Just an amazing straight forward IPA."
"Spectacular beer! Very effervescent and slightly hazy golden color with a head that foamed up, then relaxed to a fizzy, thin layer. Smells apricot sweet up front, maybe leaning towards a melon side that wraps up with just some hints of pine. Taste follows the nose for the most part, but pine kicks in a bit faster, but otherwise very much like the nose. Bitter yet sweet with apricot melon pine in a solidly medium bodied beer that leaves behind a hint of sweetness."
Currently #108 on the Top 250 beers list.
"The beer pours golden and cloudy with a good head and lacing. The beer smells very hoppy. The beer tastes like orange juice, as well as very fruity and hoppy. The beer feels smooth and lingers. Overall, I like this beer but abrasive is better."
"Taste: Bold,dank, citrus hops, Grapefruit, crisp, bitter bite. Nose is grassy, grapefruit complex hop nose. Honey colored, unfiltered, small head. Medium/Full body. Funky."
"Poured from bottle to tulip. Orange in color, hazy with sediment that suspends itself in an interesting swirl pattern. Whatever foam that is generated from the pour dies quickly. No lace, nothing. Aroma is fantastic, and bursts forth from the minute the can is popped. Grapefruit rind, pineapple, berries, herbal notes. Taste follows, with the lemon rind, orange, tropical notes first, then berry/floral/cracker as it rolls over the tongue. Semi-dry finish, and a lot less bitter than I expected. Would have again and again."
"My favorite Surly beer, dials up the fruiter hop flavors while still cruising on a nice malt backbone."
Can dates 12/20/16. Citrus and faint caramel malt on the nose. Pleasant citrus hops up front with a subtle malt backbone and moderate bitterness on the finish.
16oz can poured into a tulip glass
"Canned 07-06-16. Drank 08-09-16. Really liked this. Not much gas, but tasty as heck."
"Not sure if I had an old one or not, but out of the can it was orange with an unfiltered look not indicative of a West Coast IPA, so not sure where they got that one from. Reminded me a lot of OTWOA by DC Brau."
"Hazy gold. Head dies instantly. Smells awesome, like tropical fruit. Tastes awesomely tropical as well. Low bitterness. Low carbonation, and slight slickness keep it from being world class, buy I still dig it."
"Got in a trade with The-Adjunct-Hippie. 16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 11/16/2016. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden amber/light orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, berry, light pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, berry, light pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine, citrus peel, herbal, spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/sticky/resinous, and grainy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 7.2%. Overall this is an amazing IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink for the ABV. Insanely bright, juicy, and dank on hops across the board. A really amazing offering all around."
Had a can at St. Paul Grille.
"From a 16oz can, dated 11/29/16. Served in a nonic."
"Poured into a cocktail glass (hotel beer). A moderately hazy golden-amber color with a modest white head. Below-average retention with not much lacing. Huge aromas of orange, grapefruit, blueberries, and a touch of resin. The taste was citrus out of the gate - primarily grapefruit - with a nice mix of resiny dankness and berries. A restrained malt presence that added great body but no sweetness. Outstanding."
"Look - honey hue, fairly translucent, thin fluffy white head"
"The Surly beer most like a Tree House brew...orange, citrusy, rock candy flavor is just a bit much but helps balance the aggressive hop profile. Delicious. My go-to beer when I'm in Minnesota."
"Pours a murky, nearly opaque, amber color with a modest cap of coarse, white froth. Hop aroma evokes pineapple and tangerines along with biscuity, crackery malt and a dollop of honey and alcohol."
"Pours a slightly hazed orange color with a small, soon vanishing white head."
"Poured from a one pint can. The beer pours a dark amber with a small head that quickly disappeared. The smell is huge citrus hops that knock you back. The smell hits from several feet away with grapefruit and orange. The taste follows the smell with great citrus hoppiness. A nice smooth, full mouthfeel compliments the beer. Overall this beer is outstanding and I'd go out of my way to get it."
On tap. Excellent IPA. Tons of fruity hops in the nose and taste. Pine and dank hops too. Decent malt balance. Abv very well hidden. Overall one to seek out
Obtained from HyVee craft beer growler fill
"Tried this some months back, in a can that the owner admitted was several months old and wasn't very fresh. However, relatives from Minneapolis brought out a fresh can for me, and the difference was night and day. "
"While this was a decent beer, I didn't get the same out of it, others seem to have gotten. Then again, both cans I've ever had were just over a month old and seemed malty."
16 oz can packaged 8/26/16.
Review from BeerAdvocate magazine issue #112 (MAY 2016)
"Pour at local option in Chicago. Hazy golden color but not murky or turbid, citrus aroma pop from the glass. The citra flavor is magical, really reminded me of Kern Citra or something from HF. Bright and balanced I could drink this all day...."
L: Pours a hazy dark orange color with a medium creamy head that slowly dissipates.
Received a four-pack in NBS BIF #4 from @Josholson666 – thanks man!
"Let me start off by saying this beer is a banger. Took me completely by surprise. Dark orange, some particulate/haze. Aroma is Mosaic hops, piney, berries, slamming. Flavor is more Mosaic hops, no wonder I liked it so much. It is a little pricey so I would probably not buy this if it were distributed here but damn it is a fine IPA."
"Fantastic beer fresh, although definitely super expensive for an IPA. Paid $16.99 for a 4 pack. Nose and taste is nothing but hop bomb. Pungent mosaic and citra goodness. Be warned however that this beer falls off fast. Significant flavor changes by week 6. I'm a freshness fanatic, and consider 6 weeks to be ""old"", but most beers still retain their goodness, just less of it, at 6 weeks. This beer actually changes, as the malt seems to morph and the hops pull back. Great beer, but drink quickly."
Not sure why this isn't higher on the list. Best pale ale I've ever had
"It's pretty fucking dank, but that 99 rating is a little off. Clearly, the modern ipa has progressed quickly, but this is still a very solid brew. Would drink again. Clean hop profile that doesn't move to heavily into any specific hop character, more of a solid blend."
Off white head with mixed bubbles.. good carbonation. Golden light honey color.. super hazy with some floaties
"Poured from a tallboy into a shaker pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, caramel-copper coloring, with a flurry of carbonation bubbling through the body, feeding a foamy, clingy, light, off-white head. Aromas of wet hops characteristics like sticky pine pitch, pepper spice, and moss, with a tangy caramel backbone, and solid citrus notes of grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Heavy, robust aromas coming off of this one. Flavors are dank and sticky forward, a blast of wet, green characteristics like pine needles, moss, and wet grass. Solid richly sweet backbone, with highlights of grapefruit tartness, orange rind sweet, and lemon zest. This has a ton of flavor, dynamic and balanced throughout on a rich, slick, oily body. The aftertaste is more of the sticky and resinous hops characteristics, with the citrus blend sliding into a supporting role. The finish is slick, bitter, and dry, with a lingering resinous character. Great beer."
"Look: light golden in color, clear"
"Appearance: unappealing dark copper with a chill haze, almost no head."
Served in a snifter glass from the can. 
"Was super excited to try this, finally got my hands on it!"
Appearance: translucent bright peach color with no sediment. 
Has a nice and hazy yellow-orange appearance with good carbonation as well. 
this beer since hazy Amber gold in the glass. It hosts befool 2 inches of light beige head with a standard pour. The flavor is very unique even for an IPA. That is really saying something in today's world where everything starts to blend together. You get both juicy mango and Mandren orange in the flavor. This is a super IPA it's well worth the score.
"Gold rust color with fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Grapefruit and mango nose, grapefruit start to finish on the palate, with an oily hop afterburn. Moderate mouth feel and well carbonated."
"Had at mr brews tap house on state street. Sweet citrus taste to start, doesn't finish too dry. Comes in a goblet"
"Pours a cloudy amber colour. Smells like grapefruit, hops, sweet malts, a bit boozy, but balanced. Tastes like sweet malts, grapefruit, grapefruit rind, pithy, and a bit alcoholic. Very balanced and drinkable for such a big beer."
World class IPA.
A fantastic juicy IPA. Canned a little over a month ago but still very fresh. I could tell the moment I poured it in my glass that it was going to be great as I smelled the hops right away. Citrus was the dominant flavor. The way this beer tasted is what I look for in every IPA I drink but few are able to be up to this standard.
"Other than a head that didn't stick around and a lot of haze (not New England milkshake-y haze but more than simply chill haze), this is a damn near perfect IPA. A lovely nose. The taste is juicy, citrus-y, some piney bitterness to keep it real, this beer has it all. Had it fresh recently at the brewery and the can in my hand is just as wonderful 8 weeks after it's canning date."
Pours a hazy opaque orange with almost no head. Steams of tiny bubbles course upwards in the beer - the only sign of any carbonation. Without that it would look completely flat. 
canned 6/9/16 enjoyed 7/1/16
"This one is serious folks. Huge citrus and pine on the nose. Slightly dank and very bitter on the finish you can taste the hops and citrus for 10 minutes after the swallow. This is Minnesota's Pliny. It's that good. Loved Surly before, now I'm smitten. Well done."
Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned June 15th 2016.
"Damn, I wish this thing had a frickin' head! It disappeared way too quickly. After less than five minutes there was not even a ring!!! The mouthfeel suffered tremendously. I think I'm being too generous here..."
"Pour: On draft at Smoke and Barrel in D.C. Poured into a tulip glass. Appearance: Light gold to orange in color. White head present on the pour but reduces to virtually nil after settling. Lacing present on the sides of the glass. Some lazy bubbles rising to the top. Hazy look to it. Aroma: Dank and juicy hop profile...citrus and grapefruit. Huge nose that doesn't half step. Taste: Follows the nose. huge dank and juicy on the palette. Citrus all the way. Also reveals notes of grass and pine. Aftertaste: Finishes juicy and somewhat chewy. Lots of citrus, earth and pine on the back end. Very consistent throughout. Notes: Love Surly. Big, bold and strong in all aspects of the brew. Result/ Rating: Excellent/ 4.97"
"When it comes to Surly and IPA, there's no shortcuts allowed. Greatness will be achieved. And it all comes down to Todd, you know- the axe man to see it through. Beatings will continue until morale improves!"
"Can dated 05/12/16. Oh what a beautiful nose! I can only imagine how great it must be hyper fresh. Surly crushed this brew in my opinion, solid as always."
"L - Dark, hazy, glowing orange with two fingers of white head"
Enjoyed on draft at the Cambridge in Philly. Maltier and more hop assertive than expected.
"Had this on tap before a huge show our band played. I usually don't retroactive or back-date reviews, but this still deserves a vote. "
"A thanks to a world class and frequent trader, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a cloudy, orange color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of citrus, malts are present, light pine. Taste is citrus, pine, strong malt backbone, to easy drinking at this abv. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall yet another fine beer from this brewery."
"Look: Really nice golden, leaning toward amber, color. Decent head retention."
Consumed 6/15/16 can
2016-06-10
My style of IPA. Tastes to me like TH Alter Ego Light
Nice and pale gold color that is clear. Nice dry hop pine aroma and taste. Good juicy mango and orange note in the taste. Heavy body but feels a bit thin and smooth. Tingling carbonation makes nice texture. Pretty good.
This beer is so great you got to have another one because you can take it down so easily. This is a single IPA on steroids w/ a great citrus taste and absolutely no bitter aftertaste. That IPA taste flows throughout the whole drink and doesn't leave you hanging with anything unexpected.
"Opaque deep yellow pour at the beer hall. Nose is amazing, full of pineapple, flowers. Flavors follow through with sweet fruits, mango, balanced bitterness. Above medium body and average carbonation."
A - Pours a hazy golden orange with a two finger fizzy white head. Nice amount of light lacing.
32oz Crowler from Morans
"16 oz can. Poured golden, slightly hazy, some sediment and a nice white head and very decent lacing. Aroma of hops and citrus fruit. Taste is nice and bitter, but extremely well balanced. Great IPA, extremely enjoyable."
L: dark yellow/golden white a big head
"Canned 4/12 and consumed 5/20. Amber orange in color with thin white head. Nice lacing. Smell is melon, tropical fruits and some basement style dankness. Taste is underwhelming. Sweet malts, no hop bitterness and flavors of tangerine, melon and ? Gym socks. Nice mouthfeel and abv is well hidden. Abrasive and the many west coast and NE style IPAs are much better"
"Sunset orange with a bubbly white head. After it warms, it looks like relaxed apple cider with sandy, minuscule particles clinging to the sides of glass."
"This beer is amazing! IPAs aren't for everyone, but I love this!"
16oz can poured into a snifter. Canned on date is 04/14/16. 
Mixed review as the current can I'm drinking - 4/14 is a tad off from the 3/31 batch and the one I had last year. The 3/31 was amazing 5.0. The 4/14 is still good but doesn't have the same juicy goodness and pow. A bit malty maybe..still smooth a good just not top notch.
"APPEARANCE: A hazy, burnt orange. A finger of foamy head that settles fairly quickly to a ring. Very small bubbles rising, nice carbonation effect when rocking the glass. Very minor lacing down the glass."
"Can: Poured a clear bright blonde color ale with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrusy and tropical fruit notes with light residual sugar notes is quite awesome. Taste is a nice mix of citrusy and tropical fruit notes with juicy notes, floral undertones, limited bitterness and some residual sugar notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Super solid IPA that I wish was regularly available around here."
"Burst of fruits such as Grapefruit , Passionfruit, Dragonfruit, relaxed with a piney citrus orange peel finish, the smell is amazing and the taste is even better, Surly knows how to brew a World Class Beer for sure , I put this in the same cooler as Pliney and Heady, this one is going to be extremely tough to beat!!!! 100"
10.5 draft pour . 
One of the juicier IPAs I can recall. The nose is super tangerine and fruit-filled. Taste is juicy and fruity with a lil bitterness on the tongue at the back end. Surly is a Hop King
"L: Pours a quite murky bright glowing gold with tinges of orange and a mild quickly dissipating head. Tiny specks of yeast sediment held in suspension, with no head retention or lacing to speak of. This beer’s got a very pretty hue, but really could have used more carbonation and foam in the pour."
"99, really, only a 99? This beer is amazing and I rate it up there with Heady and Pliny. Simply amazing. You're hit with an incredible hoppy-citrus aroma as you pour it from the can. The nose is simply intoxicating, The nose carried into the taste. Amber hop hazy color. Hoppy, citrusy, and great balance of malt that make your taste buts dance. The flavors make the mouth feel silky. I haven't been wowed by a beer since my first Heady Topper, but this has just done that. This is a must try."
"WOWOW. This is one hell of an IPA. Really, all that needs to be said is to try this beer if you get the chance."
This beer is awesome. That's all I have to say. It's worth the 17-20 bucks for the 4 pack.
"Thanks to RussianDragon for the share. I very excite! Dark orange body. Big citrus flavor support by a sturdy malt backbone. Definitely what I would describe as balanced, although certainly trending toward hops. Juicy, resinous, delicious."
"A: Golden and hazy. Can see suspended particles, bottom of glass had layer of leftover malt. I don’t know why, but I really like the look of unfiltered beers. Light head that dissipated quickly. "
"Had this on 2016-05-04 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz can. And on 2017-01-23 in Warrenville, IL from a 16oz can dated 2016-12-28 and in Warrenville, IL on 2017-09-20 from a can dated 2017-08-02. "
"Aroma - strong cat pee immediately after the pour. This disappears after a few sips, thankfully. What's left behind is lemon peel, pine, pineapple skin, caramel malt, cracker malt, light onion and mild mango."
"Copper penny colored with a fairly amount of haziness. There's a fingernail of off white resting on top. Massive citrus hop aroma. The flavor is intensely bitter citrus hop flavor with lots of light malt to help things from getting out of hand. There's a nice deep hop burn on the tongue and the body is resinous and a bit thick for an IPA, but I suspect it is due to not being filtered."
"One of the best beers I have had. Very well balanced, full of aroma, taste of citrus. If you like IPA's you will love this one."
Todd the Ax Man is awesome. It poured a Hazy golden with white head that left a nice lace. The scent had orange peel and pine. The taste is on par with the original Z'Dust and very easy to drink. The Mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is outstanding and I will be on the look out for this one.
"Received in a trade as an extra. Thanks Tony! Poured in tulip glass. Deep orange. Aroma smacks you in the face with tropical and citrus notes. Taste is incredible hoppy, balanced with a little bite. Medium mouthful and carbonation. This lived up to the hype"
Just fantastic. It has such a great balanced flavor profile while still giving you a healthy dose of hop goodness. Absolutely must try. It is one of the better ipa's I've had.
16oz Can
"I've had this beer super fresh, and I've had it a month old, and it's never impressed me. A nice beer for sure, but I don't get the hype and there are many, many better hoppy beers..."
Pour is a somewhat hazy darker orange. Very foamy head with excellent lacing.
16 oz can was poured into a pint glass. 
"The artwork of this beer is pretty damn cool, this might be one you see on the shelf and pass over but it's worth the buy if you are looking to try something new..fresh tasting and good hop aroma as well as a hoppy taste"
"A little hazy, but not overly bitter IPA Hop juice. Drank out of the can in St. Cloud MN. So good.."
Solid IPA! Dank smelling with some tropical fruit notes and citrus.
"Aroma is citrus, dank hops and mild fruit. The flavor is citrus, grapefruit, fruit, a hint of spring water, malts and a long and very bitter/dryish finish."
Smell is off the hook
"Appearance- golden orange, crystal clear minimal head with nice lacing. "
L: Poured into a tulip glass. Hazy orange with thin white head.
"Pours a densely hazy medium amber copper color, nice frothy lacing that sticks all over the glass. Aroma is rich with notes of smooth citrus, light melon sweetness, some pepper earthiness, nice and complex. Beer goes down smooth and clean, good level of finishing bitterness but not overwhelming. Some fruity bitterness up front. A killer IPA. Quite enjoyable"
"This is a very awesome IPA, excellent aroma and taste even better than it smells. Very fruity on the tongue and in the nose, a lil heavier than most IPAs but a welcome change. The price point is a little steep but very worth it."
L- Amber color. Thin head. Bubbles floating to the top for a short time after the pour. 
04/08/2016
"This may be best the best IPA I have ever had. Smooth, fruity and not too bitter. The perfect mix. It tastes like a less abv Abrasive but dare I say that it's better? I think so. Only pipeworks can match the craft of Surly's ales in the midwest. Both tend to brew smooth, balanced and flavorful ales. Not massive and big. If that's what you're looking for seek this beer out."
"Canned on 2/15/16, consumed on 4/7/16, so nearly two months old, but plenty potent."
"Pours hazy dark golden, with small head. Strong smell of citrus hops, very rich. Taste also rich with hops, quite bitter, strong and lingering. Feels a little thin, maybe not as carbonated as some) but so intense it doesn't matter. Really great IPA."
"The nose starts out so bright and shiny, fresh but not raw. An amazing complement of fruits comes on strong- pineapple, mango, papaya, berries (straw and rasp ;)), tangerine- although the impression is mostly tropical. It is balanced by a touch more than a suggestion of that dank/weedy/sweaty quality; just enough to keep things from going off of the fruity rails. The malty sweetness augments the aromas to give it a rich, juicy feeling. "
"16oz can courtesy of the largesse of @Ri0. My first beer from Surly, this was canned on March 1st, 2016, per the stamp on the bottom of the can. At first I somehow got the idea this was an Imperial Red Ale, but the can does say IPA, on it. Not sure how I initially misread it, but glad @Ri0 reminded me of it’s need to be drunk soon."
"Fantastic beer. Amazing citrus blast that is juicy and incredibly pleasant on the nose, taste and finish. My go-to when it is available. Absolutely love this beer! Citra/Mosaic combo is done so incredibly well. doesn't get better than this when it comes to Citrus American IPA's. I would go through each characteristic of this beer, but there isn't a need. It is on point in everything you hear/is said about it. A must have if you can get it. Beats furious by a long shot."
Poured from a 16 oz. can into a Belgian tulip. Canned on 02/15/16.
"Holy crap is this stuff good. Surly continues to impress with this Citra & Mosaic hop-cocktail. This beer is juicy and poundable as orange Gatorade after a 5K. Nary a hint of the 7.2 ABVs. Only complaint is the price point, and could maybe use a touch more carbonation. Overall, well done Surly. I will welcome in the Axe Man anytime."
Canned on 03/20/2016.
Citrus and dankness in the nose. Heavy scents. Taste is nearly flawless with same citrus / pine combo. Great brew. Nearly flawless. 
"Another A+ beer from Surly. Personally I enjoy it way better out of the can over what I experienced in certain bars. May have been the awful cleaning chemicals in the glass or the rinsing of the glass with water. Anyhow, this beer is the sister (palate-wise) to Abrasive Ale. If I had to put their (D)IPAs in order it would be 1. Abrasive 2. Todd 3. Wet 4. Furious."
"Poured a copper gold color with decent head which quickly dissipated. The aroma was very strong and immediate - grapefruit, citrus and hops. Taste is strongly citrus, but very bitter all the way through the aftertaste. Body is quite full for this type beer. The bitterness makes this beer less desirable than Abrasive, or PseudoSue which are more balanced."
Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter. Bottom of can says Canned On: 03/09/16.
"pours copper with a medium white head. Tropical nose with notes of mango. Really interesting malt base, rich with just a enough of a hint of sweetness to carry the hops. Medium body, reminds me a bit of All Green Everything the way that the malt base pops even in a really hoppy beer."
"A little too bitter for my tastes, but excellent complexity and feel for a pale ale (I greatly prefer stouts). Lots of grapefruit, and notes of lemon, melons, and pine. Damn fine beer. "
Hazy yellow
A: Golden hazy color with a finger or two of white head.
"Pours a clear, bright yellow golden color with white head. Citrus, lots of it, grapefruit, floral notes, resinous tones, and some pine on the nose; follows onto the palate. Full bodied. Finishes with much of the same."
"Beautifuly balanced tropical hop bomb. Pours golden with a good amount of haze. A lot of tropical mosaic goodness in the nose. Taste follows the citrus theme, but this beer also has some dank and grassy undertones. The drinkability is off the charts. Full bodied for the style with moderate carbonation. World class all the way."
Drink it fresh
"2016 Surly release. Pours clear and gold from the can with a solid, frothy head that dissipates after a couple minutes. Smells like hay bales of hops in a sunny citrus grove. Tastes dank and earthy and pithy. Finish is great and aftertaste is unmistakably Surly. A splendid beer that deserves to be sipped and savored FRESH."
Revisited 10/13/18
"Got it fresh, poured into a tulip glass. Nice minimal head, great smell. Had it side by side with a fresh Jai Alai and it was maybe just the tiniest bit ""better"" as in, a little more bitter (in a good hoppy way). just that littlest extra bite. Very good, could drink it regularly."
"L: Golden, some haziness to it with 1 1/2 inch white head."
"Pours a gold colored haze, half-inch foam head. Smells tropical-citrus: mango, pineapple, peach deliciousness all in one. The mouth feel is very well balanced, enough malt to give it a nice full backbone. Tropical is the only word needed to describe the taste, with a nice piney finish. Fantastic IPA, perhaps my favorite in the Midwest."
"The best IPA I've had and I've had most of the big boys. This beer is slightly hazy, deep straw color, citrus tang, full mouth feel, full fruit smell. Loved it."
"Good beer here. Pours a cloudy deep orange. Lots of citrus aroma with some pine. The taste follows the nose, but there is quite a bit of malt sweetness. Some Hawaiian roll taster Nice dry finish."
Pours a cloudy golden color. Aroma is citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is piney and citrus with a hoppy aftertaste. Drinks really well and overall is a really good IPA.
"This is one of the best IPAs in the country right now. If you see it, cough up the money and treat yourself. Todd knocked this one out of the park! I was lucky enough to have it on tap at the Surly MPLS brewery and it was phenomenal."
"Semi hazy orange, finger of head that goes away quickly"
"I had a hard time drinking this, I got lost in the aroma. Huge citrus, mango, pepper and fruit. The taste is aligned with the smell. The finish is spot on. It's a little spendy at 18 bucks a 4 pack but the flavor punch makes up for it. I'll be heading back to the store for this one."
"I've found this a few times in cans and love it.... However the most recent batch dated 05/07/2016 has an extra mosaic hoppy taste IMO. (Not a huge mosaic fan). In this past the beer seemed a bit ""fruitier"" this batch more onion. Still tasty."
Pours hazy orange with a two finger head. Smells of juicy sticky hops and toffee. Taste is a bitter hop bite up front that washes into citrus and peppery notes. Has a nice balance that should work for a hardcore IPA drinker and someone who just likes drinkable beer as well. Really nicely done by Surly.
"L; cloudy, orange, long lasting white head"
"Seriously dank. I managed to grab a 4 pack with less than 2 weeks on it in freshness, so this couldn't be fresher. Big tropical nose and hazy, unfiltered look invites you in. Overripe mango and pineapple sweetness edged with hop bitterness, and both the citra and mosaic hop profiles get to shine here. The feel is full and yet not overly sticky. Top notch."
Look: Copper color in appearance with a nice big head.
"COD 2/1716. Copper/orange pour with a touch of haze and garnet. World class head volume, lacing and retention."
"Great smell, look, mouthfeel, and taste. The only thing it's missing is a finish. But it's still great"
"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Picked these up the day my local shop got them in...the freshness shows. Pours a hazy-ish light amber-orange color, haze clears up some with time. The aroma makes this beer...it's phenomenal. Smells of citrus fruit, some tropical fruit too, and you can smell it all from feet away. My wife commented on the smell from across the room. The taste matches, with grapefruit, passionfruit, citrusy goodness, and it finishes with a dank bitterness that's not overwhelmingly (but definitely there). It's not one that I would call ""balanced"", and that's a good thing. Medium body, well-carbonated, finishes somewhat dry. Overall, my favorite beer from Surly aside from Darkness."
"Tremendous balance, hazy straw color, tropical fruits and hops"
"A light orange brownish color. Aroma is just redunkulous: intense citrus, pine, resin. Taste is similar though there's a touch of sweet toffee and caramel. Feel is amazing. Somehow the texture manages to be both light and sticky. I had high expectations but this beer surpassed them."
What a gem! Surly's best IPA they've ever made.
"Grabbed a four pack, canned mid February, so pretty dang fresh. When I got home, I opened this up immediately so not fridge temperature, but not warm."
"Face melter of IPAs, pairs well with 80's thrash metal, if you don't like it you're to old - Riki Rachtman"
On tap at G Allens.
"Have you ever been in a place where you shouldn't be and you know you shouldn't be, but you realize that it's just such an overwhelmingly nice place to be that you will pretty much go against everything that you believe to trust this new experience like a hammer to the head? Yeah? Then you'll get why this is such a phenomenally built brew - I nearly piss myself when I discover it in my provisioners cooler. But near perfection comes with a price tag - on your wallet and your desire to have it regularly. In the wake of all the new dank lovers out there, this is mecca so start building your alter because you now have a new centerpiece. BrewYa!"
The best IPA to date for me.
"This beer is tits. Big'ol titties in yo face good. I likes! Hazy, 2 finger head, tropical scent, hoppy floral taste and sticky film. This one is good. I'd drink again. Never said that before for a Midwest IPA. Cheers!"
"Pours a deeply cloudy brass-orange with a cap of head. Pine and faint aroma of orange peel. Taste tangerine with a resiny pine tail. Refreshing, almost slick feel. Very enjoyable."
"Had this on tap at the brr fest in Coralville,IA yesterday. The best beer, along with Darkness, at the whole fest. Beautiful, brilliant burnt orange color with a nice white head. The smell and taste was perfect for an APA. The citrus, resin, and funk smell and taste was big for an APA, but all in goodness. The balance achieved by additional malt still allowed the funk to come through which I like. I am so glad I finally got this."
"Had on tap in a tulip glass while at the Surly Beer Hall. What an amazing West Coast Style IPA. Wonderful tropical fruit, especially grapefruit, hits your nose instantly. On the palate it is extremely well balanced with juicy citrus peel, grapefruit and hints of pine resin. It packs a nice bitter punch on the end but nothing overwhelming. The finish is extremely long and smooth. This is one of those IPA's that sets the bar high and keeps you coming back for more time and time again. Full marks for this amazing brew."
"16oz pint served on draught at Monk's Pub in Chicago, poured into a shaker pint glass, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"Only had on draft half a dozen times. A true southern west-coast style fruity hop bomb with big-time bitterness. The most redeeming quality is its quaff-ability - it just doesn't ruin your palette somehow, and stays very in-your-face after many trips to the well."
"This beer became my go-to Surly beer, over Furious. Todd the Axeman rocks."
"The best IPA from Surly that I've had, I love this beer, it was great being able to order it online and have it show up at my door. Drank 2 cases during the course of August and September."
"Can into a Gandhi-Bot tulip. Thanks, Alex!"
Poured into a tulip from a bomber. 
Updated 3/4/16. 
"Dark straw color pour from tap. Much different than the almost red color of furious. Very hop forward... True west coast style IPA. Strong flavors of pine and citrus fruits, very bitter. I feel the bitterness hits early compared to furious hitting later. Very good beer, must try if you have a chance!"
A: Golden blonde color with an orange hue and moderately carbonated
"July 2015 can, opened Nov 2015"
Such a solid IPA!!!
"Three month old can, kept well."
Can dated 8/4/2015:
Great west-coast IPA. Taste that you crave when you want a beer. Its a must try.
Excellent Single IPA.. Probably the best I've ever had.
This is why I trade for beer.
A good IPA.
This one absolutely blew my expectations. Pours out a dark hazy orange color. Smells like passion fruits and some bitterness. Taste is a melange of juicy hops and floral notes with some underlying bready malts. This is absolutely mind-blowing and slightly better than heady topper. Wow. Top 5 ipa
Pint can into my Duvel tulip.
"Pours a murky yellow orange, with a small whit foamy head. Smells of citrus and a slight hint of dank earthiness. Taste is of massive pineapple and grapefruit with a light danky finish. Mouthfeel is sticky but slick and has a slight earthy aftertaste."
Poured into my DFH IPA glass.
Awesome can art. Pours a very murky orange with a moderate white foam head that quickly recedes. Leaves a thin ring of lacing around the edge and a very thin layer at the surface.
Great can logo . Got this can alittle older then i prefer but the flavor was still strong . Great nose and hop smack I always love . Really a great beer
Received via trade. The mosaic hops shine through on the palate. Extremely well balanced IPA. I have nothing bad to say about this.
"Received several cans via trade. Poured into a 16 ounce tulip glass. Color was a deep amber. Nose was aggressive with piny notes. Flavor mimicked that of typical IPAs (hoppy and bitter but finished smooth)... tasted good, but it wasn't anything memorable either. Nevertheless, a solid beer."
"Surly Todd the Axe Man. India Pale Ale. Originally brewed by the Danish brewery Amager in honor of Todd Haug and his musical skill. The bottles that were imported here sold out quickly and were never seen again. It wouldn't be like Omar or Todd to make a beer and name it after themselves. They merely re-created Amager's tribute and kept the self-aggrandizing name. Nothing wrong with that. And now, it's in cans, and now I'm drinking one. ""Beer to shred your face, in a can."" Let's see if my face gets shredded."
"Definitely one of the better IPAs I've ever had. Lots of hop flavors. Just a touch of bitter, then sweet at the end. Would love to try this super fresh."
"Lotta hype in this one. Clean, fruity, well balanced. Certainly does not have the body of the Headys, SoS, S&S, Dinners of the world. And for the price point ($19 a 4pk in the Chicago market) I doubt I'll drink many."
"This one lived up to the hype for me, and even my anti-IPA friend loved it. A solid juicy IPA with a gorgeous color to it. I'd drink this one again and again if I could."
"This beer was just outstanding. I am way late getting on the bandwagon. No matter, as a beer drinker that thinks hoppy beers as an after thought this American IPA acts so un-American in that it is not overly hoppy, not overly citrusy, not overly bitter. Surly’s Todd the Axe Man is an American India pale ale that belongs in its own category. There are the the tropical fruit aromas that emanate from the glass —pineapple, grapefruit, mango - not heavy on citrus or grassy aroma. There is even a suggestion of honey sweet malt. The grain bill of this beer is made of only one malt, which is Golden Promise. This Scottish base malt is not seen much over this way which has been a signature malt used in many of Surly’s brews. The Golden Promise single malt gives the beer a pale-ish yellow orange hue which is slightly different. On the palate bitterness is medium but nicely and slightly understated. It does not overpower the palate going in or the finish. It is playing in accompaniment with honey malt and fruit and slight grassiness singing in harmonious ahhhhh! The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with medium carbonation. and creamy. This beer is remarkable in how it is so drinkable and off-dry going off the beaten path of bitter and bone dry. My palate is talking like a mature cheeze -it."
"Canned on 7/10/15, reviewed on 8/12/15. Poured into a pint glass"
Didn't care for this. Very bitter for my liking
16oz can from IAmJacksHopTongue (thanks!). Canned 7/31/15. Served in a goblet. 
"This beer pours a nice light amber color with a inch off white head. The smell is citrusy, tons of orange and other fruit. Light sweetness and notes of pine and grass. The taste is dominated by the bitter fruity hops, with a nice sweetness and hints of the pine and resin. The Citra and Mosaic are well showcased in this hop bomb. Orange, grapefruit, pineapple and mango are all present. Creamy texture with a good amount of carbonation, very smooth and a good body that lasts and makes you want more. The smell and taste of this pleasant looking beer makes it one of the best american IPAs i've had. The depth and aggressiveness is reminiscent of a DIPA, which is nice with an IPA abv."
"Smell is perfumed. Juicy, melon, peach, mango. Pine bitterness, dry. Some malty sweetness up front, but balanced with the bitterness so it doesn't come off as cloying. This is a Midwestern ipa thru and thru with a west coast undertone. It's good."
"Was lucky enough to almost stumble into a load of this beer fresh from Minnesota. This beer is everything mosiac and citra can be all crammed into one can. Classic, slightly sweet, American IPA with tons of wicked hop flavours. I love it."
"Everything I've had from Surly has been very tasty I was excited to get to try this IPA. This can is fresh, less than a month from canning so the hops are still bright and resinous. The taste like the aroma is surprisingly balanced with a lot of sweet malt to help balance out the bitterness from the hops. I tend to prefer my IPAs this way with a little bit of sweetness on the backend. Overall, Todd the Axe Man was a fantastic brew that I really enjoyed. Cheers!"
I was very impressed by this brew. Didn't know what to expect not knowing much about it
"Got this from @5EKF, thank you!! Great aroma, taste, big mouthfeel. Almost drinks in between an ipa and a double. Fantastic, love this brew!"
"16 oz can. Hazy orange colored body with a small white head. Aromas of candied orange slices, pale malt, bitter hops and pine. Flavor is heavier on the sweet malt than I would like, bitter citrusy hops. Really reminded me of OTWOA. Would have loved to try this hyper fresh, though."
Type: 16-oz. can
"Tropical, juicy, citrus bomb. Light and bright in its look. Sweet and slick in the mouthfeel with a mild amount of bitterness. This is really drinkable and deserves its praise. Another great IPA."
"L (4.25) - Bright orange color. Nice bit of head on top. A little cloudier than it should be, but you'll have that sometimes."
L: Darker orange-brown with a nice head and good retention.
An amazing beer. Deeper orange color than most. Aroma is simply fantastic. Citrus galore. This can has some legs on it so fresh must have been even more incredible.
"Superb in every respect. The color is perfect, smell is wonderful, and the taste is world class. I've only had a couple Surly offerings and they never disappoint."
"Great IPA, taster at Bells Funvitational, Citrus aroma and flavor, little hop bitterness"
"Looks delicious like all beer. Cloudy orange with a disappearing head. Smells like dense tropical fruit. Mango, tangerine, pineapple and a zesty hop bitterness. Really really good. Taste follows the nose except a ton more of the zesty bitterness on the back. Really smooth and well carbonated mouthfeel with a nice alcoholic burn. Very good ipa."
Tasted at Bell's Funvitational...I was looking forward to this beer and it failed to live up to the hype. The taste was just not to my liking. The look was great - Smell and taste were just ok at best.
"Liked the citra hops, but was far too malty for my tastes"
"This one started out with great promise. The nose is phenomenal -- huge citrus notes. Unfortunately, the beer that follows tastes nothing like that. Not bad, but definitely short of the hype."
"Unlike its overhyped brother, Abrasive, this is a truly elite IPA. Very strong on the citrus and has a smooth and thick mouthfeel like an east coast ipa. Stands its own against the true heavy hitters."
"Top 10 IPA. Hazy appearance, pour results in 1 inch head. Nose is citrus pine and dank resin! Super excited for this one. First sip does not disappoint. Absolutely love the hop profile on this one, ultra juicy. This is what Midwest IPA's are all about. Overall a great beer!"
"Really good beer, reminds me of heady in a lot of ways. Looks awesome, tastes even better. I wish we had surly distribution here in Miami. Would make this a regular."
Thanks Kevin for the hookup on this. Pounder can poured into a tulip appears a clear golden copper color with a white head composed of large bubbles that is quick to fade leaving patchy lace.
"Delicious IPA here with loads of tropical fruit and citrus notes - my kind of IPA! Definitely more malt presence than I would have thought, as it comes through with a light biscuity sweetness to round out the flavor and adds significantly to the mouthfeel in a pleasant way."
"Pours a light amber color with creamy head. Aroma is Orange, pineapple, and peach. Also get resin, cedar, pine, and definitely some sweetness. Maybe some papaya or passion fruit. Taste is pine, resin, grassy hops and biscuity caramel malt. Fruit flavors follow the nose, but taste is not as fruity as the aroma. Getting some grapefruit on the finish. The mosaic hops add a nice bite to balance the malty sweetness. Light to medium mouth feel. Lightly carbed too, but the bitter hops keep it moving across the palate. It's a malty IPA with bright and bitter hop presence and great fruit profile."
"Damn you, Surly!! Canned IPA. Never thought it would be any good but this is the best IPA I have found. Price comparable to bottled craft of the same caliber. Yum"
"A slightly hazy orange/gold color. Nice white head. Some lace, but not much."
Best dbl ipa tasted
"16 ounce can into a snifter, canned 8/6/15."
"Todd The Axe Man has a thin-to-medium slightly off-white head, a murky, gold-orange appearance, and minimal lacing. The aroma is strong, and one can pick up the smell from a distance- citrus, white bread, and piney hop resin. Taste is of pronounced, but in no way harsh, bitterness, white bread, some bread crust, and citrus. Mouthfeel is high or heavy medium, and Todd The Axe Man finishes dry, puckering, and drinkable (to me). "
"I knew this had a chance because it wasn't clear---nice hazy orange/peach color.... Smell was definitely encouraging with hoppy citrus notes,.... Flavor was similar with citrus and grassy hops... not much in the pine-y or tropical fruit department,... However, I have the same gripe I have with every hoppy beer I've had west of New England---too much malt, yuck.... But then again, I used to love brown ales now I can't drink them---tastes change!! Still, well-made and one of the best I've had outside of the trio (TH/HF/Tr)"
"Nose is absolutely amazing. Mango, melon, orange, stone fruit, citrus. Absolutely juicy. The taste does not dissapoint. Light, but somewhat sweet, malts hit for just an instant before the taste of tropical fruits and strong citrus hit and blend all together. A wave of Orange and slight lemon hit about 70 percent through the mouth, before a firm hop oil grapefruit finish hits you. The balance here is amazing, definitely in my top 3 ipas to date. Well done."
Poured from the 16oz can to a sip of sunshine tulip glass. Canned on 8/04/15. 
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass. Acquired in a trade. Canned 7/29.
Poured from a can at Northdown Cafe and Taproom in Chicago. Was really hoping to find this one while in Chicago and it did not disappoint. Citra and Mosaic are incredible together and Surly does a great job with them in this brew.
"Really bought this on impulse without knowing it was a Surly. Twenty bucks was burning a hole in my pocket. For me this is a cross between Abrasive and Furious. Thoroughly enjoyed this offering. My rating does not reflect price, but I would not purchase this again if the price remains. Wonderful to try! Hey Surly, where's the Abrasive!!!"
My new favorite IPA. Well balanced.
"A: Moderate murk in this orange-bronze beer, sprite bubbles rise through the suspended sediment. I hate sediment. Head doesn't last, I wonder how intense this is really going to be if it can't maintain a billow. I also wish the description was more offense, a la Arrogant Bastard. If they are going to threaten to shred my face and use all the cliche aggressive adjectives, I feel like they should put an outright ""Fuck You"" somewhere in there too. Get some balls."
Pours a slightly hazy amber with thin off-white head. Head retention in outer ring. Nose is a balance between bright citrus and pine notes and deep earthy hops. It's wonderful. Taste is a bit more muted but follows the nose and finishes with the beautiful earthy hop flavor. Body is light to medium with a bit of bitterness on the back end. As this beer warmed a couple of degrees it opened up into a very well balanced IPA...a great representation of the style.
"Pours a nice orange with good carbonation and a pretty decent white head. The smell is incredible, I popped the top of the can and it hit me like a ton of bricks, and I have a pretty terrible nose. As I poured it out the smell just filled the room. Taste was dry and bitter with some nice tropical notes to it. Overall this is a damn good brew that I would drink a ton of if available near me."
"On tap at Surly Brewing Company. Huge, bitter citrus and grapefruit notes and extremely well balanced. My favorite IPA from Surly - worth seeking out."
Poured into a snifter. Nice orangeish hue and white head. Smell is delicious citrus and some tropical fruit. The taste had a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness. Drinks very easy for >7%. Grapefruit and slight piney bitterness. A very nice IPA indeed.
A: Pours a chill-hazed dark golden color with a sticky one finger cream colored head. Leaves some nice tracks of lace down the glass with each sip. 
Appearance - The beer was a straw yellowish copper color. 
"Pours a hazy caramel color. Almost exactly medium on the IPA spectrum. Smells like fresh pine, with alot of fruit scent and sweet malt. Taste is incredible. Doesn't quite live up to the hype (but very few do). Light hoppiness blends in with a strong grapefruit taste. I've never tasted such a strongly fruity beer that still holds a hop profile so well. Mouthfeel is almost like a smoothy, so fruity and so smooth but still exceptionally thick; it almost has pulp.. Overall, one of the best fruity IPAs I've ever had"
"Pours from the can an opaque orange with a bit of a white head. Huge aroma of citrus and resin. The taste begins with a really nice orange and sweet malt, then the grapefruit rips the skin off your tongue. Wow! The grapefruit is so bitter. Medium mouth with a fair amount of carbonation. This is what Grapefruit Sculpin and Electric Peel wish they were."
"A: Beautiful golden orange color, one-finger thick head that settled quickly down to a ring around the edge of the glass. Bubbles are visible rising to the top of the glass."
This should be another fun one. I like the talk of some Citra action. Let's take a look-see. 16 oz. can into a tulip.
"Cloudy orange gold color with a nice head that stayed for a bit. The smell is grapefruit peel, floral scents, pine and some definite onion on the end. The taste is amazing with citrus and malt followed by floral in the nasal cavity. The onion is hard to taste but easier to smell. Super complex well brewed beer that is up there with the best in the world."
Was really looking forward to this one. I had it on tap and in cans - I think it tasted better out of the can.
Received a can of this in a trade recently. Can is dated 8/6/15
"This is the most balanced IPA I've ever had the opportunity to enjoy. The nose is heavy mango and tropical fruits. The hops are amazingly balanced with malt, but with enough that it maintains a nice bitterness at the end. Worth seeking out."
From a 16 oz. can:
From a 16oz can:
"Loads of citrus and pine on the nose, hints of pineapple and mangoes. Flavour is much the same, loads of fruity citrus and a solid caramel malt backbone. Perfectly balanced, insanely sessionable and loads of flavour. Certainly a top notch example of the style."
On tap at Tribes Ale House in Tinley Park Illinois. Served in a can glass. 
"Pint-sized can - canned on 7/11/15 (stamped on bottom) - Poured into a tulip glass, as suggested:"
"Can, bout 2 weeks old when I first tried it. 16 oz can. yellow. Big bitter hop aroma. Some tropical fruit under, pineapple, mango.. Fresh bitter hops. Juicy and sort of a pallet wrecker. Definitely high bitterness for the style. Damn good stuff. this is bigger and more flavorful than most IPAs. Bordering on a double. However, this is currently the 25th best beer in the world. Don't think it's that good. In fact I passed on grabbing another $17 4 pack yesterday. Little expensive for a single."
"I enjoyed the near-perfect balance between hops & malt. Perfect amount of bitterness for me. Citra and Mosaic hops with Golden Promise malt, per the can. Delicious! I tasted a nice, apricot/pineapple/danky hops flavor with a strong malt backbone. This is as close to a perfect IPA as you'll find. Kudos to Surly! This stood out in a tasting session versus Heady and SoS."
"Good IPA, Solid. Pretty fresh can after trade. Besides liking it more then SOS I have to say I still like 90% of the big time NE single ipas better: Substance, Julius, Focal, Susan. I wish I could have it on draft. It has that nice light color, taste is hoppy and fruity, a little bit of a bitter after taste not as smooth or citrus after taste as some. Glad to have a 4 pack"
"Poured into a Pipeworks NvU 12 oz snifter. Settles into a hazy orange with minimal head after a very bright almost shiny orange with nice foam on the pour. Reminds me of a double IPA in its strengths - strong citrus and pine notes on both the nose and taste that balance nicely with the high hoppiness. The great thing is it has very few of a double IPAs faults-it's not a malt bomb, and it has only slight bitterness on the aftertaste of a semi-whole mouth filling feel. I'm bummed I only got to get one of these, but I'm damn glad I got to try it."
"So I had heard rave reviews about this beer and decided to do something that i'd promise myself not to do again: trade for. Luckily, the person I traded with is among the best traders out there (literally, what a great guy!). "
16 oz can poured into nonic pint dated 7/23
Poured from a glorious pounder can into a Teku glass.
"Sugar, sap, pine, strong resin, rich mango, citrus, light caramel and fresh grain in the scent. Flavors of resin, pine, citrus, sugar, tropical fruit and light grain."
"Hazy, orange-ish in color. A small white head that dissipates quickly. Monster, delightful nose. A lot of hop presence: grapefruit, citrus, spice, a little sweet. Taste follows suit. Same flavors with a nice touch of earthiness and lingering bitterness. Nicely balanced. Medium body with medium-high carbonation. A very nice IPA."
Awesome IPA. Hop character is spicy citrus and floral. Great aroma. This beer is expensive but worth the cost.
Look: Golden apricot color with just a bit of cloud
"Maybe one of Surly's best beers, Todd the Axe Man parallels Permanent Funeral being a collaboration with a metal band. However, Todd is not as palatable as Permanent Funeral due to its tremendous hoppiness that I enjoy trying but not a super fan of."
16 oz can - 4 weeks old - in a pint glass
Amazing beer! Drank at 2 weeks old according to the canning date.
A: Golden yellow with some haze
Pours an amber color with nice head and lacing. Superb aromas of the citra and mosaic hops. Taste follows the aromas but slightly less. Very well balanced and I want more. Thanks Devman171
"To be far, I am very spoiled by having relatively easy access to Trillium, Treehouse, and the VT IPAs. This is rock solid, but is not in the same class as the aforementioned. Outside of TG, though, there is not much better IPA-wise available in MN."
"Pours a hazy unfiltered amber gold with a 1 finger head. When I put my nose to the glass, it was like a forest of hops exploded in my face. Simply amazing. When i finally get my nose out of the glass and taste, it is a bouquet of citrus (orange, Lemon, grapefruit) mixed with resin and pine. Surly really outdid themselves with this brew. Loved it and hope that i can get more!"
Pours a hazy golden amber orange with a solid white finger of foam. Little lacing.
Update: 08/16/2017
"I remember having this at the brewery this last summer, and being surprised by the fact that I did not enjoy it that much considering that it is one of Minnesota's highest rated beers. As such, I've been meaning to have the Axe Man again for quite some time, just to see whether my opinion of it would increase if I had it during different circumstances. "
7/31/15 canning date. 16 oz. can.
16oz can. 7/16/15 canning date.
I could smell this one immediately after opening. One of the best if not THE best noses / aromas on an IPA that I've ever had. I feel the malt is subdued which is PERFECT for me and my specific tastes. Mosaic + Citra = Win / Win every time.
Canned 8/6/15. Poured into a glass.
Poured from 16 oz tallboys can into a clear glass pilsner glass. Canned on 07/21/15 on bottom. Supplied by and split with Mpls bro Greg. 
"Pours a golden yellow with little to no haze. Smells of sweet malts, tangerine, and a tad bit of pine. Tastes like the nose, sweet malty goodness, with hints of tropic fruits. Well carbonated, this beer has a nice lingering bitter finish. Overall a great beer. Not a huge tropic fruit IPA like I love, but still a solid representation of a great beer."
"It is hard to believe that this beer is listed as the best beer from Minnesota. Surly makes some great beers, but this one is just above average. It uses some great hops and this beer is not overly bitter(which is a nice change because Surly loves to make brutally bitter hoppy beer most of the time), but its just good not great. I would take masala mama any day over this as the best hoppy beer in minnesota."
"Pours a pale gold with white head, typical IPA appearance. Nose is incredibly fragrant with heavy tropical notes paired with dank resinous hops. The mosaic seems to be a little more prominent than the citra, the two jive together nicely. Notes of melon, mango, pine, and earth all come to mind on the aroma. The flavor is smooth with juicy tropical notes up front, moderate bitterness, and a refreshing finish. This is a fantastic IPA... $18 for a 4pack seems a bit steep, but it's definitely worth a try."
"This pours a cloudy, golden yellow color with a slight white head. Very bitter aroma full of hops! The taste is rich, full of pine, citrus, and bitterness. Given the boldness it is very well-balanced. A slow, but delicious, sipper brew that I’m so glad comes in a 16oz size!"
Pours a hazy/partly cloudy orange with a two-finger head that quickly dissipates to some lingering white and bubbly foam on the top. Spotty areas of lacing.
Wow am I an anomaly on this one. I think it's fine but not outstanding. Fruit bowl aroma but it also has some less pleasant qualities too. A bit of sweat like and hints of skunkiness.
The nose on this beer is the shining force that brings Tod the Axe Man to the rank of world class. Super juicy and resinous with a perfect balance of hops to malts.
"I wanted to try this one for a while but had come to terms with the fact that it was draft only at Surly, and then like Christmas come real early this year, they announced they'd be canning it. After tasting it, all I can say is I sincerely hope that this is released on a somewhat regular basis. What a fantastic beer that easily surpassed my expectations. I hadn't tried any other Surly offerings so I didn't know what to expect, but how can you go wrong with an IPA hopped w/Citra and Mosaic (my 2 favorites)?"
"Aroma is heady. Flavor's a heavy duty DIPA, but with enough malt to tone down the edge a tad and that really makes this beer. Along, of course, with their exact choices of malt and hops. Sure is tasty."
Poured on tap in their beer hall into goblet.
"Glad I landed this one in a recent trade, nice fresh cans to boot. Big resinous, floral, tropical nose. Taste is orange, white peach, with a big pine finish. Smooth malt backbone right around my goldilocks 7% mark that brings everything together so well. As someone who is constantly spoiled by treehouse and trillium offerings I can say it's not quite on that level but this is a damn good offering and easily the best the midwest have to offer right now."
"Was blown away with this one. Beautiful color, juicy hop nose, perfect mouthfeel. It almost flirts with the DIPA category but shies away from any sweet taste. For a mid-7% ABV, this is easily in the top-5 of any IPA I've tried thus far."
Really high end beer that really highlights the mosaic hops. Great mouthfeel for an IPA and very drinkable for a beer with a 7+% abv. Holds up and even stands out in the lineup of well done Surly Cans.
"Dated 7/29/15, enjoyed on 8/16/15. Poured into a deGarde tulip glass. Hay colored, good carbonation that faded quickly. Very tropical aroma, taste is super smooth with minimal hop bitterness."
"The beer offers lots of juicy grapefruit, mango, melon, and pineapple up front. Then onto a light bready malt with a kiss of sugary sweetness., piney bitterness and a clean crisp and bitter finish."
"Fresh pungent hop aroma in the nose. Beautiful golden color with two finger cream head. The taste is like drinking an orange or mango juice more than a beer. It coats the mouth and tongue and draws out every drop of saliva as the fruit and tropical notes cascade over the back of the tongue. The only thing my mind is thinking after tasting this is ""why isn't there more?"" This doesn't quite hit the level of Abrasive Ale (not many beers can) but this is a masterpiece in its own right. Hats off to Surly as this is hands down the best single IPA I have ever had and another outstanding beer in their lineup."
"Well this beer certainly lived up to its hype, I want MORE! Poured from a tap to a tulip, the head was about half a finger, but the color was very appealing; a dark golden/burnt yellow color with lots of carbonation bubbles rising. The smell was wonderful, very citrusy, and the taste backed up the smell. Not overly bitter, awesome citrus/hoppy taste. I'll be hunting for some cans this week, or a growler if I can find it in the WI."
Many thanks to SomethingClever for this can.
Poured out as a hazy copper color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer has a pretty aggressive hop aroma to it. The taste does as well. Lots of violent hop flavors and bitterness going on in this one. The feel of the beer is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Overall this beer was pretty fun to try.
"I have a four pack in the fridge, I tried this at the GTMW pre party in Madison. 8oz pour into a tulip glass. Hazy golden orange color, The smell had tons of juicy grapefruit and mango, The taste was similar with a nice sweet malt backbone and plenty of bitter hops near the finish. Balanced and bold, very juicy, just a great beer."
"poors a very slight, hazy blood orange. Some cans were clearer than others. But the color is very gold/orange. Looks great. "
This beer didn't wow me. After reading many great reviews and hearing about the big additions of citra and mosaic hops I was looking forward to a world class IPA. It's good but certainly not in my top 10. The smell is excellent with big citrus and mango and the first taste is more citrus/mango flavor but then the dank bitterness hits and it just doesn't leave my palette with a clean finish. It lingers and I'm not digging it. I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't seek it out again.
Canned on 7/31
Poured from a can (two weeks old) into a tulip glass.
16 ounce can poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. 
"Beautiful citrusy, floral hop aroma explodes from the can upon opening. Taste follows with grapefruit, orange, pineapple and a hint of bitterness. Medium bodied. Overall a fantastic IPA."
Special delivery care package from my MN buddy from Chicago! Seriously badass of you Andrew to getting me this fresh!
I'm so glad a bought a lot of this smashing hop juice...review based on a pour into my standard IPA glass from a batch canned 7/21/15.
Poured from the 26 Oz can into my SN IPA glass
The maltiest IPA I have ever had.. While still being so balanced and delicious. Surly nails it with their IPA brand beers.
"16 oz. can poured into a pint glass. Hazy deep orange. Small white head, but a careful pour. Tropical fruit hop aroma. Strong caramel malt. Almost like a candy sugary aroma. Resiny hops as it warms a bit. Taste is more grapefruit, resin, and even oniony. Not quite the sweetness I expected, but still pretty heavily malted. A bit of toasted malt. Medium bodied. Not a ton of carbonation. A lot going on here, especially for an IPA. Wasn't enthused at first, but this grew on me a lot."
Can shared by Curran yesterday.
Todd the Axe Man has just joined Surly Abrasive as my top two favorite IPA's that were not brewed in New England. This is everything I look for in a great IPA sans the super hazy NE look
"Man this is a really good IPA, nose was sort of citrusy but sort of danky as well; there was no singular over-riding smell. Taste is similar where is a bit citrusy up front but some dank comes behind it leaving you with a slightly bitter west coast like aftertaste"
Thanks to Jeff for keeping the hits coming! 7/21/15 can date. 16oz. can into a Carton Boat glass. 
Canned on 7/16/15. Poured into a 3 Floyds pint glass.
"Canned on 7/31/15. Dark straw to light amber appearance. Gives off tons of carbonation bubbles. Head is light bodied of about 3 fingers that slowly recedes. Smells fantastic - tropical aromas of mango, pineapple, buttery lemon along with some dankness. Tastes great too though doesn't quite live up to the nose - juicy citrus, pineapple, dank pine and bready malt. Hop bite is there in a big, albeit nice way, on the finish. Feel is pretty standard for an IPA. This is a damn solid beer - just wish it wasn't $4.25 per pint."
Citra and mosaic hops. What else is thee to say? This is a fantastic IPA that is insanely drinkable.
Canned 7/21/2015 ... Relatively fresh.
"Dank stank with bright fruity notes. Best surly ipa to date. Boing! This is better than a fuzzy kitten or drooling badger. Put on your shit kickers, this is not hype. Don't die without trying a Todd."
Served at the brewery tap room in Minneapolis in their snifter.
"Reminds me of Focal Banger except it is more bitter. And that's not a bad thing. Smells of tropical and floral character, and tastes fruity, bitter, and very dank. One of my all time favorite IPA's of all time. Would certainly go out of my way to get this again."
"Smell is heavily tropical with hints of dankness and floral aroma. Taste is lemony citrus upfront with a mixture of tropical flavors and a bitter, but fairly balanced finish. Probably my favorite IPA from Surly."
Color: standard IPA. Bit opaque.
Pint cam poured into pint glass. 
"16 oz can. Pours hazy medium orange, head disappears quickly. Aroma is incredible, big fruity smell of oranges, peach. Initial taste follows the aroma, fruity and juicy, delicious. The back end is a great balance of grapefruit peel and sweet semi-resiny malt. Mouthfeel is slick, glides down. Overall outstanding. Want more!"
Delicious. Great citras notes. Reminds me a lot of Dinner.
poured 16oz can into snifter. Canned on 7/31/15.
"Loved this brew! This is one juicy IPA, go out and drink some if you can find it. I hope Surly makes this year round some day."
Excellent brew from Surly. I really enjoyed this face melter. Traditional Surly finish wants you wanting to take another sip to continue the face melt. I highly recommend this hop bomb!!
"Before you do anything breath this one in. If you bumped up the ABV and the beer is Stone's Enjoy By! Not an over the top west coast IPA, but you will not make a mistake about the style. Very drinkable. The ABV would kick my ass. 4.5"
10 day old can into a tulip
"Aroma is a wonderful mix of pineapple, blueberries, honey, and wild onion. Some piney quality as well. Fresh and floral with some grassy notes. Very strong and pungent. Funky passion fruity, mandarins. Very difficult to smell anything past the hops. Clean yeast and malt, malt perhaps supplying a bit of a honey note. Maybe some toasted bread is there as well."
"Pours a medium orange color, thin white head with some lacing on the glass. Thick hop smell, beautiful tropical fruit smell with some grassiness as well. Taste reflects very much of the same. Smooth mouthfeel puts this one into the top tier of IPAs. Very well done."
"Look-definitely the beer's least impressive feature, color is a very cloudy orangish yellow, with a brown tinge. Pours two nice fingers of white, frothy head that retains well, leaving nice chunks of lacing on the sides of the glass."
Pineapple and mangoes !!! This is soooo juicy . The balance of bitter is perfect. Super light malt backbone that let's the hops shine ! This is a hopheads delight. I hope this isnt just a seasonal brew. Well done surly.
"As the description on the can suggests, this is definitely a ""beer to shred your face, in a can."" Absolutely a fantastic IPA. This pours a hazy gold all the while hitting your nose with hops... super hops! Wonderfully citric bitter and bold flavor; a very bold in your face IPA. If you like zombie dust or pseudosue your going to love this beer."
The smell of this beer is pure heaven
"Delicious. Best from Surly, which is saying a lot."
WOW. Mine was a little more than a week old and this was absolutely incredible fresh. There was tons of fresh hops on the nose and tons of character in the taste with just enough hoppy goodness on the finish.
Cloudy gold. One finger head that quickly dissipated. Lacing is just ok. Tropical and citrus notes shine on the smell. Bitter forward and the mosaic comes in after for a nice fruitiness. Ends with a bitter orange from the citra. Carbonation present yet smooth.
So good
"16 ounce can served in a tulip glass. July 23, 2015 canning. "
"Pours a hazy light orange, with a less than one finger white head which fades quickly, leaving spotty lacing. The aroma has pine, grapefruit, grapefruit peeling, pineapple, and mango."
"Can. Pours mostly clear. Not all that hazy. Aroma is of both assertive and sweet hops. Green, bitter-smelling, potent hops along with some blended tropical fruity hops. Flavor is interesting because the first sip demoralizes my bitterness sensors. It's got such a bitter initial zip. Then once my buds are blown into an abyss of confusion and massochistic sadness, all the sweetness and tropicality of the hops come out and dance on my tongue's vanquished soul. Lots of squished citrus, pineapple, nectarine and mango. The dank and grass slithers in and out of my mouthpiece. Finishes with a fruity sweetness and maltiness that tames the mouth dragon. Medium bodied. Reminds me of a grouchy, spiteful and diminutive Abrasive Ale. Very good! Thanks Todd?"
7/23 stamped 16oz can
"16 oz. can. I think you know what this is. If not, please see knittingadvocate.com. "
"Canned 7/20. This will certainly tide me over until abrasive is released. It's not as pungent or bitter as Abrasive, but it is a great beer in its own right:"
"Tallboy canned on 7/23/2015. Aroma is super pungent and the mosaic hops shine here. Taste follows suit, an absolute juicy hop bomb. Very dry. Light malt backbone. Under-carbonated, which is the only major flaw. This beer is going to ruin my palate for weeks."
"I am blown away by this IPA, it is so well balanced between citrus and pine... "
16oz Can
"A - nice hazy orange, can't complain"
"Huge tropical mango, hoppy nose. Lightly toasty/biscuity malt presence. Balance between sweetness/juiciness and drying hop bitterness is pretty spot on."
"Gives Abrasive a run for its money and that's tall praise. Superb balance, great nose and with a polite but noticeable ABV. Another winner from the Twin Cities."
Poured from the can into a tulip. The nose jumps out at you. Beautiful fresh hops. There are waves of citrus flavors and even a little pine to my taste. It drinks like a big DIPA to me but has a nice and easy finish. If you like Abrasive this should be in your ballpark.
"This was canned on 7/29/15, so at only a few days old it was extremely fresh. Beautiful gold/orange appearence. You can really smell the citrus. Same with the flavor, citrus and pine, wonderful bitterness. Expensive, but I'll have to sneak it into my rotation. Wonderful beer. (note) After having a few more I had to up my rating...just an awesome beer."
Canned on 7/16/15.
"This ranks up with Abrasive and BA Darkness as the best beers I've had from Surly. The combo of Citra & Mosaic is a proven winner, but it needs to be brewed with the right malt base. This is not quite on par with some of the Trillium brews, but it's damn good."
Had on tap at the Pig & Fiddle and Lake & Irving. 
Canned 7/23/15. $15.99 for a 4 pak at Sentyrz. Thought I would buy 4 just to give it a try. I'm gonna have to buy more now that I have had it. Damn you Surly!! I love me some Citra hops and this beer has it in spades. Opening the can the smell is just awesome. The taste follows suit. I would choose this over Abrasive.
the hype is real
Easily the best beer that I have ever had ever.
Picked up a can of Todd at Zipp's yesterday after having Todd on tap about 3 weeks ago. 
Some IPAs have to add natural flavoring to achieve this much flavor.
lots of hype about the release of this one. bottom of the can reads 7/21/15.
"Very well done, even outta the can. I'm headed to get an AXE MAN tee signed by Todd himself as u read this #MERICA"
Absolutely a world class beer! Was able to have at Surly's World Headquarters in the cities. Can't wait till it shows up in cans in Wisconsin.
"Stopped over at Surly to try a few of their local brews. This American IPA was exceptional, possibly due to its freshness, but smooth a a nice hop balance nonetheless. A top brew for me."
Great ipa pairs well with BBQ
This a great beer. Right up there with Pseudo Sue.
Staring down a 4 pack to Todd empties dated 7/23 as I write this review
Citra and Mosaic hops combined to brew an exceptional beer. Absolutely delicious. Doesn't get any better than that.
"On tap at CBC 2016 - day 2. Super dank and with tons of hops in the aroma as well as the taste. Notes include oranges, pineapple, unripe mango, a bit of pine resin."
"I got a lot of pineapple flavor from this beer. Comparison wise, it's certainly as good as anything Half Acre has ever made (Beer Hates Astronauts comes to mind). Tastes like a double Akari Shogun, minus the wheat, plus Citra hops. Really good stuff. Would love to blind-taste this against Anicca, Spiteful IPA, BHA, Space, Broo Doo, etc. to crown a true Midwest IPA champ."
Wonderful balance of juicy citrus and sweet marmalade on the nose. Intense pale fruits define the palate. It finishes dry but every flavor lingers... much to my delight.
"This bright golden slightly hazy beer bursts out of the glass from the table. Huge pineapple, grapefruit, and dank grassy notes. Melon, pineapple, grapefruit, and Five Alive hits your tongue. Rich and oily body. Quite frankly the best Midwest IPA I've had since the glory days of ZD & Sue. Immense flavor and slick body. Home run."
"among the best ipas i have ever had. it has something so special about it, and although this might be offensive to some, i found it decidedly east coast in style. it has all the features of something like an abner or something lawsons would do, this might as well have come from vermont. glowing hazy orange color with a tall white head, you just know by looking at it thats its the same type of ipa, raw and juicy, just how i like mine the best. then you smell it, and oh man, its an explosion of fresh pineapple, melon, lemon, citra, mosaic maybe, maybe even some nelson, its just fruit punchy and insane. the thing that i find amazing here, is that the taste is even more developed than the nose. so often in these types of beers, the flavor never lives up to the smell, they get washed out and messy, but not here, all of that tropical hop brilliance comes on, and lasts forever. the pineapple is the dominant note here, especially in the finish, and there really is hardly any bitterness at all. i could drink this all year and not get bored with it, which might be the ultimate compliment for any beer coming from me. its s juicy, my mouth waters for it after every sip, and i find my glass is gone way too fast, owed in part to its soft medium body and sparkling carbonation. among the best i have ever had, and for all the beers that were under expectations here at surly, the very fact that they made this one makes them one of my favorite operations in the country. what a beer! easily worth the hype that surrounds it. stunning."
On-tap at the new brewery restaurant (my first visit). Tasted 21 April 2015.
Look: Cloudy golden apricot with a bit of tan film	
"On tap at Surly. The color is beautiful, glowing, slightly hazy orange with a white head. Smell is fantastic tropical fruit. Taste is perfectly balanced bitter and sweet citrus and tropical fruits. "
Passed a goblet of this at the Surly tap house in Minneapolis.
Very solid beer worth having a taste! This beer really seems to hold up in cans. Have had it many times and it keeps getting better! Better than Abrasive most days.
"Revisiting this one after consuming multiple cans. It's really growing in me. Citra juicyness. Perfect hop bitterness, the best single IPA I've had."
So incredibly smooth and just a beautiful citra bomb. Unbelievably easy to drink for over 7% ABV. Perhaps the most impressive offering from Surly yet.
On tap at DLD15.
Appearance: Arrives at the Surly Taproom bar with a golden color verging on orange; an inch of foam caps the liquid and leaves a few strands behind
8/4 Canning 
"This is the best IPA I have had. While drinking this for the first time I recall saying to the bartender that I would be happy drinking this daily and never try another IPA. He nodded in agreement. Beautiful nose, but that taste! It cannot be topped!! Heavy on the Mosiac & Citra with a clean and light malt backbone. I just wish I could make it to Minneapolis more often, or you know, if they could just ship me a keg every month."
A nice IPA. Good representation of the style.
"I have only had this beer once but today I was the first person to ask so Bunny's in St. Louis Park, Mn tapped it just for me. The taste is amazing and smooth. The kind of IPA you can sip on all day. It's strong but not insane and it's flavor is incredible. Come to Bunny's to get yours!!!"
"Amazing taste, highly recommended on tap."
Delicious fresh keg @beergasm pdx
Fantastic new DIPA from Surley! Had on tap several times! Really floral!
In my top 10 IPAs ever.. perfect beer
"Wow. Great beer, really glad they finally put it in a can. Beautiful looking golden color with a bright white head that sticks around. The nose is very fruity on this one with mango sweetness. Very hoppy flavor, lots of grapefruit with a decent amount of light malt flavor on the end. This is a super easy drinking IPA. Definitely worth the price as a seasonal treat."
"Growler fill, likely could have used a bit more carbonation. Looked like pond water. Smelled quite nice, but taste seemed a little flat."
"Light in color, but heavy in flavor. One of my favorites of this style!"
"Tasted in a 12 oz snifter from draught at Firkin on March 13, 2015. Tasted in a 14 oz snifter from draft at Half Day Brewing on May 31, 2016. Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 16 oz can on several occasions. Look is hazy copper gold, with a sudsy white head and some lingering lacing. Smell is citrus, cedar, hay, pear blossom, tea and caramel malt aromas. Taste is citrus rind, pine, pear, black tea with light caramel malt flavors. Feel is medium in body with a crisp bitter finish."
Exceptional! Wish Surly would can this beer so that it was more available.
Poured on tap into a snifter
This was good. Had on tap at the brewery. The amount to which this beer tasted like grapefruit and pineapple was insane. Lots of hops up front and malt and yeast in the end.
On tap at Tipsy Cow. Very good. Hazy unfiltered look. Light straw color. Big Fruity citrus taste and aroma. Decided to share this and a Doomtree with my girlfriend and we fought over this one.
"This brew was served on tap from the upstairs walk-up bar, at the new Surly taproom in Minneapolis, Minnesota. They poured into Surly tulips, with the beer showing through a glowing golden pumpkin coloring. A one finger head of chunky, soapy white bubbles topped the liquid, showing solid retention.  Lacing was spotty, and a cheesecloth film formed across the surface of the beer. Heavy haze reduced light and clarity, but no sediment was found. Carbonation appeared to be minimal. Aromatics included saltine crackers, heavy grapefruity and citric hops, evergreen piney hops, sweet caramel and honey sugars, pale, crystal, and wheaty malts, tropical pineapple and passion fruit fruitiness, chlorine, green onion airs, concrete dust, lactic creaminess, raw barley dust, soft amber and wheaty inclusions, light white sugars, dill weed, glue adhesive, and aluminum. With warmth came spicier dried herbal and grassy hop pellets. The flavor followed with cucumber skins, wheaty and Rice Krispie maltiness, big herbal, piney, and hearty citric hoppy blend, green bell peppers, fresh green twigginess and wet mossiness, vegetal celery stalk and parsnip root, potato starchiness, raw organic oregano spiciness, corny malty vibe, medicinal phenols, clean pale malt toast, simple raw caramel graininess, and clay-like mineral. The body was medium, and carbonation was a bit lighter. Nice slurp, smack, cream, froth, and crisp finishing pop enhanced each sip. The mouth was left chalked and astringently dried following a flash flood of wet and drippy creamed coating. The abv was appropriate, and the beer disappeared super easily."
On tap into a 10 oz Surly snifter at the new brew hall.
"This is a beer that has the best of both worlds when it comes to hops, malt bill, and some resemblance of many of the delicious New England IPA's. The Mosaic and Citra hops come blasting out of the can on the nose. Grapefruit, tropical fruits, cantaloupe are the major aromas. The taste matches the nose. The malt bill is simple, light and crackery to let the hops shine. it also makes the beer very drinkable at 7.2% without a heavy caramel malt bill. Delicious beer."
On tap at Surly.
"Had this on tap at the new Surly destination brew-pub-restaurant whatever. Pour was hazy light orange with a pale pillowy straw colored foam that laced up. Wow..smells of mango, pineapple, oranges and tangerines. Love it and Fantastic. Taste is mild-medium bitter showcasing Citra with ripe pineapple, papaya and mangos, a light complexity of citrus.. tangerines and mandarin oranges. All this woven into a just barely there malt canvas of crackers and biscuit. Moithfeel is medium, creamy and holds together well. Finishes dry but juicy. Eminently drinkable. Very, very good."
"This beer pour golden yellow with a lively head. The aroma smacks you in the face with sweet grapefruit, lemon, and pine. When I say smack you in the face, I mean it. On smelling it I did a physical double take. The flavor is not quite as intense, but is is still a straight up citrus bomb, with hints of pine in the background. Balance, screw balance, this beer is pure, unadulterated hoppy fun. If this was sold regularily I would bet it would outsell overrated."
"I had on tap about 6 months ago at Surly, unfortunately I started off the night with Witches tower which made the axeman taste like a plain old ipa with nothing to it. Fortunately for me I tried it again... This is the closest thing i have EVER tried with a clean palate to Pseudo Sue! Wow. I mean i hate to say it but Surly ya out did yourself this time. For ONCE a surly beer that lives up to the hype. This one should be called ""underrated"". Cirus BOMB soooo balanced and easy to drink. Easiest to drink. Mouthfeel is medium light, slight malty-ness. Aftertaste doesnt linger until it warms a bit then it lingers but you WANT it to... The only thing Sue has on axeman is that Sue is a pale ale and drinks like one, Axe man is marketed as an I.p.a. But drinks like a pale ale. Im sure this was a mareting ploy on Surly's part, since they have yet to make a PALE ALE!!! I can just hear Todd asking Omar ""should we call this a pale ale?"" ""Nope we will sell more if we call it an i.p.a.""..."
"Big grapefruit flavors, nice hop flavors but not very bitter."
"On tap at the beer hall, hazy yellow appearance, aroma is full of tropical fruit and the taste is the same, super drinkable for the ABV. Surly's best hoppy beer, great to see that they are canning it."
"Poured from bottle, hazy pale gold with medium white head. Aroma with notes of bread, fruit and citrus. Taste is bitter but well balanced and surprisingly light bodied. Nice bitter after taste."
Thy axe is sharp and steadfast......neon is the color and the flavor is that of pure hop bliss and with a crispness of a Braeburn.
"Bottle. Golden, little cloudy. Medium, semi-densed, white head. Very aromatic. Striking combination of tropical fruits (lychee, pinnaple, mango) and citrus (mainly orange) aromas. Light malty character (toast). The beer taste more like APA than AIPA. Due to used hops (mosaic, citra) it’s sweet. The bitterness is medium, I’d even say bearly medium. Aftertaste is dry and bitter."
"Got a hazy yellow goblet at the Surly Beer Hall. It's absolutely bursting with hop flavor, but maintains a pleasant, balanced bitter kick. It's floral citrus with fruity undertones, so rich in hoppy flavor you could sip a glass for hours. This is an IPA to be reckoned with. Very different in character from Heady Topper, but nearly on par for strength of flavor."
Had on draft at Surly brewery
This one is Better than Abrasive...
"2016 and later: This beer is pretty inconsistent, i've had cans that were terrible. Sample first."
canned 8.6.15. re-reviewed about two weeks after can date.
"From a can. Pours hazy, golden orange. Head dissipated quickly. Nose jumps out of the glass with grapefruit, pineapple and pine. Taste equals the nose, and ends with a borderline harsh, almost peppery bitterness that lingers. Medium body and soft mouthfeel are just perfect."
"The nose on this beer is worth a .25 uptick alone. Floral, resin, grapefruit. The flavor, thats where the rest of the score comes from. Its juicy, and delicious. "
Excellent IPA. One of the best beers Surly has brewed. One of the best IPAs I've ever had.
Some of the best beer out there. This one is highly sessionable and overall obscenely delicious. Creamy and fruity with a very approachable golden hazy color. EXCELLENT!
"A nearly perfect IPA. A great example of why citra and mosaic hops play so well off each other. Excellent sweet blueberry flavor combined with mangoes and fresh citrus. All day long. Such a juicy beer that has a very clean finish. No head retention? Who cares, get me another!"
"Marmalade orange in appearance. Not clear, just a slight bit of haze."
My new second favorite surly offering. This is even better than abrasive.
On tap at the Surly taproom. 10 oz. pour in a chalice.
A-pours a clear yellow color with a 1 finger white head a touch of lacing .. was surprised at the color of this
"I have had this beer several times now, both on tap and out of the can. I will say I liked it better on tap, especially the nose. Seemed to have a better citrus punch on tap. All in all a terrific brew."
10 oz goblet at the brewery. 
"Seriously one of the best beers I have had, at the top with beers of similar style! Let's hope we will see more of this!"
"Citra bomb. Close to sue, Zombie dust, and the other single hop Citra beers. I dont like citra centric IPA's too much, but everyone else sure does! So if you love citra, you'll love this beer."
"Poured out of growler 4 days after buying. Nothing fancy here, just a simple but beautifully crafted single hip ipa that checks off all the boxes. Terrific!"
12 oz pour at the brewery last week.
"This was the last of the Hill Farmstead cans that I traded for in front of Other Half not too long ago. Loved the others that I had and this one might have been the best of the bunch. The Mosaic Hops were showcased so beautlfully here without being too overpowering or one-dimensional. At the end of the day, isn't that what good beer should do, without hitting you over the head?"
"Great mouthfeel, good nose, great lacing, smooth and soft with approachable hop level. This could be an everyday beer without a doubt, of course only if you lived in Vermont."
"Smell: Really dank west coast smelling beer. Onion, garlic, peppercorn. Some juicy fruitiness underneath the dankness. Blueberry, mango, peach, orange peel, lemon. A faint hint of sweet crackery malt and yeasty bubblegum. The beer smells really west coast, but with some Northeast influence."
Appearance - Pours golden straw color with nice white cap that settles to a rocky film. Strings of lacing around the glass.
"Pours a hazy, dark orange coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smells of floral, grassy hops with citrus and tropical fruit notes: tangerine, grapefruit, passion fruit, pineapple. Taste follows the nose, with a very hop-forward taste dominted by juicy citrus fruit: tangerine, grapefruit, with hints of tropical fruit: pineapple, passion fruit and a slight, undelying grassyness. Medium bitterness in the aftertaste. Medium body and carbonation, with a smooth, pleasant mouthfeel. This packs an incredible hop punch for a 6% ABV beer that is not even dry-hopped. Great stuff."
"As it pours out of the 12 ounce can, it seems clear gold, but fills in the glass to a perfectly hazy yellow-orange with a moderate white foam head that settles in rolling hills leaving short peaks of garter lace."
"This one pours a moderately hazy golden orange color, with a small head, and a lot of lacing."
"I had a few of these at the Armsby Abbey this weekend. Hands down, it’s by far the best IPA I have ever tasted. Beats Julius, Green, Congress St, Focal Banger, and all the major US labels (Stone IPA, Two Hearted, Rogue) etc."
"Pours golden. Hazy, but not muddy. The tropical aromas as you open the can are intoxicating. You know you're in for a good one from the crack of the can. There's some mango, raw sugar cane, mint, and tree bark. It's drier than S&S #6 as would be expected at this ABV. However, it's full bodied and flavorful in a way you wouldn't expect from a pale. Just another example of Shaun Hill flaunting the fact that he can make great beer in all styles and alcohol percentages."
"On tap at The Reservoir, Waterbury VT. The appearance was a glossy burnt yellow to orange color with a bar pour’s kind slim white cap of a little head, no lacing, but I’m not worried. The smell starts off with resinous bitter hoppiness with an underscore of pine to balance. The taste was just a tad sweeter than the bitter side in the respect of taking the resinous bitter hoppiness to lead into sweet citrusy bliss. A sliding citrusy aftertaste running into the same sort of finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a slick oily bitter semi-sessionable feel on my tongue. Overall, its a pretty good APA that I could come back to."
"On tap at the brewery. Super hazy and bright yellow-orange, lots of lace on the glass. Aroma and flavor are almost all Mosaic hops, grassy, delicious. This is a fine beer and definitely a pale ale, not an IPA. Better than the Citra single hop. Nice but not growler nice."
"This was fantastic. One of the best, if not the best, tasting pale ales I've ever had. Smell is pure mosaic goodness, tropical and bright. Taste follows, although slightly muted compared to nose. Mouthfeel is typical HF great. Can't wait to have this again."
"Pours a hazy yellow-gold, with an inch of dense white head. Great lacing. Smell is earthy, spicy hops, with citrus and pine coming in as well. Taste is similar, with layers of herbal spice, citrus, tropical fruit and pine. Feel is smooth and soft, with prickly carbonation providing a good counterpoint. Really great and tasty pale ale."
This beer is one of my all time favorite Pale Ales. Bursting with flavor but not overpowering like the bigger IPAs and IIPAs coming out. It has
"Tropical, pineapple, citrus. Good balance."
"Insanely drinkable. At first it comes off as a bit watery, but it builds in intensity. You get a solid balance of hops, grain bill and water. I love intense mosaic and was initially let down by not having it amped up to realms of infinite dankness but ... you know, this is a pale. This is the sensitive side of mosaic. Just crushable and delicious."
"L - Creamy orange/yellow pour with frothy foam that dissipates rather quickly. Beauty to look at, hazy and dense. No transparency"
"Drank from a 750 ml (25.36 fl.oz.) growler purchased at Hill Farmstead Brewery, Greensboro Bend, VT"
"thanks mark! growler into HF bulb. murky golden yellow frothy soapy head, sheets of lace. nose is mosaic. sweaty dank hop. taste is spot on mosaic...suoer clean and crisp and definitely a pale, but could fool you that it is an ipa.super drinkable and delish. great mosaic brew love this hop!"
"Pour is a hazed amber with yellow edges and a decent amount of tight white head. Nose is pure mosaic, pineapple, papaya, tropical, with a moderate amount of that melon rind muskiness. Flavor is even cleaner and more tropical, faint grain notes add some balance, tons of pineapple and tropical fruit goodness with a decent clean bitter finish, nicely carbonated and moderately delicate feel. Faint bit of the musky rind through the finish."
On tap at Prohibition Pig. Best beer I had on my Vermont trip. The citrus nose is alone makes it world-class.
"Hazy straw yellow with a big frothy head. Citrus and tropical fruit aroma. Dry soft body with mild carbonation. Flavors of lemon, mango, bready wheat. Mild bitter finish. Delicious and easy drinking."
Hop tastic!! 
"A nice, crushable Mosaic single."
"Served at The Reservoir, Waterbury, VT and full notes taken on May 23, 2015."
750 mL growler poured into a wine glass.
Not really my favorite mosaic beer.
"Hill Farmstead has done it again! Smooth, hoppy, but extremely well balanced. Showcases the Mosaic Hop perfectly. Great mouth feel and so tasty! Get it!"
"Very nice, prefer this over single Citra. The mosaic hops make this beer very special. HF makes fantastic APAs but this one really shines."
"Better than HF's single hop pale ale using citra. The mosaic hop really shines here, a fantastic offering."
"Reviewing the Mosaic Single Hop Pale Ale from the Hill Farmstead Brewery out of Greensboro, Vermont."
"The aroma explodes of tropical fruit of kiwi, guava, lemon, citrus zest."
"Growler, big dank, earthy, and pine hops, well balanced pale with a dry finish"
Consumed 4/11/15
Appearance: Hazy yellow-gold. Head is bright-white and slightly fluffy. Drops to a small soapy cap. Minimal head retention. Slight splotches of lacing. Slight carbonation on the pour. 
From 04/09/15 notes. Thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing a 32 oz. growler of this; thanks Ross.
750ml growler poured into a Sara's Cellar wine glass.
Growler shared by Lunch. Can I get an amen?
"Golden yellow in color. Hazy in appearance. Light, delicate, citrus rind bitterness. Smells a ton better than the taste. Creamy feel. Still, it's good."
A nice unfiltered hazy pour with a moderate carbonation. Can you say grapefruit in the nose? Powerful mosaic hop smell. Taste is wonderful grapefruit like taste with a nice not overly bitter finish. Another great HF beer.
One of the best beers I've ever tasted.
Enjoyed on tap at the Dive Bar.
Tap at Armsby Abbey
"On tap at the Blackback Pub in Waterbury, VT."
"Tap @ HF and growler driving home. Pours a hazed yellow white head. The nose is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever smelled in a beer. Pure bliss. Taste takes a small step back though. Not as tropical/juicy as I was expecting. Quite high bitterness. Very clean, very refreshing. I could drink about 4 liters of this beer without it tiring my palate."
"Excellent!! Very fragrant , earthy taste."
"I can't imagine a tastier, more flavorful pale ale. What a great showcase of the mosaic hop."
"Slightly cloudy apricot pour, 1 finger of white head diminished quickly, minimal lacing in the Blackback Pub tulip."
On tap at Grizzly's Plymouth.
"I wish I could post pictures with my reviews. This beer almost glows a stunning orange and the beer tastes as good as it looks. Hazy NE style IPA, so juicy and citrus/fruity. I've had few beers I crave more than this... now if only it could be readily had in the twin cities!!"
My favorite Disgruntled beer. I also love Reaper. Juicy and the perfect hop presence. Every batch is a little different but it is consistently my favorite MN IPA.
I've had this before but never rated it. Always enjoyed it. Looks the part with the cloudy orange juice appearance. Nice fruity aroma which leans toward the tropical fruits but definitely includes citrus fruit notes. Really a nice aroma to this. 
I really liked this one. Some variations in the batches but over all very good!
"This beer pours a completely opaqu dirty yellow with a fairly head. is hugely tropical, with passionfruit, pineapple, grapfruit, tangerine, mango, and guava. The flavor is joyously juicy, with loads of passionfruit, guava, pineappl, and mango, as well as grapefruit peel, kiwi, watermelon, honeydew, and a decent bitter pithy finish. The mouthfeel is quite soft and pillowy, with fulsome carbonation. Overall this beer has a wonderfully descriptive name - it is stupid how good this is. Great texture, huge aroma, gorgeous flavor, and just enough bitterness for balance."
"Look: A dull, cloudy orange appearance."
"Excellent NE-IPA from up north Minnesota, stoked to finally try this."
Had this on tap in a pint glass at the Taproom.
"Pours a thick cloudy golden color with a 1 finger white head and chunks of lacing...this is perfection!, Smell is citrus and tropics no mistake here all hops . Taste is a citrus overload of tropical hops , papaya,mango, fresh oranges, and tangerines its explosive yet very delicate. mouth feel is soft and pillowy so little bitterness with so much hop explosion. This is a perfect IPA and a perfect IPA for the very popular NE IPA class, make no mistake this is one to seek out,SUPERB!"
On tap at the taproom.
"I try not to give a 5/5 rating in order to respect the validity of that score... But with ""stupid good"" it was a must. This hazy IPA is one of a kind with a sunset orange color, pleasant citrus aroma, and a creamy mouth feel that is unmistakable. The fresh juicy citrus flavors are also out of this world good. With IPA's being my favorite style of beer, I have come across no match to stupid good!"
"LOOKS: A hazy, burnt lemon with a finger of white foam that slowly fades to a ring. Fair lacing down the glass."
Pours out a cloudy straw color. The head is off-white with moderate retention. Lacing is moderate as well.
"Hot shit 3 years ago, not so much now. The competition kicks this beer in the nuts and says fuck you old man."
"Straight pour from a pry-off 12oz bottle to a flared pilsner glass—AZ Wilderness’ Wilderpils glass. This has a bottling date of … who knows. “8254 1 0812,” whatever that means. All I know is that I bought the first sixer I saw in a store, and it’s a very recent release—past couple of weeks. "
"Picked up a few dry cases at, wait for it...Total Wine..Huh? yep, Total had 4 cases on hand and I helped myself to all of them. Tested the 1st bottle slightly chilled, IMO, it's still Nelson, but a little dumbed down in the 12oz bottle. The Nelson that was produced in Alpine before the sale to Green Flash, had so much Nelson hop aroma in the head it would almost trigger a gag reflex, and was unmistakeable for any IPA's that that had Nelson in the recipe. Still overall it's Nelson, and consumed the next 2 bottles chilled and poured into a Riedel 32oz burgundy stem, the look was spot on as in the 1st bottle as was the mouth feel, the smell and taste was evident that they did not use enough Nelson hops. However, at $12.99 a 6pack I think it's tasting better. Lately it's been showing up on tap in LA and the OC, it's always better on tap but get it while you can, however you can. Hopefully New Zeland will cut loose enough Nelson hops for Beachwood BBQ to put Alpha Supreme back on the menu, we can only hope."
"Bottled 9/5/18, consumed 9/22/18"
Poured into a hybrid glass from a 12oz bottle
It's a light gold color. The appearance is not representative of the overall huge flavor it has. The smell is fresh like orange juice and very piney. The taste is super refreshing and light and very flavorful and the ending notes are exceptionally loaded with fresh hops. It's very high on the drinkability scale. IT's an amazing beer in the IPA category.
"Grunt fill from Albertsons. Bright golden pour, milky, fluffy head fades fast. Fruity, flowery aroma, mild dank notes. More funk and fruit in the taste, drying bitterness. Sweet and bitter."
Pours a very hazy yellow orange with a massive 2 inch head on draft. Leaves loads of lace.
"Amazing beer, my all time favorite. "
I do not like nelson hops.
October 2015 @ MTKATL
"had this on tap. beautiful pour, way hazier than i would have thought - completely opaque. a dense bright white head hangs around for a while and leaves tons of lace. on nose is pine, dankness, grapefruit, citrus peel. this mostly follows on the palate, but there is also a white grape note and a super pithy herbaceous character. some citrus, lemon, grapefruit, orange, showing up as well. good malt presence throughout, and a nice hit of mellow spice from the rye. mouthfeel is on point! this was an absolute pleasure to drink after having so many hazed NE beers - great balance between juicy citrus notes, danky pine and green character, and that touch of spice from the rye. excellent brew!"
"Very fruity IPA, notes of Mango，Pineapple."
"4/14/17...pours pale gold, a little hazy, but able to see through. Dry wine nose, very faint. Crisp dark fruity flavor. White wine throughout. Pretty tasty."
"Classic old-school hoppy IPA. Bitter, sure, but the right amount of bitterness - not overwhelming. Quenching when guzzled. A tasty brew. Lucky to get it on tap."
"Had it on draft in a English pint. Hazy bright yellow with a thick, foamy head and great lacing. The smell is intensely citrus. The taste is strong grapefruit and orange, also prominent pine and hoppy bitterness. A very flavorful beer!"
On tap at Growler USA in Phoenix. Pours a golden effervescent hue with moderate frothing. Pungent aroma replete with hints of citrus and grapefruit. Piney.
Look: It pours golden with a white head that has moderate head retention. It is fairly clear. 
On tap pies & pints 4-2017
"Poured from a howler on the day it was tapped. A vigorous pour produces a thick, creamy, light tan, two finger head on top of an orangish tan, slightly opaque beer. The smell knocks you over with fresh citrus and woody/piney hops. There is also a spiciness to it. The taste is bitter hops resin, and a woody, floral spice. The citrus comes through less on the taste than in the nose. The mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. Overall a great beer I'm happy I had the chance to try. It's a unique flavor."
BB 5-24-16. Drank 12-18-15. Damn this is hoppy!!! Spicy rye & grapefruit...maybe a little onion too.
Love love love Nelson hops so I have been trying to get this for a while. Worth the wait. It can stand there with most northeast IPA's. Wish it was more readily available in my area!
"Rye, resin, grapefruit. Crisp, refreshing, tangy, juicy, bitter, impeccable finish. The best rye-involved beer I've ever tasted."
Interesting I'll give it that... but nothing I would prefer on a daily.
One of the first beers I ever had from Alpine. They are probably over all my favorite west coast brewery for hops right now. Super hoppy super smooth too. Nice mix of rye and citrus hops going on with this.
Best Alpine I've had by a mile
"beautiful nose of lemon, tangerine, and grapefruit. Nice light body, low maltiness, clean and somewhat dry. leaves a lingering bitterness across the tongue in the aftertaste."
I had it on tap at the Dive Bar NYC. It poured an eye catching hazy golden orange color. It had a thumb nail length frothy head that retained nicely. The lacing also retained well and was sticky.
On tap at a liquor store.
Appearance - The beer is a murky golden color that showed a big head. 
"Bottle into a snifter. Hazy golden in appearance with moderate translusence. Big ol' pillow head of white foam on top. Looks nice. Big aroma of hop resin, citrus, grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, and a touch of rye spice. The taste is very citrus and rye/malt forward. A very nice hop bitterness creeps in middleways and takes the wheel, leaving this beer to finish like a true West Coast IPA. The feel is very, very smooth and creamy, possibly the smoothest IPA I've ever had. "
Pretty darned ungood. 6/16
"Pours cloudy orange color with bubbles clinging to the glass in the body of the brew, leading up to a 1-2 finger foamy off white head that was full of bubbles of all sizes , dissipating very slowly and leaving very good spotty foamy lacing. Second pour from bottom half brought out a much better head and left foamy rings as it went down."
"Picked up a bomber at the Trig's Cellar 70 in Wausau. The ""best by"" date says this one is good for another month. Poured right from the fridge into my Founders pint glass."
Been wanting to try this for a while but never got around to it. Finally found a fresh bottle so here goes nothing.
"Looks like a wheat beer/hefe. Smells like mary jane. Real smooth with a not too bad bitter linger, Taste is not over powering, but real drinkable. Overall another solid beer from Alpine!!"
"This beer pours a very hazy goldenrod with a large, fluffy head. The aroma offers up strong lemon and lemongrass, caraway seed and some muted pineapple. The flavor is dry and savory, with the caraway and rye bread flavor playing a solid background role to the leading players of the lemony, lemon grass, lemon pepper- pretty much every lemon influenced spice - flavor, the muted, not to sweet tropical notes of pineapple, and a background hint of pine. The mouthfeel is fizzy and full. Overall this is a stellar beer. There was a lot of hype when these bottles came around, but this beer was worth it."
"Cloudy, light yellow color with half finger head. Big lemon on the nose with some grapefruit and grassy hops. Lemon also comes through on the nose with citrus, bread, and spice from the rye. Nice IPA."
Poured from 22oz bottle into a dimpled mug.
"So much all over this, blending reviews of the Alpine beer with the Nelson* from Green Flash after the cashout. Usually light orange with a full inch of white head. Aroma is a straight 5 when the Nelson hops are popping all funky, earthy, and aggressive. Everything Mosaic wishes it was!"
Cloudy yellow with a large foam head retaining a thick blanketing layer. It's not quite so much lacing as it is a wall o foam curtains clinging to all sides.
"Pours an opaque gold with a big cap of foamy white head. The head has great retention and leaves trails of small sticky lacing. The aroma is good, with light floral and citrus hops notes balancing against each other. The flavor is much the same with an additional malt that isn't really noticeable but holds up the hops, which are more prominent in the taste than the aroma. The body is just the right weight, hitting that sweet spot of having a little heft but not being too thick for its flavor. There is just a slight bite from the hops on the finish."
"Hazy golden yellow. Smells like cotton candy, lime soda, black pepper. Taste of citrus and reminds me of a hoppy wheat beer. Aftertaste is bitter like citrus rind. The rye is subtle and blends well with the hops. I thought this was going to be a malty ipa but so much more fruity and complex than I expected. I'll have another."
"Deep yellow color, moderate clarity. Bright white head that retains well. The aroma is citrus, tropical fruit, dank. The taste follows, with the dankness and rye pronounced on the aftertaste. The body is medium with a moderate-high carbonation. A bitter, balanced finish that lingers. Very impressed overall, a well balanced, very enjoyable IPA."
"Pours a golden-amber haze with a medium thick foamy white head. Good retention and lacing left behind. Citrus and dank hop aromas right up front. Slight resin hop tinge in the back ground. Smells like good things are going to come. Taste is incredibly well balanced, with fantastic notes of citrus, dank hops, and a splash of orange and lemon at the end. Fantastic. Mouth feel is smooth and filling. It has a great consistency to it that makes it feel like it could be served as a dessert course on a summer picnic, or downed pronto after a mountain bike ride. Overall, stupendous. Love the packaging on top of everything else. Just wish I could have it in 6 packs of cans or at least smaller bottles to take camping. "
"Kinda of biased because it is my favorite IPA in SD and I can go to the brewery anytime. I'm finally reviewing it because Green Flash is now making this beer for Alpine, which I had my reservations. After drinking a few batches, I can honestly say it taste the same as the original that I've come to enjoy many years ago. It is definitely a must try especially if your new to the craft beer scene. Cheers!"
"22 oz bottle, stamped best by June 2016, poured into IPA glass."
Absolutely love this beer. Everything about this beer is perfect to me
"L - the head is a little thin, but the body is a beautifully hazy neon yellow"
22 oz bomber poured into a anchor steam glass.Smell is a strong grapefruit.Taste is a grapefruit maybe pineapple mix.A lot of bitterness.Overall a solid IPA but I believe a little over rated.
A 2/3 - Slightly hazy pale yellow with medium bubbly head that hangs around for a real long time
Smell and taste just wow! Unbelievable!
"Delicious. Great aroma, huge Nelson character. Incredibly clean flavor. Pure west coast IPA. Wow, I'm glad to see that Green Flash has continued the excellence set forth by Alpine with this one. I will be picking this one up whenever I see it. No complaints here, give it a try! Cheers"
"First had from 22-oz. bomber, stamped best by ""24 MAY 16,"" poured into nonic pint. Once again I'm left wondering if the Alpine beer I'm drinking here in the Deep South is the original beer that earned its stratospheric ratings here and elsewhere."
"Pours a hazy peach with a two finger white head. Aroma is big citrus, grapefruit, tropical fruits, white wine/white wine grapes. Flavor follows with citrus, white wine, a zesty quality for lack of a better word, and a spicy bitterness from the hops and rye. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth, perfectly carbed for a rye ipa. Overall, not always a fan of the stigma that Alpine has, but this is a damn fine beer that I would happily drink again."
This beer looks excellent in a glass. It pours a murky yellow-orange with a fizzing white head. Lots of bubbles streaming. 
"22 oz. best by June 18th, 2016."
L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a bright yellow color and a cloudy consistency. There was a small amount of foamy head that lasted an average amount of time. Fantastic lacing.
"Pours a hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. The nose is tropical and fruity, with a touch of maltiness. The taste has notes of mango and orange and decent malt undertones. The feel is smooth and the finish lingers on the palate. Overall, it's a good IPA but doesn't blow me away in any aspect. Nice and fruity, goes down easy and very drinkable."
L: cloudy yellow with a finger of white head
"BBD 6/18/16. Pours a hazy gold with a touch of amber. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention."
"Wow! This is worthy of the hype. Juicy, sweet, smooth, velvety. Layers of melon, white grapes, slight rye spiciness and hops to offset. Nice fluffy head with amazing lacing that follows you down."
Golden in color. The lightness of the hops really shines through in this for me. It's a very drinkable beer with a light aroma but good hop punch. Citrus notes.
"Smell is tropical fruit - I get primarily pineapple, mango, and a hint of orange juice, with a light floral aroma. Taste is a little more general tropical fruit juice mixed with citrus, and a hint of lavender. As is typical with Nelson beers, this is extremely juicy. While it's a good beer I was expecting to like it just a little more than I did."
"An Alpine label in a bomber embossed with the Green Flash logo. Heard that GF bought Alpine, so that expalins that. Cloudy light orange-yellow pour with a very light head that quickly fades. Definite one-note aroma of piney hop, not much in the way of fruit. Taste is hops and softened with the rye and malt. This is a good solid West Coast IPA, but doesn't quite live up to the lofty score. Has the beer changed in ten years? That's possible. Alpine was not available in MN until recently."
"Bomber into Duvel glass... Pours a hazy, lemon gold, with a fluffy, white head of thick foam. Dabs of retention leave some webs and splotches of lace. Aroma is of citrus zest, white pepper and leather. Thin, bready malt is followed by a rye zing and orange / grapefruit rind on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium; carbonation is medium with a touch of creaminess... Finish is dry. Overall, the unique look of this beer, plus the combo of rye and a unique hop variety deliver a very enjoyable spin on a west coast IPA."
22 oz bottle was poured into a nonic glass. 
pours light golden with minimal head that dissipates quickly. smell of nelson suavin all the way I can't seem to place what im smelling w this hop. maybe some floral notes and lemon? anyway smells pretty nice. taste follows nose w the hop presenting itself from front pallate all the way to the end. rye gives this beer a nice spice at the finish with bitterness lingering. this is a great beer and I love nelson hops even though I can't quite place what im tasteing. seek out this one it's a def winner.
"From a 22oz bottle that says best by March 17th. I keep hearing how this beer has gotten so much worse since the Green Flash buyout. I can't comment on that since I wasn't able to get it where I live until after that buyout, but I have to say, this is still a really solid IPA. Maybe Green Flash has gotten better at making it, or maybe their version was just a victim of hype. Whatever the case, even this much maligned version of Nelson is definitely worth trying."
Look - cloudy yellow color with a good lasting sticky white head.
22oz bomber best by 24 May 2016. Poured into a tulip glass.
On tap at hopcat was nothing exceptional
Pours - Cloudy citrus juice golden color with thick white head that stays until almost the glass is gone great lacing.
"22 oz bottle poured in a stemmed, tulip style glass. Coppery color and nice carbonated white head on the beer after the pour. Outstanding rye IPA. The golden rye adds a touch of spiciness to it really balancing it out, but then it hits you on the palate with all the hop goodness."
Fresh bottle best by 6/18/16.
"GF or not, it is still outstanding. It's been a while since I've had a ""real"" Nelson, but i would never complain about this being in my fridge. Cheers!"
"22 oz. bottle, best by date May 24, 2016 printed on the label. My second beer from Alpine Beer Company, their highly acclaimed Nelson 'golden rye India pale ale'."
Picked this up from BDBS in SD.
"Bomber with best by date exactly 60 days into the future. Not sure when this was born, but seems relatively fresh. Cloudy, golden hue with foamy, white head. Looks to be well carbonated."
"L - pale yellow color, hazy, 1 finger thick sudsy white head that reduces into a the ring. Minimal lacing"
"I had this on draft at a local (excellent) bar. The rye flavor was pretty good, but not outstanding. Ideally, a rye IPA is an excellent IPA with a just more kick. This tasted like a pretty good IPA with some rye."
"Pours a very light, pale yellow color, with a thin layer of white head. Looks like cloudy apple or grapefruit juice. The smell is very fruity and bright, with citrus & slight mango aromas. "
"January 14, 2016"
"Was surprised to find a couple of these just hanging around the shelves in my local beer store. I picked one up to give it a try. Well worth it! Very good, west coast style IPA. Tropical, juicy, drank, and highly drinkable at a decent 7% ABV. Very similar to other beers I've had from them. I recommend Alpine."
"Really good IPA. Not sure if I would describe it as a world beater, but I would definitely buy again. It's a little more bitter then I prefer, but I assume that must be th characteristics of the Nelson Sauvin hops. Has a definitely tropical, grapefruit taste going for it."
"Very near perfect for my tastes. Eureka, Berkeley, CA"
"Poured a cloudy golden body with one finger of bubbly white head. Overall impression of appearance is of an excellent IPA, very true to style. Scents of tropical fruit, especially tart passion fruit, a vinous dry white wine character, hints of mango and underlying notes of tart citrus with hints of lemon most noticeable alongside light tangerine and light vegetal hop notes and spicy rye malt. Overall impression of aroma is of a very nice rye IPA that showcases the best of the Nelson Sauvin hops along with the character of the rye. Bright and fruity describes it best. Flavor begins hoppy with notes passion fruit, oniony, vegetal hops, dry white wine, slight citrus peel and some spicy rye malt backbone. Middle continues vegetal flavors with passion fruit fading into the background, spicy rye and spicy hop flavors providing depth, lightly floral flavors and moderate notes of citrus peel. Finish is hoppy and dry with notes of vegetal hops, grapefruit peel, spicy hops and spicy rye malt and some light tangerine. Aftertaste is vegetal hops, grapefruit peel, spicy rye malt and light pine resin. Overall impression of flavor is of an excellent Nelson Sauvin hopled rye IPA, bringing forth the best aspects of both flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a sticky, resinous feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of an excellent IPA, true to form. Overall this is an amazing IPA. It uses two of my favorite ingredients, rye and Nelson Sauvin hops to create a complex and rich IPA."
"22 oz bottle (drink by March, 2016) poured into Belgian ale glass"
"First time having this one. Poured into my Dogfish IPA glass. Golden and luscious, worthy of it's World-Class rating. A tad bitter which may be my only critique here but not significant enough for me to detract that much. A unique take which is pulled off very well. Must be due to the Nelson Sauvin hops."
"Hazy, vibrant and golden. Two finger white pillowy head. Smell is magnificent OJ/Mango, right up there with Heady and King Sue. Taste is pine and peppery. Bitterness is good. Lovely beer would definitely seek out again."
Pours hazed golden with a lasting thin head that leaves some lacing.
A - Pours a clear golden straw color with a small white head that settles quickly. 
L: Pours straw gold with a slight haze under a sticky 1” foam cap that quickly recedes to a thick film. 
L: Moderately hazy golden-straw with a white head and visible effervescence. A bit of lacing
"beer monger just got these for the holiday so I had to put in basket - pours a gorgeous golden orange deep hazy color with great foamy head that dissipates well smell is very tropical: ripe mangoes and clementines for a great citrus approach very little malt taste is taste you get that tropical taste and a definite rye background which i was surprised to be able to decipher taste continues to develop as the beer warms. feel is very appropriate for taste, holds it all together great carbonation level. overall a very good beer, would definitely get again."
Pours a hazy golden color with nice head and lacing. Nice citrus grapefruit smell. Taste is grapefruit up front but mellows as it finishes. The rye adds a nice touch. Smooth. I would definitely buy this again.
"L - Blond, cloudy, 1 finger of head and some slight lacing"
"pours a gorgeous golden hazy color with foamy head that dissipates moderately. smell is very tropical: mangoes, peaches, citrus, ripe everything. very little malt smell, maybe a sweet fruity one. taste is underwhelming when compared to smell. you get that tropical taste, but there are also grassy notes and a big rye background. maybe I'm just not a fan of rye. taste gets even more mild as the beer warms. mouthfeel is very appropriate for taste, holds it all together. overall a very good beer, would definitely get again, despite high prices for a bomber."
"22oz bomber poured into two stemless wine glasses (somewhere between a table-glass and a snifter). Pours an intensely hazy peach-straw color with a rapidly dissipating 1 finger white head leaving mild lacing with good moderate retention. Nose is dry piney hops and bright citrus fruits - lemon, orange, and kiwi. The palate opens with fruits very much in line with the nose: kiwi most prominently, with lemon undertones, which then give way to a strong hop body, with appropriately subtle rye notes. Rye so commonly overpowers the IPAs it inhabits, but in this case, it is a perfect companion, adding to the flavor and deepening the complexity, without dominating the palate. A not-insignificant malt presence is perceptible on the back-end of the palate. The mouthfeel is medium, chewy, with mild to moderate combination. Overall, an extraordinary IPA, with a phenomenal level of complexity, though the malt elements are perhaps more dominant than is fashionable in modern-day IPAs. The one-line assessment: a tremendously layered beer, well worth the purchase."
"Sooooo fucking good. Robust citrusy, grapefruit nose and taste. A beautiful warm cup of pee look when poured in a glass. A mildly foreboding Sauvignon acidity though it's very well complimented by the huge citrus flavor. I highly recommend this beer."
"Cloudy straw colored pour with a foamy white head. Huge citrusy aroma that has some notes of pineapple standing out. Taste is bright and juicy with tons of citrus (mango, grapefruit, pineapple, and orange all stand out) and a perfect balance of rye spice. Very bitter but not overpoweringly so. Rye takes over as the beer warms resulting in a bitter and spicy finish."
Bomber poured into pint glass
"A: Hazy, light golden orange in color, with a thin head."
"Poured a yellow/orangish color with one finger of foamy white head. Smell is citrus and pine all over leaving you to believe this will be a hop bomb. The taste is not as bitter as you'd think from the smell. You definitely get citrus, probably grapefruit, and a piney flavor followed by a little bitterness. All of this is smoothed out by the European malt like the label says. The mouthfeel is exactly what you'd want from an IPA, good carbonation with a slight creaminess. I love finding Alpine beers out here in Missouri, hopefully the trend continues."
"nose is juicy, tropical fruits. tons of mango, pineapple, juicy tropical fruit. amazing. carbonation is a little light for the style and the i would like it to be a bit crisper in the body. over all an amazing, beer. will definitely seek out again."
Another great beer from Alpine. Poured a lighter golden yellow color into my tulip glass. The nose more floral than citrus with a lingering pine nose. The taste is slightly bitter but lacking in tropical fruits or much of this nature. The taste complex to me more so than most IPA's are but I am enjoying it. A good beer I'll look forward to enjoying again.
"I would classify this beer in the category of ""great American IPAs that I don't really love."" While Green Flash's and Lagunitas' IPAs were the beers that turned me on to the style with their complex, juicy, yet gentle flavors, this one is more in the other direction. A hint of fruity flavors with a lot of bitter grapefruit basically drowning them all out, I'm not really sold on the Nelson Sauvin hop as an aromatic. Not a ton going on here, just a lot of bitter, rich hoppy resin. "
Bottle (Green Flash emblem is clearly shown) into a Belgain Tulip.
A real great tasting Rye IPA. Super smooth and easy to drink. No aftertaste to to stop you from wanting to have more. I'm glad I found the last two in the store. I recommend this beer if you happen by one.
22 oz bottle best by March 21 poured into an IPA glass. 
"Pours a hazy yellow color topped with a thick, soapy white head. Smell definitely has that Nelson stank going on...oily herbal greenness, berries, peppercorns, grass, apricot, and general fresh hop zestiness. Flavors of herbs, white wine, floral hops, peppery orange, and pineapple sweetness. Medium bodied with a lingering bitterness. Tasty stuff."
"This rye IPA is a pale gold, effervescent beer that straddles the no-man's-land between hazy and cloudy; a brief-lived, medium pebbly off-white head leaves good, somewhat complex bands of lacing. The nose is moderate in intensity: pineapple juice, pine, sweet florals and more subdued citrus notes with slight alcohol overtones and a hint of body odor. Up front, the palate presents as bitter pineapple, pine/floral soapiness and a nutty bittersweetness. By mid-palate, the citrus character shows a bit, as does the body odor from the nose; the bitterness builds to a medium-strong level, offset a bit by a modest bready malt presence (I don't really pick up any rye character). The finish is balanced and closes out with a decent carbonation bite, followed by the onset of a nice strong resinous hop bitterness that lingers quite awhile. Mouthfeel is big for the medium body, and the texture is slightly creamy and moderately peppery from the fizzy-yet-restrained carbonation. (22 oz bottle, 98 days before best-by)"
"Very unique Rye IPA that is now one of my new favorites! Pours a hazy golden/orange into a pint glass with a decent head and slight lacing retention as you drink this West Coast brew. The smell of this brew reminds me a Belgian style beer on the nose, but as you take a sip you quickly realize it's anything but a Belgian. This IPA style brew is packed with Nelson hops and is really an interesting and unique style and flavor profile as it's different than any other IPA type of beer I've tasted. Rye and Nelson hops are used in brewing and dry hopping double time!"
"From a fresh growler, pours a light orange-gold, slightly hazy and with a greenish tinge around the edges. Head is a solid 2 fingers, dense and white with very fine bubbles. Lasts a long time and never completely fades. Initial smell is dankness, mixed with an herbal spiciness. Also a bit of ripe fruit and something like sweet hay. Taste is spicy, earthy herbs. Finish is bitter grapefruit and lingering spice. Feel is an outstanding balance of pleasing smoothness offset by prickly carbonation. Killer IPA, very unique."
Poured from a Green Flash bottle.
A - Hazy gold body. Large white head. Moderate lacing. 
Poured from a growler into an IPA glass
"A-Orange, hazy, and not much visible carbonation. Head dissipates quickly."
This an outstanding rye IPA. Nice and hoppy and yummy. This is a top tier selection and I will actively seek out this brewer again. Hard to find locally here in Ohio.
"Hazy gold color. Moderate bar poured head, which leaves streaks and spots on the glass. "
22oz bottle poured into a globe.
"I'm hoping I just got a bad bottle. It looked gorgeous in the glass, smelled like I was in for an awesome hop bomb, and then I tasted it and it was nothing but burnt malt. No citrus, no hops. I was totally let down. Will seek out again and revise my review if the second go around is better. (should be noted it was in a green flash bottle)"
"I am, generally speaking, a good person. I don't liter, I treat my fellow man with respect and dignity, I call my parents regularly. But sometimes I say to myself ""If I became a ruthless dictator I could make the folks at Alpine open a brewery in my backyard."" I have been lucky enough to stage a few of their beers here in North Carolina and Nelson is the third of their beers that I have tried and each one has been extremely good. "
"Clean and fresh, full of dry citrus in the likes of grapefruit pith lightened by white grapes and wine. Ample carbonation doesn't undermine a taut feel and bittering grip on the tongue. A real nice IPA."
"Best by 04/20/16, Kudos for putting an easy to find date on the label."
A: Poured from the (Green Flash) bomber into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is clear golden yellow with a half-finger white head on top. Good lacing. 
"Best by date of April 16th, 2016"
A-pours a straw yellow with a dense bright white head that lasts forever and leaves some lacing
Green Flash bottle with a best by 4/20/16 into a snifter. 
"L- Hazy, unfiltered golden-yellow with hints of orange. A nice crown of head lasts for awhile showing frothy carb & steady lace."
Green Flash bottle best by 21 Mar 2016
"Pale straw color, slightly off white head dropped quickly. Aroma is predominantly melon and that funky wine-like/ gooseberry fruitiness that Nelson brings. Slight honey malt and pepper-like rye on nose. Flavor is that same melon/ white wine fruit, but amplified. Passion fruit and pithy grapefruit also come through. Hop bitterness is on high side but I dig it. Malt character is clean, dry and a peppery rye is very noticeable. It works well here and adds depth to the hop bomb. Very tasty."
"A - Hazy golden body, not much light through, with a full white head and lots of lacing."
"slightly over hopped, and overrated. Alpine is a nano-brewery and uses bottles from green flash to increase its distribution which is pretty cool. I was able to score some at Whole Foods in River Forest, which has developed an impressive beer selection."
"Exceptionally clear orange-straw color with a finger-and-a-half of white head and heavy lacing. Subtle floral aroma, with orange, peach, grapefruit and lemon peel in the background, definitely reminiscent of white wine, as advertised. The fruit carries over to the taste, perhaps more than balanced out by a stronger-than-expected hop bitterness and clear rye character in the malt. Medium bodied, slightly creamy with good carbonation. Very glad to have tried this one."
"Again, of the four Alpine beers to recently hit Atlanta thanks to the Green Flash relationship, I like this and Hoppy Birthday the best."
Appearance is a deep golden with a nice head 
ALPINE NELSON RYE IPA 11/22/15
Green Flash bottle. BB April 2016.
"Tastes like the syrupy mess than many west coast ipas are in Massachusetts. Really disappointing. Looks like a great modern ipa, byt tastes like sweet oxidized ipa. And this is on draft. I'm sure it's great fresh but I have no faith that I order is fresh now. Ugh."
"The rye overpowers the Nelson, this is unfortunate."
The look is definitely on the lighter side for an ipa. Smell was amazing floral aroma. Taste was just about perfect for an ipa. Can not say enough about how much I enjoyed this beer. Can't wait to try there other ipas. Seek this out.
"Outstanding beer. Surprised by the contrast between the aroma, which is all pine needles and pakalolo, and the pour which isn't cloudy or murky at all but rather golden with a light head. Taste is dank (but not sticky) and citrusy, but there's also a slightly smokey and herbal taste. Beautiful dry finish compliments the NZ hops very well. A real gem. At one point I would imagine this was considered very hoppy but in today's world of ever more hop-forward profiles Nelson actually feels more nuanced and subtle. Go figure."
22oz bomber poured into tulip glass:
"Didn't live up to the hype. Solid beer and a nice finish, but I had a Maine beer right after and it walked all over it."
The beer has a clear orange color. The aroma is spicy rye and citrus. The taste is rye and tropical fruits with medium bitterness. The rye character is very accurate. Definitely the most rye tasting IPA I've had. Goes well with the tropical fruit taste. Very good shelf beer in NC now that Green Flash is distributing it.
This review is in regards to Alpine's original gangster version and not the GF brewed bottles and or draft editions.
"Pours a hazy golden color with a 2 finger width foamy head. Head retention is very good. Lacing is excellent. Has a nice, fresh, juicy citrus aroma with some piney resin at the end. I wish there was cologne that smells like this! Taste is a big, juicy citrus bomb. Nice piney resin at the end. Moderate astringency. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. So glad this beer came to Texas and hope we get it in a 6 pack soon. This is great!!"
"Bottle. Finally. Perhaps my longest standing want. I've heard its not as good as it was before Green Flash but I don't know if I ever would have had the chance to try it without them. It pours clearer than I was expecting. Probably more filtered. Well structured, white head. Lacing is thick. The aroma brings my favorite hop right to my receptors. Tropical fruit, earth and flora. Some Sauv Blanc notes. Some dankness. A bit of sweetness too. Smells very nice. Love Nelson hops! The flavor starts off with a pronounced, coercive citrus flavor. A combination of several high-acid citrus fruits. Then the more terroir-driven hop flavors come out. Really vibrant hoppiness. Pot and earth and herb as well. Really damn tasty. Rye malt acts as a unique prop for the Nelson deliciousness. Rye tang combines with the unique hop zest. Its medium bodied and quite bitter. Still very drinkable. A morning juice substitute in a perfect world. Whether its different than it used to be or not, this is still an excellent beer. Finally got to scratch this one off the list; grateful."
Chill hazed yellow with a tall white head.
"This one is DANK. Tons and tons of fruitiness on the nose and the perfect balance of fruitiness and hoppiness on the drink with a nice white, clean head and good lacing."
"Wowsers. Yeah this one is great. Pours a cloudy light orange. Smell is all juicy citrus. Taste follows through and more. All citrus and bright clean bitter. Almost no malt to get in the way. This is my kinda IPA. Probably shoulda given this a 5, maybe I will update if I catch this again another time. Updated to add that the rye is also a plus. Joseph James Citra rye similarly kills it, so maybe ima sucker for rye malt"
"Bottle with bb date of March 2016 poured into a Teku. Look is a hazy light orange with lots of lacing. Smell is fantastic with dank earthy onion/garlic, grapefruit and tangerine. Taste follows suit with the nose and has a great earthy white wine flavor after the initial citrus. Can definetaly taste the rye too as a slight peppery malt finish. Feel is a tad thin but not bad for an IPA with medium carbonation and slick oily resin. If Green Flash brews aren't as good as the original Alpine, as I've read, the original Nelson must be killer cause this is pretty fantastic as is."
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bottle on November 13, 2015. Best by 21 Mar 16 printed on bottle. Look is golden, two finger head and lingering lacing. Smell is grapefruit. Taste is white wine and fruit. Feel is medium in body with a smooth finish."
"A bright gold that is color and foamy white head poured.smells of dank,mango,honey,crisp bell pepper....so much going on on the taste profile due to the rye and unique hops.honey,mango,bell pepper,black pepper a little bit of lime,a touch almost garlic funk. I'm giving the taste a 5 doesn't get too much better for a rye ipa,I'm definitely not one to just hand 5's out but lord it's a tasty,spicy,zesty ipa.mouthfeel isn't light,drinks like a big double ipa."
"delicious, but im not sure if im drinking the nelson of alpine lore, or the green flash version. either way, its pretty good. hazy orange in color. huge citrus nose. great flavor, nice backbone. mouthfeel really stands out for me. medium bodied with great carb. very nice."
"Worth the hype. Happened across this while on a trip to San Francisco - on tap at Hogwash. This is a stand out among IPAs. Beautifully cloudy orange color, dank fruity smell and a mouthful of citrusy hops with a hint of rye. Very drinkable... just wish I could get this in Chicago!"
A: This poured a nearly opaque gold with fluffy white head.
Poured into an IPA glass from a 22 oz bomber provided by snaotheus.
Very unique beer in all areas. Looks very hazy orange in the glass with excellent lacing. Smell is citrusy and unlike anything I've had. Very creamy mouth feel.
I'll skip the standard format and leave it at this.... this west coast ipa succeeds where every session ipa fails and you 
"This beer pours a very bright light golden color with a slight haze and a huge white head. Retention is good with nice lacing. The smell is amazing! Dankness and tropical fruits dominate with a slight sweetness and spicy notes. Taste is much the same with some grassiness and a decent amount of bitterness on the back end. Feel is very light, almost too light for my liking. Overall this is a great tasting beer though. Would definitely purchase again."
"Pours a pale gold, very bright. Mild haze. Head is off-white and voluminous. Head lasts forever and leaves a large amount of sticky lacing."
"Classic NZ hop aroma, fruity with some grassy notes. Pours a Hazy light orange color. Taste is a little strange to me though, something i can't really put my finger on. It might be the rye malt they use, but overall it's very drinkable and definitely alpine's best."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a chalice. Best by date of March 21, 2016."
2015-11-03
"L: an orange brown color, a nice white head. Not seeing the turbid look many said to expect"
Straight up mango bomb. Nearly perfect use of the Nelson Sauvin hop. I usually find that an IPA is best on the first sip; every subsequent sip is less tasty. That's not this case with this beer. Each sip is just as good as the last. I was sad when the bottle was empty.
"A: Big grape, white wine aroma from the Nelson Sauvin hops."
"Hazy, turbid burnt orange color, like a gem stone glowing in sunlight. "
Alpine Nelson
Simply special.
Green Flash version. Poured from 750ml(?) bottle into a standard pint glass.
Im not much of a hop guy but I found this beer extremely enjoyable. The hop aroma and flavor were very crisp and fresh and the taste was good without being over the top bitter.
11-9
"Bomber drink by 3/21/16. Pours pale and a bit hazy with a 1/2 finger head. Thin lacing down the sides. Nose is spicy and citrusy. Taste is like drinking grapefruit juice. There's also some smokiness on the back of the tongue, which is interesting. Finish is quite dry. The bitterness lingers. Feel is relatively light. Overall, a pretty good citrus forward IPA. However, I'd like to have a little more malt to balance the bitterness."
"L: cloudy, straw color, fluffy white head"
"Stunninging good! Pored from a Green Flash bomber with an Alpine label on it, love that! I'm a rye lover, and a Nelson Sauvin hop lover, so this beer is a speciality right up my alley. A beautiful burnt smokeness prevades. Going to make sure and get more of this West Coast premium classic."
Very devolving beer appearance wise. very light in color almost like a blonde but the taste packs a delicious bite of hopps. One of the best IPA's I've had. Super refreshing!
This beer is nectar of the Gods! So beautiful in the glass. I had heard a lot about Nelson and it lived up to the hype for me.Like Champagne in a glass. This is delicate and refined at the same time. One of the most well crafted beers I've tried.
"Enjoyed on tap at 2SP Newark, DE - pours a cloudy golden orange with white foam - minimal lacing. First taste was papaya and grapefruit - very juicy and delicious. As it warmed the malt backbone increased and masked the fruit a bit. Overall a nice brew."
On tap
"My favorite offering from Alpine. Always loved on draft and bottles, but this is with the Green Flash bottles. Best by date: 21 MAR 16F15284. "
"Best by 3/22/16. 22oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a very hazy and cloudy pale golden. Looks like juice. Creamy white head that fades leaving nice retention and nice lacing. The aromas are great. Very tropical. Lots of pineapple and ripe mango. Very fruity. Some fresh berries in the mix too. The flavors are very crisp and clean. Lots of leafy hop notes. Very floral and earthy. More pineapple. More berries. Hints of fresh pine. Hints of mint in the mix as well. The rye very present, especially in the finish. Dry stuff. Mouthfeel is great. It's medium-bodied with active carbonation. Very smooth and easy drinking. Very refreshing."
On tap; poured into a pint glass. 
"Slightly cloudy, light look; head medium, disappears quickly. Aroma of, what else, Nelson hops - trip fruits. Taste is top notch, no off anything, just pure WC IPA. Body just right at 7% ABV."
"1 pint 6 fl oz bottle poured into Founders snifter. Best by date March 21, 2016 "
The Holy Grale of San Diego craft beers in my opinion. One of my favorites.
"Pint bottle. Pours golden with finger head, good retention. Taste is classic west coast grapefruit hops with outstanding light malt sweetness balance. Finishes with a touch of peppery rye. Medium to thick mouthfeel, way soft and slippery. This brew is friggin delish, hoping bottles show up here eventually now that Alpine is under Green Flash."
Look - One of the most beautiful IPA's I've ever had the pleasure of pouring... Glowing golden in color with a medium amount of white head and lacing that sticks as you drink.
"L: very hazy pale, almost a cross between a wit and IPA in appearance. Thick fluffy head"
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color. Has a huge aroma bitter and sweet citrus peel with a hoppy backbone. Flavor is citrusy, bitter hops and pretty smooth. Leaves a nice aftertaste. Just a great delicious IPA"
"Pours a hazed very light golden with a full one finger white head atop.Big tropical fruits in the nose along with a bit of sweet onion wich is more prevalent on the pale,very fruit forward.That sweet onion I talked about comes into play upfront on the palate along with a bit of grass,some sweet caramel/biscuit malts as well.A very good beer but the sweet onion flavors seem to really take over the beer after awhile,again it's very good."
"Oh yeah, a hazy IPA - I always love that. The haze has an attractive consistency to it, too. But that's not what matters. What matters is how it smells and tastes. There are absolutely no problems with the former, as it brings a combination of grapefruit, lemon, pine, and white grapes. Malts serve to balance the nose almost perfectly, with just the right touches of sugar cookie and rye spice. Tasting it is a letdown...no, it's damn near on the same level of the incredible nose. It starts off with some touches of rye spice and dank pine, before evolving into pure. Friggen. Grapefruit. Malty touches serve to balance the beer while injecting a bit of welcome complexity. After a while, I even start picking up some white grape. The feel is strange (for an IPA), yet fantastic - thick and creamy at first, yet bone dry and even a touch sharp post-swallow. Drinkability is stunning. Alpine has become readily available in the DMV area, pinch me."
"Recommended to me even though I've never taken a particular liking to rye IPAs, I was assured this one is a must try. This is my second time having it and I must agree - fantastic beer! I'm not sure if Green Flash has altered the taste, as I have only tried the post-GF Nelson. That is what I'll be reviewing tonight"
"What can I say, this beer defies gravity or something equally impressive. First off, it looks remarkable with this great Hefeweizen colored body under text book quality stark white lacing and calm, persistent, dense head."
Re-review - I did not change my old rating with this new review as the original rating was based on an Alpine produced beer on tap versus a Green Flash produced beer from a bottle.
"I'm enjoying a bomber of this bought here in the Bay Area. Haters be damned, GF has expanded access to something I would not have been able to try unless I made a trip to San Diego. L: Cloudy yellowish -amber. Huge creamy head. S: amazing. Earthy hops, slight rye, lemon spice. T: incomprehensible balance of bitter and earthy hops, rye spice, lemon and grassy flavors. F: super rich for a single IPA. Very impressive. O: Fcking great. I can't imagine the source beer improving on this bottle, but hey if it's even more fantastic than this...whatever I'm not visiting Alpine. I'll certainly buy more of these bottles though. Even at $8.99."
On tap at brewery.
"This is by far one of the best IPAs ive ever had. Pours a beautiful thick and creamy yellow into a sniffer with 1/2 in of white cloudy head. The lacing is soild and stays around. The smell of Pine and citrus fills the nose as if i stepped outta a cabin in the woods. This beer puts me in a whole other world when i drink it. And the taste... hoppy, citra, earthy and woodie. Overall amazing taste! This beer has you feeling as if your in the cabins walking out to take on the day, with the smell of pines everywhere and last nights camp fire still on your closes. This is one i will definitely be picking up again when i make it down to Alpine Beer co again."
"Yellow straw in color. Massively hazy with a fingernail of eggshell around the rim. The aroma is tropical fruit with notes of mango and passion fruit. I love the taste in that the earthy rye blends seamlessly with the tropical hops. The mouth is slightly sticky, chewy, and crisp."
"On tap at the Beer Trappe. 12 oz., served in a tulip. Gorgeous golden, hazy tellow, like some tropical fruit juice. Smell is laden with surprisingly defined hop flavors of passion fruit, mango, lemon, grapefruit, and kumwuats, plus notes of grass and herbs on the back. Taste is very assertively hoppy: almost astringent kumquat- and grapefruit-rind up front, followed by lemon, passionfruit, mango, pine, tarragon, grass, all underpinned by a lightly-spicy, slightly sweet flavor from the golden-rye malt. Finish is dry, heavy on citrus-rind and mango. Mouthful is a bit light, perhaps the only criticism I have of this beer, but overall it's still a fantastic brew."
A kind and generous coworker brought this back from their beercation in San Diego
Pours a straw color with a puffy head which settles into the beer. Light hoppy flavor with citrus. Nice medium bodied mouthfeel with a citrusy and light bitter finish.
"A — Pours a coppery orange hue into the glass. Very nicely pours with a puffy khaki colored head. Though it doesn't stick around long, the head settles and leaves some nice lacing behind it and is quite consistent."
"This review is based on a 22oz bomber purchased from brewery and bottled one week prior to drinking. If you want to know what Nelson is supposed to taste like, this is the only clear cut way to do so at this point and time."
"Nelson Sauvin is one of my favorite hops, as you can tel by my avatar. I was looking forward to trying Alpine Nelson for quite some time. I finally got a couple of fresh bottles in a trade and I have to say, I was a bit let down. It must be that I am spoiled living here in New England, but it does not stack up to the heavy hitters over here. 5 years ago this was considered world class. Today, not so much."
"On-tap and apparently a keg from Alpine, not Green Flash."
On draft. Falling Rock Tap House in Denver.
"Poured on-tap in a tulip, the beer is a hazy, bright, golden orange color with a fluffy, clingy, off white head. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, apricot, and melon, all blending and balancing with a grassy and piney hops character. Very balanced. The flavors are tart and sweet forward, with a blend of grapefruit, melon, and passion fruit. Hops notes come in midpalate, providing notes of bitterness, subtle herbal and floral notes, and some dank, vegetal highlights. Smooth, robust bodied, with a dry edge and an aftertaste heavy on resinous hops profiles, bitter and green.The finish has a decent resinous linger, over a smooth, dry feel. Good beer."
"I have to say that if the stories are true about Nelson beeing not quite what it used to be since the Green Flash aquistion, I need myself a time machine to get back a year or so and try the original, because this was still pretty good. Yellowish staw color, just a tinge murky, with a finger of foam that stuck around a bit. The aroma is a nice blend of tropical and stone fruit; pear, mango, nectarine, grape, rounded out with an incredible floral quality. The taste is incredibly piney along with more of the aforementioned fruit flavors. Very rich mouthfeel for an IPA. Glad Alpine found its way out east!"
Amazing IPA with great flavor one of my favorites.
Served on draft.
"Pours a hazy dark straw color with well over a finger of head. As the head dissipated, it left rings behind on the mug. The hoppiness on the nose is potent, the malt backbone is solid and the hop bitter finish rivals some of the best DIPAs. There is also a sweet citrus fruit note on the finish that complements the hop bitterness."
"Light golden in color with just a bit of haze. Nice crisp floral notes to nose, maybe some grapefruit. Has a bit of spice to it, someone mentioned white pepper which I think is spot on. Mouthfee is crisp and so dry it feels almost powdery on the tounge."
Diacetyl
So worth doing. Very spiced a every delicious. Worth thetrip for this beer. Hope for days and so much fruity character. Not very dry. The sweetness makes it better because it isn't very bitter.
Very nice -
"Bright, brisk, clean finish"
Mini-review: on tap at Valhalla in NYC.
Amazing hop aromatic on this beer. This beer is perfect. First sip brings an onslaught of Nelson hops and fresh grape juice. The beer settles out with some mid mouth bitterness. The backend of this beer is perfect! It leaves you with the perfect bittersweet taste to make you reach for another drink. WOW!
The perfect ipa
On tap:
"Probably the best IPA you can find in San Diego and definitely one of the best in the west. No I'm not talking about the so-called ""Nelson"" which Green Flash produces and taste nothing like the OG. I'm talking about the OG hoppy citrusy masterpiece from the Alpine Beer Co."
This Alpine beer actually lives up to the hype!!!
"Best Nelson beer I've had so far. The combination of the rye gives beer an awesome slightly spicy bite. Just an explosion of nelson across the palate. My favorite beer from Alpine so far. If you like Nelson, this is a must try!!!"
I like the wine-like characteristics of this hop accompanied by flora aromas. Not the best IPA I've ever had but definitely unique in an IPA focused market.
"This beer has an amazing aroma. The taste is very smooth, fruity, and citrusy with a wonderful finish. This beer reminds me a great deal of Yellow Rose."
"Had this one right at Stone in San Diego, and it stood up well to their beers--which is the best compliment I can give a beer!"
"22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass, approx 4 weeks old"
Bomber bottle poured into a snifter tasting glass.
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
This is a review for bottled Nelson
I am not a fan of onion in my IPA's.
650 ml bottle poured into a Russian River stemmed glass
"On tap at City Tap House Logan in Philly. Served in your basic pint glass. Very little character from the servers, which reflected on my love of this beer. I've had other Alpine's and LOVED them! Again, environment has a lot to do with perceived taste. I hope to have another somewhere else so I can edit my review."
Nelson pours a really nice golden color with a fluffy head. Head reduces quickly but holds on for dear life leaving an eighth of an inch of smallish bubbles on top.
"As far as single West Coast IPAs go, this one is hard to beat. Very unique and enjoyable flavor profile. If you can get it fresh (and this one does not sit on shelves long, so if you see it it's probably fresh!), it's definitely worth drinking."
This is an excellent IPA.
Mostly rated this on the fact that I am not a fan of the Nelson hop. Still a quality made beer though
A - Pours a hazy golden orange with a two-finger white head. Tons of soapy lacing.
"650ml bottle poured into tulip a ways back, (from notes), I can't thank Rutager enough for the major want"
"Yes to this! Nelson pours a golden-straw color with a sharp citrusy hop aroma. It’s bitter and drying at the end, and I couldn’t get enough of it. (Yes, it’s a highly hyped beer and yes, it lived up to that hype.) I want another."
"I had this on draft in Chicago shortly after they entered the market. I thought it was OK, but very unbalanced. I was pretty dissapointed after seeing a really high BA score. I hope I just had a bad batch."
"What can I say. As I sat and enjoyed my pint of Neslon I couldn't get the grin off of my face. Light, slightly peppery malt backbone with a dry finish (just a little bit of sweetness), allows for a perfect canvas for the Nelson Sauvin hops to come alive. Big tropical notes, and the expected 'white wine' notes in the background. This lived up to the Alpine hype that I have been hearing for so long. One of the highlight beers of my SD trip."
Reminds me of Columbus brewing company bodhi will have to do a side by side
"Big bitter notes, with a slight sweet finish. Floral notes, with grapefruit."
This beer nails it. 
"Nice, light, tasty, crisp and refreshing ipa. Pours a light golden yellow with earthy aromas and flavors. I'll have to give this another go around because I'm not too impressed with this highly regarded ipa. Happy to see these Alpine beers showing up in my area thanks to the Green Flash acquisition so hopefully I'll have another pint soon enough."
Had on tap at house of 1000 beers on 5-30-15
"Very grassy hoppy beer, this Nelson. Earthy bitterness. Consistent delivery. Easy to drink. Not sure how this compares to the original production (pre Green Flash). But what's happening now is pretty nice."
On tap
Just had this beer in a flight of 4 5oz IPA's and hands down the best of the bunch! Amazing balance from the nose to the mouth feel such a beautiful beer! Thanks Three Sheets in Dublin Ca.
Pours a finger of head on a light straw body.
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden/yellow color ale with a large foamy head with excellent retention and some really good lacing. Aroma of floral hops of mango, Sauvignon and papaya is just ab out perfect. Taste is also dominated by loads of fresh floral hoppy notes of mango, papaya and Sauvignon. Light residual sugar notes can also be detected and bitterness is very minimal. Body is about average with good carbonation. Can’s say I really tasted the rye malt so much but the hops flavours are just about perfect."
Not as good as Duet. Not bad. Just ok
10 oz pour on-tap into a stemmed tulip.
"Short Review. I've been wanting to try something from Alpine for a little while now and it seems like their beers just started showing up on tap. This is pretty nice, but it's not as good as I was expecting and it had some green onion hop aspects that held it back in the end, but i did like the fruity aspects in the hop profile and the mouthfeel was pretty good. I would like to try a super fresh bottle of this. It's pretty nice, but I don't think it's a stand out for the style."
One of my new favorite beers. Great ipa
Served On-Tap
"very tasty IPA. Similar to lawsons KIWI, more citrusy then piney. Highly recommended!!"
"Appearance - Contrary to everything I've read about this beer previously, my glass does not contain a hazy, orange-juice-esque beer. In fact, it is pretty clear and light, with slow trickles of carbonation filling the glass. This isn't to say that it isn't nice looking, but sort of unexpected since the appearance is usually one of the defining characteristics of Nelson. A bone white head sits atop the liquid and lasts throughout the glass."
oh man.. Dank-est beer I have ever had.. big time west coast hops...
"Hoppy, cloudy. I don't discern any citrus. Excellent beer"
one of the best beers I've ever had
"I have had this beer on several occasions. I thought it was much better tasting when Alpine brewed it versus Green Flash. I would love to see Green Flash replicate what Alpine did. If GF ever achieves that feat, I will be grabbing a few more of these bottles."
"Had on tap at HopCat East Lansing....tapped 2 days prior for an Alpine Dinner, was very solid...not as fruity as I was expecting but enjoyed it none the less.....lived up to its expectation....other than the 9 dollar per 12oz pour lol"
22 oz bottle poured into Speigelau glass
"The Alpine hype train finally hit Bellingham. Been looking forward for trying these SoCal legends for a long time. This one didn't push my buttons. Just a solid, good, enjoyable IPA, nothing less, nothing more."
"A: Burnt orange, cloudy, two fingers of white head."
Would be difficult to say that there is a better IPA that I've tried.
"To me, Alpine Nelson > Pliny the Younger .. so drinkable and so flavorful."
Had on tap at Pint Defiance in Tacoma WA. Impressed they got this stuff in the area.
"Love me some Nelson! And it's cool to see it with rye, in this instance mellow, but an often rather harsh malt. So much hype, rad to finally have one at back country in boulder. Pour is a really light pale golden color with an opaque orange lowlight and a lasting inch of airy white bubbles. Smells like Nelson alright, although somewhat less pungent and fresh than anticipated, and especially mellow for a top 250 IPA. The flavor is more dynamic than the nose, but also underwhelming. As good as it is, and it is real good, I wanted more from the hops. The rye is a real nice twist and can be both tasted and felt, but this lends credence to my theory that it's near impossible to make a bad beer with this hop. It just doesn't pip pineapple like others, and with such a no bull name, I thought this would be the loudest Nelson statement of all time, and it's not. It's freakishly dry though, so hops and rye do stand out, and there isn't much of a yeast profile happening at all. Carbonation is really lively, and I don't mean to belittle this because it is amazing, and a real nice use of one of my favorite hops, but it just doesn't stand out far enough from the heard to be labeled one if the best IPAs ever, at least in my opinion."
"I'm having a Nicholas Cage moment in Leaving Las Vegas. While I'm not on a bender destined to succumb myself in alcohol poisoning, each sip of this magnificent beer has me calling out for a nurse. I'm worried my neighbors may think I've gone mad. I don't even know where to begin, it's so unbelievable. First off, the pour on Nelson is beyond reproach; only rivaled by Heady Topper. Brilliant orange, super cloudy, spotty lacing. Very excellent head retention. The nose has hints of white wine from the use of Nelson Sauvin hops, and is backed by tons of citrus. Taste follows with grapefruit and pineapple. So freaking balanced I can barely stand it, as if that isn't an oxymoron in itself. The mouthfeel is creamy as ever, and I can't stop smacking my lips. I never thought I would enjoy a rye IPA so much. This is a world-class, must try beer, especially for people like me, who primarily drink IPAs. Those who have access to this on a regular basis should consider themselves extremely lucky. Hard to find a flaw. JUST WOW!"
A great Rye IPA. Alpine has always been dedicated to the craft.
Smooth easy drinking ipa a good after taste
It was good. The Col.
"AP: Deep straw, fairly lively carbonation, big bubbled, continuous 1/8"" white head. Sticky lace, very slight haze."
"Another one of my biggest and oldest wants from the man, Joseph. Cheers buddy!!! So stoked to finally try this."
A: hazy yellow. Poured on tap. Not much head
"First had on tap, which I've been told is not as good since GF botched the process. Bought a bomber and whaddya know, big ole Green Flash symbol on it too. Oh, well. Best by March 21, 2016. "
Higgggh five Beer is good
"Slightly hazy golden straw color. Fairly thin white head but nice lacing. Nice big aromas - tropical fruit, grape, orange, and a little earth. Citrus taste with orange, tangerine, pineapple, white grape and some spicy rye malt. Pleasantly bitter and a clean finish. Medium-bodied. A great IPA."
"Ahhh the hazy color I love (just say no to clear beers!).... crisp hoppy goodness, a little pine and citrus, just enough malt to balance, mild bitter finish... love it... toss up between double citra and this for my left coast favorite!"
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Acquired as an extra in a trade with Rishi, thank you sir!"
"Not quite as good as Duet, but man, if you were drinking this all night, you'd be very, very happy."
Nice taste and dry rye finish. Nice color and hits the spot. Taste stays with you after your done. Well done
O m f g so good
Appearance: pours a beautiful yellow orange. White fluffy head and tons of lacing.
Duet is much much better.
the look is a hazy yellow unfiltered look. initial smell is very fruity and citrusy. Initial taste is very sweet and a hint of spicy. the taste is kind f like second fiddle but with a more sweeter mouthfeel.
Had it for the first time on draft at my buddies place (Strangers in El Centro) did indeed taste different from the Nelson 's of Alpine. Still an easy citrusy drink to have very good. Hopefully green flash can close the gap and make it a world class beer.
Excellent complex IPA.
"Poured a cloudy orange body with one finger head and lace patches on top of an aroma that is both citric and grapefruit hop infused along with some spices and possible touch of citric acidity and sourness (I assume the Nelson). Medium bodied, rather a more grape/tropical fruit like sweetness but balanced with both dry hoppiness and dry, bold malts (I assume this is the rye). A really enjoyable IPA that doesn't fit the norm and has a little bit of everything."
"We pop a bomber, pouring into our Great Lakes pints. It glows a buffy, wheaty shade of yellow, and holds a reasonable one and a half finger tall head of tight, soapy white foam. This retains well, descending softly into peaked sheets of lacing around our glasses. A definite haze reduces clarity, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be sharp and active. The aroma is delicious, even when ice cold. Warmth really allows it to blossom, giving bright Nelson Sauvin earthy, citric, and nectary fruity zestiness, white wine grapey vine and sugars, daisy blossoms, earthen mineral and metallic grit of toasty rye grain, dry cornflakes, vanilla bean coolness, sweaty pale malts, sunscreen and aloe chemical bite, peach and kiwi fruitiness, sweet bubblegum esters, ethanol airs, soft but sweet plastics, leafy basil resins, lavender wax, and dehydrated strawberry and raspberry leather. As with the aroma, you really get a nice tour of the showcased ingredients: rye and Nelson Sauvin hops. Notes include bitter grapefruity oiliness and nectary fruity sweetness of said hops, lemon zest and rind, mustard seeds, jasmine extract, creamy and buttery pale maltiness, toasty rye grain grit, concrete dust and clayed minerals, raw salted popcorn kernels, white pepper spice, hollow pine wash, musty daffodil florals, and mildly fusel booze. The body is medium to a bit full and chalky for the style, but so, so soft and gluggable. Carbonation is the same, contributing nicely to a foaminess and frothy creaminess that coats the mouth. Slurp and smack are what you would expect follow such a description; they are excellent. The mouth is eventually left pulled a bit tightly of puck, but only at the extreme back of the tongue and palate. The abv is appropriate, and drinkability is phenomenal."
"Had on draft. Corroborating those who have complained about the kegs brewed at Green Flash not being spectacular. The nose was weak, was not overwhelmed by the taste (muted citrus IPA). This was one of the weaker showings of Nelson hops I've ever had. 3.5 - above average, not special."
"Received this one on a trade. Just in time to try to drink on a cold snowy night. I don't know why but I felt this strong compulsion to put on Pet Sounds, by the Beach Boys. Hmmm..."
"On tap at Simzy’s LB poured into footed stange. Hazy golden body with a thin white head that settles to a thin ring. Lace rings. Aroma is piney, with grape skin, herbs, rye spice, citrus, and grass. Taste is initially dank and musty with moderate bitterness featuring the same flavors as the nose. Some malt and tropical fruit sweetness comes through. Rye spiciness hits on the swallow. Medium body, thin texture, moderate carbonation, and a dry bitter finish."
"Pours fine, with a clear dull-yellow color, smells fine, with subtle citrus and grass notes. But where’s the taste? I’ve had this a couple different times to make sure that I wasn’t getting a bad batch...and it’s been the same. It’s very bland, and despite that, is somehow difficult and rough to drink with an uneven mouthfeel. The rye in this beer is not its friend."
"Look- Bright, clear copper color, pours two fingers of sticky white head that retains very well."
Alpine Nelson is just so damn good!
"My favorite TG IPA is Zeelander, and was really looking forward to this. Nose was awesome, but taste and finish were an abrupt Malty/Rye insult, and not as I had hoped. Still a decent beer."
"Bottle generously shared today Isaac, thanks dude."
Another great Alpine offering!! Pales only in comparison to EXP Hoppiness and Duet!
This is the best Nelson hop beer ever made. Can't get enough of this
"Ah, Nelson, you fickle temptress, at times a very good beer, at times a stellar beer. When on, the tropical Nelson notes marry with the rye and a surprising lightness of body to create something truly special."
Fantastically original IPA. Don't hesitate if you see it anywhere.
"Sampled on tap at Craft and Commerce in SD. Pours a bright, yet hazy, straw color with 1/2 inch of fine bubbled head that stood up well into the beer. Nose is dominated by slightly tart citrus notes and pine with biscuity malt backing. The taste is more malt than the nose would lead one to believe but the balance was beautiful as the tart citrus flavor was wonderful. Creamy mouth feel. Love this beer - the hype is well deserved."
"Hazy amber. Cantalope, grapefruit, star fruit, sticky hop. Surprisingly resiny, not a long finish. Decent"
Epic west coast ipa that I had the pleasure of enjoying 8 days fresh out of a bomber. 
"This beer is amazing! Depending upon your location this is probably more difficult to get your hands on than Pliny or Heady. Drank fresh at Alpine on draft and brought back a couple of bottles. Don't be fooled by the cloudy pour or hoppy smell, this is one easy to drink beer!"
"A: Pours slightly cloudy, pale orange/yellow (tangerine) with a thin fizzy white head that dissipates quickly leaving bubbly white lacing."
"On tap at The Local Peasant, in Woodland Hills, CA. Poured into a smaller than usual Nonic glass."
"Very good IPA, nelson hops. Citrus notes and well balanced leading to a good finish."
"What an odd looking beer. Not sure if this is typical, but the beer appears to have a slight green hue. Fortunately it smells great, lots of citrus. Taste is a notch below the smell, but still a high quality IPA, wasn't wowed by it based on Alpine hype. Would happily drink this again, but don't plan to seek it out."
On tap in the brew pub and multiple bottle.
"The color is a lurid orange, and it pours a bit on the cloudy side. The foamy pour settles down into a pretty light head quickly. The lacing it leaves behind its minimal."
"From a 22oz bottle: Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a creamy white head. Tons of thick lacing coats the glass. I've had Nelson that looks as cloudy as orange juice and as clear as a macro lager. This one is quite hazy, but not quite as much as I've seen. Smell is truly unique. Grape, grass, weed, and some tropical fruit and citrus. Taste is just bursting with tropical fruit, grapefruit, earthiness, grass, weed, and grape. Very very little bitterness. Just a touch of spiciness from the rye. This beer is all about the hop aroma and flavor. Mouthfeel is awesome. Like no other IPA. The rye lends so much smoothness to the body. It's like silk. I've even described this beer as Nelson Sauvin milk before. It's that smooth and creamy. Overall, in a class of its own. There are very very few IPAs like this. Only something like Noble Nelson Showers compares (which I thought was even better). If you can get a bottle, go for it. If you've never had it and it's on tap (Green Flash brewed), try it out too, but it's much better out of the bottle."
"This is the best IPA I've ever had. Smooth, complex and refreshing. Reminds me of drinking a refreshing frothy glass of orange juice with all the complexities of an IPA. Yes. It is that good."
exceeded hype
"Had this fresh for the first time yesterday, it is truly one of the best IPAs I've ever had the privilege to drink!!"
Thanks David. I may move to SD for the sole purpose of drinking bombers of this beer on the regular.
Look: Crystal clear straw gold with a thick white head. Good lacing and lots of legs. 
Bottle poured into snifter.
My favorite IPA from Alpine
So often these over hyped beers end up being a let down...not this one. This may very well be the best single IPA I've ever had. Nelson is at the forefront of this brew. It is incredibly smooth and balanced. Very easy drinking with its light body. Smell is fantastic. Color is a nice golden hue. Fantastic beer.
"sampled on draft at toronado, san francisco on 9-10. "
"Love the rye in this. Pours a golden hue, hazy, dissipating head. Get a very grainy, malty, rye nose with the predominant hop profile of nelson. Flavor follows suit. Malty, rye with great hop flavor. Not lingering, not overly bitter. Quintessential drinking ipa. Wish I could get this every day."
"such an awesome beer! orange danky looks, hazy unfiltered look. Smells like heaven- juice pineapple/guava/nectarine nectar oozes into your nose, enjoy that right there. Taste is on point! I don't think the ""Green Flash effect"" has really changed this beer, still a monster, still a favorite. this thing is off the chain! Mouthfeel is fluffy and soft, ends with a nice bitter bite but its not nearly the bit I'm used to with these NM IPAs I'm used to. just a great beer, this is way too good to be so available, I'll be buy them by the case from now on!"
On draft at City Beer Store in San Francisco
Bottle pour.......
3 week old bottle from the brewery in Alpine. 
Reviewed from notes:
"Review from notes I texted myself, on tap earlier today at Mellow Fellow in King's Beach"
"Alpine has just started distributing their kegs and I have been lucky enough to be in LA and a frequent customer to the bars where they get Alpine's stuff. This Rye IPA has a very unique hazy and golden color, not typical of other Rye IPAs I've had (Hop Rod, Ruthless). The smell is on point, I can't think of a better nose to a beer that I've ever had (Pliny is up there though). This sets you up for an unbelievable palate pleaser. Very very drinkable (got me into some fun last night) and not something you can burn out on. If you can get your hands on this, it's an unforgettable beer. A top 5 IPA for sure."
"A=deep orange, hazy, not a lot of light getting through"
"A: Pours very yellow with a slight golden hue to it, was quite surprised with the color of this IPA, it looks more like a blonde ale, but it still looks good. "
"After drinking this beer for more than a decade, I have finally come around to rating this fine brew."
Poured into a snifter.
Appearance is a hazy yellow color with a oneffinger white head.
"Great citrus-y smell and taste to match, smooth yet dank, clean taste"
"What can I say that hasnt been said already, this brew is so well balanced and full of amazing grapefruit aroma and amazing clean citrus taste that it lives up to all the hype."
On tap at the brewpub in Alpine. 
Poured from bomber into a tulip glass. 
"Purchased very fresh from alpine beer co. Pours a hazy orange color with some faint sediment. Looks like watered down orange juice. The smell is incredible. Beautiful representation of nelson and it's earthy, fruity, dank hop character. The taste is where the rye comes in subtly but enough and provides an incredible companion for the so stickiness of nelson hops. Such a balanced easy drinking but full flavored brew. One of my favorites. Top 3"
"Big props to Raulazzer for making this happen. Been seeking this for a while, and I'm fresh off tasting Father Nelson from LCBC to compare."
"Appearance is a bright, but cloudy sun golden yellow that pours a lemon shaving colored head."
"A 4.25: Hazy, but a pretty orange golden color. Pours a largish off-white head. "
Serving Type- On tap poured into a 13oz tulip glass
"On draft at Toronado, San Francisco."
22oz bottle from zrab11 (sweet freakin extra!). No dicernable bottling info. Served in a Cigar City teku.
My first 5 beer-cannot imagine anything better
"Had this side-by-side with Mother Earth's Boo Koo, and I think I actually liked that one a little better."
"Boldly spicy and hopped, just as it should be. It's a simple recipe w/ a fresh and small batch mentality, just as it should be. The rye is more of a perfect compliment but the Nelson is the star of the show, just as it should be. Stop by the small but mighty brewery when in SoCal, Scott is your man. I recommend tasting ALL the IPA's and and grabbing your favorite...OR ALL OF THEM! Great BBQ and music too."
"A - Hazy, light pale/straw with 2"" of white head. Great retention (like a half inch of fluffy white snow) and great lacing."
"A: pours a orange yellow color, cloudy, finger worth of head"
"Overall this beer was awesome small hints of alcohol but not overpowering! It pours a cloudy golden orange with a white head. Lots of hops and pines in the aroma. The taste is fruity with hints of pineapple, peaches and citrus. The aftertaste is strong and dry."
"Appearance: Hazy yellow, good lacing. "
pours cloudy yellow with hazy flavor particles.
"I had this new Alpine Nelson that was contract brewed at Greenflash on tap. Nelson was probably my favorite beer and I've written beergasm reviews of it but this new collaboration needs to be tweaked. The beer was exceptionally cloudy with a chewy mouthfeel. It lost it 'brightness' and extraordinary deliciousness. While the Nelson hops were there, if I had this beer for the first time, I wouldn't order it again :( I hope they fix it."
Had on draft at Alpine on 4/2/14
Bottle poured into an IPA glass
poured 22oz bottle into snifter.
poured from 22 oz bottle purchased a week ago from alpine brewery to a ballast point tulip
"L: Light pale and straw in color. Strong and this pillow like foamy head, lingers quite a bit as well. Slight haze."
Amazing and unique rye ipa. cloudy orange /yellow look and a crisp and clean taste. This is my favorite easy to get ipa and I woul d make any drive to get it
"Mar 16 2016 on the bottle. Super, super cloudy. Every other element is how I remember it to be."
"This is my second Alpine beer, Pure Hopiness being the first. PH was very good. Let's see if Nelson lives up to the hype. Thanks to Sebowski for the trade."
"Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Surprisingly light yellow/orange color (thought it might be more cloudy & orange, based on smell). Relatively thin fluffy white head, which dissipated somewhat quickly. Lots of tiny bubbles, and good/sticky/even lacing throughout the quaff. On the nose, strong pine dominates over grapefruit/orange citrus notes. There is a distinct dankiness to the nose, which becomes all the more prominent upon first sip. As the beer settles and warms, the beer becomes more hoppy/piney/dank and less floral/citrusy on the palette, which is fine by me (that's how I like them, although a little more balance would be preferred here). Mouthfeel is full and coating. Alcohol burn is subdued until final points of the finish. All in all, I liked this very much. A very good example of West Coast style (reminds me a little of Sucks in that regard). Duet is better, but Nelson is a close second. Nice work, Alpine!"
"Nelson, to me, is easily one of the best IPA's I've ever had. I'm a big hop head who loves hop-forward beers. Not only is this beer incredibly well balanced, its fruity characteristics give it that respectable nudge into the elites. "
"This beer looks stunning, like liquid sunshine in the glass. The nose is sumptuous with Sticky citrus notes of tangerine and grapefruit. The rye adds a dry backbone that is perfect complement to the juicy, tropical sweetness of the hops. This beer is perfectly integrated and balanced. As good as IPAs get. This is a treat."
Review #400... and man a good one to review...
"Appearance: Pours a somewhat hazy straw color, with about 1/2"" of white head that has decent retention and lacing. Not a bad looking beer, but it does not have quite the clarity that I have seen in other Alpine IPAs. "
"The color comes in a surprisingly bright hazy lemon yellow with a 2 finger white fluffy head. Almost looks like a wheat ale because of the haziness and yellow, almost like yellow Gatorade color."
Type: Draft
pours a pretty somewhat murky gold with silky/silvery white head
"Doopie brought out a Nelson, Duet and a Pure Hoppiness a while back. Cheers man! "
Appearance- Received with about half a finger's worth of head. The head is a pure cotton white while the body is a pale amber which appears as a dull straw when held up to the light. Head dissipates rather quickly. Lacing is minimal. 
"Happy to have tried this beer. Pour was nice and clean with a golden orange color. Smell was hop forward with some citrus orange and grapefruit. Taste was like the smell but lacking a little on the citrus flavors, nice and bitter with good carbonation. Mouthfeel was smooth but not something that left me craving more with each swig. After drinking this side by side with Duet, I felt like this was a bit lacking. All in all, great beer from Alpine and will likely try it again if I get the chance."
"This beer poured a delicate and brilliant gold with a faint orange hue when held to the light in the room. When held to natural light it is all golden yellow and with a faint greenish presence. Head is cottony, white, and fell slowly leaving spectacular and decorative lace. "
"Bottle in trade from a generous dude. Thanks! Pours a beautifully clear light golden color with big fluffy white two finger head. Massive aromatics coming from this, with grapefruits, sweet honey, flowers, more citrus, some creamy sweet wine like aroma as well. Not like anything I have smelled. Flavor begins with a light sweetness on the tongue, and explodes into raw hops, grassy, grapefruit, honey, melons. A nice bitter pine on the way down. The flavor has a pleasant creamy mouthfeel, with sweet honey and big juicy hops. So light on the palate, with medium high carbonation. Up there with the best of them, especially in the single IPA category."
Huge thanks to drbenzo for this one
Appearance: Light hazy orange color with some yellow as well. Good lacing. Small head hangs around.
Thanks to eyebereej for sending this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from a bomber into a Cigar City pint glass.
"Had this beer on tap at Alpine. I really enjoy going there. Not fancy - just down to earth with good people, food, and beer."
"Pours pale straw colored gold, foamy head settles to a comfortable pillow of fluff on the surface, tight lacing. Nose is cantaloupe, grapefruit, passion fruit, and pineapple hoppy aromatics, more pine as this warms, with spicy caramel malt in the finish. Taste is light melon, grapefruit and heavy pine, strong bitterness with a softer finish, light caramel malts and rye spice. Bright palate, mouthfeel remains light, very drinkable."
Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into an Allagash cervoise glass.
"Awesome white foamy head. Fluffy white head has great retention and nearly perfect lacing. Brew is light orange with lots of light yellows, moderately clear. "
Major fail for no bottle date.
"Bright, pale yellow - lemon-colored. Despite the bright appearance, it's thick and pulpy, almost completely opaque. One finger of perfectly white head, quickly fading, leaving nice lacing."
"Received as an extra in a trade, Thanks lookrider!"
Picked up a bottle fresh from brewery. 
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Marin Brewing pint glass. Bought at the brewery last week, so no more than 2 weeks old."
This beer has a nice golden look to it once its in the pint glass.
Huge thanks to ehammond1 for sending a bottle of this my way...
Thanks @tauroe for sharing this gem with me. 
"Bottle thanks to ehammond1, poured into a 3F stem. Thanks Eric!"
"Got in a trade with TopsecretWaffle. 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but was traded fresh. Pours moderately hazy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big mango, passion-fruit, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, grass, light pine, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of tropical/citrus hop notes with a fair amount of malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big mango, passion-fruit, peach, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, passion-fruit, peach, pineapple, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, grass, light honey, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance and complexity of bright tropical/citrus hop notes with light-moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible IPA! Fantastic balance and complexity of tropical and bright citrus hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
7/23/13 Poured from 22oz bottle into pint glass.
"Wow, thanks Chris!"
Very unique IPA. Bright yellow/gold body with a fizzy white head. Tropical fruit and freshly mown grass on the nose really pop. The taste is balanced with bitterness and sweetness with a little bitter bite and a light spice from the rye. The carb is great for the flavors and the mouthfeel is just slick enough without being oily. Really well made and a great highlight of Nelson Sauvin hops.
"Pours a hazy golden orange. Not much of a head for an IPA, settles into a light lacy cap. Aroma of tropical fruit; smells like a stick of juicy fruit gum with a hint of grassiness. Big fruit flavor up front on the palate. Finishes dry with a slight rye aftertaste. Medium bodied and slightly carbonated. Overall, an extremely well crafted IPA and one that ranks right up there with the best of them! Well done, Alpine!"
"Huge thanks to Mike for splitting this with me - one that I've been dying to try. Nelson pours a murky golden and somewhat orange-ish color. Super hazy and amazingly unfiltered, it looks something like lighter-toned apple cider. Surprisingly little head for an IPA, and it looks a bit thick during the pour, but the yeasty haze is strangely compelling."
Poured from a bottle into a 3FFF glass
"Growler provided by @suncrust, Thx Kyle"
"22oz bomber, undated (but Brian assures me this was just picked up from the brewery several days prior) poured into a FFF teku glass today, 6/16/2013. Thanks a lot to Brian for hooking me up with this beer."
22 oz bomber poured into a Allagash tulip glass
Good beer Sunday. First IPA review. Exponential is my all time favorite IPA so I have high hopes here. I love Duet as well but Hopiness didnt do it for me...snifter poured right down the middle
"an opaque orangy yellow pour with a full 2 fingers of white fluffy head which dissipated slowly and left some great amount of sticky lacing behind. smells of fruity hops, slight pine, herbal garlic-like scent, grapefruit, mint leaves."
"A-Bright orange, one finger head and cloudy."
"Nelson pours a cloudy golden color with a super fine 1 finger head,and superb lacing."
"A: Hazy, golden-yellow with a bright white, soapy, fluffy head. Great lace and decent retention."
Consumed 5/14/13
Thanks to JayORear for the surprise bottle. Split with angrybabboon.
"Poured from a bottle into a Goose Island tulip. The pour is gold and straw-colored. Very pale and pilsener-like. It sports a nice 2-finger creamy white head. I get some nice notes of lemon, orange, pine, and cedar on the nose."
A-clear golden. Minimal head
"Tasted 22 March 2013, reviewed from notes. Thanks to BeerThirty for the bottle."
A: Hazy light gold with white head. Retention is good with decent lacing.

22oz bottle from Hamilton23. Thanks!
Received this extra in a trade and poured into my Duvel tulip.
"Pours a hazy light golden apricot color with a big clean white head, very attractive."
Light golden hazy yellow with a thin head that lasts till the last sip.
22oz bottle served in a standard pint glass.
22oz bottle sent by ScottO. Reportedly less than a week old!
22oz bottle sent to me by rmaste. Thanks!
"Fresh bottle, only 5 days old. At least that's what Alpine said when I bought it. Pours a cloudy pale gold with one finger white head. Aroma is super grassy, slightly piney with notes of citrus fruit. Flavors of citrus with just a hint of spicy rye. Medium body with ample carbonation. Crisp, clean finish. A smooth IPA, not too bitter."
"Pours a hazy copper gold. Attractive beer, but minimal head and lacing."
"I wasn't floored at first look (depth of color underwhelming), but this beer had a great nose and nice silky texture. I marked it down for having a bitterness that lingered slightly too long on my tongue, but otherwise this was my favorite IPA tasted at Alpine (Nelson, Duet, Pure Hoppiness, 1910)."
poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass
Been a long time lurker but this will be my first official review.
On tap at Alpine. Had right after Keane Idea.

"While Raul was sippin' hard on a Blind Pig, he became acquaintances with tha homie sittin' next to him at da bar. It wuz tight like - homeboy is in to da syrup (like Raul), and because he was so nice (and into karma n shit) he ended up giving Raul a bottle of this out of the back of his truck. (Ima get you back, dawg!)"
"Tap at Toronado SD. Poured a clear straw/light yellow with excellent sheety white lace. Aroma is unreal, beautiful NZ hops shining forth: lots of rose wine, fresh grapefruit, fresh strawberries, peach, even fresh mint leaves. Taste is earthy hops, lots of butternut squash, grapefruit rind. Would love to try this again. 8/4/7/4/14=3.7"
"Deep golden color. Smells strongly of grapefruit. Earthy, citrusy, grapefruit flavors in the hops. Unique Alpine dank maltiness. Medium body, creamy and medium carbonation. Good mouthfeel. Bright and satisfying taste. Bitterness only after it is swallowed, and it is minor. Smooth. Little alcohol taste."
"Pours a somewhat murky, light tangerine colour, with a whitish head. Little bits of lace. Aroma is tropical fruits, mango, herbal tones, and juicy citrus. Mirrored quite well on the taste with the sweet orange, mango and fruits. Mild bitterness, full of flavour. It's got a nice substantial feel, lower carbonation, but pleasant. Super easy to drink. "
"22oz bottle, unknown date. Served at around 45F."
"Pours a gorgeous orange-golden color that is impenetrable to light. Showcases an antique whit head that dissipates quickly. The nose is glorious. Juicy grapefruit to the hilt! Mouthfeel is wet and a little cottony toward the finish. A lot of grapefruit up front. The rye expresses itself in the middle, followed by distinct pine flavor. This is a magnificent beer. I can't believe how good this is. I'm not a rye fan, but this is phenomenal."
"Part of the blind bif 7, paired beers"
The color is an unimpressive murky golf with a contrasting white head. What is impressive is the spider web of lacing. 
Had this at the brewpub in Alpine two weeks ago. This review's from notes.
HUGE thanks to quirkzoo for this one!
"150th Review! Huge HUGE thanks to ehammond1 for an unsolicited box with this, duet, and some pint glasses. Total class act "
Bottled last week. 
Appearance: Light Amber color with a modest-sized white head that faded fairly quickly.

Big thanks go out to ehammond1 for sending this!
"A: Poured a slightly hazy golden orange with good carbonation with a promising creamy like white cap, bubbles and moderate lacing. I did spot a little bit of hop oil sticking to the glass"
22oz bottle thanks to Airfoil (picked up from brewery exactly 2 weeks ago). Poured into Lawson's snifter.
"When I first tried this beer many years ago, the heavens parted and it instantly became my favorite ipa. This new version brewed by GF is a shell of its former self. Massive fail here. Dear GF, Please get your shit together. Thanks, Ryan."
on tap at toronado san diego
Thanks Ehammond1 
"On tap poured into a long glass, unknown freshness. This was poured a hazy golden amber color with a smaller laced leading off white head. The smells are of oranges, citrus fruit, grapefruit and sweet malts. The feel is medium with a nice creamy carbonation. The taste is very balanced and good, lots of bitter hops, citrus fruit, good stuff."
Had this beer on tap at the pub in Alpine and later out of a 22 I brought back to the midwest with me.
"22 oz bottle, no bottled on date, picked it up at the brewery yesterday so it should be pretty fresh. Poured into a tulip glass."
"Served on tap in a Shaker pint at Downtown Johnny Brown's (San Diego, CA)."

"Bottle shared by Adam, 650ml into a snifter."
A-golden orange with a white head. Good retention with considerable lacing. 
"Thins white head on a clear dark golden. Spotty lacing, good head retention."
Appearance – Pours a hazy golden orange color with a little sediment. A nice head and minimal lacing.
"Deliciously rounded and profoundly unique with malt flavors of caramel and butterscotch balanced with citrus and winy notes- Nelson delivers the familiar wash of IPA flavors, but with a unique twist here and there to create intrigue and identity."
A: Orange with 1 finger head with LOTS of lacing on the side of the glass. Cloudy body
"Poured from a bomber into a Firestone Walker tulip. Pours a very pale shade of gold with a solid two finger head. Smell on this is citrusy with a tad bit of onion. Otherwise it's a pretty crisp scent. The taste is similar. Citrus foreground with a fade into onion. I typically don't like that quality even a little, but the citrus helps out tremendously. The finish is clean and crisp. Minimal bitterness or aftertaste of any variety. Overall, another solid Alpine IPA."
"A - Poured into a chilled 16 oz glass, the bottle itself was just pulled from my refrigerator at the said temperature. Yellow golden hue that is transparent with a very light head."
"22 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a Uinta Pilsner pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Acquired at Alpine yesterday. Expectations are very high; I've had it before on-draft and loved it. I'm a huge Alpine fan. "
You had this beer. 
"Before I even comment on the appearance of this beer, the aroma after opening the bottle was outstanding. Big tropical lush citrus with another note which jumped right to peppermint in my brain, but I can't really place aside from that association. Maybe some spicy and crisp. An IPA second only to masala mama in aroma. Appearance is average. Mildly cloudy orange color with a short white head that dissipates to a thin film. Very sparse lacing, almost none. Flavor is very tropical fruity as well. Lush and full, but does not quite live up to the world class aroma of this beer. There is a similar unique characteristic in the flavor which I cannot pinpoint, perhaps earthy, or maybe herbal, but not in an english way. Very balanced with a nice, but definitely not overwhelming, caramel quality. Mouthfeel is medium light and is lacking a bit of carbonation, but it is not so bad at all."
"Agitated the bottle to stir up the yeast. Poured into a pint glass, smooth pour nets a small white one inch head over a slightly hazy gold orange body. Average retention and beautiful curtains of lacing."
22oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint. Thanks to anacrime for the bottle!
"Bottle share in Hoboken, NJ."
A- Pours a bright clear golden orange with a white head. Head has really good retention and leaves some nice lacing on the sides of the glass. 
"Big thanks to exraided for this bottle of Alpine Excellence. Haha I have shared 2 others with friends, this baby is MINE. Live review, can't find best by dating."
"From a bottle, poured into my GI tulip"
"A: Half-finger white head, light golden-yellow color, good carbonation, okay lacing"
"A- Gorgeous light golden orange with a nice bright white head. A little bit soapy, but full bodied enough to stick all over the glass. "
I'll preface this by saying Single IPAs really aren't my thing.
Pours a nice hazy orange color with a one finger off-white head. Leaves a consistent cap of foam and nice lacing. Real nice looking beer overall. 
Poured into a tulip. 
"A: Super murky! Honey in color. Big thick, foamy head. The head lasted forever."
Bomber with big thanks to BdubleEdubleRUN.
hazy golden color with a nicely sized pure white head that sticks around a while and leaves tonnns of lacing.
Shared 22oz bomber obtained in trade from Vanlingleipa.

big thanks to LaChupacabra for sending me a box full of Alpine!
A - Pours almost a golden orange. Slight haze to it. Thin white head.
"App: Dark orange-gold and hazy, with a smallish, quickly settling head and lots of sticky lace clinging to the glass."
Reviewing Nelson from the Alpine Beer Company.
Tried this on tap at the brewery 2 days ago and now enjoying it from a 22 oz. bomber.
Thanks to breaks808 for the bottle. Cheers!
Poured from a bomber into an imperial pint glass.
"Poured a dirty yellow/orange with lots of sedimant, a light thin head."
Pours hazy pale golden with a thick soapy head. 
"Picked up a couple cases of various IPA 's at Alpine on Friday including a bunch of Nelson. This beer is a golden with a beautiful dense one inch cap that has amazing retention and leaves behind serious lacing as I sip down. The nose, like all Alpine brews is a work of art. Sweet tropical fruit, Nelson Sauvign hops and malty biscuit round out the package. The flavor profile follows the nose down the road, gorgeous rye, pine, sweet dank hoppiness all balanced by a minimal malt backbone. I cannot say enough about the uniqueness of this work of art, it is simply one of the best IPA's I have ever had, and Alpine may be the little giant that continues to craft ultra uber cult status beers according to their own rules."
"Pours a pale yellow gold with a thin white head. Lacing left on the glass looks like layers of sediment or rock in a cross section. Thin yeast residue left at the bottom of the bottle. Piney, woodsy, earthy hops aroma, as well as citrus and floral aromas. A little twinge of tart light bread also, like it's baking in the oven (read: yeast). Taste starts out very piney, like some spruce tips were used in the making of this beer. Very mild malt, but rye is there and unmistakable, which makes it tart and acidic. Bitterness comes in like the tide taking over your taste buds without you noticing. Tangy yeast comes out with time. A bit acidic in feel, but easily drinkable. dry finish."
"Thanks to tjkinate for this one, I always love me a Rye IPA, and I always love me some Alpine. Served from a 22oz bomber into my Darkness snifter."
Thanks to Brandon for this one.
Acquired from mthomas84 via SS '11 so a big THANK YOU goes out to him
Poured this beer blidly into a Surly Darkness snifter:

A-Pours a slightly hazy golden with a very small white head with good retention.
Alpine Nelson
"deep amber, almost bronze/brass, with a slight haze. white head that leaves a bit of lace. nose is nelson for sure... fruits like grape, pear and melon mix with grapefruit, citrus and grass while playing with sweet, spicy rye and blending with a slight caramelly undertone. taste follows suit while evoking memory of ""dank"". not cellar dank... cali dank. hate to be cliche, but the juicy goodness in here is really reminding me of mj. the taste is well-balanced, and flavors pop out and shine for a second, then go back and blend while something else pops up. not muddy, just full of nelson. at times i'm also definitely reminded of why this hop is called nelson sauvin. lovely. medium body with no bad aftertastes. gripping bitterness that opens up the palate to the rye and other sharp flavors that are toying with the juicy, fatty flavors of fruit. overall, another very fine beer from alpine with a very, very fine name!"
Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass. No noticeable bottling date.
Thanks to Brett for this bottle in our recent trade. Served at 50 degrees. Split into two tulips.
I really can't wait for my visit to the brewery in a few weeks.
Poured into a Bruery Tulip
Got from a very generous Scottfrie. Poured 22oz into snifter.

"Freshly brought back from the brewery on 10/27/11, consumed 11/10/11 with Chico1985. Reviewed from notes."
22oz into a Sierra Nevada pint glass. 
Major props to Huhzubendah for sharing this- Thanks Matt!
"All I drink is IPA's, and it's been a long time since I had a mind blowing one, and I've tried a lot of the great name CA brews. This one is beyond sensational, the nose is fruity, not quite as sharp as grapefruit, and the taste follows. Fruity, kinds peachy, a little sharp like sucking on the peach pit, is the best I can relate to. You think this would be a typical CA IPA, but it's not... it's so much better. Definitely not sweet, well balanced, but still very bold, a little xtra malt, drinks like a DIPA. . Must be the different hops is all I can add. As good an IPA as I've ever had, and I have tried most of the higher rated ones. You have to give this one a try, i can't believe it hasn't had it's own thread yet."
Bomber generously brought back from Cali and shared by cbutova. Been looking forward to this one.
"Poured from the bottle into my Chicago Bears pint glass. Once again, huge thanks to Brett!"
"Went all the way to San Diego but the only Alpine IPA I could get my hands on was one bottle of Nelson, and it was a good one. I had it once before and I realized it must not have been so fresh, because this one was amazing. "
"22 ounce bottle sent to me courtesy of smarcoly, thanks Scott! Poured into a tulip glass over the course of the evening."
"Picked up a bottle back in early Sept when visiting San Diego. Made a special trip out to Alpine simply because I was hearing such great things about them. Missed the brewery because it closed, so my wife and I hit the pub right next door. After a hearty meal with some tasty brews, the server was kind enough to sell me a bottle of Nelson. "
Thanks to Vissai for this new Cali brew 
Poured a 22oz bottle into a Bell's pint glass. Curiosity of Sixofsigmas. No dating on the bottle. 
22oz bottle served in a tulip glass.
"If you opened your eyes and saw the color of this beer, then closed your eyes and took a sip, for me it was the closest thing to Pliny the Elder that I have seen/tasted. Lighter in color, but full of flavor and almost sweet hops that linger in your mouth well after swallowing. Has the exact same flavor profile and elegance that Pliny has, but I think this one might be even tougher to find. Made with New Zealand hops it has all the flavor of a California IPA that all the “C” hops have."
What used to be a world class IPA when brewed by Apine is now a shell of its former self now that Green Flash is brewing it. If I was given a blind taste test would never guess this is Nelson. Shocked at some of the positive reviews here on the new Green Flash version.
"A: a hearty, somewhat hazy golden pour with slight lacing that clings to the glass as if its life depends on it..."
Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass.
Clear golden-apricot color with a nice 1 finger bubbly white head. Good retention and excellent lacing. 
"Another share with Brez07, another borrowing of review."
"This is a solid IPA, using the Nelson hop (only?) and some rye."
Most recent batch of nelson though I'm not sure of it's actual release date. 
"I received this bottle in a recent box from BrewerB, thanks for hitting this Want Brian!"
"Bomber courtesy of millerbuffoon into a tulip; shared with a couple friends at NEBCO. Thanks, Miller!"
"Pour from a bottle gave a golden color with a nice white head. Earthy, fresh hops in the nose. Medium bodied with upfront clean natural bitter NZ hops.Refreshing beer with the alcohol pretty well hidden. Long finish really accentuates the unique flavor profile. Awesome."
Thanks again to a buddy for sharing this with me. Pours a golden orange colour into a snifter glass. I could really pick up grapefruit in the smell. The taste followed suit as a intense grapefruit like flavour followed with each sip. Good bitterness and a nice malty backbone. Very nice beer.
"Alpine Beer Company has a favorable reputation amongst BA members and even sports a few beers in the top 100, including Nelson. Since they don't make their way up to the SF Bay Area, I used a recent trip to San Diego as a great excuse to visit them in person. "
22oz bottle split with Drazzamatazz and Heater
"Pours a yellowish-golden color with a nice whitish head. The nose is intoxicating. A light pine is lifted by a delightful citrus array of grapefruit and orange. Wow. Delicious (I rarely give 5's for any category). The taste is really good as well. A light spicy bitterness, grassy with just a touch of pine and citrus. It brings the wood like the nose. Yum. The mouthfeel is medium with a medium light carbonation. I always have felt that I like Duet better, but this fresh batch of Nelson is fantastic. [EDIT: Had this beer like a million times since and this is one of my favorite all time beers]"
"Poured into a Stone Imperial glass. A golden orange color. A bit cloudy and full of tiny carbonation bubbles. Head isn't that big (not a very aggressive pour, my fault) under one finger and bright white in color. Lace is pretty sticky and leaves a beautiful spotted pattern. "
"Very excited to try this. Poured from bottle into my Sierra Nevada pint glass. Smell is amazing. Strong, piney, grapefruity hop notes. In the background there is a lot of malt sweetness. Color is pale straw. Head quickly dissipates to a thin head. The taste is really interesting and unique. There's the sweetness but also a bit of grassiness in the hop notes. The rye really contributes to the unique flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. "
Another San Diego gem....
Had this once before (thanks to Gregshead) and got to try one that I had time to review again (thanks to Thegordianknot).
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Hazy orange with a good white head. Aroma is floral hops with a lot of citrus fruits especially orange and grape fruit. The flavor is an explosion of hops but in great balance, not as sweet as the aroma seemed. Orange and grape fruit, maybe apple, peach. So nicely balanced, this is a stellar IPA and I always seek this out when they put out a new batch."
"I've been lucky enough to have this beer a few occasions, so I felt that it was time to review."
This is a world class American made beer. 
"Pours a light golden amber with two fingers of fluffy white head, sticky lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma and taste are both full to the brim of white grapes, giving it a flavor similar to white wine. Sharp hop blasts of grapefruit, musky wet grass and herbal notes, backed by a slight spiciness I assume is from the rye, which complements the hop profile perfectly. Also getting a bit of that catty, onion flavor I'd normally associate with simcoe, though in a much more subtle way. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a low to medium carbonation and slightly dry, finish. Fresh, slightly acidic citrus notes linger on your tongue for longer than you can wait to take another sip."
Big thanks to Jesse for this great beer.
Bomber into a pint glass
"A light amber, golden color with a thick, persistent head that leaves significant lace. Quite floral nose with light hops. Grapefruit nose becomes more prominent as the beer warms up."
This is the third time I have been fortunate enough to have this beer. Thanks EHammond and Airfoil for this OUTSTANDING and one of my top 3 favorite IPA's.
"Another one from dmsohyea, thanks Ian! This one was picked up at the time of the Expo release and enjoyed on 08/11/11."
Bomber served on 8/6/11 into my Alpine pint glass. Picked this up from the brewery about a week ago.

Great foamage/lacing. Light yellow.
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Bells snifter.

Thanks to danwho for hooking this bottle up in a trade.
22 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Big thanks to DearthVader for sending this one.
Poured a dark straw with a white creamy head. Lots of lacing the whole way down the glass.
"I had had Nelson and Duet back when I was first getting into craft beer. I remembered liking both but thinking I liked duet a little more, and since that time that was about all I could remember about Nelson: that I liked duet slightly more. Having Nelson again has been a real treat, and I realize that you might not be able to compare the two as both are wonderful beers with quite distinct characters."
"750ml couple weeks old fresh offering, shared with Klym."
Thanks Urbancaver for sharing.
"Huge thanks to thome50 for including this in our trade - this is one of my all-time favorites, but I've never actually reviewed it. "

"Wow, do I have a new favorite IPA?"
Bottle. Pours a clear light copper color with a coastered white head. Nice fruit aroma mostly dominated by grapefruit. Medium mouhfeel. Nice malty backbone with a hoppy forward grapefruit rind notes. Bittenrss lingers. Nicely drinking. No alcohol notes found.
"Thanks to DeathVader, 22oz bomber to Stone IPA glass."
Oh Nelson how I've longed for thee. Last time we met was not soon enough.

"22oz bottle with no bottled on or freshness date poured into Hair of the Dog tulip, reviewed on 6/6/11."
"Taken from notes on my trip to Alpine in late May, 2011. 4.5 oz. pour as part of a flight."
Poured into a Mikasa tulip from a 22oz bomber.
"A very proper looking IPA. Nice white puffy head which leaves a trail of tight belgian lace behind it. Hazy and opaque but a nice golden orange color. Such a fruity aroma, big grapefruit and citrus fruit. Sticky and hoppy, could pop a bit more. The flavor is clean and pure west coast IPA. Big fruit notes, grapefruit, melon, citrus, really great. I'm missing a little complexity from multiple strains of hops, I think? The rye is a nice touch, faintly spicy. But where the rye shines is helping create a dry clean finish. Nice, alot of IPAs have a bit of a cloying finish from the hops, but not this one! An IPA of the highest order."
"Got this in a trade ,now getting to drink and to the review, being poured in to a surly imperial pint glass"

Big thanks to schmoopsbeer for this one
Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint glass.
"Big thanks to Metallitone1, this was super fresh! I split this with a friend and it was entertaining. Orange color, not quite perfectly clear but maybe it was hazed from being too cold at first. I could barely taste the rye but the hops were certainly quite pungent and tasty and bitter! It had a real full feel to it, robust hoppiness. We drank a Duet right after and Nelson was much more interesting. Overall this was a good IPA but I'm not surprised given the source."
Have to say thanks to mschofield for this one.
A- Pours a very light orange with a fluffy white head that lingers for quite a while. Slight haze.

Pours a murky yellowish orange. Lots of white frothy head. Smells incredibly hoppy. Tons of grapefruit and a touch of pine on the nose. Smells great! Tastes great. Bitter hops and grapefruit on the tongue as well. The malts are very subtle in the background. Nicely carbonated. Overall a very tasty beer. Probably my favorite alpine beer!
A: Hazy golden color with a small head and nice lacing.

A- Pours a wonderful burnt orange color with frothy 2 finger head. Great Lacing
Poured into New Belgium tulip. 
"Wow what a great beer, pours two fingers of head and almost comes out with a mercury metallic hue when pouring, settles to a caramel orange in the glass. Nose is just full of citrus and tropical fruits and white wine with a touch of piney hops. Taste is a complex blend of candied citrus rind, bitter papaya, orange mango juice and some dark rye bread with a touch of sauv blanc notes at the end with the requisite ipa finish. Sculpin might have been dethroned in my book gorgeous beer."
"Pours a hazy light orange color with a nice 2 inch stark white head that fades to a small cap. The head is very cloudy and puffy on the top of the beer. Thin rings of lace around the glass on the drink down. Smells of citrus zest hops, pine tree, and some spiciness from the rye. Tastes of spicy rye, malt, and citrus zest/pine hops, but overall the beer has a muted taste in my opinion. Beer is slightly carbonated and seems a bit flat. Smooth but creamy in the mouth. I would have liked to have more carbonation for the style. Overall, this is a good beer from Alpine but I prefer a few of their other beers over this."
"Big thanks goes out to Sixofsigmas for sending me this one as an extra in a trade a long time back. I just found it sitting in the back of the fridge! Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a massively fluffy four finger off-white head that subside to one finger stupidly slow. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, citrus, orange, citrus hop, and pot. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, pine resin, citrus, orange zest, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew completely wowed me. There is really a lot going right for this one overall. One thing to note is the head on this one. HOLY CRAP! It basically formed a pillow over the beer and was borderline solid. You could actually take a bite of it and chew it. It remained this way throughout the entire glass which was awesome. If you noticed that I mentioned getting pot in the aroma, well usually this is out of place, but it seemed to work great with the other aromas going on in this one. The flavor itself was very complex and extremely well balanced. Very nice feel on the palate as well. I would honestly have to say that this might be the best American IPA I have yet to have. Really nice job on this one Alpine!"
Thanks to BdubleEdubleRUN for the trade on this one. I had a sample of this brew for the first time on Saturday care of Deuane and figured I better pop my bottle open soon to take this in and throw down a proper review.
"Hair6a11 hooked it up. Huge score, really appreciate this one. Bomber poured into snifter."
"Picked up some more of these at the Provisions shop a few weeks ago. Glad I did, still had the amazing orange appearance and 1"" head. Aroma was the funkiest Nelson aroma experience I've ever come across. A unique hop to say the least."

A: Hazy golden color with not much of a head but some great lacing down the glass. 
Honey color. Some chill haze. A fat finger of head. A quarter inch of steadfast froth hangs around for the festivities. Heaps of lace spattered about and plastered in sheets. 
"Poured into a pint glass from a bomber. Delicate lacing is left on the glass. Pale copper hue, slightly cloudy."
"Bomber, poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours a clear golden yellow, with a finger of foamy bubbly, off-white head. Head leaves a thick lacing as it slides back into the glass, with many large bubbles staying at the surface of the beer. Some light carbonation is visible."
"Thanks to Grapehops for the extra! Poured from bomber (no date stamp) into a pint glass. Pours hazy gold, medium to thin off-white head, pretty lacing. Nose is soft, fleshy stonefruit and papaya, lush and fruity, with both fresh and dried pineapple here as well. Flavors are soft and fruity, but deceptively bitter. Pineapple and guava in the mouth, as well as a pervasive nutty earthiness from the rye. Mostly upfront palate, but some ""white wine"" acidity on the finish with caraway again on the long finish. Quite a complex beer but was not my style among my favorite IPAs. Overhyped IMO, so I am going against the tide on this one."

"Aromas are initially citrus (grapefruit) and light pineapple and earthy hops, with an underlying bit of bready, spicy rye and a touch of caramel malt. There is also a nice white vinous characteristic on the nose; must be those special Nelson Sauvin hops. "
275th review on BA
A creamy one finger and half head that dissipate fairly quickly.
"Alpine Nelso was provided to me via trade courtesy of tbase. This is a really interesting IPA! The Nelson Sauvin hops used in the brewing of this beer really adds a fresh vinous, fruity aspect to this otherwise solid IPA. Without the interesting hops I think this a pretty typical IPA, in fact it reminds a lot of hill farmstead citra which I thought was pretty good but Nelson really has it going on. The bitterness in this beer is slightly subdued but i like that because it helps you really taste and smell the Nelson Sauvin. The rye also contributes a nice earthy spiciness helps keep the beer grounded. If possible get a hold of this beer, even if you have to pay ridiculous shipping for it. It's worth it!"
22 oz. A hazy orange pour with about a finger of white head. Sticks to the glass very well.
Thanks to Ultraman9000 for this one. 
This beer popes a hazy light orange/yellow. It smells amazing. The blend of hops and grapefruit is captivating. I dig it big time. It tastes similar to the aroma. Big hops with sweet fruit flavors and a bitter aftertaste. Verk drinkable and considerably better on tap vs bottle. Out of the bottle it has a lot of malt flavor and less citrus and hops. Very enjoyable either way.
Thanks to billshmeinke for sending this to me in a LIF
"Alpine Nelson is an unbelievably great beer if you like your Hops piney and resinous. Nice light amber color, good carbonation, grapefruit aromas, smooth mouthfeel with a meduim body and just enough malts (including Rye) to give a malt back bone to the hops. As a Hop freak, this is one of my all-time favorite beers. Tastes like a pine tree air freshener steeped in dirty bongwater....just incredibly good. about my only complaint is the head retention is a little lacking. "
"This feels like a refined and mature IPA. There is a solid malt foundation supporting the hops, and adding rye to an IPA is a brilliant idea. It smells similar to a double IPA, a lot of malt and some spiciness. This beer does not smell as hoppy as I initially assumed, the bitterness is there but not overdone. Once it hits your tongue, youre not bombarded with bitterness. It's a big beer and balanced well. Plenty of carbonation and a nice finish. Also, if you live in San Diego, it's not that expensive."
pours cloudy pale yellow with some dark muddy gold - 1+ finer head that left some spotted lacing

"Split a bomber with my good friend and roommate, JustinA1."
"Thanks to Augustgarage for this incredible California IPA. Poured into my Dfh tulip glass, pours a beautiful yellow sun color, about 1 finger of head quickly subsides with a little lacing. On the nose, I get sweet grapefruit and a buttery sweet flavor. I love it, this is a unique and wonderful ipa. Unlike any I have ever had. On the first taste, the hoppy goodness hits my palate, followed by grapefruit, and there is that buttery sweet flavor in the back. The nose is so filled with grapefruit that it smells like I am sticking my nose into a glass of ruby red. Mouthfeel- nice, silky, with just enough carbonation. Drinkability- I could drink this every day for the rest of my life and die happy."
Thanks johndoe8 for trading this one to me.

"Purchased at the ""best damn beer shop"" in san diego california on vacation with my girlfriend. she spend a semester in new zealand and since something about this bomber had to do with NZ I was pressured into getting it.. it wasnt that bad but I was not all that impressed. Its a golden ipa rendering it a bit less hoppy with a lower IBU than I would prefer.. still not a bad beer by any means. Poured a copper color with a minimal head..very basic almost bland appearance. Upon the first sip I got a lot of grapefruit and burnt sugar...a bit of coriander comes to the nose which is a pleasant suprise. This beer is very crisp and slightly complex..it seems as though a ton of flavor is rather non-existent but still has some of those citrus tones I previously mentioned...the flavor just kind of dissipates the more you drink it."
"Another one from Megan, I thank you again. For some reason, whenever I go to San Diego, I always pass on the Alpine beers. I don't know why. Fortuneately, I got the chance to try this one the other night. Poured a nice clear golden color, with a little white head. Good fresh piney hops, spicy, peppery rye and a long bitter finish."

"Again Thanks to Hayesez for the pour! into a Portsmouth snifter from the fridge temp to room temperature. Looks a pretty dark orange. smell is awesome, with a huge presence of typical fresh hops, citrus smell of orange and grapefruit, and as i smell it, a building presence of mango (hayes says rubber...weird!). This is great! there is also some spiciness that i can't place (not our first beer haha), but adds a nice complexity. Taste follows the smell, but just a hint disappointing. it's decently bitter, and fresh grapefruit is there for sure (comes out a lot more as it warms). the mango and spiciness in the smell, however, didn't come out in the taste. it ended up being just a little odd, but not a terrible one. This one feels pretty good in the mouth, again not incredible. The taste is odd/different enough (to me) that i probably wouldn't want a ton of this one, but definitely worth a try!"
"Yet another Alpine brew received as an extra from Kaiser81. The Duet and the Pure Hoppiness have both been exceptional, and I can't wait to give the Nelson a shot. Split with Ridgley and K-Rho and poured into my Portsmouth snifter."

"Poured into my Zated fluted glass. An interesting, more brown, color than most IPA's. Got about a finger and a half of white head. Smells amazing, very grapefruitastic. One of the best smelling IPA's I've had in some time. Nice citrusy, lemon and grapefruit flavors. The malt flavor is subdued and leads to a nice, looong bitter finish. Medium carbonation, and very satisfying. The 22oz is a perfect serving size."

"White grapes, freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, honeydew melon, apples, and perfume scents bellow from a clear, golden amber body. A fruity and vibrant aroma if I do say so myself with faint peppery bread notes."
"Tasted from 22oz bottle. Pours pale orange with a thick and frothy white head that slowly recedes to heavy lace. Nose of lemon, pineapple and other tropical fruits, hemp, and I think that the rye is adding a dimension that I am not used to smelling. The pineapple flavor really comes through on the palate with lemon and even some red fruits. The rye is also a flavor that I recognize on the palate as hard as it was for me to discern on the nose. This is full bodied, as there is something almost creamy with average carbonation and a long, beautiful finish dominated by pineapple and rye. This beer is ridiculously drinkable with no alcohol burn."

Wow, this smells perfect for the warm day it is. Nose is lemon and orange and some spice. Taste is first lemon, orange/mango but with a great spicey bready malt and that rye backbone. Bitterness is very mild in the finish. So refreshing...it does NOT deteriorate as it warms. This is a pretty perfect balance for me. Sessionable? You bet. This is an amazing beer - great nose, so flavorful, and leaves you wanting more (and I DO)! How can you left-coasters sleep at night keeping this to yourselves!?"

"2 of these scores where close to achieving a half point increase but I couldn't quite do it. While I loved this beer it was lacking that ""I deserve to be considered with the greats"" factor. The rye is a great addition to this and really shows itself adding another dimension to an already good example. A well crafted IPA with rye, done just right-what's not to like? Bright, vibrant orange citrus fruits with a bitter backing in the nose and more in the taste blended with rye. I like this nelson hop variety. Mouthfeel was not crisp or creamy but somewhere in between. Search out all Alpine IPA's there's a reason 3 of them (including this one) are ranked in the top 100."

"Another great IPA from the Alpine Beer Company. The unique character of Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand adds a wonderful grapefruit/citrus flavor that blends well with the malt. This beer is a light copper color, slightly hazy, with nice head with lots of lace that clings to the glass as you drink it. Light and slightly fruity aroma, with a touch of rye malt that goes very well with this interesting southern hemisphere hop. Overall impression -- this is an exceptionally smooth beer."
"Another great ""extra"" from NewGeneric thank you again. Smooth pours clear slight head is defanitely hops forward vs malt but not aggressive. slight pine I know there is citrus but its not your typical grapefruit taste its more of tangerine or perhaps dare I say appricots? Not entirely certain but its is nice and fresh. "
"Bottle, home. Alpine night #2. Another day, another fantastic IPA from Alpine. Whereas Duet was a nearly perfect version of what I look for in an IPA, Nelson is unexpected but also world class. This isn't my first encounter with Nelson Sauvin hops, but it's definitely the best use of them that I've tried. The beer smells of orange rinds, wild lilacs, honeysuckle and sweet white grape juice. The flavor is dry, bitter and spicy with rye. The whole package works extremely well. I have no real qualms with this beer, but I wouldn't mind if the rye was a bit stronger. I'd love to try an imperial version of this beer, so get on that Alpine. The mouthfeel has a nice hop oiliness surrounding the duel between hop bite and rye spice. It's an incredibly drinkable beer despite its unusual flavor profile. Alpine has managed to make a combination of rye and Nelson Sauvin hops feel completely natural and I'd love to spend a night with nothing but glasses of Nelson."
"Pours a light gold in color with a very nice inch of white head. Leaves plenty of webby, spotty lacing on the side of the glass. "
"Pours a golden hazy straw color with a thick bubbly head that dissipates quickly leaving a medium amount of lacing along the glass, pretty solid in appearance."
"this beverage came with a bit of reputation in the sd area, as many of the breweries visited informed us we'd be mistaken were we not to head over to alpine. when i arrived, they struggled to determine what order i should taste in, but were convinced i should finish with this unique beverage. the nelsons have an arrayed aroma and flavor, it was like having a bite of something colorful off of someone else's plate when they weren't watching and you didn't pay attention to what they ordered. playfully citrus with an angry spice contributed both by the hop and the rye. i'm not sure what to make of this beer, but i'd like more to try. it's kind've like a rhinocorn. i don't know if it's even real. a fun and spicy rye.p.a."
"Bomber pours into my glass a deep orange/yellow with a two finger creamy, bubbling white head and superb clarity. Aromas start with a distinct tropical, pungent, fruity hop explosion. Grapefruit melds in with a nice spicy rye character. There is somewhat of a vinous, white wine character lurking within as well. Quite the lovely aroma."
Thanks to beerman4 for putting this in as an extra.
Bottle purchased at City Beer Store (yep! NorCal! You rule Craig/Beth!)
Second of the west coast IPA's. Another bottle from JesseTheHut. 
Big thanks to errantnight for hooking me up with this. Bottle spit among friends produced a smaller white head than expected that went off to nothing. it has a somewhat cloudy yellow in color body to it.
My second time having this beer. This being the first time I am sober enough to review it and remember the characteristics.
Poured from the bottle into a Sam Adams sensory glass.
22oz bottle from the brewery served in a pint glass. 
A 22 ounce bomber poured into a mug.
This and Duet have become two of my favorite IPA's and definitely the best bang for your buck.
"Appearance: Pours a fizzy golden peach toned orange with huge carbonation--a couple inches. Huge mid sized carbonation bubbles and swirl around the glass to the top. The head on this one's going nowhere. The head retention is amazing given that the bubbles are so big--they look like the type that are going to disappear at any moment, but they stick around impressively--I'm not sure at this rate I'll be able to get through to the beer. A beautiful pattern of sticky lacing."
"22 oz. bottle purchased from Beverages 4 Less, poured in to a cervoise."
One of my favorite IPAs out there. A creamy haystack yellow with a thick head that recedes shortly leaving a beautiful lacing that covers the whole glass.
Thanks to Alpine beer co for only being one hour drive away and letting me purchase a half and half case of this and Duet! Spoiled.
"Thanks to Skuter for sending a couple of Alpine brews my way. American IPA - favorite brew - rye, my favorite additive - my expectations have climbed! "
"Thanks to JessetheHutt for the bottle. You're the man, Jesse."

Thanks to stawn for this one! This is my first experience with Nelson Sauvin hops!
22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. 
Thanks to HopHead84 for sending me a month old bottle of this nectar to me.
"Slightly hazy golden-orange in color with a good-sized off-white and fluffy head that doesn't want to go away. When it does, a craggy lace is left behind. Nose involves a nice big hit of citrusy hops and a slightly sour earthiness in the background. Smooth and malty going down and wrapped in more citrusy hoppiness with a few sour candy notes in the middle. Well-balanced and quite tasty brew, and there's not much more you can ask for than that."
My original review was definitely from a bad bottle. I've since had it a few times and this might be the best IPA out there. The Nelson hops are fucking outstanding and Alpine definitely knows how to make an IPA.
Pours pale golden and clear with a tight two finger head. 
Bomber poured into my trusty pint glass.
Murky brown/gold pour with a finger of head that leaves some webby lacing.
Poured from a 22 oz bomber into an Imperial Pint glass-
"22oz bottle from mikey711, very much appreciated. The beer is lightly hazy, light orange color, dense foamy head. The smell isn't as unique as I expected from the Nelson Sauvins, but I guess the longer it lingered I noticed some nuances. Light citrus and pine, a little orange peel, and a very light touch of rye. These all came through in the taste, maybe not so much from the rye but still delicious. Very drinkable, the body was just right for an American IPA, perfect carbonation."

"Bottle received in a trade from HopHead84, thanks Shane. I've been wanting some Alpine for some time now."
ritzkiss shared this one. thanks eric!
"22 oz bottle, 7% abv. Pours a hazy golden color, with a great lookin white rocky head. Great head retention and lace. A real looker. "
A nice copper orange color with a large slightly off white erupting head. Good lace and great retention.
Thanks to jyoungsbcp for this in trade!
"22 oz bottle, big thanks to ritzkiss for sharing this one!"
"Light gold in colour with a slight haze. It had a fine, bright white cap that stuck around until my pint was gone and there was lots of lace stuck to my glass. The aroma was intense with grapefruit and resin, nice for a West Coast IPA. It had a soft, citrus bitterness and grapefruit flavour throughout. There was some malt backbone that showed through towards the finish and a bit of rye spiciness as well. Quite refreshing. Just under medium bodied with smooth, fine carbonation. Light dryness, good texture. I liked the balance on this beer - solid IPA with a bit of rye that added depth to the hoppiness."
22oz bomber received from hophead84 - thanks for the hook-up!
I drank this from a 22 oz bottle into my Rochefort chalice.
"I was blown away by this one, big surprise."
Thanks to Exiled for sharing this bottle.
Another spectacularly inviting brew. Appearance is very light for an IPA and it looks crisp and refreshing. The best part is the nose. A bouquet of hops livens the mind like smelling salts. I'd recommend this to trainers in the NFL. This would wake me out of a coma. Needless to say the startups are 5's.
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a hazy orange(with some yeasty floaters) and a sticky white head. The aroma is pine, oranges and pineapple. The flavor follows the nose, with pineapple-orange juice being dominant. The finish lingers and is sweet. The beer is medium bodied and easy drinking. The beer works for me. I was expecting a bigger beer, but the profile is much more sublime and layered."
Another round of thanks goes out to tpd975 for this one!
"A- Pours a light tangerine hue with a nice, 1.5 finger frothy white head that leaves decent lacing on the way down."
22oz. bomber received in a recent trade courtesy of mbudner. Thanks again man!
Poured from a 22oz bottle into my southern tier tulip glass. Pours a hazy golden amber color with a thick white pillow for a head. Nice head retention and excellent lacing on the glass.
"Poured from a bomber into a Sam Adams ""perfect pint"" glass."
New Beer Friday! (Sadly I will not hit 100 today because of plans later on but tomorrow will be a celebration!)
A: Pours a very pale yellow with a tall pillow like head. Okay retention and light lace.
22oz bomber received in a trade with BevmoIan thanks!
Thanks to mauerhan for this as an extra in a trade.
"Out of a 22 ounce bomber bottle and into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a hazed bright golden yellow with at least an inch of fluffy sticky bone white foam. The head leaves a nice lace in its wake. Nose and flavors consist of both white and ruby red grapefruit peel, pith, and juice, tangerines, oranges, lemon oil, fruity, white wine-like notes characteristic of this hop variety. Body is about medium could be a bit fuller, with adequate carbonation and quite dry throughout. Pretty tasty stuff and very easy to drink. Certainly worth checking out. Thanks a bunch Chris!"
Bottle.
Got this as fresh as they come straight from the brewery. Growler fills are cheap here so I always get a few.
"Thanks to Mauerhan for the opportunity to try this one. 22oz. bottle served in a standard pint. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a rocky, bright white cap. Decent head retention reveals specks and strands of delicate, cloud-like lacing as the brew is consumed. Nose is light, sweet grapefruit. Crisp rye flavor comes out up front, followed by grapefruit sweetness in the middle and finishing with a light, cleansing residual bitterness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation that drops off towards the end of the quaff. This is really delicious. The rye really give it an extra dimension. This is my third IPA from Alpine and it is awesome. A top notch beer from a top notch brewery."
Huge thanks to czoch75
Brought this home with me from San Diego Beer Week and had a couple shipped back as well. Can't get enough of this one.
"Bottle courtesy of bret27. Pours a light gold color with a frothy off-white head. The lightness is actually enticing considering the darker hues of so many awful, oversweet crystal malt bomb IPAs. Aroma is just ridiculous. A huge wave of tropical fruits explodes from the glass. Peach syrup, tangerines, passionfruit, grapefruit, pineapple; I really can't stop smelling this. The taste is, thankfully, pretty much identical to the aroma, so much so that it was hard to tell when I had stopped inhaling and started imbibing. Fruit salad with a great resinous medium bitterness. Oh and I was so fixated on the fruitiness that I almost didn't notice the rye, which works to spice up (pun intended) the malt base, which would otherwise be imperceivable. Insanely smooth and drinkable. Just a fantastic IPA."
Just received this brew from Masterski. I had a cup of this beauty at Darkness Day this year and it was fantastic. Glad to have a full bottle of my own. Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale tulip while watching San Diego vs. New York.
22oz bottle poured into a Bruery tulip.
"Nelson pours out a unique shade or dark golden that has an almost green look to it. The light tannish head is not enormous, but there is good retention and a gorgeous ring of microbubbles that clings along the edges of the glass. The aroma is a mix of grassy and floral hops that combines with the spicy rye to form an almost funky paper mill scent. I find the nose a bit peculiar, and actually not completely appetizing."
Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Loterbol tulip. Extra special thanks go out to errantnight for sending this in our recent trade!
"Poured from a bottle into a conic pint glass. Beer is yellow and has high haze. Thick white foamy head, tiny bubbles, high lacing, carbonation moderate. Not feeling the haze but otherwise it looks great."
"Mad props to Alex (MasterSki) and Shane (HopHead84) for getting me this beer. Much appreciated, bruthas!"
Pours a cloudy golden color with a small white head.
Arrived early to Blue Palms to watch the cask of this get put on - a large burst of carbonation was released when Brian drove a corkscrew into the shive (or whatever it is called) - a good sign. Served after sitting for 20 minutes (after about a pitcher of watery foam was poured off) in a 20oz nonic - mine was the very first of the evening!
22oz bottle fresh from the west coast.
One of my last bottles. 
"Well this is a beer that enters immediately into the realm of regular favorites... I've loved it on tap, on cask... only Duet and fresh Pure Hoppiness have surpassed it from that maestro of the hops over there..."
"Poured from a 22-oz. bottle. My first thought was that this is clearly a rye beer. Definitely not your run-of-the-mill IPA, it's more complex and definitely quite challenging. Ultimately I liked it a lot."
"I picked this one up at Walnut Liquorette yesterday, although the price tag was a bit of a turn-off, I've been wanting to try this one for awhile."
Very unique IPA...the much talked about Nelson Sauvin hops exude an aroma and flavor unlike any IPA I have had before.
Many thanks to Mauerhan for the trade! 22oz bomber into a Foothills pint glass.
Purchased at south bay drugs.
Picked up at the brewery during my San Diego trip last week. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. No dating info but since got at the brewery it's gotta be fresh and well handled. It was a slightly hazy golden color with tinge of orange. Good carb streams and good lacing. It had a massive white head that very slowly settled into a foam. Very similar in appearance to the Duet from them that I had last night.
"Pale, hazy golden body. Thin and bubbly cap of ivory white froth. Lacing comes in sporadic thin rings. Aroma brings bright layers of pink grapefruit, lemon zest, MJ, apricot, tangerine, etc... This is one great smelling beer. This IPA has nice balance between bitter and flavor in regards to the hops. Neither overpowers the other. Bitterness is fairly clean and refreshing. Flavor brings a lot of citrus and a little pine too. Not quite as bright and juicy as the aroma led me to believe, but rather, a little rough around the edges, which isn't all bad in an IPA. All of the original suspects are still around to varying degrees....grapefruit, orange, lemon, etc.... This is an interesting IPA and an interesting hop for sure."
22oz bomber courtsey of MASPuros...thanks Mike!
"Nice pop of the bomber, recent release picked up by a really swell local BA. Slight chill haze, white grapefruit juice without the pulp. Pretty darn clear golden orange, on the golden side. Fluffy white head in my Moonlight nonic. Lace immediately sticking to the sides while milky way bubbling settles in."
22oz bomber poured into a tulip.
A: Super clean and bright gold with a ton of carbonation rising up from the bottom of the glass creating a lingering 3 inches of soapy white foam head.
"Pours a cloudy light golden color with a nice loose foamy white head that fades slowly leaving a good amount of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is off the charts!!! Really enjoyable aggressive fruity grapefruit orange resin character. Full flavored, the grapefruit taste bursts out and pretty much hides the rye-factor. However, I do sense that the rye is adding to the mouth feel and seems to extend the impact of the resin aftertaste. This is one heck of a nice drinker. Very enjoyable; reminds me some of Pliny. Huge thanks to radshoesbro for the opportunity."
"A - Finally, in the bottle. Almost clear, light honey/heavy straw. Near white head, though not much of it and it reduces to ring fast. Some thin sticky lace."
"a - pours a bright golden color, moderate ivory head with decent retention and great lacing, fairly cloudy"
22 oz. into a snifter
Bottle picked up by my buddy ArthurPendragon. Consumed on 10/11/2009 and poured into a snifter. The beer is transparent straw golden with a creamy one inch head. Retention is good and a little lacing is scattered.
Had on tap at O'Brien's in San Diego in August 2009.
sunny day
"Had this on-tap at the Toronado San Francisco anniversary fest. I really, really liked this beer. I've been an Alpine fan for a while, and I think they do a great job with their hoppy beers. I love the zingy, bitter hop onslaught on this one coupled with the spicy rye, it just really works for me. Poured golden with a wispy head, but very nice continuous lacing. Very fresh tasting herbal hops in the nose, quite a bit of dill aroma that I get from the Nelson Sauvin hops sometime, and a bit spicy in the finish as well. I just love the taste of this beer. Lots of herbal hops followed by lots of pine, pretty much my favorite hop situation. Long, tangy, spicy, piney, and herbal. Beautiful interplay between the spicy, slightly sour rye and the hops. Very bitter and long in the mouth with quite an austere malt profile. This is a delicious beer, but its a mouthful."
"A: Clear golden body. Moderate white cap, decent retention and spotty lacing."
Tap at Toronado 22nd Anniversary.
"This is a beautiful beer in all aspects. I love the color, probably the lightest IPA you can find. It has about 7% ABV which gives the body but it's still a ""light"" IPA. The one aspect that sets this beer apart otherwest coast IPAs is that it doesn't have a harsh bitter finish, this might be due to the New Zealand hops. "
On tap at the Toronado 22nd Anniversary Party. Comes in at 7%. Poured into a pint glass.
I ordered a pint of Nelson on tap at Toronado in San Diego.
"Growler from the brewery on release day. Gold with a lasting white head. Super green, dank, spicy, grape, and mango hop aroma. Awesome. Smells like no other IPA that I've had, yet is unquestionably one of the best hop aromas that I've ever come across. The flavor has a similar light toasty malt to their other IPAs, but with just a touch of rye spice. The hop flavor is all there, but is not too bitter at all, just very dank, fruity, and juicy. The body is on the light some with smooth carbonation. I know that this is at the peak of freshness, but damn this is amazing. Unique and just awesome all around."
"On-tap at Blue Palms, "
Shared by Pehlman...thanks! Poured from a growler into an Alpine Pint glass. 
"On tap at O'Brien's in San Diego, CA on 7/11/09."
I can remember the first time I tried this beer I hated it. But that was years ago when my mouth thought good beer was Pacifico or Miller High Life. HA! 
"his is honestly one of the best I have come across hands down. I knew it would be good, but wow, blown away would be the appropriate term. Served cold and poured into a pint glass, this growler was consumed on 05/06/2009."
"Big thanks to Dave (d0b) for sharing this, and to JesseTheHutt for sending these growlers all the way to Chicago! Served in a pint glass."
Big thanks to JessetheHut for sending this growler my way. Split two ways with BA pecorasc.
Thanks Jesse!
Served on tap at Toronado SD
"Perhaps the ultimate Southern California IPA. Had on tap at Downtown Johnny Brown's in San Diego. Poured a light yellow color, almost the color of a lager, but plenty of lacing and sheeting action on the glass. Strong piney and floral aroma. A decent amount of malt, with a little detectable sweetness, but all the piney and slightly floral hop goodness was definately center stage. Excellent crispness to the hop bitterness. Just a joy to drink and right level of carbonation."
"This beer is made with 100% Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand. The hops variety was named for the gooseberry-like flavor it imparts to beer, which is similar to the taste notes of a sauvingon blanc wine. I'll have to take their word for it, since I don't think I've ever had gooseberries before. I don't even know what they look like."
Growler acquired in trade with WeeHeavySD. 
"Appearance: A vigorous pour from the growler produces two fingers of head that clings to the glass impressively. Hazy, bright and golden, this could be mistaken for a hefeweizen."
"Poured from a growler into a pint glass, from notes last month. Shows a rather clear medium golden color with a half inch of nearly white head. Bumpy head leaves lots of lacing initially, reducing through the glass."
5/9/09
On tap at O'brien's the other night.
"Clear gold with a medium white head. Pine, resin bomb in the nose with grass and grapefruit. More resin and pine in the flavor, with the citrus taking a back seat. Sharp rye taste in the back with minerals and a vinuous bite. I see this is listed as an APA here, even though the company calls it and IPA. Either way, it is an excellent beer."
Carcking open this beer was like coming upon an oasis in the hops desert!
A growler full of this love was given to me for Valentine's Day along with a growler of BP Victory at Sea....man am I lucky or what!?!
On draft at O'Brien's
"Poured from tap at Pizza Port (12-8-07). Poured into a pint glass a golden color with an egg shell white thick foam head. Smell is of rye bread mixed with slight citrus overtone. Taste is oh my god good...light malt mixed with dank pot pine taste all blended up with a mixture of pineapple and rye. Mouthfeel is light with smooth carbonation level. Drinkability is high with my first pint gone in 60 seconds, dont taste the alcohol and I could drink this beer everyday for years. The best APA I have tried but I really think it is almost more of an IPA mixed with APA mixed with the color and body of a hefe. Great job alpine now lets put it into bottles."
"Appearance: Pours a translucent golden body with a small, white head."
"I have been waiting to sample a beer made with Nelson Savin since they first hit the market. Lightly hazy, it even has some floaties from the growler, the beer is a light, copper color and it is topped by a ring of wispy, light tan colored froth. The aroma is quite distinct, certainly hoppy, but not as I have ever smelled before. It is quite herbal, with a note reminiscent of garlic chives, some musky hemp notes, and an almost woody grass-like note that can be quite pronounced at times. There is a fruitiness from the hops too, and with all of the herbal focus, it is not too far of a stretch to say this is like Sauvignon Blanc. It even has a touch of cattiness to it as well as notes of unripe grapes, lime and even some grapefruit if you really dig for it."
"A: Looks like cheap airplane orange juice...cloudy, sort of yellowish. The head even looks a bit like pulp, chunky and webby. "
On tap at Liars Club
"Nelson Rye IPA on-tap and cask conditioned at O'Brien's today...This is an IPA, definetely not an APA as listed, but what the heck...who really cares?"
"Had this at the brewery and filled up the growler. Excellent beer. Very fruity, but in a grapefruit kind of way. Looks like orange juice. So clean, refreshing, and goes down easy. I could pound this stuff all day long. One of these days, I will."
"On tap at the Bistro's IPA fest last saturday. All New Zealand hops, not sure of the variety used."
On tap
"This beer pours a cloudy light golden yellow color. It boasts a huge thick fluffy white head, with a slight yellow tint. The head fades very slowly, leaving many thick laces."
"Pours an opaque orange with a finger of white foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is orange, grapefruit, papaya, and watermelon. Nice tropical fruit aromatics, with light wheaty, biscuity malt notes behind. Flavor profile is grapefruit, papaya, orange, and light mango with light wheaty, biscuity malt notes behind. Big flavor with an aroma to match. Still, it doesn't scream tropical fruits or get right in your face to announce its presence. Good balance here. Mouth feel is lightly grainy, with a fuzzy, dry finish. It has a medium thickness. Overall, a splendid beer with big hop notes in both the aroma and flavor profile, while still allowing malts to peek through. Make no mistake, the hops are the story here though. "
"Looks great and smells fine but compared to DDH Fort Point this is a bit of a let-down. Bought in Boston and drank fresh. Side-by-side with DDH Fort Point and DDH Melcher Street, this was the middle of the three----but still an overall great Trillium beer!"
"Another excellent DDH Street Series IPA. This one is really smooth with excellent hop flavor, though it doesn't explode in the mouth like DDH Farnsworth did for me. The drinkability factor is high due to the mouth-feel. Overall, an excellent mid-ABV IPA that is a pleasure to drink."
Look- Poured aggressively into a Trillium tulip glass. With a two finger head. Picture does not do the color of this beer justice. Its a beautiful opaque and turbid yellow. 4.25
Canned 11 days ago.
Canned 8 days ago. My 50th review of a Trillium beer!
On tap at the brewery. Hazy orange. Smells of orange and tropical fruit. Tastes of tropical fruit and orange. Very bright. Some pale malt with a touch of sweetness. Low bitterness. Medium body. Good.
"the smell on this one is a rich orange citrus note. nice look, smell and mouthfeel. The taste is great off the nose, but the bitter hoppyness starts in the middle and lingers through to aftertaste."
Picked up a 4 pack of this at the brewery while visiting JLindros. Canned on 2/27.
"On tap. Haven’t had one of these hop milkshakes in a minute! Right in line with many of the rest in terms of looks, aroma, flavor. Powerful nose of fruit and juice. Flavor is really nice but it dies off sort of fast. Pretty yummy."
Poured from a can dated 2/27/18 into the pint glass
On draft at Trillium Canton.
"grassy, soft, peach and pear, grapefruit, white grape, some piney character. overall very smooth and an interesting hop profile."
Trying to get caught up on ratings
"Outstanding. Another winner on tap at Trillium's Canton location. Great, sweet palate with a rich body. The nuances of this palate don't quite hold up relative to DDH Fort Point or DDH Melcher: specifically, the citrus falls off and the high-notes of the palate aren't quite as robust as some of the other Trillium brews sampled today. Excellent nonetheless."
lovely tasting easy drinking ipa. thanks for sharing Brian. Light orange coloured body. Dry hopping adds to flavour. A bit boozy finish. well executed.
Trillium Beer Garden. Had half of this and half of Pocket Pigeon. Preferred the pale ale--this one was good but plenty stronger and more bitter.
"one of the better hazy ipa types i have had from anyone, these guys included. a generous hookup from my friend who picked this up near the source. stoked to get one of these less than a week old! trillium does these right, and its hard to be critical of them, they are part of starting this whole trend, and do it better than just about everyone. their cloudy ipa is even pretty, with a soft peach color about it and a wispy white head insanely lively and delicate looking. nothing thick or sludgy about this. i also find it interesting they use dextrose and other nonmalt type sugars, the feel of these always points to more grain not less, so its an interesting thing i am learning here. maybe just to boost the alcohol, not a lot of flavor coming from corn sugar from what i know. in any event, this beer is a delightful and intense expression of mosaic hops, incredibly tropical with white wine and peach and pineapple and guava all there in the nose, it takes me away to somewhere sunny all the time with palm trees and cool ocean breeze. fruity confections, hop shatter or dust or whatever they call it could be in play, sweet for a flash in a hoppy sense. the hops are so juicy in the flavor there is almost a tang to them, fresh meyer lemon and sharp white wine, its awesome. i think the critique that a lot of their beers in this style taste the same is valid, but not this one, the nelson is so prominent and fresh it could not possibly be mistaken with anything else. i appreciate the white wheat in here more in the texture than the flavor, and enjoy this being so fluffy and dry at the same time, perfect for these hops, and freakishly easy drinking for it being on the stronger side. i am okay with this trend continuing forever as long as at least someone is making beer this good! infinitely ahead of the competition for the most part, this is both exciting and arousing for me, a full sensory experience, and as good as this kind of thing can be. lucky to have had it so fresh!"
"This beer is perfect, the Simcoe hops stand out prerry nicely. Double dry hopping it just refines the flavor of it. This has pineapple all over. Really well executed."
"All these ""street""-themed beers from Trillium have been very rewarding, but none more so than the double dry hopped versions. this one features Nelson Sauvin along with their standard Columbus hop... 5/26/17 canning..."

A 16oz can with a canned on date of 5.25.17. So this one is 9 days old.
Absolutely my favorite! Hoppy deliciousness!
"P- Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City pint glass.Canned on 25-MAY-17."
"Buddy just brought this for me to try in Garmish, Germany. Super psyched to try...especially after I just returned from a road trip to Treehouse a few weeks ago. Pours pale gold and quite hazy as expected with some lacing. Nose is juicy Thai guava as well as grape and citrus. Taste doesn't shine quite as much, but still has nice melon and cracker. Very drinkable, and has a bit of bitterness to help the finish linger. Overall, a great beer."
"Explosively aromatic. And delicious. Better aroma than any TH can I've had this year, regardless of freshness. Love the gooseberry / citrus / tropical fruits of Nelson hops. Wow."
Look: Hazy opaque pale orange with a thin white head. Mild activity.

Draught
This one for a hazy and very juicy looking orange. It is completely opaque with a decent size head and a pretty solid amount of lacing.
16oz can poured into a teku glass
Looks like juice. Not even hazy just straight up vibrant murkiness. Smell and taste are pretty subtle. Light body and low bitterness
Obviously unfiltered which brings a whitish hue to the dirty gold color. Beautiful initial head but it fades quickly to rim bubbles and no lace. 
"L - flat-colored OJ. Has a milky glow that even radiates in the dimmest of lights. Loud, crackly head quickly dissipates. "
"Another great offering from Trillium. Has a good bitter bite that is missing from most ""juicy"" IPAs. Not my favorite hop bill but still excellent. Very Good."
Poured into a 13 oz Weyerbacher tulip glass canned on 3/28/17. Pours like orange pinapple juice with a two inch sticky white head that leaves behind plenty of webby lace.
Super hazy and plentiful fruit notes
"Poured 4/2/17 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery the previous day, into a mug glass."
"From a 16oz can, dated 03/28/17. Served in a nonic."
A: cloudy; deep gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a splotchy cap; very nice lacing;
"Poured into a Teku glass. A turbid golden yellow color with a frothy white head that left faint tracks. Big aromas of Chardonnay, tangerine, and dank earthy notes. The dankness rushed over my palate and blended nicely with the fruit: white grapes, oranges, and tropical fruit. A soft pillowy feel and a restrained malt presence. Huge Nelson hop flavor."
"Pineapple puree in my glass? looks thicker than most stouts produced in my home state... (sad face emoji). Guava/pineapple juice just touched auto-boner beer'd my nostrils, ridiculous. Its juice, this is a trick, there is no beer in this can, we have all been deceived. all lies, trillium and their perfectly balanced hops bomb/juicy/amazing beers... dammit."
"White peach, mango, green grapes and subtle hints of lime zest. Clean, cracker malt background. On the less sweet side. Nicely balanced. Fairly dry. Really delicious."
"Pour is your typical hazy trillium hue, this ones a little lighter than what I remember. Aroma is super tropical fruit forward, mango, kiwi and melons. Nelson hops definitely shine through, getting plenty of grapes here as well. Flavor follows the nose well, plenty of tropical fruit, with a nice grassy almost nectarine like finish. Soft pillowy mouthfeel. Nelson hops do some justice here!"
"Hazy orange with decent fizzy head, minimum lacing. Pineapple orange nose and taste, with moderate mouthfeel. This beer is right in Trillium's sweet spot. Thanks Will for grabbing me a few cans!"
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a hick white head that lingers. Smell is tropical fruit, pineapple. Taste reflects the same with soft notes of kiwi. Superior feel, incredibly smooth. Everything they do is world class but this one stands out"
Fully opaque maize yellow with a soft white blanket bordered by raised edges.
Appearance: Hazy yellow with some orange hue. Can't see through this one at all.
Cloudy hazy golden orange. White head with lace. 
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"This is my favorite beer from Trillium, bar none. Imagine your cheerleader girlfriend in high school. Am I painting a picture? She looks exceptional; in this case, her blonde highlights glow against the sun and radiate in extract brilliance to let you know that her excellence is magnified exponentially against all types of weather. I can see her haze in the pouring rain. She smells like a grapevine; herbaceous; tropical; a melange of candy corn and ripe stalk. She tastes like Starburst lip gloss mixed with Ariana Grande sweat, when it's side to side. It's tropical; it's semi-bitter; it even gives notes of raw earth on the back end. Rustic. Her lips are soft; semi-dry; pulling me back for more. BAs, we should all be so lucky to drink from the mother maple tit. This beer shines when the world is dark. LARRRGE™."
Absolutely fantastic. The Nelson Sauvin is wonderful here - pineapple and earthy white grapes. Bitterness and mouthfeel are perfect and the finish is long. One of the best beers I've ever had. yb
Consumed 1/18/17
"L: Pours a viscous hay, apricot, merigold, and yam with a white foamy head"
"Canned on 1/9/17; drank in a tulip on 1/17/17; another amazing beer from an amazing brewery; Trillium has really seemed to adapt the use of Nelson hops in such a unique way; however, this particular batch is a tad thinner than I am used to in their IPAs"
"From can. Pours a super cloudy orange. Looks like the Simply mango and orange juice mix. Huge head, strong lacing. Dollop of foam lingers on top. I could smell this beauty from across the kitchen. Dank but with a Wet hop; not quite tropical fruit but straight delicious smelling. Nice and juicy. Not as much wow factor as on the nose but perfect balance of bitter and tropical hops. Awesome feel. Sticky coating, nice and bubbly. Def one of the best and I dare say easiest drinking IPA I've had from them."
16 oz. can dated 01/09/17
"Look:Looks like orange juice, very hazy, nice head."
"Loving these DDH Trilliums, canned 1/9/17, ""21 Sauvin"""
"Pours a murky, milky, golden fleshy fruit color. There's mango and white grape aroma. It's not as pungently aromatic as I expected. There's mango, pineapple, peppercorn, lime, and acrid vegetal hop character flavors. The finish is what is really off putting with this. It's bark-like and intense, if it were resinous, it'd be a nice feature. As typical with Trillium IPAs, this is nice and soft. It's the evolution of flavors in this beer that I am not crazy about."
"So delicious. From a can dated 1/9/17. Beautiful hazy pour with great citrus nose and taste to match. I'm not too familiar with the Nelson hop and man is this fruity. Also, first time at the trillium brewery today. Really impressive space and selection. Can't wait to try these cans over the next few weeks as it does taste a bit green and seems like it will evolve even more."
"Canned 1/9/17, ""21 Sauvin"" ... this is a more than solid offering that is almost on DDH Congress level. Kiwi, gooseberry, white grape on the nose; some banana and stonefruit come to play as it warms. All of it combines to form a smell I can only describe as Fruit Stripe gum (with the zebra on it.) Crazy! Dry and prickly up front. I'm tasting orange peel, lime, papaya, pomegranate, and tangelo with tons of hop resins coating the tongue. High carb rounds out a sharp-edged brew that somehow manages to retain some dank quality throughout. It's not totally balanced as the hops really assault you towards the end of the pour. Seems like this will taste really killer when it's less green in ten days or so, hope to grab more before they run out. Awesome first batch and a worthy addition to their DDH Street series."
"Awesome beer, so smooth. Trillium has done it again, great beer."
"Appearance, aroma and mouthfeel is what you expect from Trillium. After awhile, while all outstanding, I would find it difficult to tell anyone which is fort port, congress, vicinity, head room, etc. They set the bar high, no doubt, but they are all indistinguishably delicious to me. This is the same, impressive, and perhaps the best use of Nelson I've ever tasted. I wish i had rows of this in my fridge, yet I might not know the difference between this and ddh fort point unless I did a side by side"
"From a growler. Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is orange creamsicle, muscato grape, pineapple, and grapefruit rind on the finish. Sweetish start with dry bitter finish, medium bodied and medium-high carbonation. Stillings Street is one of my favorite Trillium IPAs and the DDH version comes very close to its amazingness. The bitterness works well with the body. This is an all day IPA. I usually prefer either the DDH version or most of the time the regular version of Trillium's IPAs. These are both great. Worth seeking out."
"Pours a murky pale orange in color with a finger of white head of white head with average retention. Aroma is very nice and quite complex; white wine, subtle tropical fruit and lemon notes, and a bit of a green/grassy quality. In the taste I get cantaloupe, subtle white wine notes, zesty citrus, and a moderate bitterness. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall another solid IPA from Trillium, a great showcase of Nelson Sauvin."
L - Orange milkshake. Murky body and a finger of white head.
"Pours a beautiful bold creamy orange/white with a one finger head. Smells of cereal grains, nelson, berries, sweet. Taste is tropical, dry and hoppy, into grainy malt and a stinging bitterness. Body is a little light for what's usually a bit more filled out in the ""Double Dry Hopped ______ Street"" series. Overall, this is a tasty IPA. Enjoyed it."
"Had this on tap at the Barking Dog Ale House in Haverhill, MA. The beer had a very murky orange appearance with no head. The aromas were strongly of orange juice but i could sense some lemon citrus. Very sweet and tangy, like orange juice, in flavor. This was a very crisp, carbonated beer; extremely refreshing. Overall, a great beer to have with a meal thanks to its incredible mouthfeel."
"Hazy and juicy, with a hint of mango in the after taste. Moderate aroma. No hoppy bite to the finish. Very ""New-Englandy"" style."
"A: The beer is rather hazy light yellow in color and poured with a quarter finger high bright white head that died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface, a narrow collar around the edge, and some lacing down the sides of the glass."
Not a fair review. Didn't rate on 3 categories. Can I received was 4 months old.
CAN
Pours a beautiful peach-orange color with a fluffy white head that reduces quickly to a ring and thin top layer. 
"Looks great with a nice pillowy head and opalescent body. Smells clean and fresh, my honest take away from the nose. Flavor wise it's crisp and delicious. This is a light yet flavorful brew"
A hazy looking brew with a fluffy white head. A tropical fruit aroma and flavor. There is some bitterness in there to go with the fruity flavors as well. Soft mouthfeel like many other beers in the style.
"Thanks to stillmatic2232 for this 16 oz. can. Hopefully it can wash away the bad taste of the first three episodes of Falling Skies. Terrible, terrible writing. "
"Cloudy yellow, hazy and opaque aggressive head that clings to the sides of the glass. Smells of mint, eucalyptus, rosemary, apricot, orange, and floral notes. Taste follows the nose with that bright minty, bitter hop presence leading the way and a nice bouquet of stone fruit and citrus in the background. Mouth feel was smooth, but slightly watery for me. Not much on the finish. Overall its a really nice beer if you get a chance to try it."
"A: Light gold with bursts of orange. Snowy white, well-packed head. A slight haze. "
Pours a hazy yellowish color with a 1 inch foamy head. Smells of pineapple and tropical fruit. Had a nice smooth mouthfeel. Has a pineapple mango sweet taste. Wonderful beer
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (shaker pint—JK! It’s JK stemware). This has a canning date of November 17, 2016 printed in black ink on the underside of the can (“CANNED ON 11/17/16 08:59:21”), which would make this beer just under four weeks old at the time of consumption. Refrigerated several days. "
Probably the best DIPA to date I have had from Grimm and I have had most of them. Juicy as hell and nice hoppy bite but still drinkable. You need to track this one down!
Appearance: A serious bubble show that lifts an inch or so of foam over the cloudy honey colored liquid; plenty of lacing action
"On tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY."
"Another solid beer, great hazy ipa look, pleasant scent, decent mouth feel, but I was left wanting more in the taste department. Last Grimm beer I had was Awoogah and unfortunately for Magnetic Compass it had to live up to that. MC is a solid beer would drink again."
"Description: Hazy as can be with lots of white lacing along with a white head that quickly fades away. Color is like...Winnie the Pooh. Aroma is straight tropical fruit, mango, citrus, etc. The taste is similar with what seems like pineapple that fades to a bitter finish. The taste isn't bad, but I think it's a little one note. Body and mouthfeel are a standard IPA 'medium'."
"Canned 11/17/2016. Incredibly hazy pour, opaque golden yellow body in a snifter with a fluffy, tightly-packed white head. that leaves the desired lacing Huge hop aroma on this one; lime zest, overripe peach, kiwi tang, bitter citrus, ruby red grapefruit, dank herbal grass, guava nectar, tart mango, blueberry, white grape, mango puree, the list goes on and one. Lots of ripe, tropical, sweet and tangy fruit with a nicely balanced honey sweet malt backbone. Very crisp, creamy, and silky mouth feel; great sense of carbonation, sweet tropical fruit going down with mild pop of citrus and pine bitterness on the back end. The flavor follows the nose with an endless list of exotic descriptors. It's an incredible joy and privilege each time I am fortunate enough to experience one of Grimm's hoppy offerings."
"This is pretty good, but falls way short on the price point. Can was like 6 bucks. Are you kidding me? Pours a hazy NE ipa, some nice dry hop aroma, but not knock your socks off good. Nice full hop flavor on the back with strong bitterness for NE style IPA. Side by side in a NE ipa line up, this falls way short of Trillium/OH et al. Especially given the reviews, i thought this would be julius"
"Typically cloudy orange body, small quickly dissipating white head, fairly minimal, soapy lace. Appealing but mild aromatics, mostly fruity and slightly floral, vague citrus. Not as explosive in aroma as some of the other Grimm beers. "
"Fresh can. Orange-golden in color, cloudy with a tall sudzy head, good retention and lacing. The nose is a thing of beauty with massive sweet citrus, oranges and tangerines, some white grapes. On the palate, sweet citrus dominates up front with oranges and tangerines, ruby grapefruit, toasted malt and a clean pine finish. Easy drinking and massive flavor from 6.4%."
"Canned on 11/17/16, pours cloudy gold color with a thick foamy 2 finger white head that faded slowly and left outstanding foamy lacing coating the sides. Excellent looking beer."
"Fresh can, brewed in VA. I was really looking forward to this. I'm glad NYC has this availability. This is my least favorite hoppy grimm can. The bitter finish lovers will enjoy."
Currently #239 in the Top 250 and #8 in the Top New York state beers lists.
"Hazy gold pour with 2 fingers of white head. Mosaic forward aroma, strawberry, tangerine, melon, floral. Citrus up front, floral, hoppy, light chive, cracker malt, passionfruit. Medium body, good lacing and a dry finish. Another winner, easily approachable."
"Second one and have to hand it to Grimm for another great IPA. Juicy, smooth, and aromatic. Hope this one comes out again, right up there with Lambo Door!"
"As advertised, only bitterness lends itself to orange peel. All day drinking enjoyment."
Another winner from Grimm
"Had it on tap out of a wine glass. Beer has a light golden color with medium plus haze and a bright white head. Aroma jumps out of the glass with tropical fruits. Mangos, pineapple and tons of white peach. Aroma does not translate to the palate. Very light juiciness quickly transitions to a strong pithy bitterness. Mouthfeel is on par for its ABV and has a strong drying effect from the bitterness. Normally I expect Grimm's IPAs to sit on the sweeter end of spectrum but this one goes full on bitter juice bomb. 95.25 points!"
"Rolled the can before pouring. Poured a very hazy golden yellow with a fingers worth of head. Smells great! Various fruits, candied and stone and some spices mixed with bread. Very juicy to start of with tones of citrus and stone fruits before its balanced with malt and bitterness. I am really enjoying the combination of juiciness with a heavy amount of bitterness. Could be my favorite Grimm IPA/Beer yet."
Super fresh tall can...Canned on 11/17/16 on the bottom
"Another fantastic Grimm IPA. I wouldn't say it's their best, but then they make some mighty tasty IPAs to contend with. I can't wait for these guys to finally nail down their own brewery and crank out cans on a more frequent basis."
"Thanks BrianS52 for the great recommendation!!!! This is the best Grimm that I've had! Poured from a growler, golden orange color with super tropical notes!"
This beer is amaze balls. Juicy and the best Grimm I've had yet. Big thanks to BrianS52 for the hookup. Looking forward to trying the other Grimms!!
"Picked this up a while ago in New York, as this beer had a date of 6/7 on the bottom. Even without rolling, there weren't a lot of particles suspended in this and even more amazingly, this was the best beer from Grimm Ales that I had so far as this went down so smoothly and had everything in near-perfect proportion, down to the last sip!"
"From a growler, pours a beautiful, bright golden orange with a finger or so of white foam. Webby lacing. Bit of haze but more clear than hazy. "
L - Big fan of the hazy NE style IPA's 
"Murky deep gold leaning towards a bit of copper, totally translucent."
L: Pours an incredibly murky dark hay with some orange and golden hues. Good sized head with very nice foam retention. 
Not sure why this one isn't rated higher. One of the best from Grimm. Huge juice bomb and there is the finish is really smooth. Wish I had some more of this one.
"I just wish it was easier to get anything Grimm. Believe it or not as good as this is its Grimm's 4th best IPA after Lambo Doors, Tesseract and After Image n its still a excellent brew. Please, make the step and get your own brewery. Luv all things Grimm."
"Canned on 6/7, enjoying on 6/29, and I believe it's even better than the one I had 10 days ago. A hay straw golden color. Didn't roll at first, but swirled the remaining half in the can and poured into my teku and boy did it get nice and hazy. The NZ hops are jumping out in the aroma, and it's fantastic. Mango, orange, light peach and tangerine. Has a nice mouthfeel, medium, properly carbonated. Overall this is one of the better single IPAs from Grimm. Loved it"
"Poured from a can dated 6/7/16 into a snifter. Hazy, golden straw color with minimal head and lacing. Abundantly floral, tangerine, grapefruit aroma. Bitter taste with similar grapefruit aftertaste. Light mouthfeel that works in this beer's favor. Overall really good and would enjoy having more."
"On draft at Rattle n Hum West in NYC. Pours a hazy gold. Nose is absolutely sublime. Huge orange, tangerine, stone fruit, mango. Taste is similar with orange and tropical fruit being dominant. Uber mild bitterness on the finish. Feel is smooth, almost silky. Overall, another excellent IPA from Grimm."
Poured from a 16oz can into a Speiglau IPA glass.
L: Golden yellow hues with an ample haziness and 2mm fluffly white head
"L - super hazy, one finger head fades to a thin layer, lots of lacing"
"This one sits right behind Tesseract and Lambo Door for Grimm's best IPA. Pours hazy straw, crisp and fruity taste. As always, cool label!"
Amazingness in a can!
Appear : Hazy golden yellow. - 4/5
On tap. I am a sucker for mosaic and this comes off as having a very soft but present mosaic backing. Maybe now a fan of Rakau too! This beer wins at the feel level. What is becoming a more typical and welcome easy drinking yet dank/tropical east coast IPA. It is getting harder and harder for them to be distinctive but who cares? Another great addition to the world and props to Grimm. Can't wait to drink this again.
L - hazy golden orange
"L: Peachy yellow, nice white head that lingers. That glow only a well executed NE IPA has, shining eternal."
"This beer pours a completely opaque, cloudy, orange juice color with a dense, bright white, 2 finger high head that takes a while to fade to a 1/4 inch ring around the edge of the glass. There are hanging chunks of lacing. Smell is amazing. It doesn't leap out of the glass, but when I stuck my nose in, holy crap, a burst of citrus and tropical fruit went right up my nostrils and blew my mind. Candied orange, mango, melon, grapefruit, pineapple and tangerine are all there in spades. Taste follows suit, excellent as well. Feel is light side of medium and creamy with a slightly resinous finish. Overall a fantastic beer. World class. Probably my favorite beer by Grimm to date."
"I've had this on tap and out of the can. It reminds me a lot of Singlecut's Softly Spoken Magic Spells or a Trillium beer. Hazy orange color, juicy, very enjoyable."
Another great IPA variation from the guys at Grimm. The new hops do have that stone fruit taste which I love in a sour much less a hoppy beer. The color is on point and nice and cloudy which I love the unfiltered nature of these beers. Fruity aromatics and a light bitterness but very clean tasting. One of the better IPAs I've had this year. Cheers!
Pours a very hazy golden color. Decent 2 finger head that dissipates all too quickly leaving mild lacing behind. Very inviting look.
16oz can from Noble Grains on the UES NYC.
"Definitely my favorite Grimm single IPA yet. Murkier in appearance than many of their IPAs. Nose smacks of tropical fruits with some herbal notes creeping in at the end. Taste follows, very juicy with just enough bitterness on the back end to tie it together. Really creamy, soft Grimm mouthfeel, accentuated by the oats. Really, really great IPA."
Canned 11/17/16. Consumed 11/26/16.
Much much better than DreamWeapon. Beats out ForceField in my book as well
The beer comes in a medium plus hazy light gold color.
"This beer is one of the best IPA's i have ever had , loads of hops taste and a very bitter bite, yet mildly sweet at the same time with plenty of suds and froth feel . It just makes your taste buds go wild. the beer is acloudy looking medium amber with a frost white head."
An awesome ipa with a full flavor of mosaic hops and an exceptional amount of floral undertone. When you pour it you will smell sunflowers and with the pineapple quenching flavor it adds to an experience any ipa lover will crave.
Best IPA in TX hands down
Strange beer
Made an account just to rate this beer 5/5. Best beer ive had coming out of texas.
Crisp and delicious grapefruit with a pineapple finish. Fruity Mosaic hops all day against a light backbone. Very good IPA.
"Pours a slightly hazy, grapefruit juice color with a big thick head. Much carbonation to be seen. Lacing is good. Has a different aroma in that hoppy smell that I would call, delicious. Has a nice flavor and the hop character comes on the back end. It's got a thin mouthfeel for an IPA and goes down fast and easy. Overall it's nice beer that drinks easy and not overpowering in the hops or the alcohol. It's unfiltered and unpasteurized. Mosaic whole cone hops are used. I would buy this one again. Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle dated 07/03/18 into an Imperial Nonic. It's big enough to share and somewhat pricey. A good starter for the non-IPA folks to try. www.lonepint.com"
16.9oz bottled 7-3-18
"Texas Beer.yummy. nice mouthfeel, grapefruit and orange peel. nice bottle 16.9 ounces. pretty artwork. this is really good, 12.99 at the HEB in Belton, TX, I couldn't wait for it to chill all the way so it was only about 65 but it was really good. Hell to be honest I bought it for the bottle."
Beautiful
"Smells like sweaty gym shoes but damn, it’s tasty. A beer lovers IPA"
October 2015
Draft poor. Fantastic smell and great mouth feel. Highly recommend.
16.9 oz bottle poured into can glass.
Pours a cloudy deep golden yellow. A thin white head forms and settles to a ring & thin cap on top. The smell is of pineapple and tangerine with faint notes of flowers and pine. The taste follows with tropical and citrus being the dominant flavors. Mild bitterness on the finish. Medium texture with medium carbonation. Simplicity at it finest.
"One of the greatest Texas IPA's I've had the pleasure of trying; Nice, hazy yellow-orange, A little unfiltered, this beer leaves splashes of lacing on every side of the glass in an unfamiliar way. Smell is tropical mainly, with hints of fruit, citrus, and just a little spice. A lot of tropics on this one. Flavor is like the smell but subdued in a very IPA-characteristic way. Nice hops and bitterness on the finish to remind you this isn't just a larger bodied, tasty beer. Cheers."
"Hazy yellow color with off-white foam. Aroma has grainy malts with well integrated hop flavors. Floral, milky yeast, ripe apricots. Taste follows with grainy malts, some bread, subtle hops with really nice flavor. Medium body with soft carbonation. Really easy drinking and tasty IPA."
Yummy mosaic barleypop. Smashing!
"Pours a deep orangish color, very opaque, with a huge, thick, fluffy head."
"Sampled on draft. I admit to not having much passion for IPAs, but this beer has definitely changed my mind. Hands down, my favorite IPA thus far. A strong malty presence with somewhat of a pineapple follow. A very drinkable, balanced single-malt that still maintains tons of character. Try it if you get the chance."
"16.9 oz bottle at Uchi Japanese restaurant, poured into a 6 oz. glass. Complex, interesting, drinkable. "
"Golden pour, large rocky head, rings of lacing. Balance is the name of the game here, with pineapple, floral hopping balanced out by a solid malt backbone, light earl grey, grapefruit, light bread, pine. Lighter to medium body makes this far too drinkable."
"Quite a nice Mosaic showcase, but with a solid malt backbone more befitting the SMaSH moniker. A bit thinner than expected, with subdued and subtle flavors but somehow also full on the mouthfeel impression. Enjoyable tropical fruit flavors, ahead of its time."
"Pours hazy gold. Foamy, thick, short white head with good lacing."
"Very nice, slightly hazy light gold. Not much head left when the waitress finally brought it to the table. Bright citrus/pine smell. Good complex flavor despite the single hop, single malt. You can tell it's a well crafted product that a lot of effort went into making it."
Look is a slightly hazy light apricot and poured with a finger plus of white head.
Poured from the bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Bottled July 25th 2017.
"Poured from fridge temp. Pours an opaque yellow with strong and robust white head. Nose is aromatic pine, citrus peel, mint, a bit of salt, bread, and hops. Taste is really smooth. Hoppy bitterness, citrus peel, a bit of salt. Mouthfeel is dry and sticky. Bitterness lingers like grapefruit peel. Really nice."
"What a juicy drinkable IPA. Pours gold , some lacing, nice frothy white head. Aroma is super fresh citrus and pine. Taste is the same but even better, slightly bitter. Feel is light-medium carbonated and softer than most IPAs I've ever had. Overall, one of the most straightforward, yet tasty and drinkable IPAs I've ever had!"
"One of the best smash IPA's, usually (I'll explain in a minute). Poured into a large glass reveals an instant aroma of citrus and pine and a hazy unfiltered appearance with a medium head. The taste is pure joy in a glass with a strong grapefruit citrus flavor. Has a slight carbonated feel in the mouth. My only complaint is that Lone Pint seems to be inconsistent with this brew from time to time. I've had it when it's awesome and other times so so. If they can get it together, this will be the hard one to beat."
"Yellow Rose IPA has a very thick, frothy, off-white head, a yellow-gold, hazy appearance, especially following the ""swish & pour"", and heavy glass lacing. Aroma is of sharp, piney hops, and the flavor is of pine, citrus fruit, sweet, white bread, and overall sugar. Mouthfeel is medium, and Yellow Rose IPA finishes mostly dry. "
"Tasted from bottle. Pours a murky yellow with huge thick white head. Aroma of pineapple, melons, lemons. Taste is a nice clean bitterness throughout that is very well balanced. Flavors of pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, caramel. Excellent IPA."
"This beer pours a very hazy golden orange color with a two finger, super dense, bright white head. It retains a one finger, rocky cap for the entirety and leaves tons of chunky patches of lacing all over the glass."
Very bright white head. The color of the beer is cloudy...very cloudy. Nose has an aroma of lemongrass or grapefruit. The taste is definitely pineapple. The follow up or aftertaste is almost nil in my opinion.
Straw appearance with a small white head that desipates quickly. Aroma is a mild hoppy with slight citrus touch. Taste is a very heavy feel with a smooth hoppy taste with a mild citrus touch that is very pleasant.
L: Hazy yellow grapefruit juice colored with a very large creamy white head and lots of rings of lacing around the glass.
"Pours a beautiful dark hazy gold with massive head that lingers. Good lacing. Strong grapefruity citrusy smell. Great moderately carbonated and creamy sensation as it travels through your mouth. Massively balanced malt and hops extravaganza upon contact with your taste buds. I'm picking up malt sweetness up front with grapefruit and pineapple hoppiness hitting almost immediately, along with berrys, and other fruity flavors. The malts and hops stay on your palate throughout the trip across your tongue. This IPA is the most complex, amazing, pleasing experience since Two Hearted Ale. Probably better than Two Hearted, and that's saying a lot!!!! Give this one a try!!!!"
"One of the easiest to drink IPAs I've ever had regardless of ABV. Great floral flavor. Nice yellow pour, delicious."
It's good. It's diversely malty and hoppy at the same time. Top 250 though? Not sure how that is.
"appearance- Golden amber color, cloudy with some visibility, and pours a one inch head."
Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Bottled 3/13/17.
Poured into a Duvel tulip. Label says 03/27/17.
"Nice beer! Pours a semi hazy straw yellow with light orange hue. Nose is the star! Bright and fresh. Fresh cute citrus and melon. Taste of fresh cut oranges, light pinnaple juice and honeydew melon. A bit of malt character in there as well. Medium to full bodied with a crisp somewhat dry finish."
"Partial because I'm a Texan but this IPA is in the pantheon for me. Taste is on par with any alchemist, trillium, or Treehouse I've had. Wish it was unfiltered for a better experience but this is the best beer in Texas."
"Impressively tasty considering the journey to VT. Many other IPAs from closer breweries haven't held up nearly so well. It was clean, light, and refreshing with bright hop flavors. The person who shared the bottle with me wasn't as impressed, but he'd heard it was like Heady and it really wasn't at all. Still, I really enjoyed my pour and look forward to trying another."
"Great use of the Mosaic Hop. Golden slightly unfiltered look, nice pineapple and floral nose, and citrus pineapple taste. Fluffy creamy white head hangs around nicely to accompany the back half of glass. So clean, so Mosaic, so pleasant of a beer! Wish I was local to this one."
"Floral, pungent, sweet, graceful. Bottled on 3/20 and enjoyed on 4/2. Beautiful packaging - from the bottle shape to the artwork to the varied cap and the cardboard holder. Incredible presentation. Yellow gold pour with slight haze and a fluffy white cap. Aroma is papaya, nectarine and melon. Inviting. The taste is a cascade of citrus hops to smooth malt and a balanced bitterness. Orange rind, guava, tangerine, melon and a faint floral and honey note that surfaces late in the sip. Wow. Very complex flow of flavors. Nothing heavy handed about the hopping - a balanced beer that exhibits grace from start to finish."
Bottle shared by jc1762. Thanks Jon!
"opaque bronze colors ale with an eggshell head. beautiful mosaic nose with elements of guava and pink grapefruit flesh, plus whole grain cracker. flash of something buttery (diacetyl?) on the first taste took away a little from the flavor, but the resurgence of the hop aromas on the tongue kept me interested. medium bitterness at the back end, and average to lower co2 overall."
I love this beer. My brothers always told me when I come home that I need to try it. I tried it last year and now I always pick a 4 pack on the way to see my brothers. It has an amazing taste on the pallet. It felt as if the beer opened a new side of me I never knew. It so smooth and has great flavor. Highly recommend it if your in Texas.
"Pours a semi hazy deeper yellow. Strong citrus on the nose. Very pleasant citrus on the palate as well with an easy bitter finish. Overall, a very good IPA. Not sure how easy this is to get in TX. Close to some of the East coast IPAs."
I've been trying to get a hold of this beer for some time. Got the last 4pk at Whole Foods today. Very cool label. 16.9 oz bottled 1/17/17. A little over 2 weeks old.
Knockout grapefruit/citrus nose. Great head and lacing. Soft and approachable front palate with a good follow-through. Top 10 IPA for me.
"This is my go to IPA when I cannot decide or do not feel like experimenting with other IPA's. I am not happy about the new bottle design but hey, it all about what's in the bottle, right?!"
This is a very unique (and delicious) beer. Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was dated 1/2/2017 and I drank it 5 days after (quite fresh).
"Wow. Been to Texas many times to visit family, and always came back wanting more from local breweries. Jordan though at HEB in Vintage Park recommend this. Awesome - this poured an extremely clear yellowish lager color so I was not expecting the fruity hop bomb that came. This was almost west coast like, and a great find . Nice stuff. Now don't sell to InBev!!"
Sweet Tropical Aromas. Juicy POG flavor. Medium body with integrated hops. Clean tingle finish there are the hops. Very nice beer.
"Not a lot of bubbles, and the color is washed out amber, but the flavor is amazing. If you like floral hops, it is awesome. No head, sweet flavor with amazing citrus hops. Beers claim to have grapefruit or floral flavor, and then it is malty and dry. This provides exactly what citrus hunters are looking for. It is not pretty, but the flavor is there. Look to ""wolf among weeds"" from LA brewery Golden Road, but this Texas brew is amazing. A rare find and totally satisfying. What it in CA."
"Very unique IPA. Has an interesting flavor, almost herb like with some honey notes. Overall, a great IPA, beautiful, flavorful, one of a kind even, but not what I was expecting. Cheers!"
16.9 oz. bottle poured in Imperial Pint glass
"Great, fairly mild, IPA, with a nice fruity flavour. First taste gives the impression there may be a bitter aftertaste, but it has very little; with a very clean finish."
"16 oz pour at Bangers in Austin for $6.5. Slightly hazy orange color. Little to no head. Not super aromatic, maybe light grapefruit and peach. Flavor is much better, tropical side of Mosaic with pineapple and some of the characteristic berry. Feel is slick, medium light body and same carb. Very over rated unless I got a pour of an old keg.."
"A: Hazy, light orange, white head that lingers"
"This pours a murky golden color - lots of carbonation bubbles in the beer. The head is extremely thick - 4 finger, and frothy white. The nose has the nice citrusy smell associated with a good IPA. The taste is, once you get through the head, is wow! Citrus, but not too bitter. somewhat mellow, but it works very well together. The feel isn't watery at all. Solid beer from this brewery, and gad I was able to get a bottle of this to enjoy, because I am."
Very interesting and unusual IPA. Beautiful bottle for all you collectors out there - love the amount of information and transparency in the description of the beer and brewery printed right on the label. Interesting mix of fruit and yeast in the nose and taste. Definitely an IPA that I'll look forward to drinking again.
Yellow Rose is a solid IPA. The citrus notes come through real nice and it has a nice dank taste. Had a little bitterness at the end. Nice yellow body on the pour.
16.9 FL. OZ. bottle
On draft in a regular pint glass in College Station. 
"Poured from tap at BJ's in Katy. Very hazy, almost looks like a hefe. Not much Head. Initial smell is oranges and lemon. Taste is floral and citrus. Reminds me of sculpin. Excellent."
"A - Hazy yellow body, an electronic shade, with a head of white, persistent, and lost of lacing."
"500ml bottle, dated 8.29.16, poured into a 16oz tumbler glass. Enjoyed on 9.26.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"Wow, I didn't realize what I was about to experience when visiting El Paso for a quick business trip! We went to the Hoppy Monk for after dinner drinks with a crew of mostly non-geeks that ordered amaretto sours all night. The bubbly waitress gushed all over YR when I asked for a great local IPA and she wasn't kidding. Beautiful nose on this one, very reminiscent of some of the more tropical IPA's out there but with a breadier malt bill. Taste follows the nose with hints of blueberry and maybe peach? A totally unexpected surprise that I wish I could have hauled home!"
"Hazy, two finger white head"
"Have consumed YR for over 1 year now mostly via the 750ml via HEB or Specs. YR had never failed to deliver a top 3 Texas IPA product. That changed this week, as I bought the new 4 pack of pints. The born date was 9/19, and the purchase was made 9/21, oh yeah-things are looking up already!"
750ml bottle poured into a tulip appears a hazy golden color with a big white cap 3 fingers strong that fades leaving stringy lace.
"Traded for this a few months ago and also had a sip of this on the Other Half line fairly recently. The ratings for this were really high on here and I'm pretty sure that I'm spoiled by all of the outstanding IPA's that have risen out of nowhere the last few years here in the northeast as I didn't think that this beer was amazing, like so many others on here. This was great and balance but it felt just a bit too light to come across as an IPA..."
"Excellent IPA. Best I've had this year. Was on beer safari in Houston, and was told that I should grab a Yellow Rose before I headed out of town. Had some free time so I drove out to Magnolia and had a fresh pint. Learned it was a SMASH brew using whole cone Mosaic and toped with heavy dry hopping as well. Went great with the Pilsner malt. Beautiful pour and laced down the glass top to bottom. Best mosaic taste I've had yet. Smooth easy sipper. So simple and so amazing."
"Long time favorite, a fine example of how a smash beer should be."
64 oz growler was poured into a pint glass.
"His does look terrific. Glass pour, hazy yellowish/ cidery appearance, nice white head and what turns out to be lacing aplenty. "
"On draft in Dallas. Pours hazy dark yellow. Citrus forward from beginning to end. Grapefruit flesh and pith. There's not a lot to this beer, but its sharp and refreshing. Light mouth feel. This is great for a simple, light, easy drinking IPA. I wouldn't trade for it or pay the price for a bomber, but it is a must try on draft."
"This is a balanced IPA with a smooth feel, floral nose, full hop body, and a little spice on the finish. Great experience!"
"When this stuff is fresh, it is almost unbeatable."
"Beautiful scent, clear white head, light yellow gold in the glass. Taste is clean and fresh hops, exactly as described. Loved it."
"I love how complex this beer is, especially since it is a SMaSH. Thanks to this beer, I now have a new found joy for IPA's. I litterally couldnt stand any IPA I ever tried, but due to hype locally, I had to try this one. Now there are not enough bottles on the shelves to keep me satisfied. Smells of grapefruit and a little pineapple. I dont get the blueberry in the smell, or in the taste. Taste follows the nose with a perfect bitterness and a slightly dry finish leaving me wanting another sip immediately after. In love!"
Draft beer at Banger's in Austin on 6/9/16
"Bottle. Nice to check off a desired beer. This was very tasty. Mosaic in a way I have never sen before. They tamed this hop but brought out it's best parts. I tasty, tamed dog. Just spicy enough. Very multidimensional. I enjoyed it's nuances."
"Enjoyed out of a 32 oz swingtop howler on 5/16. I'm almost certain it was filled on 5/6, so it's almost a week and a half old. Amazingly, this is not the freshest I've ever had it. Poured into a Speigelau IPA-specific glass. "
hate large-format bottled IPAs... but this WAS a bucket-list beer!
Love me some Mosaic hops. This is one classic IPA. Smooth almost creamy feel and retains a nice head. Light body for easy drinking but it's full hops nose and flavor. Sweet grapefruit and creme brulee are the stand-out flavors.
"Bright looking, musty earthy herbal smell almost like marijuana. Tastes more citrusy than smell suggests. Probably does better paired with food than alone. Not overly hopped, which is appreciated in this era of triple digit IBU IPAs. Good solid beer."
"Shared with me at a brewery release for a different beer. This beer lives up to its name. It is very golden and yellow. Smells citrusy and earthy. Tastes much the same but with a little more hop bite than the nose would suggest. Overall, this is a solid IPA that I will seek out again!"
"Pours an orange-gold with a hazy, tight, 1/8th inch bright white head embedded with pinpricks. Nose expresses light citrus, floral notes and chamomile. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a spicy quality most likely attributable to the mosaic. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild, even carbonation. Overall, a decent beer with a nice complexity which seems more consistent with a farmhouse than an IPA in my opinion."
"On tap at The Shack in Cypress TX. I had just had a Firestone Walker Union Jack and told my server we might as well shift gears and try a stout or something because I knew he wouldn't be able to bring me an IPA that I liked better. He asked me if I had had a Yellow Rose and when I said ""no"", he twisted my arm a little and I said ""bring it on"", though I doubted it would be as good as he said. Beautiful color and head and a nose that is amazing. The hops flavors explode in my mouth like fireworks. Now THAT is an IPA. Very pine-y but grapefruit as well. Definitely some dank, earthy notes around the edges. Perfect balance, perfect carbonation...this is just about perfection for me. Never rated a beer a perfect 5 but what part of this masterpiece isn't perfect? And it's all from one malt and one hop... amazing!"
L: bright orange with a finger of white foamy head
"Really great IPA that showcases Mosaic. It brings out all the character of the hop - tropical fruits, apricot, mango, and some pine. Perfectly balanced malt backbone with a huge hop aroma, bitterness, and flavor (many ""well balanced"" IPA's don't satisfy one's hop craving; this one does just fine)."
Huge thanks to Matt for letting me finally tick this beauty.
Best beer ever and this is my first choice anytime.
750 ml consumed within one week of bottling date.
"Pours golden and hazy with a huge three finger head. Smells of citrus, tropical and pine. Sticky. Flavor is a mosaic bath, hoppy, citrus, smooth. Juicy. Very drinkable. Really solid and balanced all around."
"Pine, Citrus, Funk on the nose, both on draft and in bottle. Color is murky yellow. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Honey, Pineapple, berry aftertaste. Love this IPA."
"Trying the Yellow Rose at Mojos Sports Bar and Grill in Hobble, TX. It poured a hazy golden with white head that is leaving an incredible lace. The scent and taste are what you'd expect from Mosaic hops. The Mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer."
"Bottle shared by Curran today, thanks man."
"Beautifully sculpted from the mosaic hop and from a short malt underpinning, the masterful brewers at The Lone Pint get the most out of the hops with copious amounts of the lupulin-filled cones and a bright and fruity ester boquet for a taste that falls between that of creamsickle and IPA."
"On tap, 03/01/2016."
Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. Acquired in a trade. 
"Pours gold, a bit dark, with mild haze. 2+ finger head is off-white and long lasting, receding to a layer of foam that stays to the last drop. Tons of lacing, very sticky."
"Drank on tap at Whip In, Austin, TX"
"On tap at Hi Hat. Aroma brings back memories of Germany. Right on the money with bananas and bubblegum. Body, taste all on target. I get the high ratings. Finally, a true American weizen."
Shimmering golden yellow with a massive white foamy head that leaves exceptionally enormous amounts of lacing no matter how many times you sweep over it with liquid.
"L: Murky yellow, big white head"
"I bought a bunch of Yellow Rose from the Lone Pint Brewery when I visited the Jester King brewery six days ago, and I recently opened and drank my first bottle, and what a delight. "
"poured this into a st feuillen grand cru glass and it poured a golden color with a small while head and beautiful lacing. it has a very light citrus smell. the taste is delicious, has as a subtle bitter bite and a it has a hint of sweetness. the feel Is smooth on the tongue. overall it is a crisp and clean ipa that I enjoyed after my bike ride."
"A bit disappointed in this one. Perhaps it was because I had trillium an hour or 2 before, but it fell short. I liked it but I didn't love it. "
Nose is very strong of the mosaic hops. Bitterness is present but not overwhelming. Nice citrus.
Bottle pour into a tulip. No apparent bottle date but was deemed to be fresh from my trade partner. Mosaic hops were detectable but overall this one was far too malty/almost oaky to enjoy...big-time disappointment. Likely past its prime but unable to tell for sure without a bottle date.
Wow. This one is a gooder. Very thankful to the Round Rock Specs beer gal who nabbed a bomber for me on my last visit.
"Cloudy straw color, rich foam and lacing. Citrusy aroma. Lemony hop flavor with just the right balance of malt. Delicious and easy drinking. Definitely seek this one out."
"Amazing single hop mosaic IPA. Cloudy straw color. Pours with a bit of a head that hangs around awhile. Smells and tastes like topical grapefruit goodness. Smells good but tastes amazing. Nicely balanced fruit, bitterness, and malty back. Incredible drinkable. Little thin on the mouthfeel, but the abv is lower. Probably my favorite non citra hopped single IPA."
"Wow, what a great IPA. Beautiful golden orange color (a bit hazy), with a nice foamy head (had on draft in a classic pint glass), foam has large bubbles and some stays the whole time. Smell is quite citrusy and tropical with a nice balance of hops. Taste follows the nose as much as any beer I've had - really really nice balance of fruit and hops and malt. Mouthfeel is also nice - not too thin, not too thick, and nice carbonation. A really great non-hop-bombed IPA."
750 ml poured into a pint glass. light white head with pale cloud appearance. Crisp and clean citrus and grapefruit in the nose and on the pallet. Excellent ipa. super drinkable. 
Too fruity or flowery
750ml bottle poured into a tulip
"I'm a cynic by nature, and I concede that I can be especially exacting on overly hyped, well, anything. So, here comes Yellow Rose, the pride of Texas IPAs, and I'm feeling as defensive as ever for another hyped brew. Then, it hits your lips -- egad, this is a tremendous brew! The fact that it's a SMASH pils malt + mosaic combo makes this even more incredible. Not just big flavor, but a nice diversity of flavors, which you'd otherwise expect only from a brew with a variety of hops/malts. Glowing orange hues in the glass, nice little enduring layer of foam, hazy, not opaque, though there was some debris in the glass even after a careful pour. Nose isn't ginormous but it's extremely pleasant, light tropical notes, a touch of something herbaceous. I know this is all Mosaic, but something about it reminds me of the better batches of Alpine Nelson. Anyway, the palate is where this shines, those notes from the nose coming out in full bloom, ever so light dankness, excellent bitterness levels, tropical notes, and that great high fruitiness you get from these new waves hops. This is a homerun of a beer and absolutely deserving of the hype. Well done, Lone Pint."
"750ml smuggled back from my road trip to Austin. Sexy looking beer, dark blonde and hazy but a little muddy. Great head, great lacing, sticks around. Aroma is fantastic, heavy on the grapefruit and apricot. Taste is super smooth, unique for an IPA. Not bitter or piney, but soft and fruity. Part of me wants a little more bitter edge to it, but that's a personal shortcoming I think. Mouth feel is very soft, and the carbonation creates a great viscosity, perfect for the style. Nailed it all around."
Really great beer
"750 ml bottle. Pours hazy apricot orange with thick fluffy head that recedes to a finger layer that lasts, rings of lace. Fruity watermelon aroma. Fresh Melon fruity taste with some nice grapefruit bitterness. Silky soft medium mouthfeel. This is a simple delicious IPA. The melon taste is not the usual overripe taste, but more of a fresh taste, yum."
Huge fan of this hoppy delight. Lots of citrusy floral flavors that pound the palate. Wish I had access to this on a consistent basis. Well worth the effort to find.
On tap. Mosaic hops are amazing. Smells as good as it tastes with a ton of tropical fruit notes on both ends. Medium carbonation. I'll go against the grain though and say Community Beer Company does the Mosaic better though.
Yeasty and chalky with lots of flower petal and big bitterness. Lacks the vibrant blueberry punch I dig in Mosaic. Pineapple linger
"The beer offers sweet grapefruit, hints of tropical and pineapple, a light bready malt in the middle and a medium bitterness on the back end of pine and herbaceous."
Draft from World of Beer in College Station. Pint glass.
Many thanks to Cherryadam (Andy) for the chance to try this IPA.
"Freshly tapped pour into a pint glass. Really a great beer. Wonderful floral smell and taste. A great balance with the floral and citrus taste, and just the right amount of bitterness and a little bit of sweetness. Nice to live less than 20 miles from Lone Pint!"
Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass.
Very overrated and just not that good in general for an IPA. I'm confused.
"Got this beer in a trade, "
"Beautiful. That describes everything about this beer. The color. The label. The aroma. The taste! All of it is beautiful. What a fantastic ""SMaSH, Single Malt and Single Hop, IPA"". The mosaic hop is just so damn good. One of the best IPA's I have had in a while. Well done!"
"Looks great in the glass - hazy golden color, with substantial white head. Fresh, pretty citrusy and floral hop aromas, with some light, clean maltiness. Similar flavors - elegant, balanced, pretty. Just enough clean, lightly sweet malt for balance, then a fully dry finish with a medium level of bitterness. Just very tasty. Smooth and extremely drinkable, with a fairly low level of carbonation which works well - almost creamy texture. Quite nice."
Smell is amazing. Top-notch IPA.
"Difficult to review this beer because of batch consistency, but based on the good bottles/draft: "
Hazy murky straw gold colored body. Head is an inch of creamy off white foam that has very nice retention. Paint brush strokes of pace are left behind. Nose is so lovely and unique for an IPA. Lemon bars and banana esters play to make a smoothie like feel. Like nothing I have ever smeed and so inviting. With first sip I actually get chills at how good this brew is. The initial balance is of floral hope and bready Belgian like malts. Sweet and electric mouthfeel is carried so well. A very nice finish to this brew with a classy dryness and distinct hop bitterness that is a pleasant surprise to the end of this beer. This is a very special IPA.
Got the bottle in a trade and excited to give it a try. 
"Of the few things to come out of Texas, this beer is a gem. Right up there with pit beer BBQ, honky tonk music, and fake DD's, this is an exquisite IPA. Juicy crisp and not bitter. What a damn good bottle."
Appearance - The beer presented a darker yellow color with a snowy white head. 
Shared this with a couple of friends at a share. Poured really cloudy. Good size very white head. Smell was meh. Lots to be desired. Left me searching. Taste was the same as aroma just searching to find flavors. Bland. Tasted like my first homebrew IPA. NOT IMPRESSED!!!
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a pure white head. Has a nice citrusy pine aroma. Flavor is a little softer than the aroma. Citrus, lemon a touch of pine. Very smooth finish with a touch of bitterness. A really delicious ipa"
Appearance: Hazy yellow glass holds a white halo and thin cover that lasts and laces a bit.
"Good little ipa here. Clean tropical flavors, papaya, mango and some orange jest. Getting an almost pilsner aftertaste. Finishes semi dry Not the most flavorful ipa out there, but it's extremely well balanced."
This is what I had always imagined a perfect IPA
750ml bottle poured into a snifter tasting glass.
"Thanks to Jakehoodlum for a bottle of this long-time want (OK, two bottles), as I’m always up for some world-class hops. How many IPAs comes in 750ML glass? Split with my wife. "
Absolutely fantastic beer. Single hop with Mosaic and it's as good as I've had.
"The best beer in Texas. Very near the flavor profile of more northern stalwarts like Zombie Dust. Excellent malt and hop balance keeps the bitterness in check and the finish clean without lingering. Citrus flavor is strong mid palate and remains noticeable through the experience. I must say I am a big fan, especially when found on draught."
Undated bottle at 42 degrees into snifter
Thanks to rudzud for sharing.
Great solid IPA. Almost reminds me more of a IIPA with it's thickness and amount of hops. One of the most bitter examples of mosaic hopped beers I've tried with a solid malt backing it up. Unique and delicious.
"Great taste not quite the level of a heady, but much better than most"
"From 750ml bottle received via trade. Pours slightly hazy gold with a big white head that leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is a beautiful meld of tropical fruit (grapefruit mostly) and hops. Taste is hop forward with lemon, grapefruit and maybe a hint of honey. Nicely carbonated, creamy mouthfeel. A fantastic take on the IPA."
If only this fantastic beer found its way out of Texas more often...
Received in a trade. Shared with JLindros.
A very tasty IPA with a good malt backbone and some fine hops both on the nose and in the taste. This is the best SMaSH beer that I have had and reminds me of the Midwest style of good hops but a really solid malt backbone
"I had this on tap again and once again, had to take home a growler full. It's an amazing IPA, it smells great, tastes great and is very easy on the palate. It has a nice, light yellow color with just a hint of white head. No lacing but no problem as the taste and smell is great. Although I typically like my IPAs really bitter, I don't mind at all that this is a little mellower than most. It doesn't matter because it tastes great."
"This one blew me away the first time I had it on tap, at Nobi Public House in Webster, Texas. The smell is magical and the taste is full of surprises, the after taste seems to change with each sip as well. I have found the bottles to be just as good and buy at least 1 whenever I see it, at $9 a bottle it is something to savor. I don't care for the murky color and high amount of sediment in the appearance, but i detect none in the mouth feel. Very smooth and versatile SMaSH IPA, fruity and hoppy. Nectar of the gods. Good thing my son dislikes IPA's, this one is all mine."
"This is a nice IPA, but single hop mosiac hoppy beers are just not my thing. Mild bitterness. Pretty drinkable IPA that has a nice mouthfeel. I also feel that the hype train might have some influence here on scores."
"Pours a lot darker than expected. Smell is strong with a floral aroma, not very strong on the hop smell. Taste and feel is very pleasant with a very dry finish. Notes of pineapple, fruits, and pine. This beer is a treat to say the least. I am honored to say that I have tried this beer."
Most overrated beer in the top 250. Don't understand why people all seek this out. Nose is grass and grain. hop bitterness and juiciness is lower than your average pale ale from any old brewery. finish is average. There just isn't really anything going on here. Maybe I got an old bottle shipped to me?
"750, light yellow. Slightly hoppy, low bitterness. Lotus of greens, Grassy, weedy, underbrush. Under-hopped for the amount of malt in my opinion. Like it was an IPA hopped in APA territory. Not seeing what the fuss is about."
"I love single hopped beers, it really makes the hop used shine. Yellow Rose perfectly displays the Mosaic hop in all it's glory. It pours with a yellow unfiltered hazy color with a strong 2 finger head. Smells of grapefruit with a small hint of lemon. The taste is incredible, hop forward with hints of grapefruit and lemon, finishes very clean with no lingering bitterness but just a touch of sweetness. A very delicious beer, will definitely be seeking this out again."
"Very smooth tasting beer that could be consumed again and again. I got a light citrusy aroma, nothing too strong. I got a little bell peppery finish as well- Not overpowering in the least. This is a great IPA."
A great single hop brew. Looked hazy and delicious..great mosaic hop smell with medium body and sweetness.. Had TG Pompeii the day before and found Pompeii to be superior. But overall I love mosaic hops and this beer is excellent.
Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
"Was lucky enough to get this in a trade. My usually go to is the New England IPAs so I wasn't sure how this would stack up. Pours a hazey yellow with a thick 1 inch head. Nice lacing as you drink it down. Aroma is grapefruit and pear. I get grapefruit at first and a bit of malt in the finish. Different but a really nice single hop, single malt beer."
Picked up a bottle at Whole foods and was disappointed to find it had skunked.
"Pours a delicate pale yellow with a robust white head that is sticky as hell. Aroma hits you initially with so much tropical fruits- pineapple, mango, papaya. Some dank qualities to this one, along with some citrus zest (orange maybe?). Taste is much the same, but maybe toned down a bit. The bitterness is is spot on though. It keeps it dry and refreshing. I would have loved for the flavors to be a little brighter and the body to be a touch lighter, but it's a small complaint. This is damn good."
On tap at Harvest House. Appearance was less cloudy then usual. Foamy mouthfeel that immediately gives way to dank hoppy goodness. Due to the manageable ABV the hops are allowed to do their thing without any alcohol burn. The taste and appearance remind me a lot of vintage Alpine offerings. One of the best single hop offerings out there.
Very nice ipa!!Excited to have gotten this as extra in a trade!!!
Thanks to GRG1313 for sharing this one at his tasting.
"Don't want to go into a long description, all I can say is it's got to be the best IPA in Texas! Try it, you won't be disappointed. Light sweet malt, with tropical slightly bitter IPA taste. This is one of the few IPA's that is totally unique. I would say that it's better than Pliny The Elder, but it tastes really different maybe because they use Whole Cone Hops. I'll have to visit this brewery soon on the way to Houston!"
I would love the know the yeast that gives this single malt so much diversity of taste!
Think the bottle was old. I can imagine if this was fresh it would be phenomenal!
Received a 32 oz growler of this beer filled on 7/16 from a trade. This beer is pretty fantastic. It has a pretty substantial mouthfeel and is slightly bitter. It's definitely a top-notch single hop beer.
"It well balanced and being a SMaSH IPA it showcases (really really well) the Mosaic hop, which is one of my favorites. The citrus and tropical fruits notes are rendered beautifully in both aroma and flavor. The malt doesn't disappear, but it's not the star. It definitely balances the hops wonderfully smooth bitterness. I also get some honey on the nose. This is a world class IPA and I'm so happy it a local. It's as good as any of the fabled northeastern APA/IPA's that I've tried."
Wow! The nose on the beer is INCREDIBLE. Seriosuly a beer worth trading for! Top 5 IPAS all time
A grapefruit bomb without the bitterness usually associated with that flavor. Very enjoyable.
"Aroma is wheaty, grainy, and very grapefruit forward. "
"L: Golden, very hazy, thick head sticks around"
"6-24-15 batch. I don't know if my palate is completely compromised by the juicy East Coast DIPAs I've been consuming as of late but I wasn't blown away by this. Granted, it's a single hop, single malt IPA which gets credit right away but I found an underlying mustiness present throughout. It has a more delicate floral sweetness than I was expecting from the mosaic hop, and there is no denying the malty, bready backbone. Didn't live up to the hype in my opinion."
"An absolutely brilliant IPA. Easily the Pliny of Texas. Crisp, refreshing, characteristic, and classy. Not the easiest to find outside of the Houston/Austin area but well worth the hunt."
Bottle at a bar in Nacogdoches; reviewed from notes.
Very well balanced beer... delicious!
"Beautiful label, delicious beer. Amazing all around. Only wish that it was sold in smaller format bottles/cans!"
"Been looking forward to trying this for some time. Much love to Nick for sending one along, pretty excited!"
Thanks to @patrickredbeard and my other TX connects for these bottles. They all love it and love to share it. Super example of the style! I am lucky to have had this on a few occasions.
"Pours a pale straw, forming a thick white head with heavy lace. The aroma is a huge bouquet of hop deliciousness. The taste follows the aroma with huge hop flavor, but the hops are very smooth with a nice malt base. No harshness. Medium bodied, smooth, with great carbonation. Overall, this beer lives up to the hype!!!"
"Most of the 750ml I got in a trade leaked out during shipment (bad cap), the 10 or so ounces I got was flat, so my rating reflects that...will revisit when I get the replacement."
"Had on tap at Buffalo Wild Wings in Conroe, Texas."
"Huge want, high expectations"
Pretty label. Pineapple and grapefruit nose. Hazy goldenrod body with a light medium bitterness and clean malt taste. Tasty tasty!
"pours a nice light yellow color with good white foam. Smells like amarillo hops - nice grapefruit smell. Taste is of grapefruit/tangerine and very hop forward, but not that bitter. Not a lot of malt there, but not a lot needed. The hops are the star of the show and this was a tasty beverage for a hot day in the sun working the grill."
This beer has a unique smell and taste with earthy or citrus finish- LOVE in a pint glass!
"I've had Pliney at the brewery, I've sampled Dorado and Pliney side by side at Toronado in SF been to Portland, been to Seattle, my friend from Boston sent me cans of Heady Topper this winter, we drank the Albuquerque IPAs last summer. Yellow Rose is right up there with all of the best hoppy American ales I've ever tried. Although I do believe this is the best IPA in Texas, this beer is not overrated just because it's from Texas. Because I live in Texas I can get it reasonably fresh which means the fresh hop aroma is there - citrus; grapefruit and orange. The appearance is cloudy golden, which is expected given the bottle conditioning and pilsner malt. The up-front taste is reflective of the aroma combined with a sweet, cleanly fermented, malt backbone that serves to balance the lingering hop finish. The carbonation is slightly high, which makes for a beer with extremely good head retention. Your last sip will have foam on top. Yes, this is indeed a world class beer."
Great flora a fruity taste and a bitter tingle on the tongue.
From 05/19/15 notes. 750ml bottle poured into a tulip.
Fantastic IPA! Thanks @pnelting for sending. Floral up front with nice citrus bitterness on the back end.
Description pinpointed the nail on the head. 
Very tropical and refreshing. Perfect for a hot day.
Could be my favorite IPA of all time and I have regular access to Pliny and other great IPAs. A must try for any beer lover. If you can find it that is:p
Pours a moderate golden hazy straw color with a slight fine head. Nose is quite floral with a bit of juniper and rosemary. Tastes starts with pleasant malt up front quickly followed by piney and floral hops flavors. Highly drinkable and the best IPA I've sampled out of TX by a long shot.
"cloudy yellow classic ipa head. nose is a nice citric hop, very classic and inviting. taste to match super easy drinking super tasty ipa. very drinkable. very worth checking out and worth the buzz"
"On tap at Craft Pride on Rainey St in Austin. 10 oz pour. Really nice, complex IPA. Tropical notes and delicate hop flavor. Wish I could find a bottle somewhere, but they appear to be sold out."
Can you imagine being on vacation in Texas Houston area in search of sierra Nevada's new double IPA and run into a manager who likes Hoppy beers. what I want is not available in Houston although web sites says its in Texas but that's a big state. but he says I have one more bottle of Yellow Rose ale .. and the other store 5 miles away has 12 in stock and the hop stupid I was looking for. quickly found the Hop StOOPID . Sent a sales man looking for it. One rack had empty paces leading up to 3 last bottles of Yellow Rose were left. I took 2 to give me a total of 3. I have had 2 of them and wish I can a case. maybe next year..
I've had this on draft at Petrol Station in Houston as well as in a bottle share at DLD 2015. Both experiences were excellent. Evident why this is such a highly rated beer.
"Maybe I had a bad bottle, or maybe it was an old bottle - I couldn't read the date - but I don't get the hype for this beer at all. The appearance was a dirty, milky, cloudy orange, which looked somewhat unpleasant. At least there were no floaties. Maybe I just don't like mosaic hops; that could be it."
Great pale ale but I think Trillium Fort Point and Sue are a bit ahead
"This tasted less of citrus, and grapefruit for me, and more like the juniper taste you get from gin. It sat unfinished as the three other guys at the table with me also did not care for it."
750 mL bottle poured into a snifter.
Traded to me from a fellow BA in Texas. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass.
Great IPA out of Texas! Definitely recommend!
"Recent steep declines in the quality of this prodcut have made me lower the score i previously gave it. It has become a more standard ipa, darkened up with more malt and more bitter. Used to stand out more on the market, less so now"
"The only possible complaint you can have about this beer is that it's a little thin. The ABV is perfect for drinking in a quantity, which you'll want to be doing. The smell is unbelievable. The taste is essentially perfect. I can't remember the last time I had an IPA and didn't think ""I'd rather be drinking a Yellow Rose."""
I'd guess a few weeks old. Had a buddy bring one back from his travels to the brewery's area.
750mL into a tulip. Pours a cloudy dirty golden color w/ a sudsy white head.
"Bottled 10 days ago and the freshness is apparent. L: Orange straw, fluffy white 2-3 finger head with good retention. S: Delicate, super fresh pineapple and orange with some floral notes. T: extremely well balanced and clean. Fresh pineapple, a little orange, floral. Not particularly bitter. Lingering hops with a touch of sweetness on the finish. Great showcase for Mosaic. F: Clean, mouthfeel light/medium-light."
"I don't understand the hype behind this one. It is a solid ipa, especially for a single hop single malt offering, but just didn't hold up to the vermont hops consumed later that night. Yellow rose poured very pale in color with a pure white, bubbly head. The smell was very clean, citrusy, melon, and a strong herbal note, thyme maybe? The taste was much the same, begging for more body, biscuity malts, somenice fruity, tropical hop aromas, and again, finishes very herbal in a way I just can't put my finger on. Mouthfeel was crisp but lingers dry and herbal on the palate for quite a while. Really needs a more substantial malt backbone. There is nothing wrong with yellow rose, it's a solid ipa, but I think there is some truth to the beer being so hyped solely for being a decent beer from a region not known for them."
"Beautiful looking beer of golden color, light trickles of carbonation and a pale white frothy head. Looks beautiful in an oversized snifter and shows no flaws. 5"
Bit of a turd. The only reason this gets hype is because it's a decent IPA in a region not known for them. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. There's not too much reason to venture outside of New England for hoppy stuff these days.
"Very, very delicious. By far the best IPA I have had"
How this is rated so high is beyond me.
Thanks to Gunch52 for this.
Pours a cloudy dark straw with lasting lace and cap of off white foam.
"Great balance. Citrus, earthy notes, even some spice. Ends with mild bitterness."
25oz bottle poured into a tall-stemmed Hill Farmstead tulip
"This is a great IPA. Not as in your face as many you see, slightly subtle but with great taste. One of my favorites."
"This is a really great IPA. Difficult to put into words. Complex, but not overpowering. Aptly named, it has delicious, bright bright floral notes to it. One of my favorite IPA's hands down."
"A very simple and very good IPA. The hop aroma is huge and flowery with notes of pine and blueberry. The only fault I can really find with this beer is that the malt character is a little to one-dimensional and the sweetness overtakes the hops a little to much. However, these are minor complaints, I think it is very soft, hugely flavorful and certainly very unique in the Texas beer market. I recommend this beer to anyone who likes IPAs."
I have to type 5 words
Poured from 750ml bottle into gandhi bot tulip
This beer made me think differently about IPAs. Quite possibly the best beer I have ever had. I love the citrus bitter sweetness. Good malt back.. good head and lacing. If someone asked me there is one beer you could have till the end of time this would be it.
"This one's worth the hype, guys."
L - Beautiful golden haze. 1 inch foam forms and stays
"If you like mosaic hops, you will love this"
Really good with amazing notes of citrus and flowers. It numbs the tongue like most IPA's but is not overpowering.
"Pours a light honey yellow with orange tint and med white head. Smells of tropical fruit and floral. Tastes of orange blossom, grapefruit, mandarin, sweet malts, bready. Medium body and carb but the hop character gives it a much lighter feel. Some citrus and pine on the aftertaste."
"Look: Poured into a nonic with a foamy head. Some splash lacing. Color is opaque, yellow-orange."
"Interesting beer, I love that it's a SMaSH. The mosaic do give a very mixed fruity flavor profile, but there's little in the way of sharp bitterness. It's quite smooth, yet flavorfully hopped. The malt backbone is solid and gives this beer an overall balance not usually found in IPAs. "
"Wow, amazing smell and taste of pineapple."
"Compares to the better single IPAs on the planet. Dank, citrusy and delicious. Was the best part of my Texas trip by far."
"Pours a light gold, very similar to hay. Floral aroma that smells a lot like spring/summer. Taste is light, easy to drink, and incredibly balanced. A real treat"
"The blueberry in this so big and delicious. With the Pilsner malt, it is has great balance off the hop."
On tap @ Strangeways.
Very tasty....but way overhyped...I traded Pseudo Sue to get this and should have just drank the P Sue....
Well balanced and very smooth. An amazing beer.
Appearance: Arrives with a slightly hazy amber color and a nice cap that leaves plenty of splashy lace
Juicy. Great showcase of mosaic.
Got to try this not even 5 days old. Super fresh!
"Was really excited about trying this one. Extremely disappointed. Lots of medicine taste to me. Almost like a cough drop. Not sure if I got a bad batch or what. Would be willing to try again but not a fan,"
"Look it's so great but don't judge a book by its cover. Even the label isn't the greatest logo/label but smell & taste is amazing. I'm more into the super bitter IPA's from 70-100+ ibu and even w this 62 ibu's, it is extremely satisfying to my taste buds. Definitely don't go without trying this one made by Lone Pint."
"Have had on draft and from bottle. Decent nose of citrus, earthiness and hops. Flavor just wasn't there for me compared to two hearted, hopslam, or heady which is the hype that comes associated with it. Light bitterness, lot of floral, and earthy to the taste. Nice to try once, but wouldn't spend money on again."
huge thanks to SteveyTI for the bottle
"A: In a tulip, this pours a hazy golden amber with a decent white, chalky head. Lacing is clumpy before it quickly dissipates. "
My favorite IPA. Not crazy bitter just good citrus flavor.
this is a really well made IPA...
Outstanding! Nice stong hoppy aroma with grapefruit and blueberry notes.
"Reviewing the Yellow Rose, a single hop (Mosaic) IPA from The Lone Pint Brewery, out of Magnolia, Texas."
Appearance: hazy golden color with a murky body. Massive head on a solid pour which retained throughout. Sticky rings of lacing left behind.
16 oz. on tap poured into Lone Pint nonic at the brewery
It so so so tasty!
"certainly one of, if not the single best example of why mosaic is such an awesome hop. it brings the best of that tropical melon fruit character and a citric punch that makes it so sought after by both brewers and beer drinkers alike. to say that its one of the best beers in the world may be a stretch, but its pretty darn awesome, thanks to a homie for sharing this one with me. weird color behind the haze, almost green in the light, super fresh and new and raw. the sediment makes for a creamy and soft feel, not sharp like some ipa can be, and certainly not overrun with malt character. its really light in that regard, even though it does have some body, the grain is just a minimal flavor contributor, but may have some wheat. the hops are immaculately well dosed and fresh, mosaic in all of its glory. a tiny bit vegetal, green again, but citrus and tropical fruit rain on this one, lingering long after the swallow. neat yeast to it as well, uncommon for sure. i like a yeasty ipa, especially one as delicate feeling as this one. absolutely awesome to get to drink this one with some good friends, worth trading for, for all of you gotta try it types out there."
"Phenomenal IPA, very drinkable with subtle tropical fruit flavors."
Excellent beer. Wish I could find it near Chicago.
"simple and delicious, one of the best one hop IPA's i've tried. very clean taste that's fruity, floral, and well balanced. really superb."
"Super sticky white lace. Nose is floral, piney & dank. Great showcase of mosaic hops. Tastes like the love child of heady & dirtwolf. Super crushable. Typically not a fan of large format bottles as I have a hard time getting through but could do multiples of this."
A near perfect example of the style. It poured a deep clear amber color with a two finger head and a good amount of sticky lacing. The smell was wonderful with citrus notes and mild pine. The taste was just as good as it follows the nose. Citrus upfront and mild bitterness in the finish. Clean mouth feel and medium carbonation. This might be my favorite IPA. Just wish it was easier to get in North Texas. When I see it I jump on it.
Fresh growler. Poured into a snifter glass 1/24/2015.
"I've had both from a growler and out of the bottle. For what ever reason, this drinks significantly better from the growler. Pretty muted from the bottle."
"No need to go IPA whale hunting, there are great IPAs in your back yard (probably fresher, too). A near perfect example of what an IPA should be. Hazy, slightly amber, it has plenty of head and lace. Tropical fruit and pine resin in both the taste and aroma. Despite the big hop presence, it's plenty dry, with a clean, slightly bitter finish. Medium body and medium to low carbonation give it an appealing mouthfeel."
"Nearly perfect pale ale, one of the most drinkable IPA's I've come across. Very similar to Zombie Dust, not as sweet or full flavored but smoother. Look forward to trying again."
Sticky thick soapy head and an orange body.
Has a citrus taste - pretty great ipa
Thanks for the trade Brent!
"Buttery taste, minimal hop aroma and flavor. Probably an old bottle but without bottle dating no way to know."
Blueberry bomb. One of the best single hop IPAS I've ever had.
Pretty average and disappointing fitting the TX stereotype.
"Purchased in 2014 in Spring, Texas in 1pt 9.4oz bottle. Perhaps one of the best IPAs I've drank to date."
One of the most citrus IPA's out there
"10 oz. pour on draft at Craft Pride in Austin, TX; unknown brewing/packaging date; poured into a modified British pint glass; drank over 15 minutes"
This SMSH is ridiculously balanced.
"A- Bone white head, great retention and sticky lacing. Body is a light golden."
I first found this on tap in Houston and was very disappointed. It was just ok. Fast forward a few months and I found it elsewhere and tried it again. There it was! There was the amazing IPA I had read about. Don't know if the other had faded or what. But since then I've found it several other times and now can purchase bottles and it hasn't let me down again. Great IPA!
"Nice juicy tropical hop profile, but also syrupy sweet. Might enjoy this a lot more with a touch more bittering hops and a lower FG."
"No botteled date found, I feel like mine had a bit if age on it. Nice clean malt, would have like to get a bit more of a hop hit."
"Fortunately, this beer is readily available from my office in downtown Houston (Flying Saucer for those who are wondering). However, I've had very mixed reviews about it."
"I'm gonna have to give this brew a two thumbs up. Not only because it's a Texas brew, or an outstanding beer for a SMASH, but because of the smoothness and complexity of this brew. This honestly makes me change my mind about mosaic hops. Looks golden and clear as Pilsner malt should. The smell is of fruity, citrusy heaven. This beer taste makes you feel as if you were on an island drinking a juice from the gods. All the right hop tastes at all the right time. A great hop forward brew, but balanced in every way. I'm so glad this brewery is in the town of a few family members. Overall, this beer stands with the best IPAs out there. So completely impressed for a SMASH beer. Makes me somewhat jealous I haven't tried brewing this myself. Only reason it's not rated a five, is so I have room to work with when my own brews hit the shelf one day."
Got this one in on a trade from what I hope to be a more frequent trading partner. I had read some about this one but I had to try it for myself as I have been burning through the big boys lately. 
I love this beer. Beautiful white head. Incredible nose full of fresh hops. This ipa is first class
"Pours a light straw color with a frothy white head. Aromas of grapefruit and pineapple. Loaded with citrus and fruity hop flavors. Medium light body with effervescent carbonation. Overall, an outstanding ipa from Texas."
"1 pint 9.4 fl oz brown glass bottle with appealing label art and green unbranded pry-off cap bought in Austin, TX and served cold into a pilsner glass. Reviewed live as an IPA per the label."
Serving: 750 mL bottle poured into an IPA glass.
Amazing. My go to local ipa is one of the best out there. Try this if you can
Cloudy golden yellow colored pour with white two-finger head. Big citrus and grapefruit aroma with a hint of bread. Great citrus taste upfront. Very juicy and not overly bitter. Also has a lot of grapefruit and tropical fruit flavor with a touch of biscuit and pine. Finishes with a nice juicy tropical fruit bitterness. Light body with moderate carbonation. One of the best IPA's I've had.
I've been fortunate enough to have this brew in a bomber and on tap. Absolutely tremendous across the board. This beer is worth going out of your way to track down.
I love you Texas!
Just a fantastic IPA. I've not found anything in an IPA that I like better. Delicious and refreshing.
I now order any beer who's description contains the words mosaic hops.
This beer has one of the most insane noses for an IPA.
So good. Mosaic juice.
Yellow Rose - The Lone Pint Brewery
Bottle dated 10/22/14
It smells of tropical fruit with a nice hint of citrus. A Very tasty IPA.
My favorite beer that comes out of Houston. So glad it comes in bottles now. The smell is tremendous with light pine and strong blueberry and grapefruit. The taste follows the same way with a lingering bitterness at the end. Haven't gotten enough of this beer yet. Highly recommended.
Have had this brew at various locations within the Houston loop and recently a bottle from their first run:
"Poured from tap into a pint nonic, 1 finger cream colored head, recedes quickly, nice lacing, really nice. Bright golden hazy in the glass. Smells biscuit malt, tropical citrus more to the grapefruit side and some underlying line. Taste is initially a little malt sweetness followed immediately by grapefruit/pine bitterness ending with a citrus/floral semi dry finish. Great mouthfeel, no alcohol detected. I do notice an underlying earthiness/ dankness to this. Great beer I can find on tap almost every day"
Pours such a beautiful color. One of the best IPA's with nice citrus hints.
"Straight white head, nice lacing. Orange, grapefruit, sweet mango, pineapple, biscuit, breast malt notes. This is really good IPA. Wow. Nice coating of bitterness in the mouth. Dry finish. I’m a fan."
"Pours hazy golden color with a finger width foamy head. Mild retention and lacing. Aroma of strong grapefruit and hops. Slightly malty taste with big hoppy finish and strong fresh grapefruit aftertaste. Very slightly soapy. Beer was poured straight from brewery, so it was unbelievably fresh. Excellent beer!!"
1L growler poured into a HF wine glass. Served at 42F.Major thanks to porter0209. Mike indicates the growler was filled six days ago.
Appearance: Head is bright-white and fluffy. Drops to a small cap and collar with big sheets of lacing down the glass. A hazy gold with some bright yellows when held to direct light. Pours with a moderate carbonation. 
32 oz howler pours a more yellow than gold color with a fine-bubbled white head. Fair retention and outstanding lace.
Bright golden yellow pour from the draft at Rodeo Goat in Fort Worth. Moderate to slight white head that settles with some lacing. Citrus (esp. grapefruit) nose with a bit of sweet. Taste is huge and moderately sweet grapefruit with some nice maltiness. Very crisp with hoppy bitterness lingering. Really surprised with how good this IPA is. As good as Deep Ellum's IPA. Truly delicious.
"What a surprise this was, so much citrus flavor and great yellow color"
Pours a golden color with a good amount of foamy white head. The smell is floral and citrus. The taste is balanced with a sweet malt backbone with a lemon flavor that is smooth and not overtly bitter. This is one of my all time favorite beers!!! An excellent Smash IPA.
"Pours a light golden/straw color. Nice white head, thick and creamy."
"I was super excited to be able to try this SMaSH (Single Malt and Single Hop) IPA. Heard good things about it from a few people and the brewers. Unfortunately, I'm drinking the last bit from my growler (about 5 days old, opened a couple of times) and it's a little bit flat. Fortunately, I have drank over a gallon of it fresh within the past week so my memory shouldn't be too shabby. I'll review what I'm drinking but add on to it with notes I took previously and pictures I took."
It's got a great golden hay color.
Best IPA in TX.
Got it in a 32oz clear Growler and I was mesmerized by its color its like a livid Yellow almost looks from another planet great taste plenty of Citrus best brew I had from Texas so far
Top of the Smash IPA heap

"Great craft beer in my home state of Texas is hard to find. I have traveled the West Coast, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska for the past 15 years searching out great craft beer. In recent years more craft breweries have popped up and while some have gone and others simply are mediocre at best there are some keeping it simple and putting focus on the beer not the money they can make. lone Pint is one such brewery and they have made an IPA, Yellow Rose, that to me stands up there with the IPAs made in the places I mentioned before. "
"One of few beers aptly named. Beautiful SMASH IPA. Tropical fruits on the nose paired with light, crackers pislne yeast. Taste is full blown tropical fruit. Mango, papaya, pineapple galore. Quite possibly the best beer in Texas and quite possibly be best IPA ever."
Easily the best IPA brewed in Texas. Nice aroma and a lot of tropical citrus in the flavor. Not overly bitter at all and drinks very smooth. I really wish they would sell this in 12oz bottles. I'm not always in the mood to drink a whole 750ml.
Simply the best beer brewed in Texas in my opinion.
"This poured out as a really nice clear yellow color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer is excellent, the hops really shine through on this beer. The taste is very clean with a nice amount of bitterness in the finish. Overall this IPA is worth seeking out."
Thanks to Lnashsig for the growler. 
"A- Pours a lovely, wonderful, heavenly deep yellow. This beer just looks amazing. I don't know why, but it is a color that I just can't stop admiring. "
"Beer pours a bright yellow with the requisite foamy white head. Good lacing around the glass. Powerful tropical fruit, grapefruit, tangerine aroma. I wanted to continue to smell this beer. So fruity and really a treat. The taste was nearly as good. Tangerine, grapefruit juice. Bright and citrusy. Minimal pine and resin. The body is a wee bit thin for these flavors. I'd bump the malt base up a bit. It's a great IPA and just a hair lower on my rankings than Anicca in terms of Mosaic single hop. Great beer."
Got in a trade! Very excited to try this....love Texas beer!
"I've gotten to a point where I walk into a bar that has Yellow Rose and 50 other taps and ask for the Yellow Rose before even looking to see what else is available. After having YR for the first time, I started seeking out other Mosaic beers and while I think there are many that are quite delicious, at best I've found things that are ""95% of yellow rose."" "
"From a 32-ounce growler, filled the same day, pour into a standard pint glass."
First had at Dallas brew fest in September 2013. Bill brought it to my birthday party in 2016.
This is absolutely my favorite current beer.
"It is not often that I think a beer is perfect, but this is one of those times. I have nothing new to say that has not already been written by other reviews. Big citrus / grapefruit nose and flavor that is as drinkable as it comes. One can only hope that one day I will be able to pick this up in cans."
Poured from a 32 oz growler.
"As part of a trade I recived a HF growler fill of this, the tag said Lone Pint - Yellow Rose Single hopped Mosaic IPA so I'm guessing this is the correct place for the review."
"Clear sunny yellow color with a bright white head. Tropical fruit aroma with juicy citrus notes, mango, light crackery malt. Tastes of tropical fruits and bright citrus. Citra definitely seems the culprit here. Light balancing maltiness, and a medium bitterness that finishes clean. Lighter In body, somewhat crisp, definitely refreshing and super easy drinking. Thanks to lndsy for suggesting I grab a growler! Delish!"
Best SMaSH IPA iv ever had. Proud that it comes from a local brewery and happy I can have it on tap with dinner all around town.
On tap at Downhouse in Houston.
This is a review of Project Dank Summer 2018 Edition.
Rich copper/amber color. A good creamy looking head. Nice lacing. Excellent aroma. Hops are inviting. Taste follows the nose and it’s very good and it reminds me so much of Cedar Creeks’ Dankosaurus. Mouthfeel is smooth and the bitterness is just right. This is the one you want at La Cumbre Taproom.
"Thanks to leftpaw for kicking one of these down on a trip. Pours a darker golden color. Solid 3/4"" white head on it with ample retention, especially for a beer with such a high hop/hop oil to it. Those hops aren't the most pungent in the nose, they come off kind of restrained if anything. Present, but not overpowering or even to levels I would appreciate. Went in the direction of pineapple and tangerine mostly."
CAN: Currently #1 on the Top New Mexico beers list. 473ml format. Best before: 09/27/18. Pull-tab can. Bloody fantastic label art.
"A: The beer is slightly hazy yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass."
One of the best double IPAs I have had.
Clear orange with thick head.
"Pours a slightly hazy orange gold with a white head. Smells of tropical fruits, citrus, fresh hops, and light malt. Tastes of very bitter/flavorful/fresh/dank hops, sweet malt, caramel, orange and grapefruit zest, dankness, and light tropical fruits. Medium-heavy body with medium carbonation. Overall an incredible hop bomb."
"Yep, this is a hop bomb, no doubt about it. I didn't look at the IBUs on the bottle, but I'd guess about 100 or so. A check of their website upon writing this review yielded ""A LOT"" in the IBU category, so maybe I'm close. But as advertised, that's what dominates this beer. Good if you like the style."
A bomber with a packed on date sticker on the cap that reads 09/21/17. Pouring in a 12oz. tulip for the review. 
"Hazy gold color. Half-finger head that lingers and laces nicely. Lots going on with the nose. Strong scents of tropical fruit, floral, honeysuckle and mineral. Love the taste of this beer. Very well balanced between the hops and the malt. Strong flavors of pomegranate, pine, grapefruit and peach. Medium body. Nice medium-length finish coats the palate."
"Pours a cloudy gold with decent head and very good lacing. Nose is hoppy citrus with some floral tones and grapefruit. The taste is just awesome, very sweet hoppy goodness with a refreshing citrus mix, a little dry and very mild bite on the finish. I really enjoyed this beer, the hops were so tasty, just a juicy goodness."
"On tap at the brewhouse taproom in July 2017. Nice hops aromas; hugely out of balance in flavor and bitterness toward in-your-face hoppiness. I found it enjoyable, but not overly distinctive compared to any number of other huge hop bomb IPAs."
22 oz. Bomber
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Cloudy golden yellow color with a short lived white head and good lacing. Smell of vanilla, pine and oranges. Silky feel. The taste is a bit boozy , with caramel, citrus, and lots of hoppy bitterness. Comes off like an imperial IPA."
"On tap at Hunahpu Day. Been wanting to try this for a long time now. Clear golden. Smells, as described, dank. Some tropical fruit behind the herbal and dank hops. Tastes of green, resiny, and citrusy hops. Sweet pale malt. Low bitterness. Medium body and a little sweet. Very good."
Big thanks to shuntstout for sending this bottle! Reviewed from (very) long-standing notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a Cycle Brewing pint glass.
Bomber served chilled into a goblet.
"22oz bottle from Albertson's (Santa Fe, NM). 8.49. Bottled 9/19/16. Served in a wine glass. "
"22 oz bottle, bottled on 9/23/16. Pours slightly hazy straw gold with a medium rocky white head that retains well and laces the glass."
Poured from a 22oz bottle with a bottle on date of 9/23/16; into a tulip.
L: Pours a raspberry tinted amber with a lovely lacy head. 
A - nice orange amber clear beer with an off white head that leaves okay lacing
"I had this wonderful and dank (in a good way) IPA I had at the La Cumbre Brewery in Albuquerque, New Mexico."
22 oz. bottle purchased at the brewery. This has been on my wants list for years. 
10-18-18
On tap at the brewery. Nice deep gold color with healthy head and nice lacing. Aroma is complex citrusy/piney/tropical with good malt character. Flavor followed. Delicious with nice mouthfeel. The lingering bitterness of the Elevated IPA was more moderate here providing a delicious drinkable big IPA. As noted in my other La Cumbre review. I brought 4 of these home as well and sent a care package of Tree House beers (Julius and Green) out to them to try. I understand that the recipe changes from batch to batch but this would be my go to beer if I lived in Albuquerque
"L: deep gold color, nice lacing white head"
L: Copper gold color that is very clear with a creamy white head and lacing all over the glass.
"Crystal-clear, copper colored body; thick, frothy, sculpted head; lacing down the glass. Big, bold dose of pine and citrus aroma; oranges and pink grapefruit. Mellow, bready grain flavors and soothing, bitter hop presence. Heavy but with a soft, airy quality; warm; creamy."
Picked up from the brewery. Poured into a teku.
Bottled 4/06/16. Super Fresh. Never had this before. 
"Love everything this brewery does and this is no exception. Being in upstate NY I can only dream for the day their distro expands. this beer lived up to the name the pony citrus nose hits hard, and the taste does not disappoint. 4.5/5"
Very tasty beer
"Bottled 03/15/16. Clear and vibrant light orange-gold color with a finger of white head and heavy lacing. Amazing bottle art, too. There is indeed a dankness and slight skunkiness to the aroma, with a mix of orange, pine, pineapple behind and a whiff of nuttiness in the malt profile. Way heavier-bodied than expected, with some prickliness to the mouth feel along with the heft. The dankness is more prevalent in the taste than the nose, both with an initial burst up front and lingering in the bitter aftertaste. The orange, pine and pineapple mix is present, too, though, mid-palate, with a little citrus lingering, too. Very nice."
"Poured from a bomber bottled on 2/29/16. Pretty orange/amber hue, nice half inch head, good retention and lacing. Huge aromas of tropical fruits, pine and I swear it smelled like weed. Lots of of mango and pineapple in the flavor with a touch of sweetness and just a hint of bitterness. Nice oily mouthfeel, medium bodied. Just a super tasty beer, glad that La Cumbre is regularly distributing to Colorado now. Really looking forward to enjoying this a lot in the future"
Thanks to Marcos for hooking me up with a fresh bomber.
Consumed 1/29/16
"Deep gold orange with an of white head. Left minimal lacing. The smell is grapefruit, onions and weed. The taste is malty sweet with a lot of grapefruit and bitter hops. This is a fine and balanced beer."
"Bottle share. Silky smooth, super hoppy aroma and taste, mildly viscous, light on presentation but huge on taste. Just great. Can't wait for my trip to Albuquerque."
Poured into a snifter
I found the version on tap (1/2/2016) to be quite exceptional. 
"Tough to rate Project Dank since each batch offers a new recipe. Rated as my overall opinion of the series. Some batches I like more than this (such as the January 2016 batch, which has been my favorite I have so far tried), other batches I have liked less."
Good beer but not over the top amazing. I don't understand how this beer is listed as a single beer when the recipe of this beer changes significantly every month or so. The malt and hops change so should the entry in BA but that's my opinion.
Bottled 10/13
"Bottle consumed about 6 weeks ""old"""
"After some of the reviews I was ecstatic to try this. Bottle dated 10/13/15. Ok...it's a very good IPA. Great? I wasn't blown away, but it is very solid and super smooth. No dank and the aroma seem subdued a little compared to the elevated IPA. I know they change the recipe every so often so, maybe this is just a different batch of hops and new techniques. If you have a chance to try it, go for it. I was hoping for an epic beer and felt slightly let down with this batch. Maybe others batches are, or will be better. YMMV."
"We split a bomber into our Founders snifters. It shows the color of old peach flesh, and puts off a soapy one and a half finger tall head of white, slightly toasted looking bubbles. This is beautifully reproducible with a flick of the wrist. This retains very well, leaving dusted plateaus of lacing across our glasses in a jutting, stepwise fashion. Haze is dense, but no sediment is found. Carbonation appears to be lightly medium. The aroma includes incredibly present hoppiness, offering up notes of heavy, syrupy nectars, dripping pines, light citrics, and massively perfumed florals. This bountiful blend plays against a backdrop of sticky butterscotch caramels, pale and caramel grain sweatiness, coffee cake crumbles, apple cider sugars, latex plastics, dripping wet peachy and pineapple fruit juiciness, dank scotch-style (but not mossy or peaty) booziness, raw white rice, candy corn cloy, cork and balsa wood, white pepper, crayon waxiness, and fresh olive oil stickiness. With warmth comes a juniper fruitiness, and an enhanced piney hoppiness. Wow, what a supremely bitter beer!! West-coast (land-locked?!) through and through. The hops come first, exploding with the highest citrics and soaps around, before melding into the background, where they loosen up and become dank, earthy, and crystalline. The body that these blend into is comprised of hot graphite, harsh grain alcohol burn, syrupy pear and peach juiciness, biscuity pale malt toast, raw caramel grain, buttered white bread, burnt plastics, crispy apple skin shavings, grapefruit and tangerine flesh and peel, subtle honey sugariness, rotten vanilla bean, old coffee filters, dew kissed morning moss, tin and titanium, under ripe honeydew melon, wet salted seaweed, and soaked wool. For the first half of your glass the bitterness from the beginning sips follows you to hell and back, like a shadow, lingering behind you. The more the beer warms the more this fades. The body is decidedly full, and the carbonation is actually rather mild. Each sip gives nice slurp and smack, with more oily froth and creaminess, making it have to lap up and cling to the lip. The mouth is left puckered, bittered, and coated with a grating astringency, where you could almost feel a sandy chalkiness sitting beneath it. The abv is appropriate, and the beer sips away like a champion."
"Attractive clear amber with an ample foam that lasts and lasts. Sudsy mouthfeel. Very malty and full bodied. It's more in the style of a double IPA, fairly sweet, but not much alcohol taste. Big aroma of apricot and honeysuckle with a cedar note."
Sampled at GABF 2015
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"As the name states, it certainly is dank. Pours an hazeless orange color with quickly dissipating head. Dank on the smell with some sweetened. Taste reflects much of the same. Feel is smooth with some carbonation. Nice beer overall"
Slightly cloudy bronze. Thin head with solid lacing. Very aptly named. Smells of dank wet hops. Reminds me of a certain friend's basement but in a good way. A little sweet but a nice hop finish. Bitterness starts to prevail as you wage into the beer. I've never felt dank before until now. Big fan.
"Simply one of the best IPAs that money can buy, especially if you like an IPA that isn't overly carbonated. I'm not saying it's a cask ale or anything, but dank-smooth? Yes, this is it. Pull up a stool. You've found it. Now, if they'd only sell this in one of their handy pint-sized cans instead of the damn 22 oz bottles that roll around in my car every time I have smuggle this beer across state lines. EDIT (10.14.18) - standards have changed, but now P. Dank is done in a seasonal 4x/year variant, and now in cans. Summer version was slightly more interesting than the current ""autumn"" edition, but damn if the latter isn't still solid. Scores adjusted accordingly."
"This is a proper west coast style IPA. Hoppy, piney and bitter. An exceptional version of the west coast style, but nothing really sets it apart from the rest of the field. I would drink this all the time if I could get it locally, but I'm likely not going to search it out again in trades."
L- Golden Orange with a small fluffy white head
Had it on draft at the brewery. Released 7/18/15. Liked it so much grabbed 8 bombers to take back to Tucson.
"Thick bodied, tastebud punishing goodness. Nose is pine, grapefruit and a touch grassy while the taste chimes in nearly identically, save for hints of licorice and a thick, dry and slightly salty finish that is barely perceived by a numbed tongue from all the hop violence. Very happy to have been able to try this absolutely fantastic one out!"
"From a 650 ml bottle (""Danked"" on June 17, 2015) to a wine glass. Reviewed from notes dated June 27, 2015."
"Thanks to ONovoMexicano for this bottle from NBS BIF #2. Hated 22oz bottle with a ""Danked on"" date of 6/17/15. A solid and enjoyable beer, Pleasant body and verygood flavors. Worth trying if you see it."
"On tap at the brewery, and again out of a bomber bottle a few days later. "

Bomber from Susan's Fine Wines in Santa Fe. Bottled on 4/1/15.
"Malt forward IPA with a hint of citrus. Has a slight bitter/dry finish. Moderate amount of hops. Subtle ""dankness"", not bad overall. Picked up a few cans of this in a trade."
On tap.
Bottled on 3/26/15. 2 weeks old
Poured from a 650 ml bomber
22oz bottle driven to Nebraska by a good friend!
"Nelson meets Citra, big flawless"
Thanks to Beard505 for the trade.
"One of my favorite go-to beers. Always a bit different from batch to batch, but constantly complex, dank, and delicious. As always, La Cumbre delivers, this beer deserves its GABF medal (and more)."
"To this day, without a single doubt, the overall Best IPA I've ever had."
Look: caramely and slightly carbonated
"Clear amber body with an endless stream of bubbles. Clingy head that melts off the sides of the glass. Nice to look at. This has a glorious smell - Candied tropical fruit. The aroma definitely steps up. Upon first sip, I say...this is better than Elevated IPA. I could use the word ""dank"" to describe this beer. Sweet tropical fruit + easy grapefruit + dank. Nice finish, subtle sweetness, super clean, no aftertaste, makes me want more. I want that taste, I have to take another sip. Very drinkable. The feel is slick and somewhat creamy. How'd they do that? "
"Deep, heavy and bright amber-orange. Nicely hazy, completely especially towards the end of the bottle. Brilliant aroma of big fresh dank hops. Very resinous and bitter. Big fruits, sugared grapefruit, orange, citrus. Very clean, crisp pine throughout. "
Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy amber color; a bit of a bubble show produces a two fingered head; good retention and webs of lacing linger
"I've wanted to try the gloried IPAs from La Cumbre for some time now and was glad to have landed one of their better beers through a generous BAer - thanks! Pours hazy orange with a soapy white head that lasts very well throughout the session. Aromas of orange peel, malts, and that wondrous dank. The flavors displayed that strong citrusy malt character and sweet dank hop. Sticky mouthfeel, medium bodied, and some pleasant bitterness in the back finish. Overall an extremely solid IPA!"
"Floral citrus nose, joyous interplay of malt, hop bitterness, and trop fruit on the palate."
"Luckily I get to travel to ABQ for work...LaCumbre is simply amazing! Im surrounded by great beers here in Ohio, Three Floyds Zombie Dust, Alpha King, War Mullet, Space Station Middle Finger, Bells Hop Slam, but that beer is amazing!"
"Glad I was in NM and got to try this. Better than any I've had and each batch is a little different, they are always tinkering with the recipe. Must Try!!!"
"Just a touch of haze on this one, ever so light, oodles of lacing, all in complement to a big, tropical nose, with just a hint of dankness, and a soft, easy-drinking palate rich of similar notes, and with very little bitterness. New school take on the style, but man it does it well."
"22oz bomber that's about a month old, enjoyed out of a balloon glass. "
"Pours a hazy sunburst color with a tight, white head that leaves a good bit of lacing."
"Just tasted a fresh dank, and damn was it good. I had never heard of it before and got it in a trade. I definitely recommend any IPA fan to try this beer. You will not be disappointed."
"ttle in trade, Danked on 11/3/14 and poured 11/20/14. Stoked for this one. Pours beautiful clear golden orange with a half finger white head. Awesome aroma of floral smells, stone fruit, mango, light pine and grass, sweet citrus. Mmmmm. Flavor is strong bitter on the tongue with a mango and stone fruit finish, bitter lasting through dry on the tongue, lots of hop twinge, whoah. One of the more lingering bitter brews I've had. Really nice. Super dry after an initial juiciness, medium plus carbonation, light to medium body. This is really nice with a unique bitterness note. I think I would have liked to taste a bit more smooth sweetness and a bit less bitter here, but really nitpicking."
Batch dated 11/03/14
Appearance - The beer poured an orange gold color.
Type: Draft
Had a pint on tap in Santa Fe.
650ml bottle. Poured into a snifter 10/4/2014.
"immaculate ipa here really, truly one to behold. fortunate enough to get to try it, a real treat. its got such a unique hop complexion on it, which manifests itself entirely differently in the nose than in the taste. the beer is clear copper colored, definitely some crystal malt in here under the dish soap foam textured white head. the nose shows some real tropical notes, new world stuff, mosaic or nelson or some other newfangled hop. peach and nectarine jump out at me, but in the taste i get way more dense west coast hoppiness. its pine pitch and bitter greens, balanced only by a robust malt profile that does have a touch of caramel and toast to it. like a meal of a beer here. ive been told the hops used in this beer change from batch to batch, and i am unsure which one i had, but what i am sure of is that this is incredible ipa, unique and distinct from the masses, and really one of the better ones i can recall. cool that they package it too, id love to see this penetrate the colorado market at some point!"
Awesome!!!
Thanks to JustXBeer for sharing this one at mrbubbler's tasting.
"Re-reviewing the new batch, which is a different recipe. Bottle dated 8/11/14, courtesy of BeerandBoards, my Dank hookup forever and always. You're amazing. Poured into a Prairie Teku glass. Previous reviews below."
"tropical hops abound in this delicious ipa from la cumbre. cloudy yellow gold with clingy lace in the glass greet the eye. i love the aroma of this beer - huge southern hemisphere hop goodness (mango, guava, pink grapefruit). the citrus bit combined with he cleasing bitterness places this among the top ipas ive had the pleasure of tasting. while thete is a heaviet booziness to this 7.5 abv offering, its great for a glass or two. i would probqbly get into trouble knocking these beasts back because they drink smoohly.malt sweetness is more than balanced by hop bittering. fantastic brew that reminds us californians great ipa does not have to come from the golden state."
Received this as an extra from @hambone85. 
"exceptional taste and nose on this. La Cumbre is really underappreciated for thier ipas despite thier awards. Its like drinking candied orange peels, good amount of pineapple mango type flavors and aroma. The beer pours hazy orange color with a 1/4inch of head"
"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Clear bright orange color. Very little head but small bubbles and lacing remain on surface of beer. Really unique smell. Weeds, grass, some tropical fruits and citrus as well. "

"Bottle ""danked"" on 6/15 and actually released only 5 days ago. Poured into Alchemist stemless wine glass."
22oz bottle into a tulip
"L - amber/orange 1"" head forms and dissipates very slowly- slightly hazy but transparent through the glass"
"A-Interesting orange amber appearance, about a finger head."
"A crystalline, golden apricot color with a rapidly thinning slightly-off-white head that settles to a quarter inch foam ring around the edge of the glass but only a thin skin of foam in the middle. Candied citrus zest and pine aroma with a slight alcohol undercurrent. Sugared grapefruit flavor. So smooth. Some malt sweetness in the middle. Finishes pretty cleanly, with a pine and bitter grapefruit pith aftertaste. Honestly not the most powerfully flavored batch, but I've had others at the brewery that really knocked my socks off. The hop bill changes periodically, so aroma and flavor will vary from batch to batch. Medium light body, smooth as glass. A really fantastic mouthfeel. Overall, this is an excellent IPA, but I still favor La Cumbre's flagship Elevated IPA. In any case, this is a must-try for any hophead."
"Thank you Majin for the trade! Pours a hazy amber with a small, quickly fading white head. Not much lacing. Lots of citrus, apricot, and tropical fruit on the nose, easily one of the best smelling IPAs on the market."
1796th review on BA
A-orange amber color with a decent white head and some lacing
Bottled 4-5-14
"Bottle poured into a bell tulip. Bright orange-yellow color, slightly hazed, with a finger or so of frothy white head that eventually sank to a collar and held there, dotting the glass with lace. The aroma was mostly floral, lesser notes of citrus rind and pine needles. Taste was good, but not quite as inviting as the aroma. Floral and herbal notes, citrus zest bringing in a solid yet low-key bitterness, pine resin, with a small, crackery malt complex. Mouthfeel was on the lighter-side of medium, which was nice, and this was a pretty easy drinker. Not really ""dank"" as compared to several other IPAs out there. A pretty average IPA overall, with nothing really setting it apart from many other easily obtainable options. But it was still a good beer."
A- poured gingerly into a snifter. clear golden with very little head. 
Got this from a friend who lives in Albuturkey. Apparently the hop bill changes on this one with each batch?
3 week old bomber poured into a point glass.
"Slightly cloudy appearance with a golden body and light head. Huge nose with grapefruit peel and ditchweed. The name is appropriate. This was not a bomb to me. It was really, really well made and balanced. It's hop forward but just enough sweetness to not turn this into a bitter palate crusher. The nose and the palate are the same. You get really juicy grapefruit and of course a deep dankness. Great, great IPA. World class."
"This beer is IPA perfection. I love everything about it. It's a beautiful hue of golden straw with the perfect amount of carbonation. The nose on this thing is remarkable. Strong smells of passion and tropical fruit hit your nose first with a hint of citrusy goodness at the end. The taste oh the taste of this beast is perfection. You taste the rainbow of hop flavor on this tropical fruits, citrus and a slight hint of floral notes finishes the beer off. The mouthfeel is perfect and really makes it super drinkable. It was hard to not just pound the whole bottle. I used to think living on the west coast I had access to the best IPAs but this blew almost everything I've ever had out of the water. It really is that good"
"From 02/11/14 notes, Big thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing this one; thanks Ross. 22 oz. bottle into my Bell's tulip."
"A really tasty IPA. Smell is a bunch of floral, citrus, melon notes."
"Batch 2, bottled 1/15"
Bottled 1/15/14
"A-Cloudy and golden. It looks great, and pours great. A thick, two finger head that dissipates to a half inch lacing."
"I believe I've tried every batch of PD to date. Without fail one of the best IPAs being brewed to day, and one of the most consistent. The hop bill is different every batch, so there's little sense in picking it apart in this review, though it's always hugely aromatic and leans toward the dank side of things, as you may have guessed. Lighter in body, dry, plenty bitter but not excessively. Incredibly clean fermentation. A masterful beer, I'm hard pressed to think of a better year-round IPA."
"The newly released, bottled, Project Dank. Comes in a 22 oz. bomber and poured into a nonic pint glass from Marble Brewery. Albuquerque marriage right thurr."
"On tap, pours a clear light gold. A finger of white foam leaves spotty lacing. A very well-made West Coast IPA. Great combination of citrus and pine, with a pleasant bitterness in the finish. Super stuff."
Appearance: Arrives with a slightly hazy golden color and a frothy head; decent lacing action
Had on-tap at Cross Street Chicken and Beer in San Diego. Poured into a pint glass. 
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
"Drank on tap at Hamiltons Tavern, San Diego, CA"
"The aroma offers bready malt, pine, resin, grapefruit, very malty on the aroma. Reminiscent of some breadier IPA like from 3 Floyds or Pipeworks."
"Sampled in a 4 oz taster along with several flights at Societe Brewery. The clear standout beer of all them. One of the best, most balanced, and robust pale ales I've ever had. Worthy of its whale status. Only wish it was in distro outside of San Diego."
"Very clean tasting ipa. Best way I can describe it. Juicy tropical fruit notes, almost non existent malt backbone and perfect level of bitterness. Super balanced and drinkable."
"From the growler, which was filled the night before last. "
Pretty damn good. I absolutely love the smell. Taste is very citrusy and juicy
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Very tropical. Had on tap in a north San Diego restaurant. Wish I had the pour at society. Didn't taste as fresh as it would be there. Happy with this IPA.
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
Really pleasantly surprised by this beer. I had a draft pint immediately following a pint of Pliny the Elder and was fearful that I might not taste it at all. I was wrong. Excellent grassy citrus aroma and a full round mouthfeel with excellent flavor and a smooth finish which did not dry out the back of my palate. Highly recommend that you seek this out.
A very well balanced IPA. 
"This pours a golden hay color with a strong grassy hop presence coming across. The flavor shows more grass with a light, chewy yet clean finish. Hop forward West Coast IPA done up exceptionally well."
"Brewed in the San Diego IPA style with the over the top hop character. Nelson Sauvin hops give the beer a settle rye like spice. Strong citrus and floral notes. Beautifully balanced with a crisp clean maltyness. If you are lucky enough to find yourself in the middle of the epic San Diego beer scene, grab one of these as a classic example of the West Coast Style IPA. You will not be disappointed!"
Light gold. No carbonation. No had to speak of. Mild lacing.
In love with this beer. If available in bottles my fridge would always be stocked. Guess growlers will have to do.
On tap at Societe. The belle of their lineup.
"Sampled on tap at Bottlecraft SD. Pours a beautiful bright yellow. About as clear a beer as you can have with a nice head that holds up well. The nose is huge tropical fruit - in addition to the mango and pineapple notes, I dug out guava to go along with the fantastically balanced hops. Clearly several hop additions going on with this beer given the complex yet subtle flavors happening here. Mouth feel is perfect. All in all a lovely beer."
This is my first review and I'm starting off with a stellar beer from my current favorite Brewery in California. I'm going to keep this straight and to the point for now.
"A soft, citrus pithy take on an IPA that is tasty though perhaps not distinctive. Got a touch watery for me as it went. I like it...but I'm not sure I'm on the bandwagon like everyone else seems to be."
"On tap at Cocina Urbana in San Diego, CA. Also had this on tap at Societe the day before. Either way, this was served in a pint glass 12/15/2014."
A: Brilliantly clear straw golden body topped with a tight one finger head. Patchy lacing remains after a swirl. Beautiful beer.
Growler shared by Michael T. Thanks man!
16oz glass on-tap at The Rare Barrel.
"everytime i taste ipa thats so flavorful yet delicate, i think of vermont, and of the way the likes of hill farmstead, lawsons, and the alchemist make hoppy beer. they dont have that high resin feel, they dont have the sticky oily thing going on, and usually dont have the honey sweetness the hops can provide either. they tend to be well integrated, feature some amount of grain character, a softness of mouthfeel, bright aromatics, and a cleaner, less bitter finish. thats why i was so surprised to learn that this beer was made in san diego, it feels so vermont to me. so highly refined, well understood, and balanced brilliantly. its not that that hops or hop varietals are anything new to my palate, it seems a bit of new world tropical fruity stuff with the classic northwest high alpha C varietals. its the way they are dosed here, no harshness from bitterness or plant matter at all, and that softness that comes from baby bubble carbonation and really dry finishing yeast. the dry hopping is where the magic happens here. its so clean and yet big. the abv is really rather gnarly, but its never detected in the drinking experience of this beer. its almost more like a big pale ale than an ipa, considering its balance. beautiful beer, i could happily drink this one forever. great introduction to this brewery for me."
"On draft at Pizza Port, Carlsbad."
Seriously amazing beer. Probably one of the best IPAs in San Diego!
Growler opened on 9.18.14
"I had this for the first time at the Stone 17th Anniversary Party-- phenomenal. This is a beer with great balance and an awesome hop flavor. Born in San Diego, land of the IPA, this is one of the best. The aroma is fantastic, the taste is even better."
"64oz growler poured into a Cantillon Degustation Glass, enjoyed on 6.7.14, reviewed from tasting journal."
1797th Review on BA
One of the most dry hopped and delicious ipas in San Diego. Not on the level of Alpine but this cloudy ipa has a great smell and overall taste. Also great that it is available on tap all year long.
Had on draft at Societe
"Have had this beer several times and it never disappoints. Light golden in color without much lasting head. Smell is slightly dank and grassy with some light fruityness. On the whole the aroma is mild but very pleasant. Taste again has that earthy, grassy hop character with some tropical fruit flavors mixed in. Bitterness is there, especially in the dry finish but it doesn't overpower at any point. Body is light but not watery at all. Overall an amazing IPA with a ton going on in the flavor department but one you can enjoy anytime without your palette being completely wrecked. Awesome beer!"
A - Incredibly light and clear. Good head and great retention.
On tap at the Societe takeover at Beachwood BBQ LB last night. 
"Don't do many beer reviews, but this beauty deserved it..."
Big thanks to Nick (OneBeertoRTA)
"On tap at The Local in San Diego. Pours a slightly hazy yellow. Big time tropical fruit aromas wafting up, with some light pine and sweetness. Flavor has big pineapple notes, some bitter grapefruit mixed in, a hint of raw vegetal hops (love this flavor), and a nice sweetness on the finish. Very light bodied with high carbonation. My first from Societe and this was an excellent brew with loads of refreshing tropical fruit."
"On tap at Blind Lady Ale House. Handsome amber color with plenty of carbonation and nice lacing in the glass. More than adequate sudsiness. Hugely fragrant, is the main thing that makes you sip up an notice this."

A: Poured a crystal clear light orangish color with great carbonation coming from the growler. A moderate fluffy white head with some decent lacing.

"A - Pours a hazy, golden hue. Minimal lacing with about a finger of head. "
"A: Low transparency, good legs and a pale yellow color "
"I had this beer at Societe during a recent trip to San Diego. Beer came out with a pale yellow color and a nice head. Compared to some of the other Societe beers, this hop aroma on this one is more subdued. It still has a nice hop flavor and nice bitter finish though."
"Poured out as a clear golden color with a foamy white head on top. The retention and lacing is really good. The smell is sweet and hoppy, nice malty caramel nose with a lemony citrus. The taste is nice, nice malt/hop balance, sweet and bitter. The mouthfeel is light bodied, with a good carbonation. Overall it's a pretty solid brew."
Cruising SoCal like I know how - down to Societe it is.
"On tap at Stone. Pours pale, hazy orange with thin white head. Aroma of citrus, pine, yeast and slight funk. Flavor is piney and citrusy. On the lighter side of and IPA with medium carbonation. Slight bitter finish. Super solid, nice balance. As good as any IPA on the market."

A: Clear light amber. Forms a moderate sized fluffy white head. Good retention. Head leaves some minimal lacing on the way down. 
Had this on tap at the brewery and then found the next day and had a pint on tap at pizza port 
"Just a great single IPA, right up there with Sculpin. Had it at the brewery. Pours a little cloudy, maybe its unfiltered. The smell is outstanding! You can smell the nelson hops, and a liitle graperfruit. The taste is crisp and super balanced. I have had Pliny, Topper and Younger & this beer is right up there with the best."

"On tap for the 2012 Peter Reeves Memorial Sourfest at Churchill’s Pub & Grille in San Marcos, CA."
"On tap at O'Brien's. Seemed like a good opportunity to tick so I ordered it. Looks sort of yellow but then it was nighttime at O'Brien's so I can't be 100% sure. Smelled quite interesting, a real melange of hoppiness, dank, west coast. Flavor sort of diverged from the aroma, very bitter though and as it warmed a bit of lemon goodness. Overall this was a good IPA, hopefully they bottle this in the future."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a finger of white head. Awesome nose of grapefruit, pineapple, pine, and floral hops. A light tropical fruit note in there as well. Very little malt aroma. The flavor has a great fruitiness to it with all of the grapefruit/citrus and tropical flavors. A nice bite of bitterness to it from the pine. Just a touch of bready malt flavor, but still nice and dry. Very enjoyable."
"I've had this on tap twice now I'm sad to say that it's almost gone after only a few precious days. I can't believe that we aren't gonna see this one again til September. Damn those unattainable Nelson Hops! Oh well, I will still enjoy this while I can. Although The Dandy and The Apprentice are wonderful IPA's, The Pupil has that little extra whack in the face that all of us in SD have grown to love. Thanks guys for making great beer and thanks Mark S. for keeping us in supply."

On Tap
5/30/2012
Bottle dated 08/14/18 -- didn't pick it up until 11/02/18 and not opened until the date of this review.
"Skip lunch. Wait for Dinner. This has practically no hops profile by comparison, although it is very smooth."
"Pours a slightly murky yellow/orange with normal carbonation. Aroma is of tropical fruit, juice. Taste is much the same with a hint of malt, not much bitterness. This one really tastes like hawaiin punch without the sweetness. Very well balanced IPA."
"Pours a standard orange with an unfiltered, hazy look that becomes a little more hazy as the lower ounces of the bottle are poured into the glass. Head formation is two fingers of stark white foam, with good retention. Aroma is pine, floral, herbal, and orange. Pine really stands out in this mix, but without an encumbering bitterness it often brings. It's a simple, clean profile. It's not loud and boyish like some other IPAs. Flavor profile has more citrus up front, with pine, herbal, and floral hops falling in behind. Again, well reserved and clean. Toasty, biscuity, wheaty malt notes spring through, firming up the flavor profile and delivering a balanced relationship between hops and malts. Mouth feel is lightly fuzzy and velvety, with a medium consistency, heightening the experience and enjoy-ability. Overall, a balanced and nuanced IPA that doesn't favor hops drastically over malts, and instead utilizes both to form a splendid balance. "
"Lunch is an excellent IPA with a citrusy/piney fragrance that gives way to the same in taste, with the slight pine notes lingering a bit on the palate providing a refreshingly smooth finish. The color is an amber tint with some deep browns and dark oranges. It has fine lacing that cascades quickly down the glass with each sip. It's best enjoyed after it's had a good chill and then a few minutes at room temp before opening, but you knew that."
"500 ml bottle, dated 09/11/18. Poured into Lexan tulip. Thanks to canconphilly!"
"Its smooth, not exactly what I'm used to as far as bite. But again very smooth.. overall a good beer."
"Bottled 09/18/18, 373, 12:52."
Aromas of citrus and a great hop flavor. The feel is great for such a hoppy beer. Fantastic IPA with a great balance.
Live the taste and love Maine Brewing company cause
"Pleasantly surprised by this. I've been trying to stay away from NE-based IPAs lately because I'm sick of them, but this was given to me as a gift. This is not really a NE IPA, but a nice compromise between east and west coasts. Fruits yes, but piney hops also in the nose and on the tongue. Not overly sugary."
"16.9 fl oz bottled 7/31/18 poured into a tulip glass, a mostly clear orange with a slight haze and a two finger white head. The aroma is predominately pine, tropical fruit, mixed with mild dankness. The taste is more floral and pine dominate, with some of the historical East Coast IPA (see Harpoon) type flavors. The mouthfeel is medium. carbonation medium, slightly sharp in places. Overall, an above average IPA, though I thought the taste did not live up to the aroma, which may be due to my messed up palate vs anything else, or perhaps the heightened expectations of finally getting to try this one."
Solid IPA by MBC.
"Into a tulip on tap at Casanova's, this is a delicious old-schoolish ipa, that has distinct but delicate and very harmonious flavor profile that lingers nicely. In the glass, it is slightly hazy golden orange with a good tight 1 and 1/2 white head. Nose leads with some apricot, orange blossom, wet grapefruit then gets complicated with some light and fragrant sweet hay and resiny pine. On the tongue, same thing, though the resin comes on stronger at the end and before that, there's also a kind of light candied sticky sweetness. While it is full of flavor, it isn't a very heavy quaff...it is really nicely balanced, and tightly constructed, and it also comes to a nice finish with a little pleasant bitterness. Finally, the flavors really linger...I find myself still enjoying it 10 to 15 minutes after I finished the pint. This one doesn't overwhelm or hit you over the head, but I think it's a great study in harmonious full flavors...extremely glad I got the chance to try this one."
"Pours a rocky white head on a hazy golden body. The head quickly drops to a thin layer with a broader ring that clings to the sides of the glass and leaves behind a delicate lace. The aromas are a subtle mix of tropical fruit, citrus ( lemon, orange) and a hint of malt sweetness. The taste is hop forward without being overpowering and finishes exceptionally smooth without letting you forget that you're drinking an IPA. The ABV is also well hidden, making this an outstandingly drinkable IPA that showcases a great blend of hop aromas and flavors that are exquisitely balanced it's malt and alcohol. Truely an IPA to seek out in a market inundated with competition."
"Pours slight hazed golden color Smell is faint fresh citrus and lemon grass. Taste was grapefruit and oranges with lemon zest a nice pine hop finish. Mouth was crisp with carbonation and hops finishes with some bitterness. This is old school W/C IPA a joy to drink, however nothing special to me here."
"A - Mildly hazy orange body, white head, fat and sticky, producing large lines of tight bubbled lacing."
"Hazy deep orange with large frothy head. Aroma of citrus, lemon, grass, pine. Tastes citrus, lemon, grass, pine, a little soapy, medium bitterness. Medium bodied with medium carbonation."
"What a solid aipa, east coast, West coast style. "
"Soft gold with lots of champagne like carbonation, and topped with 3 fingers of off white head."
"Beautiful burnt orange color with the frothiest head I have seen on a beer ..... maybe ever. The nose is straight up resiny, piney hops, along with some citrus. A West Coast IPA from a brewery as Far east as a brewery can get in the USA - nice!"
"Smooth and crisp, perfectly balanced. Lots of nice citrus and refreshingly bitter."
"Pours a dark gold/light amber coloration with a large, foamy head. Smells quite lovely of citrus fruit, mango and pine, with some light biscuity malt coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, with a very nice balance of doughy, caramel malt and citrus/tropical hops. Slighty sweet, but nicely rounded by a good bitterness. Notes of grapefruit, tangerine, mango and pine. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some pine coming through in the aftertaste. Medium body and carbonation. This has a really good balance of malt/hops and sweetness/bitterness, but the hoppiness is not quite as vibrant as I would have expected, the fruity notes seeming a little faint. Could be because the bottle is 11 weeks old, which really isn't *that* old though. Still a very pleasant East/West Coast hybrid IPA."
"Maybe I had a bad one, aroma was almost non-existent. Poured a cloudy light orange, taste was faint hops a slight orange and a bit of malt. Nothing special, and I paid 8.99$ for this 1 bottle."
"Smooth! Great head retention, wonderful aroma, one of the finest beers I have tasted!"
Damn good but expensive at $7.99 a bottle which will probably keep me from buying it again. Glad I tried it though and recommend others try it.
"So excited to try this. Maybe even more so after trying Mo. pouring from a 16.9 oz bottle into a tulip. This beer pours out a orange golden color. Hazy but not so thick as to look like juice. An strong finger worth of off white yellowish crown. The smell is piney, dank and has a great addition of sweetness. The taste has some dry straw like notes, citrus notes like stonefruit. Some really clean and balanced pine. Wish the sweetness from the nose was as prominent in the taste. But one thing I can say about Maine brewing from the two brews I've had now is there beers just taste clean. The mouthfeel is dry, crisp and refreshing. Overall, damn clean and solid beer."
Look- hazy golden orange with a billowing white head that takes a while to recede; lots of lacing
"Was very excited to try this...not that hoppy, sort of malty in a not altogether pleasant way....ok ipa, but I don't get the hype"
Was a huge Whitehead that leaves tons of lacing. The hazy Brilliant Orange with plenty of carbonation.
"Ah, an onion bomb. While not bad, it's probably one of the more overrated beers on BA. Here goes:"
"Growler into pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy deep amber color with a persistent off-white head. Initial impression is grapefruit and orange juices, with a bit of citrus rind thrown in; pine resin - but subtle, not in your face; and caramel malts to smooth things out (without making a sweet mess of things). Mouthfeel is on the thick side of medium; carbonation is absolutely perfect. Finish is smooth and surprisingly dry. "
"Out of Freeport, Maine comes Lunch from Maine Beer Company, the East Coast take on a West Coast IPA. Also has an interesting story on the how the beer was named."
Bottled on 5/8/18
"Pint bottle born on May 8, 2018"
Decanted from a 16.9 oz (500 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; bottled on 03/27/2018.
One of my all time favorites!
Light amber with a little cloud. Little sweet friuty taste. Not a lot of smell.
"Bottled 3/27/18, consumed 4/21/18"
"I love this beer . It's anything but a juice bomb but for an east coast IPA that has become a little bit of an outlier since the advent of the haze craze this beer never gets old to me. Gentle pour into a pint glass yields a half finger of white foam and the cleanest looking IPA you are likely to see any time soon. Looks great in the glass, nice carbonation and the bubbles rushing up the glass are easily visible through this great looking beer."
Look - hazy golden with a good white head. Looks like a ne
"From the bottle, it pours a hazy amber with a nice head and leaves lacing as you drink it. Piney scent in the nose. The mouth gets a well balanced malt and hop flavor. Nice!"
"It’s interesting to read the commercial description of this one. First sip I thought to my self that it is a little east coast and a little West Coast. Pours a semi hazy, chill haze like copper color. Thick off white head. Nose seems to be decidedly West Coast, resins and pine but if I search hard enough I might make out some mango. Taste is juicy up front. The aforementioned mangos and passion fruit along with that crisp bite of grapefruit pith and zest. Sticky pine and a smooth mellow malty base. Medium body with a bit of that West Coast sticky feel to it. Dry bitter finish. I really enjoyed lunch."
A: slightlt hazy bright orange caramel color with a 1/2 finger rocky off-white Head
Bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada Brewing Co pub glass
Bottled 2/13/18.
Look is a slightly hazy deep tangerine with 1.5 fingers of bubbly off white head.
"A very fragrant and tasy IPA. It pours slightly hazy and with a great head. The aroma is piney and fruity, with some nites of peach cobbler. The taste is sweet upfront with a late bitterness that outlasts the malts and offers a prolonged hoppy flavor. Some floral and tropical notes. An awesome beer."
1 PINT .9 FL. OZ. bottle
500mL bottle born on 2/27/18 poured into a pint glass
"Appearance - Pours slightly hazy golden color with huge thick white head that lasts forever, lots of lacing all around the glass."
"L: Burnt orange color with yellow highlights, mildly hazy. Great head retention, TONS of lace."
"poured into my Tree House tulip, pours a slightly hazy golden with a thick head"
"Dark, weathered orange in color with a heavy, unfiltered appearance. Poured with a tall, rocky, soapy, white foam with good retention. Medium earthy and minty hop aromas with over-ripe orange noted and a lazy, spicy dankness beneath. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Medium light malt aroma. Light creaminess through the middle and light warmth near the finish. Minty hop aromas up front followed by spicy flavors that intensify into the middle. Medium high bitterness through the middle followed by malty notes and spicy, herbal hop flavors. Finished semi-dryly with a lingering spicy, bitterness. Sweet malt character tempers the hop bitterness just enough. Aromas are subtle, yet pleasantly complex. Bitterness at the finish is a bit heavy. Have to admit, been on the lookout for this for a while, and it was a bit of a let down."
"L: gold color, big fluffy white head, nice lacing"
A-I decided to leave this beer in the bottle but I’m presuming he probably looks wonderful.
The perfect American IPA.
"Maine Beer Co. ""Lunch"""
"Tasty orange forward well hopped but balanced IPA. Nothing stands out here nor is there any flaw I can think of. A very clean, crisp, yet full bodied and flavorful IPA. While it's been a while since I had pliny, this feels like an east coast take on that. Balance first, but a good strong flavorful beer."
Doesn’t hit you in the face like the haze bombs of today. But really has no flaws. Great head and retention. Tropical yet earthy smell. Taste follows with grapefruit and orange with a biscuit malty without being chewy or sweet. Great soft feel incredible drinkability.
"Bottled Jan 23, enjoyed Feb 23, so reasonably fresh. Pours golden orange with haze, but nothing like the haze bombs of the day, and I appreciate that about it. It’s pours an inch or two of white head that is stable as hell, refuses to fully fall, and it leaves plenty of pretty lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is typical of classic American ipa, with grapefruit leading the way, with orange pith and a touch of earthiness as well. Taste starts soft and gentle with lots of orange character, like many of the hazier beers that have flooded the market, but dries out and finishes with grapefruit pith and a touch of piney character that lingers after you swallow. Feel is medium to light in body, but feels substantial. Overall, this beer is simple and damn near perfect in that way. Like everything this brewery puts out, its simple beers made right. Exactly right."
"1/16/18. A west-coast-like golden pour with one of the most beautiful heads I've ever seen. It's tall, mountainous, and like a baking soda volcano."
"Bottled 1/16/18, tasted 2/18/18"
"Look-Pale amber, hazy. Creamy persistent head, excellent lacing. "
Appearance – One and a half finger head on a hazy deep yellow body.
Beautiful golden color with a white head. Nothing can quite compare to a fresh beer. It didn’t spend a lot of time on shelf’s or in trucks. I have food in my refrigerator older than this beer. Well balanced. No face slap of hops. One lovely beer.
"L - Golden with puffy carbonated, 3-finger white head. Great retention and lacing."
I'm trying this at Monks Pub in Chicago. It poured a clear golden with white head that is leaving a nice ring lace. The scent had hints of citrus peel. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it's a solid beer.
Pint bottle purchased by Tracey and Bob at the brewery dated 11/17/17. Gold color and citrus nose. Citrus taste including slight grapefruit on the finish along with a hint of pine. A smooth drinking beer but somewhat of a disappointment . We expected a bit more flavor.
"Had on tap at the brewery. Perfectly balanced, malty IPA. Lots of mango and pineapple upfront, tons of grapefruit and pine mid-palate with a lovely, sweet malt finish."
"Lunch is a true West Coast style IPA with a floral/citrus bouquet, The website description really says it all. I've been travelling the east coast for almost 10 weeks, and Lunch is the tastiest IPA I've found. Went by the brewery on my way through Portland to pick some up for the trip north. Wish I had some now."
Nothing not to like in this beauty. Great citrusy notes w/o being overwhelmingly juicy. I would enjoy this any day or occasion.
"Bottled a week ago, picked up at the brewery for $6."
"Picked-up a single twenty-five ounce bottle at Cedarville Wine and SpiritSpiritsee for about eight dollars. I have had this beer before, and swore off of it due to the price. Having not seen it for at leat a year, I pulled the trigger. I think that this is a good, not great IPA, at an obsene price. I am baffled at how MBC stays in business. Would not drink again if dying of thirst."
"Had this as part of a flight at the brewery and picked one up to take home as well. Pours a beautiful golden with very fine particulate cloudiness. Big fluffy white head, great retention, lots of lacing throughout. I'd say the Commercial description pretty much nails it but I'd take the word intense out of it. The subtle malt sweetness is very nice as are the hop flavours but I would say the hop flavours are also all pretty subtle and not so in your face 'intense'. Falls short of being juicy or a hop bomb but it's very nice."
A - Pours a lightly hazed amber with a large foamy white head. The head leaves a ton of soapy lacing.
"Finally. First MBC brew. Although it is an IPA from the northeast, it was more similar to a West Coast IPA. Nice and crisp hoppiness that wasn't the juice bomb I have been accustomed to from the NE states. One of the OGs in the IPA game."
"July 4, 2017 batch. Poured from one of their 500 mL bottles into a pint glass."
Bought at the Vino Market Midlothian va 500ml bottle $7+tax 7/4/17 on label! Pretty fresh bottle! Poured a pure gold with immediate hints of the citrus and some pine. Excellent lacing on glass and upon tasting tropical fruits then pine and some bitterness! Very Very tasty beer! Could drink this all day long and at 7% not too too many! Unless you call ahead for Uber! HAhA! I agree wholeheartedly that this is a Top beer and the Maine Beer Company does a excellent job! My only complaint as I said with their other beers is that the price point for these beers are high especially when you can get other beers just as good (Local and National) for much less!! Enjoy the Summer! SEH Example: 6pack 12oz cans Cigar City Jai Alai IPA for $12+tax at local Grocery 3 weeks old!!
Look -- Golden Orange with white foamy hand
"One of those beers I've been wanting to try for a long time but never had the chance until seeing it today on vacation in Boston on tap at Warren Tavern. Pours a hazy medium copper gold with a small head that leaves good lace. Nose is not a big as I expected, but has nice fruit...qumquat, bubble gum, and a touch of mint in the back. Taste is more classic pine and citrus, and has a fuller hop bitterness than most NE brewers seem to go for. Overall, a very good beer that falls just a tad short of the hype."
L - Somewhere between copper and gold. Slightly hazy. Pure white head. Very nice looking beer. 
"Absolute perfection. This is the best IPA I've ever had. Well balanced and extremely drinkable. Pours a deep amber color with good lacing that dissipates after a few minutes. Grapefruit and citrus flavors stand out as you keep drinking it. Definitely not an absurdly hopped beer (unlike some other East Coast IPAs), which gives it extra drinkability. This is literally a perfect IPA. If you can find it, buy an entire case. Its that good."
"Great example of a no bells or whistles, straight forward, perfectly executed I.P.A.. A medium head with minimal lacing leads to a perfectly floral and expertly pined sip. ""Lunch"" is a perfect name for this I.P.A. because at an ideal 7% and medium feel you can put back more than one within an afternoon (Laundry Day beer). The beer is not overwhelming to ones palate and does not linger too long on your tongue, creating a refreshing environment to enjoy through to the last drop. Now if I can just get my hands on ""Dinner"". Cheers for the great beer, Maine Beer Company!"
"L - Kind of like a medium amber with lots of froth. Not much lacing left, though."
"Just plain excellent. I didn't think it was possible, but Lunch has actually improved my opinion of Maine Beer Co. As happy as I am with Peeper Ale, Lunch has become my new favorite. Sadly, I can't get it as often."
Went to Maine on vacation and stopped by the brewery. This beer is fantastic on tap and I brought a case home to GA to share with freinds. Lighter ipa and super drinkable. As the beer warms up the flavor really comes through. Try it you won't be disappointed.
One of the most enjoyable beers that I have had. You can taste the care that it took to make this beverage. Enjoy!
"Bottle from the brewery, poured into glass at home on the porch. Will have again. Mellow for 7%. Great fresh smell. Head + some haze."
"The appearance is a hazy brown colored body giving a half finger white head that lasted for at least a minute. Some slight bubbles were seen speckling the sides of my pint glass. There was barely any lacing. The smell was based around the pine and citrus with the hops pushing forward for a great combination. I smelled the alcohol once the beer warmed. The taste had a piney with a bitter hoppy edge and some citrus coming out in second place. On the palate it held about a sort of medium-ness balanced body somewhat between a wet and dry, somewhat sessionable - I could see this going with its respected food. Overall, this was a mostly impressive beer that I would definitely have again."
Bottle: Poured a clear yellow color ale with a nice large pure white foamy head with good retention and excellent lacing. Aroma if dominated by strong citrusy undertones with some light grassy and piney notes also noticeable. Taste is a mix of strong citrusy hops notes with some light grassy notes with light pale malt also noticeable. Body is about average with excellent carbonation. Solid IPA with almost no bitterness and lots of delicate flavours.
"Solid beer, but not their best. It's the fan favorite and you can't deny that, but they have better offerings IMO. Either way, solid brewery with a ton of solid brews"
"I haven't had 'dinner' yet from MBC, but this has been my favorite beer from these guys so far. great appearance right out of the tap. super golden. as with most of the beers I've had from MBC, the aftertaste is a little off."
A 16.9 oz bottle (date was unreadable) poured into a tulip. 
"Pours an orange color with a well retained one inch white head that left lacing all the way down the glass. Smells and tasted of citrus ( lemon and grapefruit), cantalopue, pine and a hint of mango. Well carbonated, medium bodied, clean and crisp."
Pint on tap in Boston. White head with nice lace walls. Golden orange color.
Fruity and citrus deliciousness. Hard to get. Very good.
"Had it on tap....good, but I feel like I was let down a bit. I'll be curious to have it out of the bottle - bc I'm sure I'll have a better experience...."
"Bottle into a tulip. Pours a slightly hazy gold with big head. Very tropical, melony smell. Taste has plenty of mango and cantaloupe. It's strong and yet at the same time balanced, even understated, in a way that seems characteristic of Maine Beer Co. beers. Maybe just shy of amazing, but still a really excellent IPA."
"From the brewery in Portland and again from growler station in Greenville. Hazy yellow color with frothy foam...fruit and citrusy smell. Tastes of melon, citrus and pine with hints of lemon. Mild, hoppy, earthy finish. Light, balanced and very, very good."
Was able to have this in there tasting room a few months back and forgot to review it I remember distinctly how light it was yet still had some great flavor. The brewery is awesome and they always have great beers in draft and some great bottles for takeout. I recommend this beer and this brewery
"From 16.9oz bottle, bottled 12/06/16 into tulip."
Tastes like bitter tin foil. Why do People like this beer?
"First had 1/3/17 at home from Johnny G. It is my firm belief that IPA's are the best thing to happen to the northeast since the pilgrims. This showcases it perfectly. Intensely bitter hops, with tropical notes and pine. Needs more body and a better feel to compare to the big boys though."
One of the top American IPAs. Extremely balanced with the right amount of hops.
"Pours a dull, deep golden caramel color. The head is dense, off white, but dissipates quickly. The nose is heavy of hops (as it should be). The taste carries the hops well. There is a little bitterness to go along with the heavy hop flavor, but I like that. After taste hits and is gone fairly quickly. If you find this beer, buy it!"
This is a nice juicy fruity IPA in flavor with a moderate resiny grapefruit rind after bite. Little pale malt backbone...This beer is all about the hops. Light bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Overall a very drinkable awesome IPA. Ontap at vintage
"bottled 10/25, had within 60 days of bottling"
Beautiful bottle conditioned carbonation. The smell is hoppy - mostly herbal (I would guess there is Mosaic in this) with sweet pine and light fruits. The taste follows with a nice malty background and soft bitter finish. Definitely a nice beer but not one I would seek out. nb
"First had at Robert's Maine Grill, Kittery, Maine, on draft into tulip. Spicy, fruity and hoppy, Maine Lunch is a fantastic IPA in a category of its own. Also goes well with oysters."
Service:	Bottle
"Description: Cloudy appearance and light golden in color. Maybe like some watered down orange juice. No head but some white lacing. Smell is light fruit with floral notes and not much pine or bitterness. All in all kind of subtle. The taste lacks the floral, fruity smell and is predominantly hop bitterness. Not pine necessarily, just hoppy bitterness. Feel is creamy and velvety for an IPA with not much carbonation."
"Love Maine Beer Co. in spite of their prices and had to pick this up when I saw it on shelves in NYC. Brewed 09/06/16 (putting this at right around 60 days old - well within the ""drink within 90 days of stamped born on date"" advice on the label). Batch 189."
"Pours a very lightly hazy pale orange in color with a finger of bone white head. Aroma has a bit of pine, grapefruit, and indistinct tropical fruits. Taste has a bit more of a focus on the still indistinct tropical fruits but I get definite grapefruit and pine in the finish. Medium body and moderate+ carbonation. Overall a tasty beer that I definitely enjoyed."
Bottle Date: 9/27/16
Wow.... this one's special. Finally got my hands on it. A little under a month old. 
Now available on draft at Doubleday's Grill & Tavern in Springboro
Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Bottled on 9/27/16.
"I haven't had the opprotunity to try Dinner yet but this is amazing. Gorgeous golden hue, smells of citrus, c-hops, resinous sap. Taste is very tangelo-esque, words don't do it justice. Only found it in Boston thrice this year and each time was an experience. Cheers to MBC!"
"On tap at backcountry pizza in Boulder, the week following GABF at an epic IPA throw down. Been waiting to try this beer for years, and it met my expectations. Great aroma with a crisp hop kick that isn't overly bitter. Still can't believe this was on tap in CO. Well done backcountry! Well done Maine brewing!"
FINALLY got to a restaurant that has it! Found it a bunch of times but was never able to get to it for one reason or another. Worth the wait! Very delicious! Will continue to seek out!
"Great simple label on the bottle with apt description of the beer and brewery ethos on the back. Nothing flashy, just straight up confidence and no bullshit. Beer pours slightly hazy golden yellow with rocky white head and plenty of lacing. Aromas of lemon, citrus, papaya, cantaloupe and juicy melon. Flavor is plenty of hop character as in the nose. Finishes with firm bitterness. Refreshing and very drinkable. Overall, a very awesome IPA from a brewery I've never had but have heard plenty about. Will be looking for a lot more from these guys."
"Quite simply, one of the best IPAs you will ever have. It is so well balanced with subtle hints of florals and citrus, but just enough resin to coat the middle and back of your tongue. Excellent in every way."
"L: Hazy yellow, completely opaque. Very creamy head, about a finger. Crazy long head retention."
"Had it on tap at the Beer Shop and Tasting Table NYC. I arrived at last call and was pleasantly surprised to see they had this, unusual for NY. It was so good I went back the next night and had 2 more."
"Horribly mediocre IPA, especially given the slick and juicy Sip of Sunshine and the extremely drinkable Golden Nugget. Both beers are about as difficult to obtain as this one and provide way more in flavor and hop character than this one."
Awesome
"This beer is excellent not because of how extreme it is but because it tastes exactly as an IPA should. Super balanced, clean, discernible flavors and a wonderful hop bouquet. This is a great beer though I must admit it doesn't crack my top 10 simply because it is so balanced. My palate trends towards the more tropical. Still a must try."
"Great color tones, looks enticing. The smell and taste are just average to me. I was expecting more because Maine Beer Co makes great beers. Perhaps my expectations were just too high"
"Served in a ""goblet"" glass."
"A: I'll admit my pour was not great, prominent foamy 3 finger head, nice hazy straw orange color to it, very prominent lacing and good retention"
"I was traveling in Maine and was very excited about stoping at MBC having always heard great things about their beer. I had Lunch first. It looked good with a typical slightly hazy orangish color with some nice foam. I wasn't getting any great aromas. Citrus and a hint of pine. Taste is some citrus and pine but they are very understated and honestly as a big IPA drinker the taste is very average when compared to all the great IPAs that are coming from the Northeast. The finish is slightly dry and I had to work to finish it. Maybe five years ago this is one of the better IPAs out there. Now, it's just hype!! I sure hope Dinner is a lot better than this beer."
"Poured a clear golden orange with tons of foamy white head. The nose is all hops, citrus, pine and tropical fruit. The flavor is very hop forward with citrus and pine but there is a malt presence to balance the flavor out. The feel is medium with a decent amount of carbonation. This is a great IPA and one I can understand people seeking out."
So far my favorite
"We were introduced to this in Burlington while asking where we could get Heady Topper. We both a few bottles and could see where the hype came from. Very well balanced, citrus, flowers, hops...LOVE it!"
"Orange with off white head. Sticks around nicely. Smell is pine, pine , pine and citrus/grapefruit. Bread, pine and grapefruit dominate the taste. Slightly tropical. Feels sticky, resinous, but not astringent. Thicker than Another One. Im glad I have both of these bottles side by side, both 7 days old. Lunch is a great IPA, but I prefer a little more tropical/silky feel to my IPAs. It gets hot down here man."
On tap
"First trip to Maine, found this night one. Poured from bottle light orange, slightly opaque, 3 weeks old. Aroma grapefruit but not super strong. Light malt bill with subtle hops it is very nice but a bit behind Dinner for me."
"This IPA pours a slightly opaque medium yellow / orange color with a somewhat large foamy white head. The smell is amazing, distinctly IPA without being overwhelming, and high in citrus character (orange and grapefruit). The flavor is similarly great, with strong grapefruit and orange notes and more subtle pine, toasted bread, and herbal tones. The body is medium. This isn’t as hoppy as some of the great west coast IPAs that I’m used to, but I think it’s really nicely balance and more refined. I love this brewery and I have to say that this is my favorite beer that I’ve tried from them (though I haven’t had Dinner), which really says something because they have a great stout and porter and those are usually more my style. This is incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day and another thing that I like about it is that it doesn’t leave a lingering dryness in your mouth like a lot of IPAs. This is a must have for IPA lovers and beer lovers in general, definitely one of my favorite IPAs."
Great feel greater color greatest beer for the greatest life.
"Excellent appearance and smooth finish, taste falls a little short of expectations. Very light, goes down easy."
"I like this beer a lot and I almost always grab some when it shows up here in Vermont. The clean hop flavors with slightly less than medium mouthfeel make it a killer beer on a hot day. However, there are many New England IPA's that I think are better. So, to me, Lunch doesn't live up to the super high ratings and all the hype. Still a solid beer though."
On tap at Monk's in Philly. Cloudy yellow-orange with a finger of white head.
Very good beer. not mind blowing but good.
Had this from local growler filler nicks of calvert. If I can get it again I can update this review...
"Bottled dated June 21, 2016. Poured into Lawson's tulip glass."
"Perhaps most appropriately consumed during the lunch hour, this MainePA (get it?) was poured from the taps at Beachwood BBQ. On to the beer:"
"Served on draft. Flavorful but restrained, very nicely balanced and easy-drinking. A bit bready up front with fruity and floral hops. Very smooth mouthfeel."
Stamped 061416
"Very piney, some citrus but not nearly as much as one would expect from a new england IPA, this is more Pacific northwestern. Smells funky, but not skunky, very smooth, crisp mouthfeel, very crushable."
"Had this at the Worthy Brewfest in Springfield. Review is taken from notes. The beer had a generally hazy orange appearance with an incredible aroma of citrus orange and grapes. The flavor dimension more showed an intense hoppy bitterness wrapped around a palatable citrus flavor. Mouthfeel helps the beer remain very crisp with a good carbonation. Overall, this was an awesome beer."
"Bottled 6/7. Poured into a snifter. Golden orange with healthy lacing, a surprising amount of particulates for an IPA (in my limited experience). Strong hoppy/malty smell with a slight funk on the back end. Malt forward taste, slight bitter hop background. Well balanced, refreshing mouth feel, very tasty beer. Glad I finally got a chance to try it."
On tap at barrelhouse
"On draft at Federal Bar in NoHo, CA. Pours a murky golden with a fluffy white head. Nose is bright citrus and tropical fruit. Very nice. Taste is also prominent grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Finish is slight resin-y and bitter, but not overly so. Medium carb. Creamy feel. Overall, a very good IPA. Happy to have found it in California. Not spectacular by any stretch, but definitely solid."
"This beer pours a cloudy, vibrant golden orange with a massive, dense off white head that sticks around forever. There are sticky chunks of lacing all over as well. Smell is very subdued and underwhelming. Pine, citrus and tropical fruits are most prominent with a hint of bready malt. Taste is the same, but is the slightest bit more flavorful than the smell. Also a moderately bitter finish. Feel is light and smooth with good carbonation. Overall a good beer, but very overrated. It pales in comparison to Another One, Weez, and A Tiny Beautiful Something. The bottle I drank is less than a month old so I can't imagine it fell off that much. If I drank this blind I'd call it good, but not something I'd go out of my way to have again. But taking the price and hype into consideration, this is definitely a disappointment."
"Had it on draft at Poor Phil's in Oak Park, IL. Absolutely incredible and underrated. In some ways it might be better than Dinner, which I have only had once. It has that great New England haze, lots of tropical fruits mostly grapefruit and passionfruit. So juicy that you can't stop drinking it."
"I was in Acadia national park and was lucky enough to find this one on draft at Jordan pond. With such a hyped beer, I prepared myself to be slightly disappointed, but to my great delight, this beer is anything but disappointing. The look has a light amberish hue with haziness which is not common for a beer that light in color. The aroma is quite wonderful with citrusy notes hitting your nose within a foot away. The taste is where this beer really shines as it is quite possibly the most balanced IPA I've ever tried. The 7.0 abv is hidden very well and this is absolutely an easy to drink IPA. The bitterness is there but not overwhelming with a lingering pleasant aftertaste of sweet but not too sweet flavor. The mouthfeel is amazing! This tastes exactly how an IPA should taste and my only disappointment is that Dinner was not yet on draft."
"This is an excellent IPA. It has a beautiful, somewhat cloudy appearance and the smell instantly brought a smile to my face. Very hop forward but still well balanced. I traded for this and have been wanting to try it for years. I think it's slightly overhyped but I'm glad I was able to finally get my hands on it and will seek this out again."
Appear : Cloudy bright orange. - 4/5
Overall a very nice offering. While it was nice I am not likely to buy it again because it was a good bit more expensive than its competitors of the same quality.
"Received from a trader, consumed about 3 weeks after bottling. Had lots of carb, much more than expected. Hay colored with a great nose and balanced taste. I have wanted to try this for years, it was good but the new trend of juicy, turbid IPA's are better than this IMO."
"Appearance: pours an orange color with a hearty 2"" head that lasts a while. A bit of lace develops on the glass."
Revisited 10/6/18
"This is a great IPA and my local spot always gets in fresh bottles. Bottled on 5/4/16. This IPA was a great IPA, but there were no huge stand out points to this IPA. Don't get me wrong I loved it, but I didn't get any memorable features of this beer when drinking it. It has a great citrus malty balance w/ a standard bitter aftertaste. I would have again, but I feel like there are better out there."
An obviously well made beer. Punch of hops that fade away to a smooth finish. Almost like pop rocks falling off the tongue.
Awesome example of a west coast style IPA!
"Underwhelming. For all the hype this beer receives, I didn't find anything remarkable about it. It is good, but like all the MBC beers I've had, it's probably not worth the price. I liked Beer II and some others more than Lunch."
"500 ml bottle, born on date of 050316. Served in a Spiegelau IPA glass, the beer pours a mostly clear gold color with a couple inch off-white head that stayed around for a really long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is really nice, the brew smells mostly like pine and citrusy (tropical fruit, grapefruit, peaches) hops, along with some bready malt. As soon as I poured this into the glass, the aroma was noticeable right away. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it's mainly pine and citrusy (tropical fruit, citrus peel, grapefruit) hops with a bit of bready maltiness. With the aroma I thought the tropical fruit/citrusy hops stood out more, but it seemed to me that there was more balance between the pine and tropical fruit/citrusy flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this a lot, I'd certainly like to try it again in the future. $6.99 a bottle."
"Had on draft at a local restaurant as well as from the brewery. Solid, but unspectacular IPA. For $6 for a 16.9oz bottle I could think off dozens of better IPAs for less, hence why I felt no need to buy any to take with me."
"Giving this beer a very high rate based mostly solely on its smell; it is something out of the ordinary! Fruity and piney! the descriptions ""east coast"" version of a west-coast-style IPA suits it perfectly. A little bit too ""watery"" when it comes to both the taste and the mouthfeel; not terribly, but I think I am just getting too used to Tree House beers."
A: Hazy SRM 3ish with plenty of white head.
Bottle dated 05/10/16
"Smooth, but more subtle flavors and aromas."
Pours a hazy opaque orange with a one finger white head. Head dissipates leaving some white lacing along the glass and some spotty foam on top of the beer.
On tap at Hand and Foot in Corning. 
Maine Beer Company Lunch IPA
Amazingly had two of these for only $2 a pint. Being a Mainer myself I think I can safely say this tastes like Maine in a glass.
Don't get the hype at all on this one. Pretty average when compared to the other things coming out of NE
"Complex, tropical fruity nose with tons of pine and grapefruit flavor leads to a surprisingly bitter and dry but smooth finish. Lives up to the hype, but just barely."
"Tastes effort by MBC that is available in more places than ever. Highly drinkable, smells and tastes great. I drive many miles to find bottles of this Lunch."
"Possibly the greatest IPA I've ever had. I wish could have a case of this beer, fresh. It's expensive, but worth every last cent...Fruity, hoppy, pine notes. perfect bitterness. Dinner surpasses this beer by a very small margin. Must try if you can get it..."
been wanting to try this one for years now...
Bottled 03/08/16
03/08/2016 bottling date served cold in a Stella glass.
500mL bottle poured into a stemless wine glass. 
"Nice beer but Singlecut Billy was also on tap and much better. Not fruity, little bitter."
"A tasty ipa that manages to quell the bitter hopiness, leans more to the fruity side; for someone who isnt the biggest ipa fan; this is probably the best ive tried.....even better than heady."
"This is one of my favorites. Very bright and tart with citrus up front, with that slightly sweet finish and perfect balance of malt. Its a west coast type of IPA, but seems more refined and not overwhelmingly bitter. Its hard to get in the south, so Im really happy our local craft bistro got a keg. Me and my growler are having a good day. Get you some!"
"Poured into teku glass, nice orange body, unfiltered but not too hazy, nice frothy white head after pouring aggressively with strong lacing. The head eventually fades leaving a thin white film Bottled on 2/16/16. Aroma is tropical, but definitely more malty on the taste. Pretty well balanced, but it has a finish that is slightly displeasing. Overall it's a very solid beer, but a little less than I expected."
"On tap at The Brew Kettle Works in Strongsville,OH. Poured into a tulip glass."
"Bottled less than a week old. Straight off the bat after opening the bottle big hit of citrus notes, some grapefruit and orange. Already pretty amazing. Pours a amber-honey with a fluffy white head that lasts the whole drink with some nice lacing. This IPA smells amazing. Very citrusy, strong smell of oranges and slight bitterness of grapefruit. Smells just like sweet orange juice. Taste follows. Starts with a dank pineness that gets overtaken by citrus notes.The orange comes out strong and ends with a sweet, candied orange. Really does live up to the hype. Very balanced between the pine and citrus notes. So good, always enjoy fresh."
Unreal!
"12 ounce snifter. Pours a beautiful orange honey hue, with a one finger white head that rapidly recedes leaving marginal lacing. Nose is citrus and hops: orange peel, lemon zest. The palate bright and hop-centric, with the same cirtus fruits outlining the crisp opening, and the slightest twinge of pine on the bitter, hoppy finish. The mouthfeel truly ties this beer together. Light. Bright. Crisp. It accentuates every note of the nose and palate. Overall an outstandingly executed almost-West-coast IPA from the east coast."
"You're hit with a blast of bold, hoppy aroma as soon as you pop the top on this one. There's candied orange, raw tangerine and mint."
"pours dark orange with nice one finger head lasting for quite a while. get some pine on the nose w light orange and tangerine. taste gets me up front with some pine that makes my tongue tingle. gives way to some light orange and tangerine. end palate i get some lingering resin maybe a little grass, and bitterness. i don't get much malt and bitterness lingers. very nice beer with bitterness that goes on for a while after sip is done. very good for single ipa."
Pours a cloudy tangarine color with a creamy head that lasts. A lot of pine resin followed by pineapple and citrus. Taste is of orange or tangarine with pine. Subdued but overall very drinkable.
"Definitely not a bad beer, but overhyped in my opinion. There's lots of hop presence (it's quite bitter, which I like), but I don't get much complexity and certainly a limited amount of tropical flavors although other reviewers have picked up on more of this. There's a great golden color, and the head retention and especially lacing are quite nice. Overall, I found this forgettable and disappointing for a beer rated as ""world-class"" on this site."
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt .9 oz bottle on February 7, 2016. Born on date 01/19/16. Tasted on May 21, 2016. Born on date 05/03/16. Tasted on June 3, 2016. Born on date 05/10/16. Tasted in a 12 oz snifter from draft at The Craft Beer Store on February 6, 2017. Look is bright amber with a thick white head and sticky lacing. Smell is citrus, sweet berries, toasted bread, nutty yeast and fresh-cut grass aromas. Taste is juicy tropical and citrus fruit, pine, sweetened strawberries, herbs, spices nicely balanced with subtle sweet malt flavors. Feel is medium in body and smooth on entry with some lingering bitterness in the finish."
"first time trying this, felt right as a mid day beer. pours a cloudy orange. fluffy white head that retains and settles to a thick coating on top. most noticed on the aroma are floral notes. definitely some citrus juice. the flavor is balanced with juicy, bitter, and tropical tasting hops. finishes out with a dry bite and spicy burn lingering on the tongue and inner cheeks. definitely a full flavored, hits all the marks, clean and balanced IPA. To be honest, not my favorite beer from this company. but still a great example of what they're capable of and why they might just be my favorite american brewery, at least one that's readily available to me."
Like - Pours a nice looking golden color. Slight haze. 
I've had this beer many times on tap and from the bottle. Prefer it fresh from the bottle. It is very smooth and tastes great. A very solid IPA but hard to find. Maine Beer does a great job and this is probably their best beer .
A bit too malty for my liking for the style
On tap at bar into pint glass (despite recent Press Herald beer review calling for snifters).
"32oz growler filled at Heinen's in Mentor, Ohio"
"Third in a line of five brews, Lunch pours a clear goldenrod. These Maine beers just explode with lacing! Not to mention, the hop freshness has been impressive all night."
Growler
"on tap - look was darker yellow and a great smell deep robust flavor, taste was full of hop citrus and pine, great feel good level of carbonation, a very very good beer."
"Had on tap at McGillicuddy in Williston. Nice golden color, crisp citrus and pine taste. Very good carbonation. I enjoyed this beer very much. Need more."
"I've been lucky enough to have Lunch several times - once even at the brewery on tap. It's such a classic example of an east coast IPA: pale, dank, strong malt backbone - all the characteristics that I look for in an IPA."
Light and see through orange color with one finger head. Aromaa is nothing much. Taste isn't much. It has a decent malt backbone with some pine. Mouth feel is crisp and a little over carbonated. This one was disappointing. No need to trade for it. Your locals are just as good.
"Gold (4+) draft pour with bright white head; thick lace; good cap which disappeared fairly quickly; excellent clarity. Citrus hop and caramel malt aromas initially; lite green hop nose as liquid warms. Flavors of bright citrus hop start followed by zippy lemon peel; caramel malt foundation supports citrus notes. Tingly lemon zest tongue coating; moderate carbonation; medium, almost creamy malty mouthfeel. Overall, excellent balance between smooth caramel malt and zesty citrus linger. Outstanding."
"Bottle. Bright golden with tint of orange, finger white head fades to thin layer, not much lace. Nice citrus peel aroma with light malt. Hop forward taste, big grapefruit peel but not overly bitter, some pine in there as well. Just enough malt for balance. Clean dry finish and silky soft mouthfeel. This is a simple and delish brew, top notch IPA."
"Outstanding IPA bottled 12/15/15, pours a nice yellow-orange, light tropical fruit in the nose, mildly piney dry flavor with very little malty sweetness, this but expected for a single IPA, nice thin mouthfeel good for a hot day I imagine, dry bitter aftertaste that lingers (really good). Easy drinking for sure!"
"VERY good ipa, best w steak."
"what a great beer to become the best seller for an amazing brewery. looks golden, clear and head which disappears fast. aromas of tropical fruit, green mango, pine. tastes like how it smells. solid soild IPA. never disappoints. great drinkability for 7%ABV."
Growler poured into a tulip
"Copper pour, full on 1 inch of head. Good retention, average lacing. Aroma was hoppy, not the most pungent, some amarillo I'd guess."
Wonderful. Glad I live in Maine and can get it reasonably easily.
Golden/orange/tan...medium hazy body
"IPA's do not get much better. It's hoppy, but at the description indicates, the hint of malt sweetness bring a superb balance to the beer. Absolutely delicious"
Maine Lunch 
"Bottled 11.17, enjoyed on 12/7."
16oz bottle into pint glass. 
Wow. Beautiful beer. Amazing aroma. Taste is citrus bitterness offset by a little malt sweetness. Heavy smooth mouthfeel. Can't get better than this. Amazingly drinkable.
"Absolutely gorgeous pour. Hazy yellowish gold with ample sticky white foam. The lacing is as good as it gets. The nose is a little more subdued than I expected. Still very nice and complex with pine, citrus, grass, mango, bready sweetness. The taste is more straightforward, pine, resin, balanced well with malt flavor. The mouthfeel is medium, low-moderate carb, and extremely smooth. Balanced with a slightly dry finish. Absolutely an elite IPA."
"Bottle dated 10/13/15 picked up at brewery. Pours clear and dark straw in color. Aroma is rich, with citrus and resiny hop notes up front, and a light malt background with a touch of biscuit."
Great hoppy goodness
"Very smooth, eminently drinkable, but just a hint of too much fruit for my taste."
"From a growler, from a just-tapped keg. Look is very nice, a rich light gold with a hint of green, and almost completely clear except for a tiny bit of haze. One-finger head is off-white and dense, leaving some pretty lacing. Head dissipates fairly quickly, but a gentle swirl brings up a film of fine white bubbles all the way down the glass. "
Wicked good
On tap at The Great Lost Bear.
"So many IPA's out there now, you could hardly find it when it first came out."
"Great brew, but I think my palate is burnt out from drinking julius, alter ego, congress st. Will reassess at a later date."
"looks great in the glass, stoked for this one. wicked nice nose, not too strong but getting a plethora of citrus dankness. taste is mildly bitter with citrus flavors predominating. its crazy how good this stuff is, one of the best and most drinkable IPAs."
This beer has a great mouthfeel and crisp finish. Very refreshing....excited to check this one off my list. A tad overrated but still a super solid beer from MBC.
Pour: On draft at The Jeffery in NYC. Poured into a tulip glass. Appearance: Dark gold in color with some slight haze. Thick white head that lasts. Lots of lacing present on the sides of the glass. Aroma: Slight citrus zest. Pine and earthy notes as well. Taste: Funky and earthy. Juicy with big hoppy citrus flavors. Aftertaste: Slight bite with the earth and citrus notes that continue through the back end. Overall: I really liked Lunch. Strong showing from Maine Brewing. Very good. 4.42 out of 5.
"Lunch on tap at Gallo's Tap Room enjoyed October 22, 2015. "
"This is aptly fruity with watermelon, lemons, oranges, tangerines, grapefruit and a piney finish. The malt is light and doesn't offer much support but it continues with a hefty feel. Very enjoyable and delicious but a bit over-hyped."
"BOD 9/29/15. Almost clear yellow golden pour. World class head volume, lacing and retention."
"Pours a hazy light Amber color. Has aroma of pine and citrus. Flavor is citrus, a touch of pine and a mild sweet finish. Leaves a nice hop aftertaste. Overall flavor is nice, a little light but very smooth and drinkable."
5 day old bottle.
My favorite beer
L: Pours a clean dark orange that you see right through. Looks just like Pliny in a glass.
"Appearance: Clear, golden color with two big fingers of head that fade slowly with thick lacing."
A great well balanced IPA that still has a bite. One of the better East Coast IPA's I have had.
"Had this on tap at the Jordan Pond House in Acadia National Park. A clear reddish golden pour with very little head and no lace. Nice floral and citrus aroma. Taste is clean and mild, slightly hoppy, very little malt backbone, clean and dry. Mouth is medium-thin, dry and refreshing. Overall, a solid pale ale."
I'm a big fan of Maine brewing and I'm happy it's suck a close brewery 
"WOW! This is definitely one of the best in production brews to date! Not overly hopped, but just enough to satisfy the hophead in me. Light in color, fragrant and citrusy, but not overly so. Sharded with the GF it was a nice complement to our actual lunch. Paired well with nice fat burgers on the grill. A bit pricey, but, what the heck, you only live once!"
Found the citrus finish past the pine trees
Appearance: golden color with light haze 
"9.16.15 on draft @ Maine beer Co. Brewery. Freeport, ME"
"Super clear beer, breaks the norm of the north east coast ipa which is a nice change of pace. Good hop aroma. Taste is clean with some malt forward sweetness. Hops come through also, west coast style hops, mango and floral characteristics with a hint of pine. Mouthfeel is a tad on the thin side. "
Pours a hazy golden yellow with a chalk white head. Great lacing.
16.9 oz bottle poured into shaker pint bottle dated 6/16/15
Appearance: It has a beautiful light golden/orange color to it. It has a nice white head that dies down moderately and leaves nice lacing.
"Clear gold with thin white head. Big grapefruit aroma, with something sweeter -- maybe a little peach and pineapple. Continues over to the taste, with a somewhat watery, low-malt middle and strong hop bitterness. It's got that same watered-down juice thing going that a lot of their beers have, but it's masked more by the bitterness. The mouthfeel has a nice ""scraping bubbles"" thing going."
"adding my review since I didn't give it one last time I had a bottle. pours a moderately hazy yellow/slight orange color. good foamy head that laces the glass as it dissipates. on the nose is tropical fruits and little bit of citrus, i can smell a bread-like malt as well. taste is tropical fruits and peaches, very slightly bitterness from the citrus notes, and that bready malt backbone that ties this entire beer together. mouthfeel is just like every other Maine beer: top notch. great beer when you can find it, too bad CT liquor stores like to hide it."
"Like mo, this has a fairly old school flavor profile, just expertly done. Somehow remains delicate without pulling any punches. not a brain fuck in the sense that you didnt know these flavors could be pulled from hops; in fact youve known these flavors could come from hops for as long as you realized hops were rad, but not many brewers have pulled these now classic once new flavors from hops so perfectly. experiencing that in itself is a bit of a brain fuck. Always a treat from those smug kids in freeport."
"Had this a while back, just found the notes on my phone. Don't recall being overly impressed. Served in a tulip glass."
I love how crushable and tropical this bad boy is! Definitely met the hype!
"Everything it's cracked up to be and lives up to the hype every time whether on Tap or bottled. Clean, crisp and very drinkable. Outstanding"
Exactly as I had heard. An excellent IPA that is what it is and makes no bones about it. Its the way IPA's should be. Clean smooth and drinks easily. One of the brews that lived up to all the good things I heard. Will def have again.
Poured into my Spiegelau IPA glass with a huge fluffy head that hung around for a few minutes. Great light-golden color with a robust citrus smell that became apparent immediately after the first pour. Perfect balance of tropical and piney hops with the ideal amount of bitterness that one would expect from an excellent IPA. 
Had this on tap at tørst. A light gold with a white head. Aroma is a striking competition between citrus and pine. Taste is Sweet upfront which flows into a bitter finish. The aftertaste is my favorite...just a slight spicy kick that makes this beer one of the best IPAs I've tasted.
"I haven't been fortunate to have tried Dinner yet, but I must say that Lunch is outstanding. It is great both on tap and straight out of the bottle. A wonderful beer."
Look - slightly hazy yellow.
"Perhaps it was just an old bottle, but I felt like this didn't live up to the hype it has gotten. I would certainly be willing to try it again, but it just tasted very flat compared to what other brewers like Tree House are pumping out currently. I want to like it a lot more, but a rating above 4 would by a lie."
"Really hard to find fault with this beer in any way, shape or form. Best IPA I have had from the Eastern part of the US and safe t say one of the best beers I have ever drank (to be fair my bottle was purchased at their brewery and drank shortly after). Really hope this brewery can grow."
"Great New England style IPA. Not as good as some of its hazy, juicy, chock full of floaters contemporaries like Trillium's Congress St, IPA but still excellent."
Very good tasting ipa. Get some (if you can) !!
"Lemon, citrus, and some slight grass smell. The scent is rather light. Taste is an amped up version of the smell nice hop presence. Good mouthfeel. Overall solid but nothing about this beer wowed me. To be fair this was bottled in June so it's fresh but not 1-2 weeks fresh."
"Look - super enticing color, light golden color with a frothy white head. Need to be careful when pouring; if you pour too hard you will likely end up with half a glass of head."
"On tap, pours light golden with white frothy, clingy head. The citrus and fruit smells are amazing. Perhaps the smoothest, most balanced IPA I've tried. This one begs for a long session. Everything good about the aroma comes through in the flavor. Finish is clean, and somewhat fruity. Best IPA I've had to date. Great stuff."
"Clear golden color, well balanced and refreshing. filtered and somewhat subdued compared to other highly rated IPA's. Worth a trip to the brewery for a taste."
Lives up to the hype. Just the right hops. Great flavor. Excellent and smooth
2015-07-15
"Had on tap. Very good beer and my new favorite from the brewery. What impressed me the most about this beer is how light and delicate the flavors are, but also how well the melded together. Taste is citrus, orange, lemon, tangerine, and light malt. This is one I will pick up again."
I wish I could land more than one! Very good beer.
"Poured from a growler filled from State Line liquors at the MD/DE boarder. $20 for a 64oz, expensive, but worth the price. "
"Bottled 6/19. Lots of citrus on the nose and palate. Light orange and clearer than a lot of New England IPAs. Well balanced and easy drinking. Overall, a delicious IPA."
"Enjoyed on draft. Was expecting wayyy more. Was really just above average, have had plenty of plus plus ipa's over the last couple of months, and Lunch was just not one of them."
"Got in a BIF with beerloserLI. 500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/2/2015. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate bready malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon/peel, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for good bit. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly sticky, and slightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming after the finish. Overall this is an awesome IPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"This used to be one of my favorites. However there are a lot of other new breweries making better beers than this. Taste is great much like dinner, but the aroma is lacking compared to other IPA's."
Very smooth IPA. Nice citrus notes.
"My expectations were somewhat tempered after hearing a few people downplay this beer before I finally got the chance to try it. Is it among the best of the best? Not quite, but excellent nonetheless. "
This beer is amber in color with a big frothy white head. The aroma is sweet and hoppy and the initial flavor is a sweet fruity hoppy beer with subtle dank piney hops following. The only weakness in this beer for me was the mouthfeel. It was much thinner than I like.
"I've had this beer many times, but this latest batch tastes like a light version of itself. Not at all what it usually tastes like. Very thin..... On draught at Sunset ..6/28"
Bottled on 6/16/2015
"At the pour farm in New Bedford,Ma"
Love it when people smell lemongrass as one of their top 3 smells. Really? You can discern lemon from lemongrass in a beer but nothing else? Do you live in shrubbery?
Stopped at their tasting room on my way home from Boothbay and tried this one on draft. It was everything I had hoped it would be. My only regret is that the 6 bottles I picked up will run out quickly and I'll have to wait until we visit Maine again next summer. still glad that I had an opportunity to finally try this great beer.
Great balanced taste good color with fruity citrus nose.
"If I didn't have principles, I'd pour this. How this beer has the hype it does is mind-boggling. No bright hop character, faint nose, boring malt bill, and just an uninteresting and mediocre IPA. It was pretty and the body of the beer was nice but that's where it ended."
"Not impressed with the pour. Want more haze but colour saves it. Smells of light fruit, lemon. Taste is a dry citrus with really well matched hop bitterness. Well carbonated."
"Couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this one yet; available every couple weeks in RI and always worth the purchase at $6.99. When it is in stores, it is consistently one of the best IPAs available on the shelf."
"Bottled 2 weeks ago, pours hazy gold orange color with a foamy 1-2 finger slightly off white head with a ton of bubbles in it that faded very slowly and left great spotty foamy lacing and rings as it went down. A small layer lingered on top for another fine looking Maine IPA, and the second half of the bottle poured just as nicely. "
"This is a cloudy IPA--I know it's a matter of taste, but I have more respect brewers who can produce a dope clear IPA. The smell is nice, with some subtle tropical fruit, kind of like Zombie Dust. The taste just doesn't carry that fruitiness from the smell through, though. I think this could be a great beer, but it's missing something in the taste. Bottle dated 6/2/15 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
500mL bottle from HopSynonymous (you rock!). Bottled 5/19/15. Served in a Barrel and Barley teku. 
"On tap at Walrus + Carpenter in early 2015 and then out of the bottle multiple times after that. Pours a gorgeous slightly hazy gold with a thick head. Super hoppy aroma is totally inviting. Wonderful melange of hops on the tongue. Citrus, juice, pine, herbs, lavender, touch of lemon. Biscuity and sweet malts never overwhelm but the body might be a hair too much. Easy to drink."
"A nice, juicy IPA. Bitterness is not strong which allows the citrus and tropical flavors really come through."
"Tasted on tap at The Great Bear in Portland, ME. Perfect toasted orange, slightly hazy appearance with a Snow White head, 1/8"". Excellent frothy lacing. Sweet N' piny aroma, as well as apricot. Flavor is resinous and not too harshly bitter like many IPAs. It's pretty mellow despite the initial flavor."
"Tried at ACBF in Boston and enjoyed it. Had another the next day at TITS in Allston. Given how much better it was the next day, there are a lot beers from ACBF that I need to try with a clean palate. Love all MBC beers (so far)"
"500ml bottle poured into snifter, purchased at CBX in Charleston for $8. "
Beautiful IPA - found it on tap in Boston. Pours a golden hue with a distinct citrus and slightly piney aroma. Drinks super easy and certainly leaves the palette intact after a glass or two. The resin and pine characteristics are confined to the aroma and hop-kiss that comes on quickly but then graciously makes way for the bready slightly sweet malt and finally the bitterness that prevents it from becoming too sweet. One of the more crisp IPAs I've enjoyed all year.
"Swung by the Nashua Garden today for some post bike ride libations. Saw Lunch on, so I sez ""wtf, Gus?!""."
"Heartier than other pale ales. A little bitter, but still has a strong hop finish."
"Really yummy citrus bust and an effervescent mouthfeel, great! Little yeasty, but only a tad in the back and I still think it's like a 4.6 beer. Really thin and easy to drink. Very good. Heady's my fav for reference"
Bottle dated 4/21/15. Lovely tropical notes. Nice yellowish orange color with medium carbonation. Hops with tropical flavors. So smooth and drinkable. I would drink this all day everyday.
This beer is absolutely worth the wait. Fantastic.
Light and refreshing. I wad expecting more depth and flavor...
Awesome on tap. Bottle is a big letdown IMO.
One note hops. Average beer
Not as good as I thought it would be.
Straw to medium gold. Just a touch of haze. Huge nose lots of grapefruit. Big grapefruit and citrus flavors. Bitter but not over the top.Good mouthfeel maybe thinner than some big IPA's. Overall a great IPA.
16 oz bottle (thanks Nathan!) poured into an oversized Modern Times tulip glass
"On tap at Double Windsor - Brooklyn, NY"
I was fortunate to have my girlfriend's father share this with me. Amzaing and can't wait to get my hands on Dinner one day!
Overall a great IPA. Very balanced with the right amount of citrus and pine. Love the finish. Can't wait to try it again.
"Hazy pale golden color; pours with short lived, lightly sticky head."
"Quick review. Super dry, nicely-hopped IPA. Looks nice, smells better. I like the carbonation here & the extra-dry finish."
"Picked this up a few weeks back at the Whole Foods on Houston St. in New York City. I always say that IPA's are a dime a dozen so I wasn't sure if this would measure up to the heavyweights the top this category. This one didn't have to because as the Alstrom brothers said in their review, this was certainly an East Coast IPA. Not as aggressive as those from out west, this had such nice balance to it while delivering a mild punch and wonderful array of flavors at the same time."
"High quality IPA. Not too hoppy, but nice dry hops and very smooth and creamy feel. Doesn't seem like 7 abv at all. Lemony, straw, grassy. Maybe slight hint of lime. Lived up to my hopes and expectations. Excellent."
Great beer. Well worth checking out
Possibly the best IPA I've ever had.
"Poured after being bottled 3/17/15. Golden, two finger head. Strong hop armor - leafy pine and citrus. Tastes clean, bitter, and noticeably carbonated. Balance seems near flawless."
"Thanks Crown Wine & Beer for this wonderful treat. Certainly one of my favorite IPA's so far. Look forward to trying Maine's DIPA ""Dinner""."
Amazing. Finally got my hands on this and it seems worth the hype
"Poured from a bottle born on 2/2/15 (sent by MNishCT77) into IPA glasses; one clear, one with lees added."
"This is a fantastic west coast style IPA. Has a very similar, to my taste, hop profile to Pliny the Elder."
"Bottled on 3/17/15, poured hazy orange, two finger head sticky looking and laced like a mother. Some citrusy aspects in the nose as well as a bit of earth and the occasional whiff of booze actually, especially after it warmed. Taste followed nose with more balance than MBC Another One. More great stuff from Maine"
"Creamy in color, reminds me of King Sue from TG. Great citrus and floral notes, finishes clean. Wish it had a bit more body to it, but amazing beer none the less."
"I pick up more of a citrus note on the nose, but it goes down with a lot harsher bitterness and taste of pine. Always an interesting IPA and grows on you with each taste."
"After having a second Lunch — one that was a little bit fresher — I updated my rating from a 4.48. Lunch is a refreshing beer but not quite as complex as other IPA, hence the slightly lower score. A brew worth looking for nonetheless."
So good! Best single IPA I've ever had.
Poured from a bottle into a tulip
"This is my second time having lunch, but first time on tap. This experience was much better. The beer is a beautiful clear gold with a nice bit of lacing as I drank it. The smell was fabulous, with tropical fruits, melon, and tangerines all hitting your nose. The taste is very similar. West coast style, with an in your face amount of hops that hit your taste buds. Nice sweet tangerines notes along with some orange hit you before a nice bit of pine and evergreen finish slightly bitter. The feel is slightly over carbonated for my taste, but not a big issue. Overall, a great ipa."
"I liked it but it just doesn't hit me like some of the other killers in the category. Stopped at the brewery and had a great time, good people."
One of the best I have ever had.
Not a bad beer I like MO better
Amazing Maine IPA. A total experience for the palate. Balanced extremely well.
This is the best IPA I have had yet!!! I love this beer and Maine is killing it In the craft brewing! Glad I live there.
Finally I have picked up that one of the last few big IPA's I had been looking for! Thanks man for the trade. I do appreciate it!
Another phenomenal beer from MBC. Had Dinner a couple of times and love it but Lunch is great since it is available year round. Hard pressed to beat this beer for something that is readily available year round in ME.
I've been wanting to try this for a while.
"Phenomenal brew with a ridiculously high drinkability. The initial taste is mild (with warm notes of clove honey), but gradually intensifies as the hoppiness takes over."
One from a fresh sampler of MBC bottles enjoyed in a pub glass. 
Been reading BeerAdvocate for about 10 years. So impressed that this is my first review. New to the East Coast (from Texas with frequent West Coast travel). 
good. Not very unique. Still delicious.
Great IPA. Just not a fan of the IPA style.
"Bottled 12.30.14 and enjoyed from a teku today, 2.18.15."
Wow.
"The best single IPA I have ever had. Amazingly clean taste, not too bitter, but plenty of hop flavor that lasts throughout the entire sip. I need to try more beers from these guys..."
"This is the kind of beer that forces you to rate to style. Its one of the best american IPAs that I've had, but there are other DIPAs that I'd rather drink. "
Type: Pint bottle
Very smooth and crisp. Drinking from a 12/30/2014 bottle
16.9oz bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled on date is 12/30/14. 
Fresh hops but not bitter
Favorite IPA of all time. Very happy to be a craft beer enthusiast living in New England. We are holding it down.
The best ipa I've had to date. Hands down. 5's across the board
4.5/4.25/4/4/4.25
Great IPA. Definitely in my top 5 for IPA's. Wish I could get more often. Sooo good.
Medium-high carbonation throws a thick head with good retention.
"Very good beer, highly recommend if you can get your hands on it. I have yet to try the other brews from the Freeport Maine brewery. Nice color, great taste. Smell was sweet."
L: Hazy light amber hue with a fluffy white head and brilliant lacing.
One of the most beautiful beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Almost perfect pour Into a tulip glass creates a thick fluffy white head that rolls like clouds on a summer day. Gorgeous lacing that sticks around and hugs the rim of the glass throughout the session. 
Had a bottle on 01/15/2015 that was bottled on 12/30/2014. Super fresh for my first lunch!
Delicious!! My favorite beer of all time!!!!!
"pours a great orange color with a perfectly white head. Huge tropical fruits in the nose here. Mango, oranges, pineapples galore. An amazing nose! The taste is tropical fruit, bright bitter hops. Smells more tropic than it tastes. Overall a great beer. If you like fruit hop bombs, this is for you!"
Sampled this bottle with my bro Brian. Poured at room temp into some snifters. Beer is a golden copper hue with some floating particulates.
Appearance: A nice golden orange hue with slight haziness.
Look: Deep golden color; cloudy but translucent. Pours a huge 3 finger light tan head that dies down slowly leaving a thick uneven layer of foam on the surface of the beer and lots of sticky lacing on the glass. PERFECT!
My favorite IPA - perhaps even favorite beer. Beats Heady Topper *gasp*
This is definitely a heavily dry hopped IPA. Immediately when you open the bottle the room fills with the scent of fresh hops.
Bottled 12/23 drank on 1/4 so nice and fresh!
I've been hunting down lunch for a while and I finally got my hands on some only bottled 11 days ago.
Great beer from a great Brewery
"Without question, this is the best smelling IPA I've ever had. Strong citrus and floral notes that will knock you off your seat. The flavor profile is similar, but just doesn't fully follow the amazing aromas."
"The quintessential IPA. Balanced, great aroma, delicious."
"It isn't my favorite Maine beer, but damn is it good. I will take Another One over Lunch but you really can't go wrong with the pale ale family of beers from this brewery."
A fantastically balanced and smooth IPA
"The way an IPA should be. Amazing in every aspect, one of my favorite beers. Period."
"Phenomenal. Nose is subtle, yet resinous and oily, pungent taste. A staple of what an IPA should be like."
"My favorite Maine thus far, but I haven't had dinner yet."
The East Coast's best brewery. Love this beer (yes it's West Coast styled).
"One of my favorite beers from my favorite brewery, what can I say? Pours a hazy orange with a big frothy white head. Smells beautiful, nice pineapple sweetness, some good mango, very faint pine, some candied citrus. "
A-	Has a great clear copper color with a two finger lumpy off white head. Head recedes quickly leaving behind chunks of lacing around the glass
"Absolutely fantastic, though I had it fresh (5 days old). Not sure if it'd hold up to being more than a couple weeks old."
Excellent well rounded beer
16.9-ounce bottle poured into a tulip.
"Super fresh, this was crafted a couple of weeks ago."
"Poured from 500 ml bottle into a tulip glass. Bottle was within the 90 day ""best buy"" date."
A: Dark gold with a touch of hazy bronze. Fast rising and sturdy white head. Thick banding. 
"A - Deep orange amber color and hazy, bright white one inch frothy head with decent lacing"
Tried this again. Way better than the first time I had it. Doesn't lack for quality in any one area. All around great ipa
"I got this beer from meulmann's craft draughts in rawsonville, vt"
Better than Dinner imho. Great IPA. This and Mo are how beers should be done!
I love this beer! Had it out of the bottle in New York and was so happy that I decided to buy it. Great dry hop smell and flavor that has that cloudy ipa look that I love. I wish I could have this every day.
"On tap at the Cask and Vine in Derry, New Hampshire. I was quite pleased to see this on the menu as I have been wanting to try it for years. Bright yellow-orange color, slightly hazy, good head. Aroma is quite hoppy, tropical and dare I say West Coast. Flavor was bitter, tropical, hoppy and again possibly West Coast. Probably one of the best IPA's from the east coast I've ever had, wish I could have brought home bottles."
Look: Crystal clear orange-amber with a thick and frothy cream colored head. Moderate activity. Lots of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. 
On tap at the brewery. 10/9/14.
Poured into a Dogfish Spiegelau glass. Label says 090914.
"A good IPA, but the taste never lived up to the nose"
"Slightly hazy draft pour, golden, dense white head with significant lacing. Floral, melon scents. Mild mango and papaya flavor rounded by bitterness and biscuit malt background. Average body and below average carbonation."
"A. Hazy, orange, great lacing, frothy head"
"Forget the haters, believe the hype. Super well balanced and just straight up delicious. Definitely grab it if you see it."
Got in a trade
"Absolute perfection. My new favorite IPA, although I doubt I'll be getting this again in San Diego."
Bottle poured into snifter.
"Had this a few times before, but never on tap. "
Light copper with a few floaties. The nose is wonderfully hoppy – the flavor profile does not quite deliver the hop bitterness “promised” in the nose. The body is a touch lighter than most top-shelf IPAs . Very good but not quite up to the hype.
"Beer poured an enormous, sticky, off colored head. color was a slightly hazy amber."
"Pours a clear yellow gold with a nice two finger head. After break there are a few islands of foam, and the lacing is good. "
A little thin. Very fresh and clean though.
"Simply amazing. First beer of the night, will not be topped. Hop taste is there up front with a smooth finish. Highly recommended."
"A - Thick white head tapers off to reveal an intricate lacing, all atop a golden semi-translucent body. Very nice look."
"I have had better for sure, but this is still a great IPA worth trying at least once!"
Love the intense hoppiness.
14 days after bottling
"Despite a thickness in the burnt dark orange color, and so much that it's closer to opaque than translucent, this beer is actually quite bright. Some floaties make their way around here and there. The head is a pale orange-tinted one that's quite hefty at a fluffy and rocky two fingers tall. Retention is good, and it drops down quite a bit of sticky lacing all down the glass."
"Pours a pale orangeish color with a bit of haze. Lace is left all along the glass. The aroma has pineapple, pine, grapefruit and orange. A zesty, citrusy nose."
"Big frothy head, easily three fingers with a very slow dissolve, uneven surface, cream white not bright, the lacing is thinner than you’d think, average stickiness at best, very light gauziness to the orange bronze liquid, consistent coloration throughout, few visible bubbles, maybe they all rushed to the top during the pour. The nose is thick which marginally hampers freshness, plenty of pine, herbal matter, the white grapefruit adds to overall punch, same for the white pepper element, the cocoa and malt cloaked, thickly layered nectarine, pineapple, guava, peach fruit scents, not going for finesse but comes off as a gentle steamroller. Full-bodied, tangy and biting, even the carbonation has a chip on its shoulder, steady push towards the throat. More tangerine and orange mixed into the grapefruit. The floral element softens a few rough spots. Earthy and close to minerally or metallic. The fruit pulls back, apricot, peach pit and some pineapple, green apple. As in the nose the malts wait until the 11th hour to arrive. Piney qualities add to bitterness. This is no messing around, no smiling, just business, type of beer."
"Poured from pint bottle into a pint glass. Pours a light copper color with a white half finger head, with good lacing ten minutes after the pour. Smells of malt, sugar, Hops, and citrus (mostly grapefruit). Tastes just as it smells, with first impression being the malt, then an earthy sugary taste, lastly the citrus lingers as you swallow. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with moderate carbonation (a little less than I usually like in IPAs). Overall a good IPA but not one I'd go out of my way to get, I much prefer the King Titus porter or dinner."
"Wow, what a great looking beer! Beautiful orange with amber to ruby hues, big towering and thick just off white head that stays atop the beer till nearly the end and deposits big sticky and chunky lacing. Aromas burst from the glass alive with grapefruit citrus like notes and slightly sweet tropical aromas. Initially your met with sweet malt flavor with a wave of hop flavor bringing big citrus and tropical favors. Malt sweetness hangs in just to right before the finish which brings on some teeth clenching bitterness and that amazingly bright hop flavor. Mouthfeel starts amazingly lively with the carbonation with a medium body. It bursts into a creamy feel then finishes completely dry and compliments that great hop flavor and bitterness bringing an amazing drink ability. This is a world class IPA that has it all figured out."
Poured from pint bottle into tulip glass. 
16oz. bottle poured into an IPA glass. 06-03-2014 bottle date
a. Cloudy yellow orange color with 2 finger white fluffy head when poured into a pint glass.
"A: beautiful golden beer, first pour was crystal clear, second pour from end of bomber came out a little cloudy, decent white head that faded fast, with decent lacing"
500ml Bottle received in trade with iguenard - thanks!
Bottle poured into a chalice
Appearance - The beer poured a golden copper color into the IPA glass with bubbly white head that left lacing on the sides of the glass as it dissolved.
"Delicious! East Coast, West Coast - who cares, this is a well done IPA. What can be said about a really good IPA that hasn't been said a million times in these reviews. It looks great, it smells great, it tastes great. It's a West Coast / East Coast IPA made and it's done well. Citrusy, fruity, even piney. Good stuff."
Appearance upon pouring is dark orange or maybe light brown. Head was relatively thick on this pour. Good lacing.
Poured from bottle into a pint glass
06/03/2014 date.
Appearance - Pours a clear copper hue with three fingers of foamy white head.
I enjoyed chilled from the bottle in a tulip. 
"Thoroughly enjoyed this ipa. Solid in every aspect, a well crafted representation of the style and a silky feel as well. Not as flavorful as some of the more readily accessible ipa's around but the mouthfeel is superb."
A- cloudy orange liquid. No carbonation visible. Frothy white head. Sticky lace everywhere. Persistent head. 
Pours golden in color with a deep haze and a good one finger white fluffy head. 
"500ml bottle, just over a month old, so I guess that means that we (me and the beer) are good to go!"
Hazy bright orange with a white head that retains and leaves ample lace.
Poured into a snifer.
Appearance is a hazy orange color with a one finger white head.
"Pour is a golden amber with a fairly tight white head and a good bit of lacing on the glass. Nose has a hint of grain and some sweet malt with a fair bit of citrus hop and lots of resin. Taste follows the nose, sweeter malt and lots of resiny hop. Citrus is mild, moderate bitterness, strong hop flavor but not the kind I love and gets a touch sweet. It is heavily carbonated, moderately soft but a touch of syrup."
"Milestone review (#500) and it came down to a Maine Beer Co. brew versus one from Green Flash. Since I am pretty pumped that we just got another wave of four Maine beers hitting Alberta, here goes. Different array of hops from Another Round and this one is rooted more firmly in citrus and herbal territory, with Another Round skewing more tropical and perhaps more pungent overall (see that review). This one is a cloudy lemon yellow with a rich beige head, a matrix of smaller bubbles encapsulated in a layer of larger ones. A remarkable fresh hop aroma greets the drinker, pineapple, mixed citrus and fresh spruce needles, resinous with hints of berry. Palate is a sublime mix of orange/grapefruit/tangerine/lime rind and juice, pineapple, rock candy, baby aspirin, sage, red berry, guava, and a whiff of burnt toffee. Largely a hop flavor and aroma showcase but with enough malt to add a balancing sweetness to the equation. Very bitter but said bitterness is ultra-clean, buttressing an assertive and juicy finish of mentholated cough candy, lime, and flower shop. Body on the low end of moderate with the carbonation on the high end. Another clear cut masterpiece from this brewery, sophisticated and nuanced yet bold of flavor. The worst thing anyone can say about these guys is the high price point, which frankly I will keep paying so long as the quality remains this high. The social and environmental initiatives these guys take only sweeten the deal."
Bottled 5/30/14 poured on 6/13/14. Picked this up for $7.99 at Whole Foods Union Sq.
500ml bottle poured into tulip 13/6/14
"Pours dark amber..almost rusty orange.. Deep foamy white head with prominent lacing. Aroma is deeply citrusy and bitter..bright. Flavor is grapefruit, hops, bitter orange. Bold and intense..oily mouthfeel that's thick and chewy. Overall a full bodied IPA."
"A fairly gentle pour generated a big foamy white cap. Lots of carbonation streaming up. Head lasted a decent amount of time before settling into a quarter inch blanket on top of an awesome copper orange beer. Lots of citrusy hops on the nose not much from the malt bill. Smells awesome. Taste is great. Lots of hops but no overpowering bitterness. This isn't a beer about power as much as it is about balance. I feel like its limited availability gives unrealistic expectations. Taste the beer not the hype, and this "
"Bottle dated 4/29/14 poured on 5/31/14. Pours hazy golden colored with a one finger fluffy white head. Aroma of sweet caramel maltiness, grapefruits, some orange peel. Flavor is a bit brighter. Sweet grapefruit and orange rind, some grassy vegetal hops that I like. Much fresher flavor than aroma. Very light bodied and drinkable with medium carbonation. Very nice. While this is a solid brew I’m not quite on the hype train for this one. With that said, would be happy to have again."
"Poured out with a slight haze into a snifter forming a solid 2 inch head which sunk back in after a minute. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and prominent pineapple. Taste is a solid mix of pineapple and grapefruit with the latter in the finish with a bit of bitterness. This brew tingles the taste buds hitting the front of the tongue and palate most. Overall a very solid IPA which I would highly recommend."
"A: hazy, dark honey; pillowy, 2 finger white head; great lacing;"
Hazy and vibrant orange with a spongy white head. Great retention. 
"Amber in colour, slightly hazy, with a foamy head that recedes to a creamy top."

A -16 oz bottle dated 4-29-14 (11 days old !) to Tulip a somewhat hazy bright golden orange with a huge 3 finger head that took its time to settle down and left some huge lacing 
"Close to the pinnacle of the single ipa. Tons of hop, pine and citrus to go around. Light and crisp, while allowing the flavors and aromas to star. Best of both coasts, west coast hopping, and east coast haze"
"Appearance is a brilliant golden orange that looks absolutely stunning in direct sunlight. Not much head, but looks very silky."
Bottled on date of 4/15/2014
Poured from 16 oz. bottle into pilsner glass
Poured from bottle dated 2/18/14 into a pint glass.
"Nice light orange color. Hop forward with some juiciness. Really clean finish with pleasing aftertaste, if any. Very well made brew."
"Our “East Coast” version of a West Coast-style IPA. LOL, love it! On bottle it says to drink fresh, because hoppy beers don't age well. I will obey this. Thanks to papparoachy for being one of the most generous ba's I have had a pleasure to trade with."
A wonderful pour! 
"Lunch, dinner, supper, brunch, breakfast, midnight snack... You can call this sucker whatever you want and it will still be money. "
"The winner of a 3-way taste test between 2 east coast favorites both new to me (Maine Lunch and Heady Topper), and a Green Flash West Coast I'm very familiar with that I purchased as a ""control."""
"Enjoyed, no - loved, on tap at Plan B in Simsbury CT. This IPA, from the citrusy nose to the delicate lacing left on the goblet, to the outstanding, complex, citrusy, and yet not too bitter flavor, this IPA is absolutely delicious. I will look for it on bottle, because it's just not around enough here on tap."
"I was quite impressed by this beer. The color was a hazy medium orange with a 1 finger white head. There was an excellent hop profile up front with nice notes of orange, lemon zest, and pine. Then it finishes with a nice balance with a little bit of malt that comes across as a light but smooth caramel. This beer is by no means sweet though and definitely focuses on the hops. Appropriate carbonation and great aftertaste. I could drink this all day."
"Got some good news today so I thought I'd treat myself to a special beer. I'd been waiting to try Maine Brewing Co. beers and especially Lunch. Well, I gotta say, it's good, but not quite what I'd expected. It looks fucking gorgeous. When I poured it, I thought, Oh my.... The scent is pleasantly citrusy but mild and the mouthfeel is just a bit thin. Feels more like a Pale Ale - a really good one. Taste is nice - orange and a bit of mango, but I'm not blown away. I'd like a bit more malt. A really solid beer, and probably a great summer beer, but I'd rather drink some more affordable IPAs."
Previous rating of 4.5/5 on 3/24/2014.
Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass. (bottled 2/13/14)
Poured into a dogfish spiegelau glass. 
A- Dark yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves behind a moderate amount of lace.
"The four-inch, frothy white head competes for space within the Dogfish Head fisheye pint glass. The hazed, honey-amber (SRM 8) beer with occasional carbonation eventually dominates as the head slowly, slow as in continental drift, turns rocky as it gives up sticky patches of lace."
Bottle &gt; Pint Glass
"Sometimes it is meet to begin a review by asking a question, and in this case, the question is what am I drinking? On the surface, this is easy to answer: I am drinking LUNCH, a highly regarded IPA by the Maine Beer Company. Let's talk about the taste before anything else: it tastes good. It tastes like beer - like the thing that, when I was 20 in college and still afraid of beer, would have carried the name. Since that time, I have ravaged my tastebuds with punishing inflictions of hops from bottles that carry the ridealong phrase ""Imperial IPA"" on enough occastions that I think I have numbed myself to the possibility of being overhopped. Context. But modulo that concern, this beer does not feel like an IPA to me. It is dry, and crisp, and I taste Belgian-style malt in the mix. The aroma is fruitless. It is a beer made of barley, only, and the hops are in your imagination. WAIT. There they are. They arrive like a waterfall at the end of a long hike through dense Hawaiian forest, and they back up the claim that yes, somewhere in here, is an American IPA. A neat trick."
"Excellent beer, just excellent!"
"Bought most of the beers that Maine Beer Co. was offering this past Fall with plans to do a tasting with six of my BA Buddies. But I wound up drinking them all with a couple of my beer buddies who attended my annual New Year's Party. Tasted Peeper Ale, Another One, Zoe, Mean Ole Tom, King Titus, Lil One, Lunch and Mo. Lunch and Mo were two of the eight Maine Beer Co. beers that I was really looking forward to tasting. Lunch did not dis-appoint me in any way. Outstanding is where I rated it and it was all of that."
Poured into a standard pint glass. Bottled on 28-Jan-2014.
"16.9 oz. bottle* Look: Nice honey golden amber body, 1 finger white soapy head. "
"A big thanks to angrybabboon for managing to get me two bottles of this! Both were dated ""12/3/13."" Consumed about two weeks later. Poured out of a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass."
Ok so wow.
Have had this numerous times (although not as much as I'd like). This is a nice citrus-based IPA from a very good brewer (as the other reviews show).
"I heard the hype and I'm just not that impressed. I drink a lot of IPA's and imperial IPA's both American and English and this over rated ale doesn't do it for me. Mouth feel is too light, where are the malts in this ale. Hoppy, yes but, again doesn't follow all the hype it gets as I don't get any malt sweetness. Don't get me wrong it's very good but, with all the hype, there are a lot of other ales out there that are better."
16.9-oz bottle to tulip. Bottled on 1/28/2014. Consumed 2/16/2014.
A: A bit hazy amber/copper and has a really big strong head that has big bubbles and frothy.
"In my (admittedly somewhat limited) experience thusfar, this has been my favorite IPA I've ever had. Pretty much everything about it was great, and the company is pretty cool as well. Got it on a whim after the clerk at my neighborhood beer store recommended it and now I'm gonna need to try to find more, which is supposedly kind of a hard task in Boston..."
Bottle dated 1/14/14 in glass.

Poured 16.9 oz bottle dated 12/03/13 into a New Belguim globe
500ml bottled on 1/14/2014. Served in a DFH signature glass.
Had this on tap in a pint glass. 
Very grateful to BA SammyJaxxx for sending this as I've been hankerin' to try it for awhile now. Enjoyed out of a 16.9 oz brown bottle with a bottling date of 120313 and specific instructions to drink within 90 days of that date on the label. Poured the nice fresh IPA into the IPA-specific Speiglau glass.
It took me a good while to get a hold of this beer.. I had The MO a few times and I was looking forward to trying this beer.. They are very similar but I think Lunch you can smell the hops a little more.. MO and Lunch are very very similar but this one stood out a little more.. I thought this one would blow my mind considering its ranked way higher then MO but again they are very similar .. But slight edge over MO..
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle....drank in Kennebunkport, ME."
"Purchased this beer at Galeville Byrne Dairy in Liverpool, NY. I am very impressed with the quality of this beer. Outstanding smell of pine and grapefruit. The taste is exactly what i am looking for in an IPA - grapefruit, pine and citrus. This is by far one of the best ipa's i have ever had. If you like ipa's this is a must have."
"A: Golden hue. Perpetually rising effervescence. Pours a giant, frothy, white head. Head craters slowly and unevenly leaving plenty of dry residue behind as it does. Thick, persistent lacing."
This is a re-review of the beer. Bottled 12/3/13 and I'm having it less than 2 weeks from the date. 
Bottle poured into stone pint glass.
A: This poured a hazy dark gold with lots of off white head.
500 ml bottle into tulip. Thank you pjkelley82
"Draught @ Brewery: This one pours a hazy orangish color. There was a finger or so of head on it, and left lots of lacing. The aroma is nice. Lots of different tropical fruits, with some citrus thrown in too. The taste is also quite good. A good hope bite to it, with some citrus notes. Followed by a decent malt body with a touch of the sweetness trying to come through. Another solid beer from them!"
Very nice bitterness. A lot of grapefruit seed flavor.
"very good IPA, but not sure its worth the $$$. It has a citrus bite but not an all out assault and bitterness is on the low side. nice malt balance"
"Yeah, I CAN hear my detractors now - ""Oh, Brother Woody, you seem to be drinking (and reviewing) a lot of bottled beers of late. Have you finally gone off of CANs?"" F**k no, Daddy-O! It is just that bottles keep showing up, unbidden, and while I am not adverse, they do get in the way of the mission. My buddy, Justin, with whom I am visiting State Line Liquors in Elkton, MD tomorrow, was just up in Maine and brought this back for me with the admonition, ""Drink this sooner, rather than later."" What, like Alice in Wonderland? ""Drink Me!"" I know about the results, but I am plunging ahead. I love Maine, having spent the best summer of my life there in 1990 while the infant USS Normandy (CG-60) was in the Portland shipyard."
Bottle dated 10/8/13
"Pours a beautiful orangy color, pretty clear, but with a little haze and a very nice, creamy head. The smell is a citrus hops and while it's not overpowering, it's really nice. The taste is similar, hoppy on the citrus side, very little malt, not really bitter at all, it's very, very good and just what you want in an IPA. Mouthfeel is a touch watery, but still great. All said, this is an excellent IPA and one that I would drink often if it were easier to find and if it were priced reasonably. It's similar to Flower Power and since FP is easy to find and reasonably priced, I'll probably never buy this one again. MBC: You make great beer, but your prices are RIDICULOUS!"
"A: A cloudy orange coming from my bottle, probably settled yeast, left a slight finger of white head at the top that lives a very tiny lacing around the glass."
"I've seen this beer around at a few of the local stores (I'm in Maine) but I always passed it over because of the rather plain and unassuming label. Then I read an article that compared lunch to the big names of Imperial IPAs- Heady Topper and Pliny the (Younger/Older I can't remember which) and lunch compared favorably. I also was told it's nearly impossible to find a bottle as they fly off the shelves. So, I made it my mission to find one. I found not only one, but about 20! So I'm going to keep this store as my little secret stash of IIPA. Anyhow on to the review:"
Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a tulip. This was bottled 10/8/13 which was 13 days ago.
Pours a lovely deep gold with orange hues. Thin white head dissipates slowly. 
"Bottled on 10/8/13 and consumed on 10/17/13, so very fresh. "
Bottled: 10/8
"A- Hazy orange body with a foamy white head. Some light shines through, but there is a definite sediment haze present."
"Served in a crystal snifter. Deep amber color with a hint of red. Thick dimpled foam rises up an inch and a half and lingers long, setling very slowly and leaving chunks of meringue up the sides of the glass. Bright and inviting aroma of ruby red grapefruit, tangerine, and orange rind."
Thanks to Joe for sharing! Quick review from notes. 
500ml Bottle
"A-LIght golden clear beer. Foamy, thick 1 inch head with thick lacing"
"500mL thanks to Travlr. Pours a clear orange amber with a massive, off-white head. Massive retention and giant lacing. Nose is fruity hops with squashy melons. Softer aroma with some subtle complexity like vanilla ice cream, peaches. Yum. Taste is a little sugary and sticky with vanilla, nutty bitterness, sugary strawberry. Gets a little cheesy. Probably not the freshest bottle, but very well made."
Received as an extra from HopSynonymous - Bottled 5/20/14 - Poured into a Stone IPA glass
"Had this at Max's during Hops Fest with a turkey frank and homemade chips and was thoroughly impressed. Crisp, slightly biscuity malt, great hop flavor and a nice hop aroma. I got some citrus and light pine and resins. Well-balanced, not overly bitter. It was a bit of a challenge because I had a half dozen other hoppy beers prior to this one, so the old flavor-taker was being challenged, but I loved every drop. I would have this one again and again."
"Bottled August 13, 2013. Nine days old."
"Poured from bottle to Tree house snifter. 7/30/13 bottle date. Poured with a monster head. Like half the snifter. I don't pour very vigorously, so very surprising. Dissipated fairly quickly though, leaving good lacing. Very bitter earthy smell. Less citrus than I remember from previous batches. Taste is also very bitter. Not a to of citrus. Nice creamy mouthfeel. I feel that MBC beers, and lunch in particular, suffer from batch variation. I've had amazing bottles of lunch, and mediocre bottles. This one fell somewhere in between."

"lunch is one of those beers ive been dying to try for a long time. finally found some, albeit not on tap, at the maine beer company itself, a very cool spot to visit. it was bottled a mere two days before I bought it, so freshness was prime. bottle pours a burnt orange sort of color, maple syrup looking, with half an inch of thick and lasting khaki colored head. the nose is a lot more balanced than expected, with some amber type malts, caramel color and aromatic to the roast, a bit sweet, and definitely robust. the hops are on the tropical end, quite apart from the picture the malt paints. pineapple and passion fruit, less bitterness than flavor. almost English pale ale sort of malt bill, way fuller bodied than I expected this to be. the hops come in about half way through, and crescendo into a really sunny fruity island sort of bouquet. the division here is pronounced. just a tad more body than I need in my ipa, but its sturdiness is appreciated, and id like to best in winter I think. a beer I am super stoked to have gotten to drink, share with my lovely girlfriend at out beautiful maine campsite, and contemplate at length. a great great beer from a fantastic little brewery. worth the hype."
Bottle is 2 months from bottling date.
Bottled 7/2/13
Bottled 7/02/2013. Poured into a glass goblet.
"Bottle, dated 060413 around 2 months old, poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours a hazy copper with three plus fingers of fluffy off white head. Head retention is good, sticking around for several minutes before slowly dissipating with some thick swathes of lacing. Small bubble carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass."
"A: Deep ruby to dark gold, impressive head, significant lacing along the edge, sea foam froth, craggy head – 4.50, S: Nose isn’t overpowering and actually quite meek, some caramel and mild citrus such as grapefruit – 3.50, T: Unquestionably an IPA, not over-the-top, quite herbal some grapefruit, doughy sweetness – 4.25, M: Slight crispness from the effervescence, hint of creaminess – 4.00, D: 7% beer and very drinkable, a little cost prohibitive but worth a premium, very nicely crafted and worth searching out – 4.25"
Bottled 7/31/13
2 week old bottle poured into a monic glass. (Though i've also had it on draught many times).
bottled 07.02.13. poured into a snifter. 
Bottle dated 5/28/13.
Found a bottle of this at Churchkey last weekend. 
Great smell. There was a hint of citrus and it smelled like pine. The taste was great and the taste held on well after the drink. The shops different and neat. It is in barn shaped building that has a window view of the brewing process. I would highly recommend this beer.
"Purchased from the Food Co-Op in Hanover, NH. Housed in a 1 pint .9 oz. bottle with a 07/02/13 bottling date"
"A: Cloudy, sort of light orange. Very carbonated, large head, seems overcarbonated."
"From the 26 fl. oz. bottle stamped: 070213-20. Sampled on July 20, 2013."
16 oz bottle for $5.99 at RSVP in Portland. Born 7/2/13. Poured into a Hill Farmstead tulip.
"Classic IPA look with pale golden body that is a little dense and a giant. foamy head that just left lace patches everywhere as it receeded into the brew. Smell is textbook with strong citric and wet hop aroma along with a caramel and bready malt sweetness. Taste and mouthfeel follow as I get a strong taste of hops, mostly citric with touches of plush tropical fruit and grape (pretty rare for a ""single IPA"") but nothing overpowered the tastebuds and the balance with the grainy, bready, and sweet malts is great. The hops are the star but don't dominate and the beer finishes crisp and dry but doesn't dry out tongue making this a dangerous session beer."
A gentle pour produces a tall foamy cream colored head atop a golden orange body. The foam has remarkable staying power and decorates the glass with billowing clouds of lace.
Bought this from Capone's and saw the much-appreciated bottled by date right away.
"I will admit that some of the fun with LUNCH is how difficult it can be to obtain. It isn't always available at the local liquor store, and you often have to ask for it as they hide it in the back or limit the amount you can buy on any given day. "
16.9 oz. bottle poured into a DFH signature glass. Bottled 7/2/13 (6 days ago) and picked up at the brewery. 
500ml bottle served in a pint glass.
"Poured from a 16 oz bottle into a snifter. Purchased in North Attleboro, MA at Yankee Spirits. Bottled 5/28/13 - about a month old. "
Poured into Nonic pint
"500ml bottle, dated 6/4/2013, enjoyed on 6/29, poured into an MBC Wine Glass."
"Bottled on 6/4, I drank this on 6/28. About as fresh as I would expect to have one. These are bottle conditioned, so I assume I picked this up pretty much as soon as it arrived at my local beer shop. (along with a bottle of MaineBeer's Mo, also bottled on 6/4)"
"Lunch pours a very clear deep gold with a beautiful head that really lingers. Fruity orange citrus and pine in the aroma with a bit of sweetness. The orange gives way to grapefruit which leads nicely into the flavor. The grapefruity hops come on strong in the flavor with just a bit of sweetness. The malt is dominated by a strong, but not overpowering bitterness. Overall this is a really nice IPA especially for a couple months old. I imagine it's hard to beat right off the bottling line."
On tap at Max's (from notes)
"Beer is a very hazy orange/peach color. Pures a huge white head that becomes extremely rocky as it recedes, has very good retention, and leaves tons of lacing.Has a juicy orange and lemon smell with a bit of grapefruit. Has a bit of bready malt aroma as well."
Sampled from a 500ml bottle dated 6/4/13. Thanks surge1311!
poured from the bottle into a Stone VE stem glass.. 
Poured from a 500ml bottle into a Jester King stemmed glass. This one has been sought out for at least two years. Glad to finally get my hands on it.
Bottle poured into a pint glass.
"Finally managed to find a bottle of this in Bangor, 'bought time!"
Pours a hazy orange to copper body with straw like hues beneath the cram colored head which is ne of the more resistant I've seen as it hangs around for the duration of the beer. 
"a hazy copper pour with 3 fingers of creamy white head which left behind great amounts of lacing. smells citrusy with lots of sweet caramel notes, grapefruitpine, slight mint/lemon hoppy character, a nice complex bready profile. getting a nice herbal hop notes up front in the taste, that minty quality is right there too. lots of bittering but subtle enough to enjoy. sweet malt profile accents the citrusy notes of the hops as well. really tasty, but i think the bitterness is a little bit overwhelming. modest amount of carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel (medium in body)."
"500 ml bottle dated 052123, so she's a month old. Happy birthday you silly little thing! Courtesy of Jeff...thank you for the opportunity!"
Revisited this recently. I used to think this beer was over hyped and a bit boring. I've come to appreciate the absolute perfect balance in this beer. Not one element over shadows another. Really good flavor that might seem muted but works harmoniously with everything else.
"Golden-amber in color with a slight haziness. Gorgeous, fluffy head that lasts for ages. Very nice lace formation. Exceedingly fresh-smelling, both pungent and floral. The scales are tipped toward more of an ""old school"" C-hop grapefruit and pine character, but there are noticeable undertones of ""new school"" tropical fruit notes. Checking the hop bill, Simcoe is in there, which explains the mango and passion fruit that I'm getting."
"Bottled on 04 June 2013, poured into an Allagash chalice."
"16.9oz bottle, dated 05.28.2013 (so, this bottle was consumed within the 90 day time window that it recommends on the label) poured into a FFF teku glass in the late afternoon of 6.20.2013. Thanks to Daniel for providing me with this beer!"
Wow...
Glass: Odell's Rastal Tulip.
"Drink within 90 days of May 23, 2013. Served in Spiegelau IPA glass. Pours a hazy amber with a white, creamy two-finger head that settles into a nice frothy cap. Nice lacing and legs. Rich smell of grapefruit rind and pine. Citrus pith strikes the palate first and finishes with a heaping dose of pine. Sweet malt backbone balances the bitterness nicely. Medium body with lively carbonation. A superbly crafted IPA that gives the west coast IPAs a run for their money!"
"16.9 oz bottle, bottled 5/28/2013, poured into a snifter"
"Found this guy as a very welcomed extra in a trade. Based on the stamp this guy is now 40 days old, which is certainly not my ideal but I think there's still a lot to be had here. "
"Pours bright like orange sunshine. Cloudy with an ample head that fell off amiably and slow. Good thick cap that never left, cascades of lace and great legs too. Nose is captivating and crisp with ripe fruits. Orange citrus, tangerine, tropical pineapple and a little lemon. With some light pine it smells juicy and dry at the same time. Floral. Malt is grainy and deeply sweet underneath and brings an icy quality that delights with a touch of sugar. Taste is positively vivid. Tropical fruits are ripe and juicy, a little tangy. The malt comes over the mid palate to delight with more bread than you were expecting. Hops are earthy and smooth. They announce themselves with a plucky bitter that takes you to a clean, dry finish. The aftertaste glows as much as the presentation. There's some alcohol warmth for comfort after all that excitement. "
"Hyped up, looks nice, smells nice tastes excellent. Surrounded by Excellent beers here in the northeast it isn't the best beer I have had but it certainly is extremely good, better than most no doubt.The hype is legit and the price is right. Would drink several times over."
"Bottled 5/28/13, drank 6/15/13."
2 weeks old purchased in Maine. Pours a deep golden color with creamy foam that lingers and sticks to the sides of the glass.
Got this as an add in from a trade .
"Pours a cloudy amber in color with a nice big white head and some excellent lacing. The smell is fantastic very floral with some sweet citrus notes. The flavor is good but dose not quite live up to the nose. The whole profile is rather bitter with some grapefruit bite and a tad of a bitter plastic taste I cant put my finger on. The mouthfeel is good for an average strength IPA and it is a very drinkable brew. Over all this is a good beer but I expected a bit more out of they ""hype"" Being a local IPA thats not to expensive I will surely give it another go in the future especially seeing as it got better as it warmed. Bottled 5/28 so its very fresh."
Seems appropriate that I have Lunch for lunch. Bottled 5/21/13.
Born on 5/28/13. Consumed on 6/11/13. Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.
"Bottled on 5/28/13, first time trying this bad boy and I'm glad it is extremely fresh."
Bottle dated 5/21/13. Poured into a duvel tulip. 
"Bottled on May 28, 2013. (2 weeks old) Poured into a fluted beer glass."
"Semi-cloudy faded orange color big billowing bright white head. Intensely hoppy nose, lots of citrus and orange, faintly floral, so bright smelling, almost getting a bit of tropical melon in there too. Underneath I get some soapy and alcohol esters."
16.9 ounce bottle poured into a New Belgium snifter. Bottle dated 5-28-13. 
"An enormous thank you goes out to my shop's regulars, Mike, for the hookup on this brew! Totally caught me by surprise. Bottle dated 5/28/13, my birthday! Pouring into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass. "
"16.9 oz. bottle purchased in the greater Washington D.C. area, date 5/28/13 (~2 weeks old on consumption), poured into my FFF Teku tasting glass , drank on 6/9/13 over an hour."
Poured a three finger head with a golden honey color in a pint glass.
The beer pours a hazy dark golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome! It has a killer hop nose that boasts of citrus hops; probably citra or simcoe. The malts lend an adequate base and complimentary aroma. The taste is good. It has incredible balance for a beer with so much hop character. It's tasty as hell with loads of residual citrus hop flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an incredible beer. It's loaded with flavor and a ton of hop character.
"Bottled 05/21/2013 and served in a tulip nonic. Pours a dull burnt orange with a slight haze and a rocky, three inch, cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with delicate strands of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Nose expresses notes of tropical fruit, a hint of rind and a light graininess. Taste consistent with nose, but a bit more muted. There's also a slight medicinal bitterness that lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation, and a slight acidity. Finish leaves a light, residual prickle between quaffs. Overall - no where near worth the $7.49 price tag. A decent IPA, but not all that mind-blowing an experience. I'm quite surprised at all the hype this beer gets."
A - A burnt orange with a two finger head that dissipates but leaves more lacing then other IPAs. 
"16.9 oz bottle purchased from Nathaniel Square Corner Store in Rochester, NY. Other bottles have been purchased at the Bushnell Basin Hess as well."
16.9 oz bottle. Dated 5/28/13. Poured into a pint glass.
"A - Beautiful golden orange pour, slightly hazy with adequate carbonation. Poured an enormous head in a tall ale glass (4+ fingers!), which was pure white and left lovely, thick lacing on the glass for the entirety of my experience. Very impressive."
Born on date of 5/21/13; enjoyed 6/7/13.
"500mL bottle with 052113 printed on the side. Pours a murky dark orange color with over an inch of thick, frothy head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is a big whiff of tropical fruits and citrus hops. Pineapple, mango, orange and others. Nice bitter flavor of the citrus and tropical fruits along with pine. Some sweet malt flavor but this one is all about the hops. Citrus and tropical at the finish with some slight floral notes. Creamy mouthfeel. Glad Maine Beer Co finally made it to Ct. Overall, really good IPA but with so many other comparable choices out there the price will keep me from buying it all the time. Still great and worth seeking out."
500ml bottle into a New Belgium goblet.
Pours a bright orange/yellow with a slight greenish hue and a big white head that hangs around till the end and leaves lots of lace. 
"Pours golden yellow with a very impressive head and lace. The smell gets you right away with nice hop, citrus and sweet nose. Honestly, you'd think this was a top double IPA from the look and smell. The taste is the best IPA I've had. Typically im not all that impressed with IPAs since double are so much more loaded and well balanced, but this is close to a double in a standard IPA skin. Well balanced is the definition of this beer. The hops, citrus and sweetness blend so nice with a smooth aftertaste. Maine Brewing Company continues to impress me more and more and they appear to be the big up and comer. As far as this IPA, its the best on the market."

Maine Beer Company - Lunch
500ml bottle poured into a Sam Adams 'perfect pint' glass.
Finally got my hands on this one!!! Been a long time coming! Bottled on 5/7/13 (050713). 
A: Pours out a very hazy amber color. Three plus fingers of off white head. Retention lasted quite a while. Lacing created a picturesque netting around the glass. 
"Bottled on 5/21/13; poured into a Bell's nonic pint. I didn't seek this beer, it sought me and demanded that I consume it. Pouring itself into the aforementioned vessel, it jumped out of its holding container to exclaim, ""I am IPA; marvel at me."" A huge, two-finger cap of foam gives way to myriad lace patterns resembling broken guitar strings, frayed curtains, and shower-glass film residue. The nose is permeated by a citric cornucopia that is backed by just enough malt to create a majestic balance of hop perfection. To characterize the taste would never do this beer any justice, as words pale in comparison to the sheer pleasure that follows the first sip. As I consumed more, I began to sense a tectonic shift within the craft beer industry. This isn't just Maine Beer's version of a West Coast style IPA; this is their version of a better one. You know the brewer has struck a chord when you can hear the cherub and the seraphim rejoicing holy, holy, holy while you're drinking it. Maybe none of it was real. Maybe I woke up one morning and imagined what the perfect IPA would taste like. All I know is that this version of IPA is without rival. Rumors have already surfaced that it can re-grow hair on bald men, and resurrect lifeless medical patients from their catatonic state. You know what, I believe them. If you're fortunate enough to get your hands on this brew, consider yourself among the chosen. Ladies and Gentlemen, Lunch is served."
"Poured from a bottle with a date of 05/09/13 so fairly fresh (2 weeks old) wonderful yellow-orange color with a huge fluffy white head. A light piney, citrusy smell that I cant get enough of. Not overpowering but just enough. Goes down easy would definitely buy this again but too bad it's eight bucks for a 500ml bottle. I want more."
500ml bottle served in a glass beer mug.
500ml bottle with a plain Jane egg shell white label. Everything on the label is in small print. Break out the magnifying glass. The back of the label only contains the mandatory US info and a description about the brewery. Off to the left side of the bottle is an inked bottled date. My bottle was bottled on 03/26/13. MBC would like it if you drink their beer within 90 days of the bottles date. My bottle was close to being 2 months old when I cracked it open. Still good! 
"I'm always perusing the Maine Beer Co section in my local shops in search of the legendary LUNCH, and a stop in to get some jumbo shrimp for the grill was my lucky day. Bottled 5/7/13, this batch is nice and fresh and doesn't have time to age on the shelf as they disappear quickly in multiples."
"54 day old bottle, poured into my Founders snifter."
13 day old bottle into a FFF Teku-
Bottled 9/9/12... a little old.
"Purchased for $5.95 at Domaney's in Great Barrington, MA. Bottled on 3/26/13. Nice labeling with a simple approach. It says to drink within 90 days of the bottling date. This beer is a touch under a month and a half old."
On-tap at a local restaurant on 05/07/13
"Very enjoyable IPA, lives up to their description as a great version of a West Coast IPA. My overall rating would have been higher if not for the hefty price tag, there's quite a few beers just as good or better even, that cost half of what this one does."
Bottled 032613. Tulip glass.

"Look: hazy, yellow/orange lots of lacing"
Grabbed a bottle that was just over a week old. One of my favorite IPAs out there.
From a bottle into a Bellhaven pint.
"We pour a brew of golden amber coloring. It holds a two finger head of tannish foam. This retains nicely, leaving massive bubbles in its wake, and thick patterned lacing down the sides of the glasses. There is a cidery haze throughout, with no real sediment noted. Carbonation bubbles at a medium. The aroma is all about the hops. These are beautifully sweet and nectary, but have a definite background of soap, pine, and biting citric bitterness. The malts are pale, but meet the hops in sweetness, with lightly cooked caramel sugars. Otherwise, the aromatic density is filled by metallics, like yeastiness, musk, sweaty saltiness, floral earthiness, and strawberry freshness. Our first impression is that the flavoring is not as sweet as expected, as it comes with a bittering earthiness on the back that screams “West Coast”. As we sip, puckering grapefruit hoppiness, green plant freshness, muddy pale malts, raw brown sugar sweetness, and fresh herbal qualities mix to start us off. The peak comes with brassy metallics, robust soap, bittered pine sap, and simple yeastiness. The finish washes with herbal mint leafiness, spicy alcohol, floral and herbal bitterness, soaps, pine, light lemon juiciness and pale malt freshness. The aftertaste breathes of big soapy bitterness, citric juiciness, wet chalkiness, yeast, light chemical phenols, peppery booze, and grassy bitterness. The body is medium, and the carbonation is high and hiccup-inducing. There is nice slurp, sip, cream, froth, pop, and glug to each sip, with a freshly cleansing coating to the mouth. This cools, but eventually dries the palate with a soft pucker. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks easily."
"Maine Beer Company's Lunch is by far the finest IPA I've ever enjoyed. In reality, its comparables aren't IPAs but DIPAs like Heady Topper and Stone's Enjoy By series. Lunch manages a similar level of hop flavor and malt backbone with only 7% ABV. This blows the competition out of the water. The only drawbacks are that Lunch isn't sold in 6-packs and isn't always available, making it more like specialty DIPAs than other IPAs. Regardless, if you see a bottle for sale in your local craft beer shop: buy it!"
Appearance:
"Pours out a copper color with white head, small bubbles, 1"" head approximately, good retention, decent lacing. Aroma was amarilloish and cascade, good and juicy, yet restrained and not super powerful. "
Quick points since this has been reviewed by wiser and more articulate beer connoisseurs:
"S: Very bright citrus with some pine, crisp smelling."
"This beer pours a hazy red orange, with a thick, luscious slightly off white head that remains throughout the drink, leaving lots of beautiful lacing on the sides of the glass."
I poured it out into a proper glass. 
Needed a break from all the holiday brews and stouts that I've been enjoying... Hoping this one does the trick...
"Lunch pours a hazy golden orange with a creamy and billowing white head that lasts throughout the entirety of the beer. The aroma will hit you right away. It’s like squeezing a fresh grapefruit. You get more of that grapefruit in your first sip as well as other tropical fruits and an herbal hoppiness. Then you think, “OK IPA, time to overpower me with hops, so much so that I have to rinse my mouth when I’m done .” But it never happens. The grainy malts come in to help tame the bitterness, and the hops don’t even come close to taking over this beer. Instead, they provide an integrating piney/citrusy freshness. The toasted malts are amazing, adding great balance and a smooth finish."
Bottle dated 11/18/12 poured into a DFH Signature Glass
received this bottle in a trade just the other day. been excited to crack it open and enjoy it. dating on it (i think) says 10-24-12. I really like the label on it as well as the simplicity is appreciated. here goes nothing.
"Lots of delicious juicy orange citrus flavour, from Warrior, Centennial, Simcoe and Amarillo. Orange coloured body, with some retained head. Orange aroma. Similar to a DIPA without any palate erasure. Masterful IPA. . Very good hop aroma. Had again a half year later, also a month after brewing, from Capone's Superior, smooth mouthfeel IPA."
"A: Murky golden orange with a good-sized white head and very strong, sticky lacing."
"Poured from 16.9 oz grey-brown bottle into a Duvel tulip. Bottled on 111812 stamped on side of label. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $6.99."

Picked up at RSVP in Portland on sale for $5 and some change for a 16.9 oz bottle. Per the label this was bottled two days ago :)
thanks to trevdawg
Appearance - Golden orange with a very slight haze. Carbonation bubbles are visibly raising from the bottom of the glass. An 1.5 inch off-white head sits atop and slowly dissipates while leaving spider web lacing all the way around the glass.
Poured from a bottle dated 10/14/12.
"An awesome extra from an awesome BA. Thanks! It may not be lunch time, but I poured this beautiful IPA into a Duvel tulip. Dated 081012. Larger than 2 finger off-white/yellow/straw colored head that sticks around for a while. As it falls it leaves minimal lace. Aroma is of simple sweet citra hops. Floral and lemony. Flavor is a bit more harsh and bitter. Still very floral with a little bit of pez sweetness. Body is great, full body and good carbonation."
"500ml bottle into a snifter. Bottled date of 10/14/12 puts this at the freshest Maine Beer Co offering I have had at only about a month old. The brew appears a hazed golden copper color with nearly 4 fingers of mostly white, somewhat yellowish stained head. As the cap slowly fades, it leaves patchy to webby lacework on the glass. A swirl effortlessly revives a finger back on top."
Bottle date of 3/26/13 which means that this beer is a hint over 1 month old. Poured this into a pint glass.
"A: Poured a hazed deep yellowish orange color with good carbonation and head retention leaving a small white cap, nice bubbles and moderate lacing"

"Was able to share a bottle of this with a friend that I bought from Tru Beer, a bottle shop in Northampton, MA. Nice find there! Pours a slightly hazy orange copper color with a two inch off-white head that laces well throughout and settles into a nice creamy-looking top. The aromas are rich tropical fruit, citrus, sawdust and a bit of malty sweetness. On the palate, it is full of flavor - pine sap, cedar, earthy spice and a nice counterbalance of ripe fruit; pineapple, grapefruit, and a bit of mango. The finish is long and woodsy with a good bitterness bite. A bit overrated as I’ve had better IPAs, but this was a solid beer nonetheless."
"The beer pours a gorgeous golden brown and murky, with a huge fat cream head with big patches of sticky lacing on the sides. The color is really gorgeous and I am loving the two finger width head that lasted for quite some time. The smell is beyond heaven with its fruity punch. Mango, papaya, and a wonderful pop of pine are the dominant smells here, but the malts are also there with a very slight biscuit. There’s even a slight bite of alcohol in the back of the smell, along with a classic bitter bite. On the taste there is a lighter bite of fruit. Mango and papaya are still dominant, but there is also the classic tinge of grapefruit in the taste. Malt is light and biscuity, but definitely a side show to the delicious hops of this beer. Mouthfeel is also to die for with velvety smoothness. Carbonation is effervescent in the start, but mellows out instantly into a sweet caress on the tongue. The mouth is left with some nice saliva along the sides of mouth and great dry bitter streak on the top and bottom of the mouth. The afterfeel is a little too dry for my taste, but still pleasant. Overall this is an awesome IPA with terrific fruitiness and a dry streak. This is a must drink, and is up there with the best IPA’s of the East Coast. This one doesn’t top Heady Topper, obviously, but it is quite tasty and a tremendous example of the style. Drink this beer."
"I wanted to revisit this beer. The first time I had it, I was just getting into IPAs, and it blew me away. "
"This poured out as a golden color. The head was white and had a good retention and a nice sticky lacing. The smell of the beer has a piney resin like aroma and a subtle malt sweetness in there. That taste of the beer has a good spicy flavor from the hops. It's got a decent balance of flavor blended with the malts and bitterness. The mouthfeel of the beer is tingly and remains smooth at the same time with a subtle booze kick. Overall this is a good beer, one of the best from this company this far."

1pt .9oz bottle poured into a New Belgium globe. Stamped freshness date of 8/10/12 means this beer is 27 days old at the time of consumption.
"An aggressive but not overpowering bitter note, and I’m pleased that it doesn’t have too much of that unctuous maltiness that comes with some super-hoppy beers. The primary association it evokes for me is haying season. Freshly mown grass still green, and the clumps of compressed sod in the back of the tractor bed, strong and complex with a ganja-tinge and just the faintest hint of fermented sweetness."
"Review #400 and finally got my hands on some Lunch! Bottled 08/10/12 (or 08/18/12...I can't tell. Either way, it's not as fresh as I'd hoped, judging by fresher dates on beers such as MO...but hey, can't complain!)"

Bottled 6/25/12
"Bottled two weeks ago. Beautiful deep brown with orange-copper shades and a creamy thick white foam. Almost a 5. Aroma: All citrus, from tangerine to pinneaples with very light pine and malt. Taste is juicy hops, very fruity. The bitterness lingers in the aftertaste and remains for a long time. Ample and smooth mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Being very fresh, hops take all the place. Maybe a little simple but so damn good. It’s up there with Edward. Above my expectations since I didn’t enjoy Peeper and Zoe that much."
A- Pours a dark orange color with a bit of haze. A nice foamy cream colored head. Head has pretty solid retention and leaves some spotty lacing. A bit of sediment floating around too.

"Gotta thank my dad for sending me 4 of these bad boys. Apparently he can buy cases of it through a hook-up in Bar Harbor, ME. Jealous. Anyways, accidentally forgot about this one and thus, this review is based on accidental aging of about 3 months. I'll try to remember what it was like fresh, and compare."
Way better on draft. Hops pop way more. Bottles are not worth the price.

"500ml bottle, bottled 3/22/12, enjoyed in a Pilsner glass at McKay's in Bar Harbor during my 5th anniversary dinner. While not as fresh as I'd like it to be, I just couldn't turn down the opportunity to try such a well-regarded beer on such a special occasion."
Brewed two weeks before consumed for this review.
"Big thanks goes out to ferillo for sending this one my way as a part of a very recent trade! Served from bottle into Mikkeller Teku. Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that remained throughout the glass. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, floral, and floral hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, earth, spice, earth hop, floral, floral hop, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really happy to get the chance to finally try this one and for good reason. Upon pouring it into the glass I put my nose right up to it. I was surprised at how nice this brew smelled on first inspection. Really well balanced and all the right notes in all the right places going on here. The flavor was pretty nice too, but just wasn’t as balanced as the aroma unfortunately. The earthy note felt a little invasive to me, but it didn’t hurt the brew at all. Definitely worth your time to try or seek out if you have never had it and call yourself a hop-head."
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, orange-gold coloring with a thick, light, frothy head almost an inch high. Great head retention, too. Clings all over the glass as you drink. Aromas are citrus-hop blend that smells amazing, with lime, orange, and grapefruit blending with the pine, fresh cut grass, and resin to entice you right into the glass. Flavors are rich and resiny. Hop forward with a follow up blast of tart grapefruit keep your taste buds standiing at attention. There is a subtle caramel backbone that supports all the other profiles, which is exactly what it should be doing. Peppery and roast qualities at the end of the palate transition into the aftertaste, where a resiny and bitter kick displays the hops presence once again in this gem. The finish is clean, smooth, and only slightly drying. Amazing. Utterly amazing brew!"
"Thanks Eric for hooking me up with a bottle of this. Poured from a 500ml bottle into my Southern Tier tulip. It poured a somewhat hazy, dull, amber orange color with a modest white head covering the top."

Reviewing Lunch from from Maine Beer Company
Bomber poured into a pint glass. Can't remember bottled date but about a month old. 
"Lunch has a light enough complexion to assume that malts should not be an issue where this hop-bomb is concerned. Its golden colour is clean but doesn't allow a whole lot of transparency, although its bubbles appear as if under a spotlight. No matter how low the beer gets, its head stays thick and perfectly level. The lacing sticks too. "

Pours a light brown unfiltered as always from Maine. with a big off white head. Good lacing.
"A - Nice hazy dark orange. Pours with a really fluffy 1-2 finger head. Leaves a good amount of lacing and the head won't dissipate fully. It really sticks around, which I always love in a beer."
Bottle pour sampled at mrbubbler's tasting.
"It poured a dirty amber color. Not the most appealing visual effect. But the aroma was very nice, hops came through clear but not overly crazy."
A- pours a murky burnt orange amber color. Two fingers of off white with amazing retention. Sticky lacing coats the glass as you sip.

Fresh bottle poured into my Portsmouth tulip...
Bottled 3/20/2012.
"Was given the 411 on this from my good friend at Colonial Wine & Spirits in Acton, MA. What I loved about this IPA is that versus all the other limited disty IPA's I've tasted, this one took the earthy/hoppy route versus the citrus finish that most others gravitate to. Very smooth at the same time which is rare to have that much hops without the LaGunitas-esque bite. Bravo Lunch!...Please brew more."

Taste like the nose would have you expect, with some grapefruit in the finish. Body is perfect not big or small, plenty of life, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is one of the best I have had, wish it was easier to find and more affordable."

"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Much thanks to ToasterChef! Bottled Jan 24th 2011, ooo she's a freshy!"
"Lazy hazy amber ale. A great big, super tall off white head is produced on the pour. this fluffy billowing head leaves lacing aplenty. Hop aroma is excellent with a bouquet of herbal and floral and a touch of pine. Not picking up much in malts, but in fragrant beers like this do you really care. First sip bodes quite bitter and dry with a floral taste essence. Not as pungent as the nose leads us to believe. Caramel malts are found towards the end with a low level of diaceytl, thats not an issue here since it is quite low. This beer finishes smooth and with a semi-dry after taste. Pleasing to look at, smell and drink although the flavor is a bit muted still excellent none the less. I'm jumping on the MBC bandwagon right now."

"date on bottle: 1/24/2012, very fresh"
"fresh shipment of lunch picked up today, poured into a duvel snifter"
"1/24/12 bottle. Pours copper orange with a fluffy head. Nose is an array of bright hops, tropical fruit. Floral. Focus is more on fruit flesh than on pine and grapefruit rind. Pretty dry in the mouth throughout, bitter and long, some grassy floral qualities. Very nicely balanced but not much expression in the mouth between hop and malt. Light biscuit toward the back palate, a nice crisp delivery there. Nice stuff, not something I'm going to go nuts over."

This beer pours a dark amber with an off white head. 
"Looks good dark amber nice head that sticks around. Scent is very pleasant. Hoppy and bready nose. Great flavor. Not as hoppy as the nose describes. Nice and full, malty backbone. Malts and hops are matched very wells. Although an amazing beer, I had my hopes up for one of the most amazing IPAs considering how fast it flies off the shelf, and it's good, but I would drink some easier to find and cheeper beers before I scoured the state for this. If Pliny does taste like this then I will not fly to Cali to get it. That being said I will buy it to support small, environmentally conscience, breweries. And it is really good beer."

"This has a lemony, actually almost on the verge of lime to be honest, taste. This has a tart hoppy taste. Kind of floral. To be honest, I like the Zoe a bit more...it actually had a better pale ale taste to it, in my opinion. That's not to say this is a poor beer--it's quite delicious. I was just expecting something different perhaps."

"Pours a nice amber gold color with some haze, nice densely packed meringue like head with great retention and lacing. Scent is big on pine resin and juicy citrus, lightly sweetened malt backbone. Taste is quite bitter without leaning heavily towards piney or fruity, very fresh with a splash of herbal notes, malt backbone is light but sweet. Medium bodied, splash high in carbonation, dry finnish. Just a good IPA thats hard to describe because it follows all the rules but exceeded others in quality."
Big thanks to mountsnow1010. Cheers!
Poured from a bottle into my La Fin du Monde tulip.
"Lunch, well its after lunch but thats ok. Murky amber orange, not quite opaque but not transparent. A rather hard pour produces some head. Not the very prettiest beer but what a smell. Huge citrus and pine, so fresh. Can't get over how fresh, piney and citrusy this smells. Big hop flavor up front, resinous, pithy pine, some grapefruit like citrus. Bitter mid-palate through the finish. Obviously malt plays second fiddel here, but its just enough to balance the extreme hops. Kinda dryish finish, not cloying from over hoppiness. Just a hugely successful beer by Maine Brewing."

"Many thanks to Mdaschaf for the chance to taste this one. Excellent extra in our recent trade. Poured from bottle into Brooklyn tulip. Pours a unique cloudy yellow-orange color, with crazy head that fills the top of the glass and takes forever to recede. Smell- tropical citrus, sweet honey hops, sweet orange flavors that remind me of dreamcicle popsicle. So excited to try this. Taste- this one is all about the tropical flavors and the citrus. I get some really nice orange flavors, a little bitterness on the end. This bottle isn't ultra fresh but I love it. Can only imagine what it would be like with fresh pungent hops. Overall, love this beer."

What an awesome beer. I went to a package store that was advertising that they got a shipment of this beer in. When I got there it was not on the shelves and I was bummed out. But a store employee gave me a bottle out of a stash. Man it was well worth the hour plus drive I made to get it. What a crisp and clean tasting IPA. Well done.

500 mL bottle poured into a British pint glass.
Grabbed a bottle of this when I was up in Boston. Actually had to go to a few stores before I found it. Review from notes.
"Pours a hazy red/copper with a very impressive, thick, fluffy marshmallow white head. The head does not mess around and isn't going anywhere, despite your best attempt at a careful pour. Aroma of sweet mango, grapefruit and touches of pine and lemon. Flavor beings with a burst of crisp, zesty, citrus hops. Very nice, bready, cracker sweetness that comes around and mixes well with the grapefruit and minor tropical notes that stand out. Ends with dry, semi-bitter pine hops, a touch of spice and a bit more citrus sweetness. Really crisp and compact flavor profile, but allows you to sense the different layers in the beer. Cohesion is off the charts. Certainly will be a star in the New England IPA scene."
"Poured into a Portsmouth Belgian Tulip. Bottle indicates the batch date was July 21, 2011."
"A: Enjoyed this in a Sam Adam's perfect pint glass. Very large head that retains much better than I was expecting followed by a nice lacing. Hazy orange color to it. Labelling is plainer that I was expecting, but classy nonetheless."

Highly recommend tracking this one down."
"Thanks to Chris for this bottle... murky light peach, a really wonderful light tope head, great retention and cap, decent lacing... smells outstanding, very tropical, pineapples with some grass hops, wonderful balance... the taste is really good as well, something living up to the buzz, grapefruit with a wonderful bitterness to it, pine with a touch alcohol, so much flavor, this is outstanding"
A big bubbly head stands on top of an extremely carbonated copper/orange body. These bubbles will not settle down. About two fingers of head. Nose is sweet bread and tropical fruits but with some pine as well. Light and balanced but the aromas still stand out. The flavor is completely different than I expected from the nose. Malts are sweet and roasted fruity like an imperial but on the light side. Hops are a mix of pineapple and spicy herbal. It finishes fruity and dry. The dryness is a mix of piney fruit and malt tartness. Creamy and fruity body with a bitter but thirst quenching finish. A large amount of head stuck around until I was finished.

"This is one good yet overpriced ipa. the beer pours a darker yellow to almost light orange color with a decent white head. the smell is huge grapefruit and pine notes, with almost no malt character whatsoever. the flavor is citrusy and piney at the same time, very bitter very dry and very delicious. the mouthfeel is thin and well carbed. overall one of the top 3 ipas ive had"

"Review #1500. It's only fitting it's a bottle from a friend. Thank you, John. "
500ml bottle poured into SN tulip pint glass. Thanks to SneezyAchew for a couple bottles of this.
"A: Top notch. Huge fluffy white head atop a golden amber pour. A little hazy, not perfectly clear. Amazing retention and great lacing. "
"The first one of the night I wanted some lighter fare to get things going in the right direction and this one definitely did the job for me for sure. Pours out a nice medium amber color with a light head of white that caps the top rather nicely and leaves a smooth and even layer of lacing. Aroma is nice piney hops that mix in and mingle with a smooth and delicate orange note and a touch of a light malty base. Very clean and crisp flavor, light body is more then adequately carbonated and left no doubt in my mind as to how good this one could be. Nice biting hops up front are quickly subdued by a light buttery taste and an earthy, piney freshness that cuts right through. Smooth as silk and overall just a very solid and drinkable IPA."
"Hazy amber color with a big white head the retains very well. Smell is of pine and grapefruit. Taste has a combo of tropical fruit and pine and some malty sweetness coming through about midway. Nice mouthfeel, about medium carbonation and body. This was a pretty tasty beer."
Huge head that settles so slowly that a dome lasts throughout the tasting and it leaves lots of fluffy lace on the glass. The liquid is cloudy but an attractive dirty gold color.
"A - Pours a dark amber orange, with about 3 fingers of white, pinkish head. The head lasts a while, before slowly dying away. There's substantial lacing along the edge of the glass."
Lot #05.18.11
"A- Light amber body with a huge, creamy white head. Retention is pretty much too good, I am waiting to drink it. Nice thick lace webs down the glass."
Big thanks to jmu500 for this one! 
Looks really good. Full thick creamy head. Big ol bubbles. Caramel coloring. 
I was surprised to find a bottle of this at Spirit Haus in Amherst! 
"Appearance: Slightly hazed amber leading with some gold edges. Head is bright-white, fluffy, and sticky as can be. Great lacing and the head retention is impressive. "
"Another blind review via the blind bif, thanks to Brez07."
16 ounce bottle
Pours a beautiful amber color with a thick head into my glass. The head is probably the best part of the appearance.
"Bottle says ""lot 051811"" which I'll assume is a bottled on date. "
"500ml bottle into a wine glass. Bottled 5/18/11, drank 6/3/11."
"Lunch IPA pours a hazy amber (yellow/orange) with a big, frothy white head on top. The foam dissolves very slowly and a thick sheet remains until the bottom of the glass. Lots of clumps and netted patterns of lace. From the bottom of the glass a flurry of tiny bubbles rise quickly to the surface."
Pours pale orange with a big foamy white head and a bunch of lace.
Date on bottle 05/18/11. Poured into the large allagash chalice.
"Bottle invites consumers to ""just keep swimming."" This is also a common ultrarunning mantra."
"Bottled 5/18/11, poured into a nonic, thanks Conor!"

Re-reviewed:
Picked this bottle up at the Warren Store last weekend. Shout out to my favorite glassware hound for getting a beer named after him. Glad Dr. Abmuh already got you one. Served in a Bruery tulip because I don't have any glassware from Maine. For shame.
Thanks to Stevenstofen for this awesome beer!
Appearance: golden amber hue
A - pours a hazy amber with a healthy 2 finger head that fades into seriouslyncling lace.
Fairly bright medium amber color with a good head that lingers as a light cover and leaves medium lacing on the glass.
Bottled 11 days ago on 5/18/11
16.9 oz brown glass pry-top bottle bought at Beverage Warehouse.
"Suprised to see this one on a stop to a beer store in Maine. Didn't even know Maine Beer released an IPA! Pleasant surprise. Zoe and Peeper are great. Excited to try this one. PT bottle, 05/18/11..."
"What Flower Power does for floral characteristics in an IPA, Lunch does for grass. This beer is one of the best examples of late/dry hopping I've ever tasted."
"a pretty standard, yet glowing amber/copper with a nicely sized off-white head that recedes rather quickly but leaves beautiful lacing on the glass."
500ml bottle split with imagineiii poured into a Duvel tulip.
Poured into a pint glass a foggy yellow honey color - tons of sticky white head leaves when it's damn well ready (which is well after lunch.)
Drank from a 1 pint .9 fl. oz. bottle
"Third Beer by Maine Beer Co. for me, have loved them all so far."
"So far have loved everything from Maine beer. Lets pop this open. Golden/orangy pour with a sizable white head that settles down. First whiff, we have a winner! Is this another tropical IPA? I'm getting the grapefruit and piney hops in the nose, it is very aromatic, similar to Flower Power. Mild bitterness starts the tasting experience, nice bready malt in the background blends with tasty hops. Considering all of the strong flavors, this is light on the tongue and very drinkable with a quick dry finish. This is among the best IPA's that I have ever had. I'm not getting the real tropical flavor that the nose exudes, but it is damn near perfect. Maine Beer Company is 4:4 with me! Fantastic"
16.9oz bottle (dated 5/18/11 - 6 days ago) poured into a Duvel Tulip
16.9 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. 
"Picked this up at RSVP the other day. Given all the reviews and chatter about it on BA, I just had to try a super fresh bottle (so I'm drinking it now in my hotel). Lunch pours an apricot orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. This beer has the look of a serious IPA. In case there's any doubt however, just take one whiff, and you're transported to IPA heaven. Yummy!!! I get a huge aroma of peach, orange citrus, apricot and pine. Incredibly, this beer does not smell at all sweet/malty or boozy, and I just can't wait to take my first sip. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this well crafted IPA, and I'm impressed by the amount of hoppy bitterness I get in the finish. There's actually quite a bit of tropical fruit in this beer, but there's more than enough hoppy bitterness to counter the sweetness, leading to a long, dry, hoppy finish. There's also a slight dank flavor aspect as well to this beer, which only enhances the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a long, dry, bitter finish. It's a bit light at the end, but that's splitting hairs.... this is just delicious. I get a slight sense of the 7% alcohol in this beer, but otherwise the alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile. "
500 ml bottle poured into Liefmans Goudenband Cervoise.
"Thanks, drazzamatazz. 500ml into newport storm snifter. Bottled 4 days ago- hope it's fresh."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice hazy melon color, with an off white head. There is a lot of sticky lace left by an inch and a half head."
"500ml bottle poured into a Bruery tulip. How great is it to walk into your favorite beer store, find a new IPA from a brewery you already like, look at the bottle and see it was packaged 2 days ago!!! 5/18/11"
"500 mL bottle poured into a large tulip. Bottled 5/18/11. Purchased at Carl's in Kittery, Maine for $6."
"Unlike some other reviewers, I was unable to try this beer at Sebago's ""End of an Era"" party...but the time I went to try it, the keg was empty. Luckily, bottles were released the next day. My bottle has been in the fridge all afternoon. It was filled two days ago, on 5.18.11. I'm pouring it into my Maine Beer Company glass."
"Bottled on 5/18/2011, so only 2 days old. I'm extremely excited to try this new beer from Maine Beer Co. to say the least"
Presentation: 500 mL bottle poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. Picked this up at Carl's in Kittery and was told that they just got it in today and it was bottled only a couple days previous. 
Poured into a pint glass. This one pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with about an inch and a half of fluffy white head. Really nice retention on this with good lookin' soapy lace. 
"It's kind of like Christmas when Maine Beer Co puts out a new beer - you don't quite know what's coming, but you know it will be good."
Great IPA the appearance and smell are really nice a frothy head with a great smell of nice piney citrusy hops. 
16oz bottle poured into a Maine Beer Company glass
Had at the Sebago end of an era special event. Shared it with my wife and bumped elbows with pretty much every major player in the Maine beer scene.
"The appearance was a burnt golden color with a one finger white foamy head that held up for great retention and dissipated at a nice pace into a concave sort of glazing all around. The smell had some sweet danky onion, tropical fruity bliss and as it warmed bitter piney/resinous aromas wrapping together. The taste had the bitterness of the pine coinciding with the tropical fruity hops. Bitter juicy to semi-sprucy aftertaste runs into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a good sipping to almost sneaky sessionable feel to it. Carbonation feels good for an AIPA allowing enough bitterness all around. Overall, I’d say this was an exceptional AIPA that I would love to have again."
"Green foiled top bottle (date not found on bottle) poured into large IPA glass. Looks is a hazy copper color with a nice white head that remains, lacing rings the glass when consumed. The smell is lightly fruited with pine notes and subtle caramel malt. The taste is way more malty than the smell, slight oniony notes come through mid palate. The feel through me off, especially for Lawson's! Definitely phenolic harsh bitterness that lingers around and a lighter feel overall. Overall I am disappointed, but hey as a Homebrewer for 9 years I know that some batches are better than others. Cheers."
"It's kind of weird having this next to Sips. To me there was nothing that tropical about this. Floral, piney aroma into a pretty bitter taste. Smooth and well executed, but more on the malty bitter side. More of the solid ipa of yesteryear, meaning this would have played ball in 2012, but now is outclassed by many other tasty ipas"
"This is clearly a beer that did not forget about caramel malt. From the dark orange appearance, through the sweet aroma, to the chewy, smooth body."
"On draft, about a 12oz. snifter at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT."
"World class IPA. Complex hop flavor, easy to drink with a crisp citrus finish."
"Great golden color. The Citra hops are the prominent note here, I think. Splendid."
On draught at Prohibition Pig. From notes. 
"Wow. Underrated to say the least. With all the hype that Double Sunshine and Hopzilla get this takes a back seat, and undeservedly so. "
From 01/18/14 notes. Huge thanks to BeerLayer85 for sharing a bottle of this from this recent VT trip; thanks Ross! 22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.
Lawson's Triple play IPA
"22oz bottle poured into Lawson's tulip. Bottle purchased at the Montpelier Farmer's market on 12/21, exactly two weeks ago."
"Another delicious offering from Lawson's Finest Liquids. Pours with a single finger of quickly dissipating head. Smells delicious, very piney and resinous. Taste follows the nose, with a pretty strong bitter finish. "
"Poured from a bomber with no #freshbeer date but i'm not worried, this is fresh!"
"Had on tap at Worthy Burger in South Royalton, VT"
"On tap at the Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT. 10oz pour into a Prohibition Pig snifter glass yesterday, 10/23/2013."
Enjoyed this beer in a large hand blown Simon Pearce tulip glass.
"Lawson's Finest Liquids - Triple Play IPA, poured into a DFH Spiegelau IPA glass."
Poured into a Lawson's Finest Liquids Tulip.
"Triple Play pours more of an amber coppery orange color- which is mildly distinct when compared to Sean's other IPA's. I like the look, but I personally prefer the golden honey orange of his Double Sunshine or Kiwi Double (nothing to take away from triple play at all). Fantastic smell with big juicy citrus at the forefront- mostly dominated by grapefruit and that's about it as I pick up on little to no malty sweetness or piney smells. Taste is very much in order with the smell, a clean citrussy grapefruit and orange at first from the CItra slowly fading to a slightly bitter resinous pine from the Centennial. The thing that I love about this IPA is the malt is all but removed from the taste leaving the hops to explode on your pallet. The brew sits with more of a mild bitter piney taste and I am experiencing little to no alcohol in the aftertaste. With such a minimal malt presence one could think this would be an overly bitter brew, but this isn't the case at all. The taste is what really what makes this beer for me and the hop profile is amazing. I give a perfect 5 for taste as Sean was able to pack SO much flavor into an IPA- I mean I have had at least 20 DIPA's that don't even come close to this hop flavor profile. If this had been a DIPA I may have scored it a 4.75, but as of now I am saying best hop flavor for a single IPA going!"
"Pours clear gold with a fine, creamy foam head. Pine and lightly toasted bready malts on the nose. Light to medium sweet flavor, some toasty grass, bread, mellow orange, citrus peel. Medium bodied with fine, massaging carbonation throughout. Lightly resinous finish, some toasty grass, pine, dry toasty pale malts, orange, hints of grapefruit. Overall, a decent IPA with some let down probably due to the fact I was spoiled by the Chinooker’d and Double Sunshine (which I tried last year and my favorite IPA from the brewery)."
"It's a cloudy glass of beer. Dark orange in the shadows and glowy yellow-orange in direct light. Medium head, off-white. A blanket of little bubbles. Good lacing and retention. The aroma is a very bright blend of citrus and tropical fruit. It smells like a smoothie made of oranges, tangerines, pineapples, mangoes and papayas. Rich and fruity and citrus sweet. Very little malt character. Just a pungent load of hops. My only knock is that the aroma could be a bit stronger. This bottle is pretty fresh, but I wouldn't be shocked if a pour off a newly filled keg would raise my score. The taste has wonderful hop flavor, particularly for a 7% abv beer. It's just packed with complexity and delicacy. The bitterness is fairly mild. It's just got a ton of flavor. It has that same mix of citrus and tropical fruit. Very bright and sweet, though there's little malt sugariness. It's just all fresh, tasty hops. What malt can be found is light and a bit cracker-ish. Long finish full of grapefruit-ish hop bitterness. Pretty dry. Mouthfeel is medium. Really fills the mouth with flavor. Nice dry finish. Good platform for the hop flavors. This is an excellent IPA, on par with the best of the style. I've been very impressed with all of the Lawson's beers that I've tried, and I'm thrilled to be able to sit down and have a bottle of Triple Play to myself. Great stuff."
"It is difficult for me to understand how beer enthusiasts outside of Vermont are getting their hands on Lawson's Finest Liquids, but more power to you if you can make that happen. I live an hour from where they make this stuff and it has become extremely difficult to purchase multiple bombers depending on their production."
Poured from the bottle into a goblet.
"A - Pours a medium to dark orange color with a dense, creamy layer of white foam that hangs out on the top and doesn't go away, a very thick lacing ring as well and very sticky on the sides of the glass."
"Pours a murky yellow with brown tint, big off white head, looks a lot like Double Sunshine."
A: Pours a hazy golden color with god carbonation but yielding a small whispy white cap that seems to fade away quickly leavng some bubbles and a white collar.
A-light golden amber color with a nice white head and decent lacing
"22oz. bottle procured at the Montpelier Farmer's Market on 3/2/2012. Served in a tulip nonic. Pours a pale, straw gold hue with a translucent clarity and a loose, quarter inch bright white head that eventually settles into a soapy slick - no lacing on this one. Nose on this beer is fantastic - tropical fruits are revealed upfront, followed by faint aromas of cat pee and evening out with an herbal/earthy finish. Taste follows nose; however, the tropical fruit is a bit more intense and has an almost candied quality, while the Simcoe character blends in with the earthy herbal qualities culminating in a light, lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive, slightly prickly carbonation and light oiliness to the texture. What can I say, this is a fantastic IPA with so much tropical goodness - I wish I picked up a second bottle, but at least I got to enjoy several offerings on-draft as well. I'd love to see more IPAs with this complexity and flavor profile."
"A- Hazy, golden-orange with a one finger white head that fades quickly, but leaves behind nice lacing"

Bottle To Dogfish Head IPA glass
22 oz gold foil topped bottle purchased at Warren Store two days ago. Served in a Lawson's snifter.
Lawson Triple Play IPA pours a hazy light orange with small creamy head. The foam is slow to dissolve leaving behind spots and lines of lace.
Thanks to drewone for sharing this one at his tasting.
"Got this from Dr. Hennig, thanks so much. Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a slightly hazy orange, with a one inch stick white head that leaves beautiful lace. Smell is a tropical citrus mango, pineapple, tangerine, papaya, and grapefruit. Taste is just amazing, very well balanced, with grapefruit dominating the finish in a wonderful way. Body is medium, plenty of life, with a dry finish, and so easy drinking. This is possibly the best IPA that has ever touched these lips, Vermont knows Citra hops like nobody. Wow it is so special. My first IPA or DIPA perfect score."
"This bottle was shared by muskabeatz, thanks Evan!"
22 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. This bottle was an extra thrown in from a recent trade with cbeer88. Thanks a ton Carl!
22oz bottle into a tulip
Thanks to Joeybones for this beer in a recent trade.
"Cloudy yellow with a tinge of orange, and a significant foamy head. Hoppy aroma. The taste is a bit vegetable. A good malty backbone and good drinkability and fits well into the style of IPA rather than DIPA.Above average mouthfeel.John’s bottle.Very nice but a little disappointed."
"22 oz. bottle with a gold foil-wrapped neck, sent by Rifugium last week (fresh from his recent trip to VT). Split to two pint glasses with my wife before dinner tonight."
Fresh bottle courtesy of sprague11. Thanks! 
"22oz bottle. No date on the bottle, but this was picked up on Friday 5/4/12. Poured this into my Deschutes tulip."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice medium amber. Head poured a very thin off white that mostly disappeared in 5 minutes leaving just a few tracings. Aroma was a mix of bitter piney hoppy, with some citrus mixed in the back end. Taste was almost entirely hops. Not to over powering, but long lasting. Left a definite taste in the mouth for a long period of time. Felt ok in the mouth. A bit of coating, with a fair amount of tingling on the tongue, despite no obvious carbonation. Overall a good beer. Not overly pushed to the limit, and balanced enough to enjoy over time."

"Thanks to chippo33 for this one, in a weird but successful trade."
"22oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Thanks a ton, Michael. "
"Poured into a tulip glass a dull copper color with a large blooming white that left a few broken rings of lace as it settled slowly.Big citric hops really jump out ya in the nose,pithy grapefruit and lemon notes over top of sweet alcohol and caramel.Fresh sharp grapefruit hops on the palate with underlying resiny notes,just great hop complexity mixed with some sweet induced alcohol.Wow there is a real citric punch to this beer,almost DIPAish except not overly sweet,a great beer."
"Lawson's Triple Play, courtesy of the sweetest bartender in the world (love you!). Served in my Lost Abbey snifter. "
"slightly amberish copper with a touch of a hop haze and a pure white head that sticks to the glass very well, though it recedes rather quickly."
"22oz bomber, thanks Keith!"
"First had: on tap at Reservoir, Waterbury, VT"
Hard to believe that I've never reviewed this.
"Received in a trade, poured into a Duvel tulip."
Thanks to phingding for the bottle!
Scored this at the Warren Store and popped it for a nightcap at our room at the Crystal Palace B&B back in Bristol...
"pour is a dark hazed orange and scummy white ring. The nose is of grapefruit, pine and resinous hop. There is some pale and caramel malt up front to balance. The taste is banned and well integrated with an assertive hop presence dominating the back. Resiny, caramel malts, solid foundation, hops take over, lightly piney, fair bit of grapefruit and tropical fruit. Very nice fruity finish with a gentle bitterness ending abruptly. The body is easy to drink, well carbonated, faintly grainy towards the back."
Picked this up on my Vermont road trip last week!
22oz bottle thanks to caguiar.
Thanks for this bottle go to Bill. Thank you very much for the opportunity! 22 oz silver foil capped bottle with no discernible freshness dating. Label reads 7% as opposed to the 6% listed here.
A big thank you to the Baron (readbaron) for sharing this rarity.
"Bought this bottle at the Winooski Beverage Warehouse in Vermont, came recommended from one of the guys who works there. Having tried a few other of the Lawson varieties I was eager to try the 2011 National IPA Champion, I wasn't disappointed."
had this at the vermont brewers fest last month. 
Thanks to shadesofgray for the share.
Bomber from Baconsausage... Thanks tucker!
"Thanks to Ryan for this at DLD... dark clear gold with hints of orange, a nice white head... the aroma is lots of oily pine, pretty bitter... taste is more of the same lots of bitter pine... I prefer the double sun shine but this is still pretty good"
"Bottle sampled at DLD '11 (thanks to whoever brought it!), poured into a wine glass."
22 oz gold foil topped bomber into a tulip glass. Rare Batch #202/Bottle #1. 
Thanks to ShadesofGray for opening this bottle at DLD 2011. Served in a SAVOR snifter.
"I've had this twice in the past week, most recently at Kan's place. Not sure who contributed this - Kan or Drew I think. Served in a HopCat tulip. Batch #202, Bottle #84."
"Bottle graciously shared by shadesofgray at DLD 2011 (thanks Ryan!). Very glad for the opportunity to try another Lawson's beer, to say the least. "
Bottle shared by Mr. ShadesOfGrey at that hootenanny known as Dark Lord Day.
Thanks to Wally for the bottle!
"Poured into a pint glass, revealing two and a half fingers of crisp, foamy white head with nice staying power over a hazy ruddy golden body. Some lacing. Smells sweet, lemony and with an awesome floral citrus hop presence."
"Won in a ""beer bracket"" contest for March Madness. Batch 202, bottle #20."
22oz bomber poured int a Duvel tulip.
Had to try this award-winning IPA. Went down to American Flatbread Burlington Hearth and had 2 x 12oz pours.
"Thanks to baconsausage for this, amongst a nest of other goodies, as I continue to wade into Lawson's head-first. Batch #187, bottle #17, looks like it's signed by the brewer. "
10 oz pour at taproom. Good stuff! Blend of hops packed more of a punch than single-hop Half-Light Sunbeam. Upside: lots of flavor. Downside: bitter.
"Poured from a growler purchased 2 hrs ago, into the test glass."
"Draught @ The Foundry: This one pours a murky golden color. There was a small white head that left some lacing. Good nose. Mainly tropical hops. Some citrus too. The taste was very good. Not too much bitterness, but lots of jucy hops. Tropical and citrus flavors. Nice!"
"Had this on tap at the Foundry. The beer had a cloudy, dark orange appearance with a medium thick head that lasted awhile. Aromas were sharp with very vocal orangepeel mixed with various citrus smells and piney hops, Taste followed the nose with a very citrus-y, tangy, and juicy drink that did not overpower the flavor senses. Very easy to drink with my meal at the bar. Mouthfeel was interestingly silky in texture with a light, refreshing body. Overall, I greatly enjoyed this beer; appearance, aromas, and flavors were awesome."
West coast meets East coast... Awesome beer!!!!
"Drank on tap at Lord Hobo, Cambridge, MA"
"Walked right up to the bar and bought 2 growlers yesterday afternoon (there were only 3 other people there drinking flights). This might be my new favorite IPA. They take the popular East coast juice bomb style with the fruit forward smell and taste, but then add just the right amount of subtle balancing piney bitterness on the back end that many of the other big name Massachusetts IPAs lack in my opinion. A really excellent beer. I'm hesitant to write this review, because I have a feeling the days of having only 3 people there on a Saturday afternoon will be short lived, but these guys deserve credit for what they're doing."
The first thing that strikes you is the absolutely beautiful color on this beer. A sip provides a nice taste of juice without destroying the pallet and is incredibly reminiscent of Julius in this way. Incredibly well done. I almost don't want to share this review so that it can remain the hidden gem that it is.
"From a 1L growler, filled at the brewery about 24 hours ago. Served in a cool imperial pint/nonic."
"Not super bitter,not sweet..Just right. This is not Your brothers obnoxious juice bomb. This is juice heaven. Orange,grapefruit dominate with a bit of a spicy (Columbus?) finish. A very great representation of the East coast IPA."
"Absolutely incredible. This actually tastes juicy. Opens up with a burst of orange juice; then sweet, tropical fruit. Pineapple. Followed by dank citrus rind, that finishes sticky with just enough lingering citrus rind and bitterness to let you enjoy it before quickly going back for another sip. Incredible. May be my favorite IPA ever."
Pours a hazy golden straw color with a 1-finger white head. The head dissipates into a nice crown. Leaves some cobweb lacing.
"This beer is incredible. It's everything I love about IPA's and is a perfect example of the ""New England"" style IPA. I would drink this beer instead of orange juice in the morning if I could."
"enjoyed on tap at Armsby Abby,"
"First off, the owners are really great and personable, but more importantly, they seem to really enjoy what they are doing. In the handful of times I've had growlers filled with this IPA there have been others present claiming that this beer ""as good as anything from Treehouse or Hill Framstead"" (which it is) and I am not 100% sure brewers (in general) like being compared to others- although this site is the exact forum to do such a thing.......go figure. At any rate, people, tell them how good the beer is based on what you're consuming at that moment. Sorry, Ill step off. "
Growler pour kegged today.
One of the best from this Brewery!
"Heist kills it once again. Ive had this beer the last four times they canned it. Never disappoints,murky orange color. Tastes like OJ but 10x better! I live in East Charlotte and there are plenty of breweries trying to do this hazy ipa thing. Heist is on point 100%"
"Can dated 8/7/18! Drank this one exactly one month later! Looks like murky hop juice. Smells and tastes like just what they were going for berry dank juice! The feel is soft and velvety. Overall delicious, I want another!!"
From the can: 
"Pours an opaque pale orangish-yellow with a finger and a half of stark white foam on top. Head retention is good with a few dense strands of lacing left behind. Aroma is mango, papaya, tangerine, orange, and light biscuit malts. Aroma is huge and flavorful with a splendid collection of tropical fruit and citrus aromas. Flavor profile is mango, papaya, melon, pineapple, tangerine, and clementine. It has a light backbone of biscuit malts. Mouth feel is a little chalky and grainy with a fine fizziness. It has a medium thickness. Overall, a delightfully aromatic and flavorful IPA. Not much perceivable bitterness, just dense notes of sugary citrus. "
"Pour is hazy yellow. Tall, fluffy, Whitehead the Fades slowly to a rocky head with good lacing."
Appearance - Pours cloudy light yellow with a big fluffy white head nice amount of lacing.
A: Pours a cloudy deep golden honey in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation along the edges of the glass and faint amber + apricot highlights. The beer has a three finger tall dense foamy off-white head that slowly reduces to a large patch of thick film covering the entire surface of the beer with a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.
"L: Hazy butterscotch, caramel, and pumpkin hues with a thick white head and incredible lacing"
Excellent beer. Hop flavor comes through more and more as it warms
"Appearance: Pours cloudy and honey colored with a meringue of a head; tight bubbles, good retention and a coating of lace"
"Another good can offering from Heist. Pours a hazy straw color, aroma is a bit more muted. Good smooth juicy flavor (lots of passionfruit) with a little bitterness on the back (from the Azacca?). Enjoyed it more as I drank it."
Heist has thrown down the gauntlet with their New England style IPAs and this beer does not disappoint. Blurred is the Word reminds me a lot of Alter Ego from Tree House. Orange Juice for days! Heist is making the best IPAs in North Carolina right now and can't wait to see them can their offerings more regularly.
"Couldn't look better, couldn't smell better are certainly couldn't taste better. Heist keeps pumping these beers out like this and they'll crush it for long time to come. Look forward to more from this brewery."
"This is another amazing cloudy offering that kills. Looks like straight OJ, smells like OJ, tastes like OJ, and is lighter on the hop bite than Citraquench'l. Would highly recommend seeking out."
"Another great beer from Heist!! The color on this one is a very deep, sunshine bright, yellorange hue . The smell is very peach/mango hop forward and reminds me of walking through the citrus section af the farmers market. The taste is a lot like all of the recent Heist IPA's, very low on the bitterness and so, so, juicy. Overall, this is one of the best ipa's i've ever had. Blurred is right up there with Citraquench'l, which completely blew my mind. Heist continues to amaze me with this style of beer!! Pure Awesomeness!!"
"Pours a hazy golden color. Has an amazing burst of citrus hop aroma. Has the same amazing juicy taste you would expect from the smell. Perfect feel. Overall an exceptional beer, I would buy it again without hesitation."
"Poured on tap at the brewery. Hazy, murky orange/gold color. Smell is all hops. Flavor follows...mosaic hops. Citrus and tropical fruits. Not overly carbonated. Another winner for Heist. Keep it up."
L: Pours like a light cloudy orange juice color.. very similar to trillium melcher st
Well for those convinced the turbid IPA is good only from NE--news for you
"Has to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me. I was quite excited, as I love the style, the ratings are high and this is the first time I saw this sold in Toronto."
I like I like
"At $2.64 per 12 oz bottle I had expected a very good product and it was very good; however, was it exceptional for the value? It certainly was flavorful; however, it was not hoppy like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which I do like. (Not associated.) It had very good taste, a very good feel and smell but that extra hoppiness that one expects with a craft brewed IPA just was not there. It was certainly worth buying to try and I may even buy some more in the future but I think I'll have to wait for it to be on sale."
"Used to be good. Sold out. Cranking them out ad nauseum. Now just a shelf turd, 15 months after bottle date."
A 12 ounce can poured into a IPA glass.
Just amazing beer
"I'm very picky when it comes to IPAs – it's all too easy to make a hoppy mess! – but Sculpin is one of the most consistently satisfying I've had the pleasure of drinking. When I'm not in a mood to experiment, it's my go-to IPA."
"This is an excellent IPA! First had it with Julia in California, maybe Carlsbad, at a bar that had just okay food but it had this beer on tap, and I remembered it. Able to get it in bottles at Elkton, hooray!"
"L - hazy, opaque golden with a medium off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves behind a good amount of lacing. "
"It pours a bit hazy golden color with a small head. The smell is of citrus but not very much almost no smell at all. The taste is tropical fruit, grapefruit and maybe mango. Overall a nice IPA just not great."
"From an IPA ""hater""......this is good! Great even! I got the Aloha ""tropical"" version of this yesterday and it was too bitter/hoppy for me. THIS is what I was hoping for yesterday: peach, pear and grapefruit taste in that order. Make sure to get thos on the bottom of your tounge--that's my favorite part of this taste. Brings out the pear more, somewhat similar to a Belgian beer. Ya, looks nice in a glass too. Bitterness is balanced against the fruit perfectly for my taste. San Diego makin me proud again with this one."
"I was looking forward to trying this one based on the many positive reviews, but it's just not for me. I prefer a standard, straightforward hoppy IPA (floral notes are a bonus), and this one registered as just another juice bomb. Try it for yourself."
Nice clean IPA. Great full body with fruity and strong hops flavor that's perfectly balanced; it had better be at $14:99 a six pack.
"No no and NO! I made an account because this beer should not be the second best American IPA. It is a solid beer, but the grapefruit is WAY too robust for this to be just an IPA. If this were a fruited beer section (no idea if they exist on here yet), then this beer would definitely compete for the top spot. There are dozens of incredible IPAs that I'd put above this."
There have been many IPAs brewed by almost every home brewer and craft companies offering those brews for sale and this one is among a very few at the top of the list.
"Clean and clear, darker amber."
Seems to molt smell than hop. But strong bitterness and weaker sweetness. Mid body.
"I tried this highly rated IPA based upon the high number of reviews. This was my first and last brew from Ballast Point. If I wanted grapefruit in my drink, I would make a paloma from one of my fine tequilas. I am delving into craft beers very late in my life and this beer only backs up my theory that craft beers are for hipsters who have yet to graduate from snowball syrup to fine distilled spirits. I did find one great craft beer with Founders Centennial IPA and it's bye-bye Heineken for me."
"Poured from a can into a pilsner glass, golden orange in color with a one-finger head with excellent lacing. The aroma is an intoxicating blend grapefruit with a little bit of Orange. The Taste is a full-bodied beer with grapefruit being the predominant flavor, with hints of Orange and maybe other Citrus in there as well. I am not a huge grapefruit fan so that is the only reason I did not give this a 4.5 on the taste. Very well put together beer that stays with you sits well on the tongue. Another highly-rated beer by the BA community that definitely delivered on the promise."
IPAs WITH ANY HINT OF CITRIS FRUIT... NOT SO MUCH....
"Great nose. Tasting notes that make me think of citrus rind, some hints of pine and mango or pineapple maybe? Just the right amount of bitter and sweet."
"Good IPA although a bit overrated. A touch of citrus, mostly grapefruit and slightly sweet with a mild bitter finish. I'd buy it again and for those who never tried it, give this one a twirl."
"Not sure what all the fuss is about, it seemed kind of weak to me, almost like a session IPA. Orange amber body with decent rocky head. Normal IPA/hop aromas, taste also, and somewhat subdued, less hoppy than a NW IPA. Good, but not great."
On tap at the Bier Markt - Square One. Served cold into a pint glass. Review from notes.
"once a good IPA, this was the gold standard. But has failed to hold up since being taken over. This is a last resort along with Goose Island for a complex IPA....."
"My first love when it comes to IPAs. If I owned a bar I would have this on tap. I avoid it now because it’s overpriced and I’ve moved on, but I must admit, this is a truly great beer."
Well balanced IPA with notes of light citrus but not overly butter. Apricot comes through in finish.
"Tasted from a 12 oz bottle bought in Oxnard, CA."
"this is my favorite IPA so far it smells like hops are right in your face, super clear and taste is fantastic."
"What happened to this beer? Over the past few months, I've had several Sculpins that were less than 6 weeks in the bottle, and they all lacked the intensity and punch that I associate with Sculpin back in the day. I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist or some old fart who drones on about how ""they don't make 'em like they used to"", but unless my tastes have changed dramatically in the past couple of years, someone has watered down the recipe for this beer. It's not terrible by any stretch. It's just ... underwhelming."
"2/17/18: 16 oz draft pour into Flamingo plastic cup in their poker room. Mild carbonation, blond pour, minimal white lacing. Pine citrus aroma, taste consistent with aroma, heavy bitterness, very pleasant. Nice firm mouth feel, medium body, fizzy carbonation holds. Overall very good IPA."
"Poured from a can into a glass at the Amtrak Legacy Club in the Chicago Union Station (by the way--- getting priority boarding, a nice place to hang out, wifi, free snacks, soft drinks, and a happy hour with decent craft beers and ok wines is pretty awesome)"
"Something seems different with this stuff these days. Can't put my finger on it, but I can't even finish a 12 pack anymore."
Pours a carbonated lacey amber. Aroma is floral with citrus. To the tongue it’s not terribly bitter but not overly light. Good mix of hops. Light leftovers in the mouth with not much of an aftertaste.
"Very pleasantly surprised by this IPA - lives up to its reputation. Smooth orange-yellow color, moderate head, crisp citrus notes with grapefruit and orange. Finishes mildly bitter but much less harsh than the usual IPA offerings. Crisp mouthfeel with decent carbonation throughout."
Canned on 14 March 2018
I will say for a ipa this is quii
"The first thing that popped in my mind -- this tastes almost exactly like Fresh Squeezed IPA from Deschutes! This has a lighter body with less of a grapefruit taste and a little less bitterness. It's so tasty I can't stop drinking it. There is a very distinct fruity flavor to this and then a very distinct bitterness to it at the end. I'm not a fan of bitterness in general, but this is a level of bitterness that I can handle. The only thing I like better about Fresh Squeezed IPA is it's body -- otherwise I'd say this is the champ between the two -- especially if you're looking for something that's on the lighter side, crisp, refreshing, and that has a lot of flavor."
"This beer has a great, cloudy amber color and smells like the various fruits that add to the flavor. The hops provide the perfect tradidtional bite of an IPA. The difference comes from how refreshing this beer is. Unlike an average IPA, which is hard to put down more than two or three, I could drink this beer every hour for a week straight. I may just have."
Sculpin is a smooth IPA but I feel is maybe just better than an average ipa.
Sculpin gets lots of praise for being the best thing around. I disagree. Its very good but there are lots of other beers out there that are better
It’s whatever
Bright shimmering gold color with good white cap and lasting lacing.
"Color is nice but has a flat, one dimensional taste (on tap anyway)"
I like IPA to be more floral and a little bit sweeter. This beer is good but it tastes just like you're eating a grapefruit.
personally my favorite ipa. by far one of the greatest beers ever made
Are you sure that this is not called the grapefruit sculpin and not the regular sculpin because this freaking beer tastes like it's loaded with grapefruits. Where is the malts to match the intense bitter hops. Anybody that thinks ballast point sculpin makes for a smooth and pleasant drinking IPA is dumber than a box of rocks. Cheers! C-
"Over a solid IPA. Not too bitter, sweet, or overpowering. Very smooth while drinking, ABV kicks in after swallowing. Very easy drinking beer, especially for 7%. Personally, I like the grapefruit version better."
"Got it in a can, poured into a tulip glass. From the moment you open it, it smells great. Pours a handsome shade of lightly hazy yellow which a finger or so of foam. Hoppy without being overwhelming, the finish has a very citric character. Feels fresh and slick in the mouth without feeling watery. Perfect for the summer."
"12oz can purchased at Moonshine Liquors in Hyannis. Gold color and somewhat floral nose. Flavors include apricot, peach and possibly mango. Finish has a hint of lemon/grapefruit. Easy drinking. Not nearly as hoppy as some of New England IPA's. Wifey liked it for that reason."
"12 oz can. Canning date is hard to figure out. Pours a light gold. Smell is floral, hoppy, piney, grapefruit, pineapple. Taste is on the sweet side but has a nice semi bitter finish. I'm picking up citrus, tropical fruit, hops, some slight piney notes, and sweet malts. Mouthfeel is light/medium with good carb. Finishes a little dry. This is one of the best IPA's I've had. I'd buy more often, but Ballast Points beers here in NY are very pricey. Paid $14.99 for the six pack."
One of my favorite ipa’s. Very well balanced and floral tasting. I would definitely recommend this beer and try it again if I find myself on the west coast again
IBU 70
"Fairly easy to find, even on the other side of the country. This has an excellent balance of flavors. Not too citrusy, and not too bitter. One of my favorite IPAs."
"Poured fridge temp into a pint glass. Amber gold, medium carbonation, 3-finger head that held on for a bit, some lacing. Piney/fruity aroma with a similar taste, I get a definite pine taste with a smooth bitterness, if that’s possible. Good mouth feel. A favorite."
"For those who prefer little bitterness in their IPA, this is it. Gave it a 5 in taste because of the balance of flavors. Delicate and simply tasty beer. Big success at Xmas dinner last night. A big plus is its price to value-quality. Amazing that Ballast Point can brew this and sell at a reasonable price."
5 month old bottle...got to try fresh...good anyway
A classic IPA in my opinion. And due to its mainstream appeal you can find it almost everywhere.
"Bottled 10/9/17, Poured 12/11/17. Taste was much more muted than I was expecting with all of the hype and price surrounding this beer. It is a solid IPA and I do find it better than a few other big time selling West Coast IPAs, but there are far better options these days in the ABV range and still way cheaper in price. I'll stick with Alpine Duet and Knee Deep Breaking Bud."
"Last beer of the night, Sculpin IPA from Ballast Point, ABV 7.00%. The can says ""dedicated to the craft"", which is why they sold out to constellation. Well seriously it is still a very good IPA, I just wish everybody wouldn't be selling out."
wasn't grate. had it with grouper.
One of my favorite IPAs!!!
"This one started it all for me, when it comes to IPA's. Flavorful and refreshing."
"Well, not sure if my rating is due to an old can (dates on the can are not obvious) or this is one to have on tap, but I cannot justify a higher rating. Poured into a pint glass. Disappointing head, decent lacing. A subdued citrus smell. Pleasant bitterness. Will need to try again, but this is an honest rating for what is in my glass."
"Another son-in-law favorite. Have to admit, never tried it at the $14.99 six pack price, that's a price above my wallet. Having said that this is a terrific beer! Special occasions only."
I am not a huge IPA guy but I found this to be pretty good. A bit piney and not so bitter you can't stand it.
L: Clear burnt orange color. Good sized head.
one of the best on tap; bottled or canned still pretty tasty
This beer is fucking great
"Very clear gold color with a 2"" head when poured from 12 oz can into 16 oz. glass. Very good balance of malt and hops lending to an exceptional smell and taste that stays with you. Can't always get here but sometimes when you ask nice it happens. I am going to be real nice to my retailer so I can get more of this . Cheers!"
"A dishonest brew...it lies to you! The look and the smell are promising of an IPA that will be on the citrus side of things. Then, the pine cone explosion begins with the first sip. Nowhere near as good as the Grapefruit Sculpin."
Poured into a chilled pint glass from a bottle
Everything from ballast point is great
A little bitter.
Meh.
"If I'm reading the date on the can correctly this should be a very fresh one but the aroma and taste do not suggest that this is the case. So either this is a fresh can that has been exposed to extreme conditions or the labeling format is misleading and ambiguous. This beer looks nice with a clear amber appearance and with a nice two finger head that does not last for long however. The nose is fairly malty, with some piney hops to provide some balance. The taste is also malty, with some bitterness late on. Some caramel and toasty notes but as far as hops are concerned it's just bitterness they contribute."
"Nice orange tinged see through beer with lots of carbonation bubbles and an off white head. Classic IPA sweet citrus and pine scent with a slight malt back. A bit less fruity than your 2017 IPA, this one has a good mix of hops and malt. The feel of this beer is pretty darn good. Smooth and creamy with lingering piney bitterness on the tongue."
"Very good smell, like grapefruit and orange peel, tastes just like grapefruit, pretty bitter, if I had to drink an IPA would defeat merely drink this but not really into iPas so probably won't drink it again."
"My favorite widely available beer. Just great taste, body and drinkability."
"Very good for what it is. I'm not into IPAs that much, nor fruit beer, but this was decent. "
One of the best IPAs I've ever had
This IPA has a nice citrusy note to it with a slight caramel bite at the finish. This is a great summer evening IPA and pairs well with all bbq-type food.
"Perfect balance of citrus and hop taste. Apricot, and orange notes in the palate along with robust IPA hoppy depth."
"Poured into a chalice: color is straw gold, a slight dense quality, not hazy just not clear - pretty spot on for an ipa. Head is brighter off white with fine to medium sized bubbles, head presents 1/2 inch thick and lingers very well. "
"My personal gold standard of a finely balanced IPA, as long as its on tap. Great aroma noting grapefruit and some lemon oil. the citrus flavor stays on point throughout and finishes very well. Makes me miss the days of sitting at the pub in Hawaii and enjoying a couple pints."
"Updated review - I must have gotten a bad/old batch initially. My local grocery store got in some fresh cans - wow. probably close to perfect ! Well balanced, well crafted IPA - probably the best ""grocery store"" (or any store) IPA out there!"
"Ballast Point Brewing (San Diego, CA) Sculpin IPA"
Twelve ounce bottle poured into a gravity pint glass. Beer and glass same temperature. Little quirk of mine. Really nice gold color with one finger head that dissipates into a lasting rim. Good sticky lacing. Floral herbal hops on the nose with good malt in the background. Pine with some faint citrus. Taste follows the nose with bitter hops on the first sip followed quickly by the sweetish malty backbone. Some thinness in the mouth probably due to high carbonation. As with all of the really good IPA's balancing the bitter hops vs malt is an art form. This beer accomplishes this with ease.
"22oz Bomber poured into tulip glass,Appearance is Hazy Apricot,with pillowy thick head good retention.Nose is mango,apricot,and pine.Taste follows the nose with a nice hop bite and lingering grapefruit pith mid palate.overall a classic west coast ipa that is a model for the style.this brew from a renowned san diego brewer is not to be missed.Highly Recommended"
"This was poured into a nonic pint. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange to slightly bronzed brown color. There’s a nice looking big white foamy two finger head that dissipated to a rocky level for a sustainable moment but eventually dissipated to a fine lacing sticking and sliding at the same time. The smell had a nice sticky sweet grapefruit, light lemon and pine running over some light caramel malt. The taste was sweet and bitter with a fairly decent sweet piney to lemon bitterness over my taste buds. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. I would say this was fairly sessionable. The carbonation was good for the style and for me. There’s a nice bitterness running over my tongue in a proper AIPA sort of way. Overall, wow, this was a great AIPA that I could bang again. It came across in every good AIPA sort of way and has a good sessionability about it that could definitely go with it’s respected food."
"Poured golden in color with a decent head and lacing. Nice hoppy notes with a hit of citrus and floral. The taste was very good, very balanced hops to citrus with a mellowness to this beer. Got a lot of dryness on the finish with a burst of lemon/orange. This is a solid beer all around, medium bodied."
"From the growler, it pours a solid amber with a nice head. Some lacing as you enjoy it. Pine and grapefruit in the nose. The mouth gets a nice modest bitterness that follows the nose. Nice!"
"Look- Poured from a can, copper in color, slight haze, a thin cap of creamy white head, no lacing."
idk what I'm doing but this stuff is good.
"A very solid entry in the IPA category but I much prefer the Grapefruit Sculpin, see review to follow."
best ipa ever
"Serving: 12 oz can (date code ""17067"") poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
"Great IPA. Very drinkable, smooth, crisp. Delicious!"
"Solid baseline IPA. Plenty of pine and hop, not too punishing of a finish. Doesn't hold up to the likes of Maine Beer Co, Treehouse, Trillium, Other Half etc... however, a solid beer that's very easy to get your hands on both on tap and in bottles around Boston."
Good good good! From tap at their Long Beach location.
"First of all, the beer looks spectacular in the glass with a dark gold look and nice head that holds well as you drink. The best thing about the drink is by far the flavor hints of pine yet has some sweetness to it. It doesn't have a strong scent to it. Not as bitter as its brothers to the north being Washington and Oregon IPA's but most definitely is a wonderful beer."
"This is my go to IPA. Heavy pine notes, crisp finish. I ofter like to buy IPAs from the store that other people swear by (usually east coasters), and then I come back to this one and remember how good it is. When trying other IPAs from Whole Foods, etc, I'm disappointed more ofter than not, not because the beers I'm trying are bad, but just because I've become spoiled by how solid of a beer Sculpin is."
"Strongly aromatic with pine and citrus, pleasant in the front of the palate echoing the aroma, but it gets more unpleasant towards the back. Very bitter in the back of the throat with too much unpleasant linger. I understand this is a classic IPA staple but it is not my kind of IPA. I desire more malt and balance. Still, I admit that I need to revisit it in depth and it may grow on me."
"Being in the top 250 I expected a lot more. Not that it isn't great, it really is a delicious IPA and I would buy it again. It's just that I've had many other IPAs that aren't in the top 250 which have impressed me far more than this one. Easy to drink compared to other IPAs with plenty of citrus and hops, smells and looks great, and in my opinion would be a good starting IPA for newer beer drinkers."
17040 printed on the bottom of the bottle.
"You know, I've had this several times over a couple years and am just now rating it. I like it. There's nothing wrong with it. But in a market that includes IPA's that have become inventive and diverse in their flavors, this is kind of bland. Not unpleasant. Just not impressive and unique. But that's ok. Sometimes you want a higher ABV, non session IPA that is dry with medium to low hops (for an IPA), no floral or fruit or any other notes, and a super clean (again for an IPA), slightly dry finish. After normalizing your palate to IPA's, you'll probably find Sculpin to be good but unchalenging and palatable to drink over an extended period of time, as long as you don't fall down. I personally use Grapefruit Sculpin as my benchmark against which to measure citrus infused IPA's, but that's a different beer, different story. This isn't a shot across the bow of Ballast Point which I think produces some amazing brews, especially The Commodore, particularly the holiday version. Ok, now I'm just ranting."
"Foamy head. Strong aromas and notes of hops, as you would expect. However, the hop taste is balanced by some malt and yeast character, so it’s not an IPA that punches you in the mouth, and is surprisingly smooth. Floral, tropical fruit notes. Dry finish with the faintest hints of citrus. Cool artwork on the label...ugly fish but a great beer. Pairs nicely with fish tacos."
"Drinkable; but, 97? No way. There are a hundred better IPAs out there. But, even at number 101, it's quite drinkable. What a country! I'm old. Trust me; we've come a long way."
"This beer is as tasty as the wicked-looking sculpin on its label is hideous. Mellow, bitter, and sweetish without any tang of alcohol at 7.0%. Bursting with flavor, will drink again."
"Not sure what the hype is surrounding this beer. Would not be a beer I would seek out again. In fact, I've yet to find a beer in their collection that I've enjoyed. Not sure if it's the marketing that's gotten them the hype, but this beer doesn't do it for me. "
"355 ml bottle poured into a snifter. Light amber, clear. Small, white and frothy head. Slowly diminishing to a small crown. Decent lacing. Strong hop aroma. Resin upfront, later very citrusy some tropical fruits. Flavor shows very high hop bitterness. In a mouth-feel has a medium body, Is quite oily, smooth with an average carbonation. Long lasting dry finish, lingering but not harsh. Fantastic American IPA. Bit of warm alcohol in a finish."
This to me is the IPA breed standard. Not theven best IPA and not the worst. This is the beer by which I judge all other IPAs.
The Billion Dollar beer is responsible for many many of my friends' conversion to IPA's. Crisp taste with a bitter aftertaste that is less wet to the palette that many other IPA's. All in all a great go to as it is now widely available.
wow. on point on so many things
"Hazy copper color with a small head and a little lacing. Smells of citrus, pine and dark fruit. Has pine and citrus flavors, nothing is over done it all blends together very well. Solid IPA for sure."
"Good stuff but highly overrated in my opinion. It appears to be placed in the highest echelons of the finest beers. However the price for this beer is a bit (or more) higher than what we can get here in Indiana.....ie.., 3 Floyds... which we can get FRESH here. ********ADD ON: drinking one now 9/7/17.... It IS outstanding, no doubt. I bet it's cheaper in California though. Just wondering. Could be that when we get it here in the midwest it is not as fresh. NO date on the bottle other than a confusing code on the bottom of the bottle....unlike the unmistakable ""bottled on"" or ""best by """
A: malts and pine
"This one was really good. I liked the citrusy flavor, I've had the grapefruit but this one is even better. Not an outstanding IPA but for a standard one it's perfectly done."
"Pours a dark gold/amber with a tall, white head that lasts awhile"
"Ah, the smell of Sculpin. I feel each time i open one that's it's a unique smell even among all the IPAs out there. Listen to me, like I brew it. I've only has it about a dozen times. I also really enjoy Grapefruit Sculpin, although they're the only 2 I've tried. Taste in this one is all pleasant hops; definitely grapefruit & other citrus & floral; pretty juicy, light piney at first which then comes on more / with a touch more fruit maybe mango. Smooth & well balanced. I will enjoy this again. (Score 4.35)"
"I was especially excited to try this IPA based upon the excellent ratings. It pours a hazy golden amber with decent head and lacing. The aroma is lightly citrus and pine. The taste is essentially a middle of the road IPA. It is rather poorly balanced with little citrus/pine hop taste. Definitely nothing special. I tried this IPA twice at different times on tap and once in a bottle. At $13.99 a six pack, it is no bargain. I can't understand all of the high ratings."
"First Impression: The first non-fruity Ballast Point that I'm trying. So far have been pretty disappointed with Mango Even Keel and Watermelon Dorado. I thought grapefruit sculpin was good, but not great. Expected to not like this as much as grapefruit sculpin but was surprised that this is better."
"First had 7/19/13 at Mom's Maxwell's on Main in Doylestown. I just don't love this beer like everyone else. Simcoe, and citrus are good, but the malt profile just doesn't agree with me. I actually, for once, approve of the fruity versions (pineapple, grapefruit) better than the original."
"Slightly hazy, lotsa bubbles, peach in color, finger, finger of slowly fading white head and moderate lacing. Aroma, first thing that jumps out is that catty Simcoe hop, my least favorite hop. Citrus, mostly lemon and a little orange and a bit of peach. Flavor, bit of that astringent, ammonia/catty like quality, again, I bet this has Simcoe. Cracker bread malt, lots of citrus/lemon, nice building bitter bite. Feel is full carbonation, dry, and medium body. I'm sure if I was a fan of certain hops, I'd like this a lot more, so I'll keep that in mind when I choose brews in the future, and I'll be kind, here."
"I once had it on-tap and got unpleasant experience thought my glass was pressed poorly without head and served in too warm temperature. So, I decide to have it again this time on bottle."
Above average IPA but good for being fairly mass produced. Like the Grapefruit version better. Nice bitter taste with nice citrus overtones. Great color and aroma. Would get a bar or restaurant if on tap.
Reviewed 6/15/15
Poured from a bottle date coded of 10/16/16 into the modified tulip glass.
12oz bottle poured into globe glass..
"I guess we all have different palates, but I was really excited to taste this today , however was quite disappointed for a top 250 brew ."
Too smooth and not enough hops.
Golden appearance with a pleasant hoppy aroma. The taste was much better than most IPAs I have tried. It is slightly fruity which is a big plus. I would recommend it to both IPA lovers and non-lovers
"A: Dark amber, darker than most IPAs"
"Look: Pour from 12oz bottle into pint glass, one finger offwhite head, quick dissipation but decent lacing. Fairly transparent amber\dark gold"
Pours amber with an inch of head that dissipates quickly leaves a nice white lacing. Very Floral forward and hoppy. Lingering finish. Hops bite.
My friends and I are always trying to find the best IPA Beer. So we all got together today with 16 different IPA'S and had a taste test. Grant we all had our favorite brands and thought we knew a lot about beer. Our final two beers were Ale Smith IPA and Sculipin IPA. Sculpin won our taste test 6 votes to 2 due to a better finishing taste.
When I first had this it was one of the best. It is still a strong beer but there are so many awesome options. This one is just a great beer with a nice crisp smooth hop taste. I'd still prefer the grapefruit sculpin.
Poured from the bottle into a tulip
The Finest IPA out there.
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a cigar city pint glass.
"New to IPA's, but very familiar w Ballast Point. Good tasting IPA. Not to heavy on the florals which are a slight turn off for me on some IPA's. Ballast Point continues to make awesome brews and this does not disappoint. I LOVE the Cali Kolsch so I had to give the Sculpin a taste. Not disappointed!"
Crack open a can and you will smell and see what all the fuss is about.
"When looking to continue from a good IPA like a Dogfish 60min, you should give this a try. A clean, crisp, and light to medium weight IPA. A nice beer to start a cool night with a grapefruit taste that will be a good entry to other grapefruit IPAs that have been making grate advances in the IPA world."
"Great IPA. I was avoiding it for years for some reason, probably stupidity. I now officially love this and dogfish 90 minute. I'm going to San Diego next week so maybe I'll find lucky number 3."
Something new to my area and seemed a little pricey. Poured from a can into a snifter glass.
"Sculpin IPA brewed by Ballast Point Brewing Company, with an ABV of 7.00% This IPA pours out a golden amber color with a small white head. There is also a nice cloudy tint to Sculpin IPA. Sculpin IPA is an unfiltered brew you can not see though this IPA. The smell of Sculpin IPA, is nice with hops, grains and malts. You also pick up on a mild sweetness in the smell of this brew. The smell is really inviting. There is also a fair amount of lacing to this IPA. Now for the taste, it is bold with hops at first. Then it smooths out with sweet grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Sculpin IPA . This IPA had the look, smell and taste of most IPA's on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. What sets this IPA form the others is how smooth it is. Sculpin IPA has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew. The month feel of Sculpin IPA is, Rich, Bold, Clean Smooth and Refreshing. I really how bold this brew is however it goes down nice and smooth. Overall I'm giving Sculpin IPA a 4.50 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. If you are a fan of IPA's look this brew up. Ballast Point Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this brew."
Appearance: A golden-coppery orange with a reddish hue. A good amount of rising foamy white head and some decent looking lacing left behind as it settles.
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/22/2016. Pours slightly hazy medium orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon/orange rind, pine, toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and lightly creamy/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Minimal warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an incredible IPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink despite very resinous bitterness. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Very good IPA. Not as floral as some of the real good IPAs but still very hoppy and a good mouthfeel. Very unassuming by the looks, but tastes strong and finished smooth."
"Pours a light amber color. It's flavor has hints of citrus and has a bready aftertaste with a dry finish. It has a hoppy bitter quality to it as well, but unfortunately I thought the bitterness was a tad too strong for my taste. Overall I still think it's a more than decent beer, and if I saw this at a party I wouldn't hesitate to grab a bottle."
Appearance:
solid west coast style IPA. was definitely a little too bitter for my palate. Probably will try it again on the tap somewhere and hopefully a fresher one will change my perspective.
"Having this on-tap. This beer draws a pretty clear, medium golden color with a bit of an orange hue and a white head that's about half an inch thick when first drawn and served. Head settles to a medium sized to thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some bits of foam on the beer's surface. Aromas of slightly toasted caramel malt notes along with mango, melon, and citrus hops. The taste is pretty much the same, with slightly toasted caramel malt sweetness that gives way to mango, melon, and citrus hop bitterness that also has a bit of an earthy note to it. Good balance of flavors here. Has a mainly crisp, slightly smooth and frothy, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish. easy to drink in the good way."
"Medium amber color with soapy head. Smell is amazing. Nice, sharp and citrusy. Warm mango flavor with nice lemon rind flavor in the hops. Smooth texture driven by the malts. Really well rounded IPA."
very solid easy to find beer
L -- vibrant pale orange. Slight haziness. Medium head with significant lacing
I actually reviewed this beer about a year and a half ago.
"An amber orange color with a rich smell of hops and citrus. Tastes very citrussy, a little piney, and has a mild bitter bite towards the end. Feels solidly medium bodied. Overall it's a fine example of the style."
"I enjoyed Sculpin from a 12oz bottle poured into a shaker pint glass. The beer pours a dark, golden, orange that looks as refreshing as it tastes. There was about a finger and a half of paper white head with good lacing on the glass. "
"Tried this a couple of times but don't think it's worth the price or its vaunted status. A bit lighter and at least as complex as a Dogfish 60, I'll give it that. A fine IPA but the price just grinds my shorts. I also prefer the richness of the Two-Hearted at a bit lower price point."
"Pours a gorgeous, brilliant tangerine-honey color with a thin head. Smells mostly of citrus/grapefruit and hops. Tastes like you'd expect a grapefruity IPA to taste - a balanced floral, grapefruit zing that quickly fades but with minimal bitterness. Seems only moderately carbonated, which I liked."
"great looking brew. notes of bready and caramel malt, floral, grass, resinous pine, light grapefruit. mouthfeel is decent but doesnt stand up to other top IPAs."
"Pours a beautiful straw color with a thin head. Smells of citrus and pine. Delicious flavors of the same including mango. Easy and light going down. Awesome for a hot summers day. Overall, the best IPA I've had."
"Copper color, little head, light bubbles carbonation which I like."
"My #1 go-to, accessible IPA for years now. Pours a clear golden orange, nice white tight bubbled head that lasts the whole session. Excellent lacing. Aroma consists of a citrusy burst of orange peel and grapefruit, pine and and a hint of sweet malt in the back end. That sweet bready malt initially in the taste, waves of grapefruit and pine and finishes with a subtle bitter hoppy after taste. Mouthfeel is relatively thin to medium bodied, moderate carbonation. A great easy drinker, hard to sense anything wrong with this."
"Simply a prime example of an IPA. I didn't want to put it down to write this review. Therefore, I'll keep it short. Whatever comes to mind when you think ""IPA"" is what this beer looks, smells, tastes, and feels like. My only complaint is that I didn't buy two (or three). I didn't give 5's across the board because nothing is perfect."
"This is one of the highest rated IPAs, and with good reason. Tons of hops, but a very balanced flavor-profile as well. It's a bold IPA, well-suited to those that like west coast IPAs and hoppy bitterness, while still being extremely smooth and refreshing at the same time. My biggest gripe is with the price - yes, it is probably one of the best IPAs on the market and can command a premium price, but there are many other great options at 1/2 the price!!"
Fair kinda scunky
"It has the best head retention I've ever seen in an IPA. Super frothy. The citrus smell is very, very inviting, but subtle. The taste also isn't overwhelming, but has a really nice bitter burn on the end. It's very close to the bitterness of an English IPA. Yes, I'd get this again. Is this one overhyped? Maybe, but worth getting."
"Solid IPA. Pine, resin, grapefruit pith, some peach. Bright carbonation with full and clean mouth feel."
"This beer has a very clear amber look with a very thick creamy white head. Has a sweet hoppy aroma with a hint of pine. Very hoppy with a light caramel, and somewhat hidden apricot taste."
"Look : Redish orange, very clear with white head - 4/5"
"great beer, pricey though..."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, there is no ""best by"" date that I can find."
"L - Golden, like the fresh waters of your local lake"
This was bottled on April 26th and came out of a mix 12 pack. I've had it before both fresher and older. 
L- Hazy orange/golden color 
"While I am not an IPA fan, I do enjoy the beer style in small doses. This is perhaps the finest year-round IPA I have enjoyed. It hits all the right notes but is never overpowering in any aspect. Overall, I am really happy that it has become available in my region (Indiana)."
"Are you in the market for a one dimensional IPA? How about one that really, substantively,, the embodiment of the ""California"" IPA, where you get one dimensional hop bitterness, no malt profile worth speaking of? If that sounds right up your alley, then, hey, you're gonna love this beer. It's got hops. Then, it's got more hops. Even more hops come in latter. The mouthfeel and head retention are the best things about this beer."
"Poured from bottle into tulip. One finger head went to 1/2 quickly. Very citrusy, orangy on the nose. Initial taste took over my mouth with sweet fruitiness. Like nectar flowing into the palate after biting into a super juicy orange, with some hops tart coming through big time. A fantastic IPA. Will find out after the bottle (or two) but this may be my favorite IPA."
Nice smooth drinking very nice taste
"L-Pours a hazy yellow straw like color with a hint of amber, with a nice white foamy head."
"This is one of those “long time coming” beers in that it’s so highly rated in the US (BeerAdvocate has it on their Beers of Fame list: The gold standard of tasting lists IMO) and Dan Murphy’s have stocked their Big Eye IPA for many years - I mean WTF took them so long to get Sculpin in?!? Anyway, it’s here, it’s overpriced, and it’s finally getting either the “Doc brand seal of Approval” or the “Doc brand seal of Meh!”... or something in-between those 2 seals [perhaps half of each seal? I haven’t really given it that much thought]. So take it away Ballast Point Sculpin IPA!"
"Nice, standard, well rounded west coast IPA. Typical of the style, one of the gold standards. Freshness definitely matters but it holds up really well for a month or two. Always happy to have this one."
From a bottle into a pint glass. 
"This is a perfectly fine, classic IPA, in fact, if there was a tastable IPA beer dictionary, you would probably find a pint of this beer under the definition of IPA. Not especially floral or fruity. It is suitably bitter, crisp and refreshing. I will always and happily drink one if offered but it really costs too much for me to ever buy it again. Thirteen dollars for a six pack? Really? It's not all that."
This is some good shit!
Thought I would try since this one is raved about. Nope still don't care for the IPAs
"Smell: pineapple, grapefruit. Tangy citrus hops. "
the most overrated ipa on the market
"Poured from a can into a shaker glass. Color is amber, a little on the darker side. Thick, white foam of almost two fingers. Scent is light, almost non-existant mostly of pine leading into grapefruit. A little flower up front leads into grapefruit and bready malt flavors then finishes sweet, lingers for a while. Feel is light, moderate carbonation and an easy drinker. Overall a pleasant IPA, there are a few better but this one is worthwhile."
"Delicious aroma poured with minimal head. Drank it from a Weizen glass with light lacing. I loved the flavor and would rank it it in my top 10. It is a good beer but, there are several other beers that I like that aren't nearly as expensive."
Sculpin is always good.
Great beer. Lots of flavor with high carbonation and hops. Very drinkable. Would buy again.
"Dark amber, not so pale.lightly medical aroma soft with an edge. Massive pale malt richness, extended hoppy finish. First carbonation-hop bite, silky smooth body. Well crafted, greater than sum of parts."
Solid
Pleasant hoppy aromas right when you open the bottle. Drank straight from the bottle. 
"Poured from 650 ml bottle purchased from Costco for ~$6.50. Could not find a date on the bottle. Not much smell, taste is bitter/musky with some citrus. It actually kind of tastes more like an East Coast IPA than West Coast, or perhaps in between the two."
Appearance: semi-opaque light gold with a short and quickly dissipating foam head
"Pours a hazy light yellow with minimal head. The nose is interesting -- I'm getting notes of pineapple and floral hops. The taste is much of the same, but I'm picking up an interesting jasmine tea flavor. Nothing really stands out and it's a little bland all around."
"Great beer, not as good as the grapefruit variety."
"On tap at the Hay Merchant, Houston. Nice orange-ish amber with a decent head. The aroma is mostly hops and lots of them...off to a good start. First sip tells me this one is not over-carbonated like many IPAs. Looks like all those hops that hit me in the face are mostly dry-hopped because the beer is not overly bitter. Lots of grapefruit and citrus with some pine notes. A little dankness emerges as it warms. This is a great IPA, no doubt about it. Everything you expect from a West Coast IPA and more. I would give a slight edge to Union Jack but they seem very similar to me. I think Yellow Rose is superior or maybe just more to my taste but I can't think of other examples that I think are substantially better."
"12 oz bottle, poured into a nonic pint. A amber-gold ale, crystal clear and topped by a large, dense white head. Good retention and great lacing."
12-oz bottle into Belgian ale glass
"Ok look, I'm not trying to be a beer snob or pile on or anything like that, buttttt I'm sorry this is not a 97 beer. What am I missing? It's easy to drink yes, but very little to offer in terms of smell, barely any hop taste, no bitterness... No way would I spend $15 on this again when I can get captain's daughter and sip for $15... Different style I understand just comparing price point. Maybe it's better on draft I dunno..."
A solid IPA
Great fruity easy drinking ipa would drink again
This was one of the first Top 250's that I was able to secure for myself in my early days of being a Craft Beer Enthusiast. I will still have one every now and again and it never disappoints!
"Ballast Point Brewing 'Sculpin IPA' @ 7.0% , served from a 650 ml bottle purchased for $9.60"
"I have no idea why this beer rates so high with everyone. Maybe they are not very experienced in drinking a variety of IPAs. Compared to coors light this is a 97, but as far as IPAs go it is as generic as they come. No hop flavor other than bitterness, no malt, crappy carbonation. Overall, nothing special."
"Really right on the money in terms of taste for an IPA - but if you're familiar with the style it's more of the same - although a superior exemplar. Lots of bitter tropical hops and a generous malt bill. A very sessionable, crisp, juicy, bitter, hoppy beer that goes down easy and finishes dry."
Poured from a can into my trusty tulip glass.
"Appearance: Pours a clean amber, with a big head of off-white suds. Decent lace."
looks ok in the glass with light orange hue. sudsy head. nose is grapefruit and some biscut with not much else to me. fairly weak. taste follows nose with some pineapple and grapefruit near the end palate with light cracker malt in there to balance it out. mouthfeel is rather thin. I dunno. I don't see all the fuss over this. ive had this beer many times and always think the same thing. ..meh.... not great. not bad.
"Ballast Point has recently come to Richmond, Va following us landing Stone's east coast brewery. Rumors even started swirling that BP was looking at us as a possible location for their expansion. I've been wanting to try their much-hyped brews, but at $15/6-pack their product is almost double that of other good beers, and close to 50% more than Stone's fine offerings. I felt like I should get a happy ending with it at that price. So when I saw a mixed 12 for $21 and change I decided to give 'em a whirl. First up, the much lauded Sculpin. "
"This truly is a world class beer. I've been wanting to try it for a long time and it definitely met my expectations. Easy to drink, full of citrus and muted pine flavors, balanced with a nice malt base. Truly lovely!"
"Excellent apricot color with orange tones. White or off-white head with firm carbonation. Wonderful nose, a blend of conifers, citrus, and other tropical fruits. Flavor, as promised by the nose, and then some. Delightful hops just as an IPA should have, but despite their prominence they were balanced. Mouthfeel clean, with some smooth creaminess in the middle that was not distracting. This beer deserves the accolades it has received."
Look:
Great IPA one of the best I have had!
This was a let down after trying grapefruit sculpin and being used to New England style IPA.
"Clear golden orange with a white head and some lacing. Big hop aroma of citrus, pine, cat pee and flowers. Really bitter up front but balanced, clean fermentation and no real alcohol taste. Medium body with average carbonation and dry. Really good IPA"
"Golden copper color with quarter inch head. Robust tropical flavors, citrus, pine, and other fruity notes. Great tropics to hops combo. Feels great. Nice aftertaste for this full, excellent IPA. Will revisit for sure."
"Pale copper color with maybe half finger of head. Nose of apricot, citrus, tropical fruits, little peach. Taste of lemon, pine, orange peel, tropical fruits, and nice hoppy bite on the back end with a hint of breadiness. Dry finish with a nice lingering feel at the end. This is a very good IPA. Very light and refreshing with the bitterness you love. I prefer their dorado but this is a close second in the Ballast line up."
Pure clear orange color with a two finger off-white head. Smells pine with citrus rind in there. Smooth and somewhat fruity. Accessible but with a big character. The bitter dryness is just enough to make you want another sip. Very refreshing without being mouth-numbing like some other modern IPAs. Definitely a great example of the type.
"Pours filtered and golden, low carbonation with a one finger head. Smells of pine and citrus with sticky hops. Taste is bitter, bready malts, and pretty nicely balanced. Light mouthfeel, somewhat watery. Not bad overall when nothing special is available, this IPA should do the trick."
"I couldn't believe I had never reviewed this since it's something of a legend and has been available in NC for years. Pours a lighter color than you expect, kind of a dark straw but almost opaque in its translucence. Nice, tight bubbled off white head that lasts a few minutes but no more. Solid lacing appears later. The nose is strong. All kinds of friendly tropical fruit flavors: orange, grapefruit, kiwi, lime, others..."
"From an undated bomber. Pours an amber color with a finger of fluffy white head. Smell is mostly grapefruit. Medium body, taste is mostly hop bitterness which is strong but not excessive. I'm a little puzzled why it's currently rated 97 - World Class, it's certainly a good IPA but not exceptional."
Bottle Date: none
"A delicious, well-balanced IPA that is excellent from nose to finish. It has multiple layers of varied and subtle fruit notes that change from front to back. The consistency of Ballast Point's batches is a credit to their process. It's wide availability is something to be thankful for."
"When pouring the beer, you get an amber beer with white foam."
"I had a bottle of this about a year ago in which I thought the grapefruit bitterness was a bit overwhelming (even wondered at the time how they could also make a grapefruit sculpin that possibly had more grapefruit flavor). A friend gifted me a can, so I thought I would give it another try. This time, it is the opposite -- very little nose. The flavor is a nice smooth, tasty IPA -- but a little subdued and unremarkable. I don't know -- maybe the Thai food I had on Saturday destroyed my palate for the week - or maybe the can is old."
Slight haziness nice lacing. Smell is nice but not exceptional. Taste is very good but I expected more from such a highly rated brew. I'll buy it again but I won't seek it.
I would take Bell's Two Hearted over this hands down!
"Poured it has an Amber color. Very light head and minimal carbonation. Smell is very fruity, citrus and hops. Taste is the best. Full fruity and citrus flavor with after taste of hops and spice. Smooth finish. I highly recommned to drink ice cold and relaxing on the beach kinda beer. Really good. One of my favorite IPA."
"Obviously this beer has had numerous positive reviews & this one will add to that. I bought a 22 oz bottle and poured it into a standard pint glass. Light amber color, nicely carbonated. Beautiful head that slowly receded to a full film across the glass. This beer has a wonderful bouquet of citrus. The bottle lists some fruits in regards to flavor. I could taste apricot, grapefruit & orange. 70 IBUs give it that hoppy punch, but not over the top. Enough to satisfy any hop head. Warm, rich, carmel malt gives it the velvet sphere that forms in your mouth after you sip it. Each sip tastes better than the previous - a sign of a good beer! I would drink this again."
"The other sterling reviews cover what I'd say. So, I'll use this space to respond to the idiots calling them sellouts and/or downgrading their beer because they decided to make some money. This is a quote from the founder of Ballast Point shortly after the deal was made with Constellation, ""Constellation has guaranteed that this brewery will remain true to its roots. There will be no coast-to-coast ad campaigns similar to the ones touting Corona. No changes in the brewing team, no shift in management. As important as that was for us, it was key for them. That’s what they are investing in, they want to make sure it’s me and my team doing what we do best. It will be the same people making the same beer, with the same culture and approach.” I get not liking big business, stay away if you want. But if you liked the beer before then you are still going to like it now."
A refreshing IPA with a hint of pineapple. Expensive.
Pours a beautiful translucent gold with just a touch of haze. Nice 2 finger head recedes in 1 minute to a thin halo around the edge of the glass. The smell gives away what is in store with a great nose of fruity hops and pine. Taste matches the smell with a bit of citrus in the aftertaste. If you stop drinking an even stronger aftertaste of grapefruit will commandeer the palate for a good 5 minutes. Feel is close to perfect. When you take it in you don't even feel the carbonation for a minute then just enough fizzy micro bubbles appear on the tongue to add some zing to each mouthful. This is on the door step of the greats for me. For this beer to be available in many supermarkets now to me means craft beer has conquered the market.
"This is a fantastic beer. I tried this on tap last year and I have been hooked ever since. I'm trying to get to all the flavors of Sculpin. There are a bunch. This beer is so good that that you don't want to put it down and you end up drinking the first one fairly fast. Then it's on to number 2, be careful this second one could sneak up on ya and bite ya in the @$$. It's potent! A 6 pack has put me down for the count. In a happy as a pig in slop kind of way. Can't wait to get down south to one of their breweries. If you see it in the store do yourself a favor and try it. It is pricey, especially for 6-pack, but well worth it."
I suppose the story here is what is called niche marketing.
Sampled from a tulip glass in Ballast Point Tasting Room in San Diego
"A beautifully clear golden, slightly Amber color1 finger head. Aroma is a bit dank, citrusy, orangey, pineapple. Smells like it will be sticky. Tastes a little more sappy with some medium amounts of piney bitterness. Grapefruit. More orange and citrus. Overall, this could easily be a nice go to IPA. Though there are other IPAs you have access to NYD, that you prefer more. This is a nice change and something you'd certainly not turn down."
Much has been said about this beer and I'll make it short. 
Appearance: This IPA pours a clear bright golden orange color.
355ml bottle into a Spiegleau IPA glass. Paid £5.10 for a single bottle.
Sellouts.
Bitter but delicious. ABV is solid. Reminds me of a tastier version of Harpoon's Leviathan.
This beer has a very clear amber look with a very thick creamy white head. Has a sweet hoppy aroma with a hint of pine. Not too overwhelming. Very hoppy with a light caramel taste.
Bottled 2/11/16
"Had this poured into a pint glass. Color was a translucent gold, bit lighter than I like in my IPAs. Everything else about this beer was very very good. The flavor and aroma were strong on citrus, super crisp...love that in an IPA. Mouthfeel was a little harsh, but not terrible. Meets the hype."
Best beer ever. Trust me.
"Having this beer tastes like what the fundamental idea of an IPA should taste. It is clear, amber gold that has about half inch head and considerable lacing. The body is bitter with lots of juicy, wet grapefruit and ends with a crisp tonic/La Croix/soda water ending. One of the most solid year round ipas I have had."
Hi points for this beer holding up this long. Poured into Teku glass after being bottled for 6 months. Slightly hazy pale gold. Aroma lacks what I had back in California. Taste is still a very well balanced beer. Solid.
One of the best IPAs I've ever had!
Favorite beer so far. Taste is outstanding and better than the grapefruit sculpin.
"Okay IPA. A bit salty. A bit overrated. The seasonal limited editions i.e the habanero , grapefruit and pineapple are better in my opinion."
F'yeah!
Tried this because I saw it on a list of IPAs for those who don't like IPAs. It just reinforced my dislike of most IPAs
Grape fruit intense
"Very good beer, one of the best IPA's I have had."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle, cloudy golden-orange. Bubbly, cream colored head that hangs for a minute before tapering off to a ring that stays around."
"Good IPA, and a standard for IPA's on the west coast. That's why you can pull grapefruit and pineapple."
"Poured from a bottle into a very small jar like glass. I didn't store the beer upright because I'm an idiot, and I'm kinda concerned it went bad after trying the first one, loving it and noticing such a difference from the second. But I'm going to review the second and update if I get it again or another from the pack jumps out. Edit: the third did."
Will have to review again with a fresher batch.
"Love this style of IPA, a little creamy, a little grapefruit, a little hop stink. Goes down easy"
"Fabulous IPA with powerful taste on the front mid and back palate. Very well balanced IPA, even-keeled between bitterness and hop taste. Very lacy."
"Sad it got bought out. Very good beer, I've had many a Bavarian appreciate this beer."
"Fantastic beer. Great hops, bitterness just right with a great finish. Too bad they were bought out by the man."
"Look: Clear amber with a nice off white head, decent head retention."
"Pours a translucent orange-yellow with a medium-thin off-white head. A fair amount of lacing. Smell is dominated by piney hop aromas. Taste is a refreshing mix of piney hop and citrus, but with an emphasis on the former. Mouth feel is rather nice. It feels strong and well carbonated. Overall, this is a great stock-standard IPA. Without any citrus emphasis, the hops get a much better chance to shine, and thus the hoppy taste may overwhelm some. It is on the medium-light hop side of American IPAs though."
"Pretty much the best IPA I've ever had. The Ballast Point flagship beer really is amazing. A nice citrus flavored hop mixed with some sappy piney notes as well. Very balanced and refreshing. They charge a pretty penny for six-packs, but it really is worth the cost. Golden tint and crisp taste are great!"
"12 oz. can, no decodible date (from Teddy) poured into an imperial pint glass."
"Brilliantly clear, deep golden color. Pours a whitish head, moderate in size but with nice retention."
"Poured from 355 ml bottle in a glass mug. (Exp. 02/2016, according to importer's label.) Great aroma, very heavy body. Cloudy, light amber liquid. Nice retention foam. Low drinkability."
"Probably my favorite go-to IPA there is. Tropical, citrus-y, and of course plenty hoppy. Hides a wonderful 7.00 abv as well as it could. The brand standard."
Nice citrus IPA w a hoppy edge. Would but agian
Poured into a balloon glass.
"Look - Clear golden color, good carbonation and head retention. nice foam generation with a gentle swirl."
I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this was. Aroma to me came off with so flora / cotta combo. Poured beautifully into a 18th st snifter. I could fill a cooler and hit the beach with some of these. Eager to try the Grapefruit and pineapple soon. At 7% could drink these all day long.
"From a growler from a just-tapped keg, pours a nice orangey copper with an off-white, fluffy head that topped 3 fingers, even with a gentle-ish pour. Fair amount of lacing. Smell is mangos and a sort of spicy pine, though mangos always smell a little piney to me, so maybe it's just mangos. Also some grapefruit, some musty earth and a little bit of sweet fruit I can't place, but elements of peach, apricot, orange and pineapple. "
"L: huge white head, nice clean look"
"Pours a transparent amber orange color with a frothy, bright white head that lasted the whole glass. Big hop flavor and aroma with lots of grapefruit and other tropical notes. Slightly too unbalanced in the way of bitterness, imo, needs a stronger malt backbone. It ends up giving this beer an almost medicinal quality. Leaves a lingering bitter finish."
Nice lacing. Wish the head didn't so quickly dissipate. Very clear - I like an IPA that's a bit cloudy. Crisp. It's good. I'd definitely buy this again.
"A staple to have around at all times. Very drinkable, only second, in my opinion to Grapefruit Sculpin."
"Well balanced with the fruit notes & hops, smooth, crisp finish."
Wife got me a bottle as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. Very thoughtful gift. Knew of this beer but wasn't aware of how highly hyped it was. 
"Amber with a khaki head, this is an easily drinkable, nicely bitter piney IPA with notes of citrus and a soft body with a dry finish. If I wasn't downing White Rajah all the time, I might have to get more comfortable with this."
"Have criss-crossed this great nation in search of the perfect IPA, and the three I submit for your consideration are Sculpin, Union Jack, and Three Floyd's Broo Doo. I've consumed hundreds of bombers, thousands of pints, and a number of growlers I've lost track of. None have beaten Sculpin for consistent quality. Will buy it at any price, and have. It's just that good."
"I will probably make a more in-depth addendum to this review later, but for now, let's just say that it's a solid IPA, not even an American IPA, but a true, almost-English-style one with a great sense of balance and nice malts to even the keel. Grapefruit is the dominant flavor in the hops, but bitter resins still preside over all and a smooth texture and light body make this an easy beginner IPA for anyone who likes a crisp, refreshing, bitter beer. Grapefruit variant of Sculpin takes things in the next logical direction, but I'm enjoying this as it is."
"Great IPA, hops are dominant but enough malt to provide complexity. Reminds me a lot of Union Jack. Maybe not quite as good, but a great beer in its own right."
"12 oz, bottled Nov., 2015."
fresh bottle. 
A gentler IPA. In a land of extreme hop heads this IPA offers balance while still maintaining a nod to the land of the bitter.
Solid well balance IPA. Highly recommend but comes with a financial decision with current price point in the midwest.
This IPA is a perfectly balanced beer. More to the floral side of the IPA style - but a truly excellent beer. A nice change from some of the overly hopped one note IPAs out there. Glad to have it in Alberta!
Outstanding beer
"Amazing IPA, well balanced, more grapefruit than pine"
12 oz poured in wine glass 
"Freakin great. It pours golden amber and clear, with a frothy white head that lingers and laces. The aroma is strong with this one, caught a whiff as I poured and was immediately excited to dive in. Smells of citrus fruit, mostly grapefruit, with a backbone of dank hops. That first sip is fantastic, hitting with a complex array of fruit, hops, some malts. Very fresh and crisp. Bitter hops linger somewhat, balancing and adding nicely to the overall drink. Definitely up there in the realm of fantastic IPA"
"I remember the first time I tried this beer in a blind tasting, and I thought I had landed on my favorite IPA (Union Jack)...but then I was exposed to a whole new beer world...."
As smooth as it gets with this one. Could be one of the best IPAs that isn't all that difficult to get your hands on.
"Very Refreshing. It gets you past the interesting hump(back) very quickly. BTW, the ""Interesting Hump"" is the point down a pint glass where you suddenly get more interesting."
The beer that got me into craft beer.
A - nice golden amber color w white head that dissipates quick
L: Poured into a Pint Defiance tulip. Body is a clear orange with a thin creamy white head. Mild carbonation is visible.
"smooth. really good color,smell and taste"
Nice crisp and refreshing hoppy ipa. Reminds me alot of bells two hearted but I thing I like this a little better. Glad this is finally avaiable in michigan. Will be drinking this again and again. Awesome ipa.
Simply an amazing beer
"L: Clear, light blonde, low head, slight lacing"
Ballast Point Brewing Company - Sculpin. 7% ABV. 12oz bottle split between two snifters.
Awesome
"Broke, I squirishly gathered enough coins for a bottle from the bodega down the street. I selected a Sculpin from thier sparse array. Walking home, a white cat with sickly yellow eyes glared at me from behind a glass door."
Ballast Point Sculpin.
"An oldie but a goodie. Light amber color, soft white head. Aroma is tropical, this was one of the first ipas that started to deliver that mango aroma. Throw in some peach for good measure."
"Starts off with a great smell of hops and fruit. Incredibly well balanced IPA, so many citrus and fruit flavors but none overwhelms. Moderate bitterness, just a terrific IPA."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep gold bordering on a pale orange amber producing 2+ fingers of frothy, variously bubbled, moderately lasting, white head that leaves a nice coating of lace. Aroma is pine resin, grapefruit pith & zest, pineapple, orange, peach & sweet caramel. Taste is grapefruit, pine, juniper, pineapple, peach, sweet & bready cobbler pie dough, vanilla & a hint of honey with the sweeter portions mid-sip through the finish. Aftertaste is bitter grapefruit & pine. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slick & wet in the mouth, drying after the swallow,medium-high carbonation with a high octane peppery prickle. Absolutely delightful!"
Just doesn't do it for me. I prefer the smell and taste associated with the pine and citrus of New England IPA's
"orange color, nice foamy head"
Dark copper-tan...clear and a nice medium to full body
"If only this stuff wasn't so overpriced, I would have nothing but Sculpin in my fridge. The amount of bitter hoppiness isn't overwhelming and perfectly complimented with the fruity and tropical flavors. Everything in this brew is in perfect harmony with each other."
Very creamy smooth like a nitro. Super tasty .
Great beer! Too bad is now a Costallation brand
"Dark gold body with lingering white head, plenty of lacing. Medium mouthfeel, somewhat oily, with piney resinous hops that last and last."
Citrus notes all over the place with this one. A classic west coast IPA.
a perfect IPA!
Look: deep yellow with a lively white head. Great head retention. 
"Bottle poured into a snifter. Overall this is a solid IPA, with great taste and feel. The flavors consist of pine, citrus, floral hops, etc. The west coast hops are definitely prominent here. Solid offering from Ballast Point, well done! Cheers."
"Discovered the Sculpin line a month ago and it has rapidly become one of my favorite Crafties - if not my favorite. Fantastic aroma, taste, color-clarity-look, head and not super heavy. Very fine job putting this together."
A must buy every time I see it. I'd really hate to admit that a California IPA could beat our Washington
"L (4.5) - I really like the color of this one, a bit more amber than some IPA's. A little bit of very white foam, but dissipates quickly."
good IPA deferentially top 10 in my log
"A: Fruity, citrusy hops upfront, followed by some malt presence. "
Poured from a bottle into a DFH IPA glass.
"12oz bottle dated ""16062"" poured into a Funky Buddha pint/shaker L: clear golden hue with a half finger of head streaky lacing and sporadic bubbles S: dank onion pineapple and mango T: sweet citrus and pineapple followed by onion and a bitter finish F: medium creamy and smooth O: really good IPA that lives up to the hype. Right on par with Stone ""Enjoy By XX-XX-XX"", but more readily available."
Just a solid IPA!
"Pours amber gold with a creamy white foam head. Smells slightly malty with bitter citrus rind, floral tropical fruit, and herbal grassy pine. The taste is fruity and malty with some floral tropical notes, bitter citrus rind, and herbal grassy pine. It's bitter but not overdone. Moderate carbonation and a medium body give it a nice feel. Overall a good, bitter, hoppy IPA that could be just a bit more flavorful."
"Pretty awesome beer, hoppy and bitter but with a mild /crisp aftertaste. Well balanced, and just delicious. I am looking forward to trying the grapefruit"
"I hate to call this a typical IPA, but it kinda is. Looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and is loaded with tasty hops like a duck...."
355ml Can from Brewdog online shop (£3.50):
"So to date this is my favorite IPA but preface that I haven't had anything from the northeast and many of the heavy hitters from the west coast so take this for what it is. Beautiful crisp reddish,orange pale hue. Super fresh refreshing citrus smell. A crisp grapefruit taste that I love. It's funny because I am not a fan of the grapefruit sculpin as I feel it takes the grapefruit over the top too much. Good beer"
Enjoyed in Vegas.
Pours a clear light Amber. Has a piny citrus aroma. Has a pine flavor with a background of citrus peel. Leaves a mild bitter citrus aftertaste. Very nice well balanced IPA overall.
"Canned on Aug 11, 2015 so it's a little over 2 months old. Served cold."
"I absolutely Love this Ipa! Pours a solid creamy orange color with finger amount of farm house white head. Thin lacing but it sticks around for awhile. Smells of citrus fruits fell the nose along with pine and the taste to follow! Citrus, pine and hoppy, mmm Mmm good! Great brew from Ballast Point of out San Diego Ca."
"L: Bright yellow-copper, clear and lively with carbonation. BEAUTIFUL frothy head. Head dissipates at a moderate rate leaving just a bit of lacing."
Not awful but not great. Don't get the hype. Not a lot of flavor outside of the hops.
Poured a vibrant copper color with a finger white head and good lace retention. The aroma had more of a malt smell to it than a hop smell. Some orange aroma to it but in the end the malts dominate. The taste is similar to the smell with some bitterness to it. It has a sticky feel to it as the lacing would suggest. I would consider it very good but not spectacular.
"L orange, slightly hazy. Frothy head"
"7% ABV, 70 IBU, 650ml bottle."
"Not sure if this was an old bottle or not but was extremely disappointed with this one. Malt bomb with a strange aftertaste. The grapefruit version is a step up. I wish ballast point put bottling dates since I can't be completely sure. At any rate, wouldn't spend my money on this again."
Great balance of piney and grapefruit notes with malt sweetness. Slides down at 7 ABV like silk. Bit of a premium price but a reasonable occasional 'treat'. Great job by San Diego brewer!
"Second tasting in june '16, a bit old (5 months old)"
"Solid IPA. Has all the qualities you want from an IPA, but the taste isn't there for me. Pours well, good head and has a good, hearty feel. I enjoyed my 5g keg but I'll stick with the cans going forward."
This was my first IPA. I will not drink anything that isn't an IPA. The taste is consistent front start to finish.
"Fantastic IPA. Smells of pineapple and grapefruit. Tastes like biting into a very ripe grapefruit at first, then the well-balanced barley hits your palate. This is a perfect representation of an American IPA."
"Very vibrant, clean taste. Enjoyable to drink, makes you look forward to the next sip. Delicious to drink."
"I'm way in the minority on this, and I know it. Sculpin IPA in my opinion is an unpleasant ale that I won't willingly drink again. I'm not going to drink Bud Black Crown again either unless it's forced on me by circumstances, but I have to admit I would probably enjoy Black Crown more. I respect Ballast Point, but they've gone for the unpleasant aromas and flavors that I find in some IPAs. I don't care for it, that's all. Imho, Sculpin is a fishy IPA. Completely overrated. Many better choices."
"Just a delicious West Coast IPA. Not sure that the $70 case price (on the East Coast) is justified when I can buy a Lagunitas IPA for $40 a case, but Sculpin is a freaking delicious beer that is well crafted and I like to have a few in the fridge at all times, and there are times when I open the fridge, see it, and smile. On draft, it is smooth and so very drinkable!"
12oz can.
"Look - poured an copper color, with a one finger off white head...nice lacing"
"It's a good basic west coast ipa, with a pretty hefty malt base that once was legendary and now is just average. I think it deserves it's place on the hall of fame list but it is no longer one of the best 250 beers. Lagunitas, Sculpin, and standard ipas are not the overly aromatic juice bombs that everyone looks for now"
Does the world really need another Sculpin review? Absolutely not. But.
"This is my go to beer. I love it on tap, in the bottle or in a can."
Poured from a can 
Very happy but sweet :-D
Poured from a can into a tulip
"I have had it on tap and from the bottle. Similar tasting experience. Lots of hop flavors throughout, while staying smooth even with quite a bite from all those hops. No malt noticed. If you like hops, this is excellent. But as another reviewer noted, there are other very good IPAs that will cost a lot less."
"bought as a single serve establishment in a train station, payed $8 for one! expected alot for $8 needed alot for $8, drank out of bottle, beer had a steady hop balance, on this particular drink tasted as a straight IPA, not much on additional flavoring but again drank from bottle with bag wrapped around. this is limiting no doubt, this was however very pricey"
"What a delicious brew! This beer is very close to my favourite IPA (Fat Tug) in taste, aroma and feel. More head, retention, lacing and paler colour though. Living in British Columbia (Canada), I have a much greater accessibility tot he Fat Tug and don't have to pay as much for it. The Sculpin cost me 23.50$ CAN for a six pack. Never paid that much for a beer but I really wanted to try it because of its great reviews. Now I see why, it is in fact one of the greatest IPA's I had the opportunity to drink."
Nice clear gold orange pour with tight-bubbled head. 
Appearance - This poured a nice brownish-orange in color with a white head that rose up nicely and left some good lacing.
"Refreshing like drinking a cold glass of lemonade or sweet tea in a hit Georgia summers day. I typically give average smell rating for beers as I'm never impressed but here I am. Small fluffy head. Nice orange Amber color. Not bitter, more hops. I feel there is one more character of hops the beer should have(something bolder) but it is great the way it tastes now."
"Look and smell were a little underwhelming, but taste more than made up for it. A little disappointed how the linger went away so quickly, but then was pleasantly surprised as to how it returned. One of the more enjoyable IPA's I've had, but at $16.00 for a six pack of 12 ounce bottles, I will stick with those other few I enjoy as much, but whose price is easier to swallow."
"Very solid IPA and very drinkable, other than that, did not really blow me away like I thought it would. Very drinkable but definitely had better."
Very well balanced with clean finish.
L -- Pours a coppery-gold with a fair white head that reduces to a ring around the edge. Slight lacing at first. 
poured a darker orange into the glass with two fingers of foam that lingered
"One of the best IPAs I've ever tasted. A mouthful of flavor. First tried at the Yard House in West Palm Beach. If there is a perfect beer, this is close."
"A very approachable IPA for amount of hop it carries, with lots of depth of flavour and a very dry finish."
Good IPA from San Diego. Had it at my cousin's wedding. Very refreshing.
"This slightly hazy, slightly sparkling pale-amber beer briefly sports a medium, slightly pebbly white head that leaves fair rafts and ladders of lacing. On the nose, it presents a good blend of strong citrus and pine, with less intense florals and a hint of pineapple. The flavor hops follow the aroma, with pine and a moderately-bitter citrus sitting atop a solid slightly-sweet bready malt foundation. The finish is slightly bitter, followed by the onset of a clinging hop bitterness that is moderate for the style both in terms of intensity and duration. Mouthfeel is a bit bigger than one might expect, and the texture is moderately creamy and peppery from the fizzy carbonation. (12 oz can, 58 days after pkg.)"
"Very well done IPA. Piney nose, golden clear in color, and very tasty. I love all the new iterations of they are releasing as well. Grapefruit Sculpin has become a favorite of mine."
From a 12oz bottle.
"pours nice clear amber with small thick white head for an ipa, smells of wet citrusy dank cedar major grapefruit slight apricot, tastes of bitter piney grapefruit hops slight roastiness in the background, mouthfeel is smooth not incredibly thick with moderate carbonation and a dry finish."
"Cloudy orange-yellow color. Not overly bitter like most IPAs makes it fairly easy to drink. Slight after-taste, but nothing really bad about it. Overall a good beer."
Bomber with code 15091 poured into a pint glass.
Serving: Can into tulip
This beer really surprised me in a good way. Its seems to get its due respect here but in my circle most had given it a thumbs down. I'm with the thumbs up crowd on this one. Very nice citrus note. Its pours light and drinks easy. Not the smoothest beer but very flavorfull. Definitly a beer better enjoyed in the summer. Its the summer ale of IPAs. Well done Ballast Point.
"Underwhelmed. Traded for this with a Gray Sail Brewing Captain's Daughter. Granted, the Sculpin had been sitting in a hot car over the weekend, therefore I want to give it another shot ASAP."
"Poured into trusty glass mug. Slightly cloudy amber colour with quickly dissipating white head. Smells of smooth hops with a hint of citrus. The taste is an excellent balance of hops, slight citrus, and just enough piney/grassy to compliment. Goes down easy. This has got to be one of the best Cali IPA's out there. I love it."
"Pours a hazy golden, with a relatively small head. "
"This only recently came into distribution here in Maine, and I was hooked immediately. Crisp and hoppy, but rounded with a dry citrus taste. This has become my go to IPA in a six pack, 12 oz. cans available too, perfect for summer outings. Fantastic."
"I know this beer is supposed to be one of the better IPA's out there, and I would agree to some extent. It is nicely balanced for an IPA - just hoppy, piney, and citrusy enough. But I wasn't necessarily overwhelmed with it. It was a good IPA but I think I'm to the point where I'm at IPA overload and can only tell if an IPA is bad."
Lights Out and Very Smooth but HOPPY IPA
This is probably the best go-to beer at the gas station. Widely distributed and always consistent on taste. A bit malty for my liking but definitely one of the best dollar values in the craft.
"A 22 fl oz bomber with a bottled code date of 15063 which means 4th March 2015, and poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
"This IPA smells so good, easy to drink, smells like a citrusy, clean, top notch IPA! Lots of IPA under my belt, this ones the best!"
"Wow. Where to begin. The latest in my IPA taste comparison (bottles). Heads and shoulders above any others I've tried. Amazing from first sip to finish. Deep gold with clear, subtle carbonation. Piney citrus hops presence in the nose and a rich malt backbone. The flavors mixed and mingled on the tongue in a way that I couldn't wait for the next sip to see how it would taste. Excellent American IPA. Definitely recommending this and drinking it again."
"Great IPA, good taste and feel. Pine, citrus, herb, floral hops are all well represented, Malt is subtle, the hops are center stage per west coast style. Good depth of flavor and great all round example of the style."
Really liked this one. Hoppy with noticeable notes of grapefruit. Pours dark amber. Very drinkable. Worth picking up a 6.
Really nice and refreshing grapefruit-forward IPA
I think I liked the grapefruit a little more
"Quintessential West Coast IPA. Pungent hop nose, deft mix of citrus/herbal dankness/perhaps pine, though contrary to common assumption, the malt is clearly there too - clean, somewhat sweet, pleasant. Palate is citrus, pine, and a fine dose of bitterness, though certainly nothing overwhelming. This is bracing, refreshing, so clean and satisfying."
"Nice citrus-forward hop nose. Not what I'd call complex, but somewhat rounded and not overly one-dimentional. Palate follows the nose, but with some added malt depth. Not a malty IPA by any means, but enough of a backbone. "
This was poured into a pint glass.
Based off day old memories.
Excellent refreshing almost fruity IPA. I taste much citrus tones. Their grapefruit Sculpin must be really citrus tasting. Excellent warm weather brew.
Delicious and light. Many citrus notes. Sneaky ABV
Nice floral smell gives way to sweet hoppy goodness
Revisited 9/20/18
"I Remember the first time I Tried Sculpin..and Swear I almost Cried, it was very Hard to hold back the Tears of JOY and Pure Enjoyment,every drink Brings New Flavors and taste""s ,First and foremost Grapefruit,and it's rind,then Mango,another Sip and BAM! Pineapple hits you,then other Citrus flavors come into play,then a slight Pine flavor and a bit of bitterness.....I do Love My fruity IPA's,and this one Here is THE Best I have had to date,Magical stuff and Top Notch Quality,Cheers!"
"Pours a beautiful orange, amber color. Head retention is decent at best but there is nice lacing. Im getting floral hops along with citrus on the nose. Grapefruit is apparent. Taste is incredibly balanced. Citrus hops followed by a more herbal, grassy bitterness that is not too overpowering. Each sip leaves you desiring more."
Refreshing and all around great ipa. Falls somewhere between session and dipa
"Darker yellow look and clear. Had a slight citrusy smell but more malty. The first taste was great. Citrusy and maybe even some grapefruit. After that nothing special. More malt. The mouth feel is ok. Not watery. Overall it's an ok ipa. Maybe a real fresh one would be different. Don't get the hype. For the price, $14.99 for a sixer, I won't have anymore. It's not throw away."
"Bought a single bottle from Beers of the World on 8/1/15 from Beers of the World. Served cold in a Duvel tulip. Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Hazy apricot, white head, nominal lacing. Aroma is a masterful blend of pine and citrus zest. Flavor is so restrained, balanced, perfect. Mouthfeel is superb. This is pretty close to perfect."
"Nice hoppy bite, mostly grapefruit with a bit of orange rind. Very enjoyable but like many good IPAs/APAs I didn't really think it lived up to the hype."
"The look is ok, light orange/yellow hue. The smell is bursting with fresh citrus. Easy drinker, quick hoppy flavor up front that dissipates fairly quickly. The feel is slightly carbonated and thirst quenching. I would say this is good beer for a hot and humid New England day. Not my favorite, but definitely in the normal rotation at my house. Cheers!"
"Pours a very clear, coppery-amber color, with a decent, stable head."
"Bottle. Pours slightly hazy golden with small white head. Aroma is hoppy and fruity, grassy, citrus, earthy, honey, slight soap. Taste is slightly sweet and medium bitter, citrus, pine, grass, fruity, peaches. Medium body. Bitter finish."
Pours perfect clear Amber. Smells juicy like grapefruit and mango. Taste is sweet malt balanced out by some Citrusy notes. Good mouthfeel. Really a solid perfectly balanced beer.
"Can dated 15135 (May 15, 2015). Boston Shaker at World of Beer."
Bought 6pk in cans . Hazy orange/gold color with medium head that settles to thin coat of lacing in my DFH chalice.
12 oz. bottle poured into tulip 
L: Light amber/dark orange.
Old trusty never fails
"12oz can with 11/5/15 code date. Appearance: Golden and slightly hazy, with a thick white foam cap. Aroma: Intense mix of melon, grapefruit, pineapple, grass, and resin. Taste: Light bready malt that quickly turns to sharp bitterness and dank, resinous, earthy hop flavors. Grapefruit and grassiness is there, but very low. Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with a medium-high carbonation Finish: Seems to balance well on the finish, with only a slight lingering bitterness. It does leave a sticky resin on the tongue. Overall: Well done west coast IPA that has a great aroma, with a dominant hop bitterness that doesn’t overpower thru the finish. Fairly light malt base that let’s the hops shine but still remains balanced."
"Super clean, love the hops!"
Poured from bomber to pub pint glass
"One of the smoothest beers on the market. My girlfriend doesn't like beer, but she loves this one. It's pricey, but you won't regret trying it!"
"Really good ipa with a touch of apricot. Was drinking founders all day iPa back to back and it actually tasted like all day had more abv%, which has 4.7% compared to sculpin at 7%. Great beer but so expensive."
Had draft at chesters. Good all around.
may well be the finest readily available hop forward san diego style out there. the epitome of it's style really.
Grapefruit taste is not overpowering; solid offering.
"This is a truly solid IPA, especially when you find it fresh."
Beautiful look to it with a solid 2 finger creamy head and some good lacing. Immediate juicy grapefruit smell with a grapefruit / citrusy taste up front with a piney/resiny taste in the back. Good mouthfeel and goes down as smooth as can be. A staple beer for any IPA drinker.
Flavor is nice but fades quickly nice carbonation
A favorite crisp and full bodied IPA.
12oz can served in a pint glass
Hands down my favorite IPA. Yes even better than Pliney
"Quintessential American IPA. It is hoppy, complex, layered, refreshing and balanced. The aromatics found are what you'd find in a traditional American IPA. In summary, it is the traditional made very, very well."
"Excellent beer, refreshing IPA beer"
This is a great go to beer for any occasion. The fact that it is that accessible any time of year and this good is a plus for craft beer drinkers!
"Had it plenty of times. Even when fresh and from a can, it's just nothing spectacular when compared to a lot of IPAs. Definitely a great beer but it's not a 100."
"Bought a 6 pack in cans from specs in Ft.Worth.Popped the top and right away I could smell this beer.Nose was grapefruit and some citrus and kinda faint pine.Taste was not bad at all,piney grapefruit with a nice bitter finish.Glad I got these.Prost!"
Best readily available IPA out there. Best consumed as fresh as possible. I prefer mine out of the can.
"Much like Daniel from Green Eggs & Ham, I could enjoy Ballast Point’s Sculpin IPA in a box with a fox, in a house with a mouse, on tap, in a can, from a bottle, ON A BOAT, and theoretically, in any which way it was presented to me. In honor of this San Diego brewery’s affinity for naming beers after sea life, though, I’ve decided to take this particular tasting nautical (Longfin Lager, Wahoo White, Calico Amber, and Black Marlin Porter are just a few of its other marine-inspired classics)."
Real nice IPA. Clean crisp refreshing aftertaste. In Illinois this stuff costs $14/sixpack. Very good but not worth the do-re-mi.
"Good IPA, was hoping for something more."
My fave IPA. 
"As Bill and Ted might remark... ""This beer is most excellent!"" I have tried a lot of IPAs, and this one is near the top of the class. First beer I've had from this brewer. It cost a pretty penny (so my lady friend says), but appears to be worth the extra nickels."
This IPA has it all. This is a sure thing if you like true West Coast style IPAs.
"First BA review! Still developing a taste for IPAs, but I have to say this is the smoothest one yet. Doesn't have that bite of a Stone or a DF 60 min. Goes down smooth and has just enough taste to let you know its an IPA! Poured out of a bomber into a 23oz pilsner! Easy to drink, so be careful!"
"Great standard IPA. A little syrupy. Nothing to wow me, but packs a solid punch."
"Very solid standard IPA. Nothing special about it, very good taste."
"Looks like an IPA, amber, great white lacing and a finger of foam. Nose and flavor are well balanced, nice drying hops with a fair bit of fruit and a touch of caramel malt. Really good flavor, almost stereotypically what I think of when I think of an IPA. It's a great brew, on par with a lot of very good ones: Two Hearted, 60 Minute, Titan, etc. Seems like maybe the hype train got a little out of control with this one, but as I said, definitely a tasty everyday beer. Very happy it's started to show up all over the East Coast."
Great go to everyday drinker.
12 ounce bottle served in a pint glass.
"Not bad. Great smell, good taste. Would buy again."
Beautifully fluffy white head sits atop a glass of transparent liquid glowing gold. 
Very delicious IPA With fruity start
My favorite IPA. So damn tasty.
Pour: 12oz bottle into a nonic pint. Appearance: Clear and light amber in color. Thick which head present with lacing on the glass. Aroma: Very hoppy and floral. Taste: Clean with a bitter hop bite. Aftertaste: consistent flavor quality all the way through to the end. Overall: Consistent and enjoyable. I will be back. Very good: 4 out of 5.
"L -- Thick white head with a golden color, somewhat hazy. "
"Pours a transparent gold color with an inch of coarse, white suds. Aroma smacks of fresh squeezed ruby red grapefruit and little else; maybe a hint of honey-like sweetness sneaks through."
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Just awesome.
Great west coast style IPA
Poor man's Cigar City Jai Alai imo
"This is a solid IPA for sure. Very easy to get, and very consistent. Pours nice and clear with a nice one finger head into my glass. Great IPA for an early evening in hot weather. A little too much bitterness at the finish."
This is a great beer
"Hype! Hype! Git'cher hype right here! Well, if you have the bollocks to back it up, then I say holler the F away. You earned it. You see, what we have right here is a tasty little blend of citrus-i-nessed-up hop cones of love, swirled in a mildly malty, yet high booze content-laden brew decanted into a proper glass for pure pleasure results - every time. And if you have read any of my other plugs, it also comes in a fricken 6-pack. Thank you Ballast."
Probably the best readily obtainable IPA out there.
this is a deliciously standard IPA that only distinguishes itself by being perfect at everything.
"Golden color with a 2 finger high, white, head. "
Poured from 12 oz. bottle to pint glass.
The beer gods hath rejoiced at this marvel of modern day brewing genius.
A classic. Delightful. So good on tap.
"12 oz. bottle into a tulip. Pours a crystal-clear amber with nearly 3 fingers of white, sticky foam. Tropical fruit, citrus, pine, and bubblegum on the nose. Very sweet tropical fruit and floral notes up front on the taste. Medium-light weight, and a very creamy and crisp mouthfeel. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and banana all present up front, with a biscuity-malt settling in middleways. Finishes as creamy as ever, and produced a tingling hop bitterness on the finish. Tart fruit, pine, and hops on the aftertaste."
"An IPA lover's dream. Was fortunate enough to have this at a Padres game out in San Diego, and I was not disappointed. I'm back in Chicago now, and I miss it like I miss California."
"This is a world class Cali IPA. Get it in the can. Ballast Point is very proud of their beer, and for good reason, but you can't cop a six pack for less than 13 or 14 bucks."
12 oz. can
If you like IPA you like this.... The Iconic IPA.. not much better than this...
Like this IPA. very smooth
"Appearance: Clear dark gold with an off-white head that eventually faded, leaving little lacing."
Very good IPA. Hits all the right tasting notes.
"Great west coast IPA from Ballast Point Brewery, but I spoiled myself by tasting the grapefruit and habanero versions of this beer before trying the original. Lots of hops and bitter citrus ofruit on this one. Nice light amber color poured into a pint glass with great head and heavy lacing. This is an amazing brew, but for me with the added grapefruit or spicy heat to the special variants, they are both favorite flavors of mine already so it makes it hard to ever get around to drinking the original."
I went in thinking that this has got to be over rated. It is not. It's a great beer. One of the best beers I have ever had. The problem is that it is always 7.99 and that is a lot. Port brewing is almost as good and nowhere near as much money.
Solid IPA that's widely available. Nice citrusy hoppy nose with a crisp body and lingering bitter finish.
Out of a bottle on 6-1-15. 
Favorite... One of my favorite IPAs
So much flavor...great when its fresh!!
"Decent, but overrated. Bitterness has an unpleasant quality to it."
"Very hoppy on the front and back end. Grapefruit, lemon aromas and tastes. Bitterness lingers. Solid mouthfeel that keeps the bitter notes"
"I'll always appreciate Sculpin as the first West Coast style IPA that I really enjoyed and, more importantly, appreciated for its balance of fruit and hop bitterness. I'm now able to drink so much great, fresh, local IPA's that I don't purchase Sculpin that often. But when I do, it's like an old friend."
Floral and fruity notes big but not quite imperial hop character. Accessible but far from compromising IPA
Appearance - Gold/Copper/Inviting
Excellent IPA. One of my top 10 go to IPAs.
"Nice light golden color, great feel all the way through. Very nice citrussy aroma, clean crisp taste. I really enjoyed this one."
"Can. Had this on tap and it wasn't as impressive. Good bitterness. Oily yet dry. Grapefruit notes with nectarine. Average but very drinkable. Won't buy again due to the big price tag. Available IPA's similar to Sculpin in my area for $5 less per six pack. That's something you can't deny, especially if you have local IPA's that have similar taste profiles with comparable abv."
"When you think you have tasted the best IPA, try this."
"Lots of flavors of pine, citrus and hops. Bold taste all the way through."
Definitely an above average IPA!
"Wow, a really great IPA! Citrus bomb that smells and tastes awesome!"
"Had a six pack of bottles, purchased in San Clemente. Very nice IPA. Citrus smells, lovely color. Nice hop taste with overtones of grapefruit. Very nicely balanced IPA."
Very tasty. Great amount of hoppiness and backbone to carry it. Not sure why it's so dang expensive though.
"Bomber. Very nice floral and citrus nose. Taste is lightly sweet malts followed by light citrus and floral hops, and are then overwhelmed by hoppy piney bitterness. Pretty full body for an IPA, and a good bit of carb. This drinks more like a DIPA, and I'm not a big fan of bitter piney hops in my beer. Nicely balanced, but not my favorite take on an IPA. I would love to try it on tap to see how the hop profile differs. Similar to torpedo from what I remember, although maybe a bit more complex."
"Good lord. I first had a Sculpin IPA about two years back. Ballast Point has made one of the better IPAs I've ever had. A little heavier than comparitive IPAs but worth it for the ABV and myriad of tastes. The body is much lighter than you'd expect; caramel or burnished bronze, the aroma is fruity and pleasant. Carbonation isnt too high so the head--even on a bad pour--is pretty low."
"Hard to beat, one of the best IPAs out there"
"I drunk this straight from the bottle, so unsure what the liquid looks like. Can't say much about how it pours or how the head is, so i'm just going to skip right to smell."
Revisited 5/13/16. Lite gold/amber pour with white/off white head. Hoppy citrus nose. Hoppy lemon and stone fruit (apricot) flavors; bitter grapefruit zest finish. Medium lite mouthfeel. Overall excellent easy drinking well balanced IPA with long lasting bitter citrus linger.
"Great, balanced IPA. Just the right sweetness too balance the hops. May be the ideal IPA."
"Yeah it's alright. Looks pretty thin. Not too much of a head. Aroma is amazing. Taste...well...More of a sipper. Drink too big of a swig and it tastes like cough syrup. I think it's a decent IPA and I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't have it again. Now Big Eye IPA, that one is killer."
"Amber color with a fluffy white head. Massive citrus and tropical fruit aroma. Light caramel malts keep the balance towards the hops. Medium bodied. A light, fruity, juicy, and bitter IPA."
"Long sought after and scored some for my birthday. Well worth the wait (for fresh) and the price, $15 a 6 pack. Hard to drink others having this one."
Fantastic IPA! The gateway beer to hop addiction!
"Middle of the road. Good nose, decent taste. Not what I expected given all I've heard about it."
"velvety mouthfeel, healthy lacing. Huge citrus aroma with a warmer finish. Taste is as close to palate perfect for me. Lives up to the 13.99 price tag."
"Had on-tap at the Main Street pub in Bally, PA - poured into a tulip glass."
One of my favorite beers.
Poured my first Sculpin from a 22 Oz bottle into a hotel 10 Oz plastic cup. It was wonderful. It is even better with real glassware! Excellent beer.
"Tastes hoppy and SALTY, not good."
Found this at the local liquor store--very happy to see they've distributed into my neck of the woods. The bottling date states it was produced a little over 2 months ago. Poured right from a 12 oz glass in the fridge into a pint glass.
One of the most well rounded beers I've ever had
"Outstanding IPA. I consistently put this in the fridge. Goes well with everything and is always my ""go-to"" beer. Simply put it's just DAMN good!"
"I'm not a huge IPA fan, but this is a fantastic representation of the style"
"Nothing jumped out at me, not bad but not perfect beer to me"
"Spent a day in San Diego and found a place that served Sculpin. So when I got home I did a comparison between Sculpin and Racer 5 (a regular). Sculpin is clearer on pour, better foam action that lasts a long time. Sculpin has a more distinct hops smell and taste. Racer 5 is more full bodied - malty. Both not far apart. At 14.95 a 12 pack, you can't beat Racer 5. The little fish would be the catch of the day if the price came down without cutting quality."
"Overall a good IPA, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed after the hype."
There is an old light house that sits on top of Point Loma in San Diego that overlooks the bay and land in one direction and in the other direction overlooks the sea. This strip of land is ubiquitous when looking outward from the beaches and it towers over everything else in the area. This is literally/geographically and figuratively Ballast Point. Why write that about a beer? Because this IPA towers over everything else in it's category. Just flat out dynamite... 
"looks great, smells great, tastes great with a bitter after taste."
Smelled great soon as I opened the bottle. Strong hop flavor with some citrus and solid bitterness. Really tasty and one of the best smelling beers I've had. For me this is the model for an IPA. One of my favorites. yb
L:
Bomber into a pint glass.murky amber like color with brownish foamy head.citrus fruit peel like flavors that goes down nicely..Prost
"Pure transparent golden in color. NIce frothy head. Very hoppy aroma jumps out of the glass. Citrusy, resiny, fine hop smell."
Appearance: Pale gold
"L: pretty Amber-orange with a fluffy head that dissipates into a thin layer. S: hoppy peach and lemon a little apricot. T: same as the nose, with some citrus peel and pith. Pleasant lingering bitterness. Tasty."
Classic west coast ipa with flavorful citrus aroma and a hard smooth kick. Delicious
Solid IPA. Very drinkable and well balanced.
"An awesome beer. King of the readily available IPAs, possibly of all readily available beers, in Connecticut. Floral-y and Citrus-y as opposed to malty and spicy (like Founders Centennial or Dogfish 90min). Very refreshing and crushable in my opinion. I work at a liquor store with a great beet selection and its tough for me not to buy this every time."
"The only thing I don't like about the beer is the price. But with the taste, I can understand why it's pricier than other IPAs."
"Light honey color, clear but pours out of a 12oz bottle with virtually no head. Nice, effervescent mouth feel without too much fizz. Slight mango, pleasant smell. Taste is smooth. well blended, starting with citrus and then a clean dry finish. No flaws here and very nice but not especially interesting. I would happily drink again but at almost twice the price of some other IPAs I enjoy, will only do so when I am feeling flush."
Just had my first Sculpin. Wow. Top five IPA for me.
"Great IPA,the Grapefruit Sculpin is even better"
Lives up to the hype. If you haven't had this beer you need to.
Top 20 IPA I have had thus far in my beer career. Always a great choice if you have friends coming over who enjoy beer.
"I love the fact that this has gotten to be shelf beer. Some fresh Sculpin is always nice. A classic IPA. Back in '12, some friends and I had blind IPA taste testing, which included Pliny, and Sculpin won."
Not a big IPA guy but really thought it was good. Tried it on tap at Danny K's in Anaheim California
Smooth. Perfect balance. Hint of citrus w super clean finish. 97 outta 100
I had this in a pint glass during a 'tap takeover' at one of the craft brewer conference events. 
One if the best IPA's
Perfect. If i could have one beer for the rest of my life this is it.
"I've had this both on draft and in the bottle, and I just don't get the hype. It's good and I'd never turn one down if offered to me, but I must be missing something, as everyone else seems to absolutely love this beer."
Had off draft. Yes very good like most of their stuff. I wasn't blown away. I prefer grapefruit version
Classic West Coast IPA. Pours golden orange. Citrus and hops both in smell and taste. Crisp and delicious!
"Nice light gold color. Great hoppy nose. Very crisp and clean. Slightly sweet first taste. Finishes with a balanced bitter, hops flavor."
I'll never forget my first taste of Sculpin. It was a magical beer moment for me.
"Really impressive presentation at the new Ballast Point facility. Beautiful,big citrus hops with classic caramel malt backbone. Easy to see why this is so well regarded."
Served from a can into a snifter
"This beer is slightly underrated. I'd describe it as a highly drinkable IPA with flavor leaning heavily toward the citrus fruits department. I'm tasting lemons, grapefruits, oranges, tangerines, but not nectarines because those are not citrus. I'd give this a solid 4.5 at a minimum. People are saying that the beer has been outshined by newer ones but I doubt that..."
"Very good brew. Dark golden color with good head retention. Nice lacing left on glass. Smells of citrus, strong pine. Very light on the palate, with tastes of grapefruit, pine, maybe a little orange. Lightly carbonated mouth feel. Overall excellent."
"Light color, medium bodied with a good hoppy balance."
L- Golden orange
"Gold in color with tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Off white head that froths around the top and settles to a slight layer of bigger bubbles. Lacing is evident along the edges of glass as it slides down. Smell is of pine and some citrus is found in the background. Tastes of pine, grass, citrus and maybe some bitter hops are dancing on the tongue. Smooth on the palate and slightly creamy with the bitterness finishing it off. Overall, a fantastic IPA to indulge upon!"
"Pours a golden almost orange colour with a slightly beige finger thick head. Getting lots of citrus and tropical fruit, slightly piney hop notes and a pale maltiness on the nose. The taste, wow grapefruit, with a slightly syrupy honey sweetness. That pale malt comes through on the tongue as well. There is a nice hoppy bitterness that is present but doesn't overpower. The mouthfeel is in the medium range with the perfect amount if carbonation. A very tasty IPA."
"I thought this ale was okay but for the price I was expecting to be knocked out. In fairness it was about 10 or 11 months old, maybe that left it a bit flat in taste"
Awesome IPA! Great go to Beer!
"An excellent I.P.A. Strong piney smell, milder on the palate. Great all around."
"For a beer I can find almost anytime, it's rarely missing from my refrigerator. I know a lot of people won't agree with this, but I also prefer the taste from a can over a bottle (poured into a 12oz snifter."
Great beer. Everything a beer should be.
Fantastic tasting beer. The best I've ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&
"A: Medium gold. Brilliant clarity. Nice white head. A little underwhelming in the size, duration, lushness. Little lacing. "
Tell me what I'm doing wrong?
"One of the best, m"
"As far as west coast single IPAs that you can find on the shelf go, Sculpin is king. There just is not a better option. This beer has a huge citrus aroma, hops a-plenty yet still so smooth and balanced. As the glass goes down and the beer opens up a bit it just gets better and better. Had from a can today with the code 15050, so I think it means it was canned on the 50th day of 2015, so late February. Taste was superb, can't really find fault with Sculpin. This was my first IPA a bunch of years back when my buddy gave me a bomber, now it's a regular!"
Smoother IPA. Sufficient hoppiness. Pleasant aftertaste.
This is without question the go to IPA.
I am an IPA drinker mostly that is all I ever drink I just feel like I have had way better before just somthing about this beer never really made me want to go back out and drink it again
"Poured cold into a tulip glass. 7% ABV. Bottled on Feb. 26th, 2014, consumed on June 23rd."
Dee-licious. Best IPA I've had out of SD.
"A Solid offering. I am not a huge IPA guy, I'm a little burned out on the style. But this is pretty darn good. I have a few more in fridge. Perhaps I'll update this review after another brew."
Phenomenally interesting. Bright yet with depth and a pine finish.
"Awesome full-bodied IPA with an incredible citrus and floral aroma. Taste of orange, grapefruit, pineapple and slight lemon. Crisp taste and feel throughout and finishes with the perfect amount of bitterness that lingers but doesn't overstay its welcome. The malt provides a solid backdrop for the citrus and reigns in the flavors from becoming too fruity. A real gem that will always have a place in the fridge as my first craft beer love."
"Very good. Balanced. Nice citrus notes. I don't quite understand all the hype, but it is a very drinkable IPA while still having bold hop flavors."
Pours a clear dark gold with lots of bubble action. Cream colored head of about 1 finger dissipates slowly and leaves lots of sticky lacing behind. Continuous bubbles keep the head from completely disappearing.
"A: Clear, with a pronounced coppery color and a persistent, fluffy head. As the head recedes, it leaves thick lacing along the sides of the glass ."
"It's hard not to love Sculpin. An accomplished IPA which hits all the right notes. The can is more drinkable than it has a right to be, but I slightly prefer the bottle. A bit steep at (typically) $15 per sixpack, but a better value than most cheaper offerings. I have had a few slightly disappointing keg pours, though."
Nice smooth taste. Not overly hopped. Drinkable beer.
"I didn't want to believe the hype, as this is priced at $14.49 for a 6-pack (!) in WI where even the rest of Ballast Point's beers are usually under $10. However, one sip and it was clear that this is a world class beer worthy of its awards. Ballast Point recently came to WI, and I was excited to try their beers. Tried it on draft, and it was supremely balanced and well-crafted in every capacity. Not the most extreme IPA, but certainly not plain either. Plenty of citrus and pine hoppiness, but also fresh tasting; substantial without ever seeming too heavy. One of those IPAs that is just clearly above 95% of a very crowded market."
"I remember this being my first hoppy drink... Didn't like it... Now I can appreciate the bitterness and hops.. Can't have enough of these beers, another solid ballast point beer!"
Poured from a 12oz deeply chilled bottle into a room temperature pilsner glass. Beautiful golden orange hue with two full fingers of crisp sunshine colored head that lingered. Beautiful looking beer. Smells of citrus mainly apricots and peaches with a touch of mango. Hops are noted. Tastes much the same. True citrus dominated ipa. Really crisp with citrus fruits flavor and subtle hops. Not piney at all. Aftertaste is only slightly hoppy. Must try.
Wow wow wow. On tap at the Park House PIT. Refreshingly hoppy and has just the right amount of malt. A real treat of an ipa. Another winner from SAN.
a very solid and very good hop flavor.
"Blackthorn - San Francisco, CA - draft"
This is a solid beer but seems to get lost in the sea of solid IPA's for me. nothing not to like and really enjoyed it. it is lighter by design from brewers but hoped it would have a fuller mouthfeel. maybe the hype about it has let me down. not here to bash it just feel there is nothing that really jumps out at me that says unique or exceptional. 
Great beer. Has aromatics like Two Hearted and Lagunitas. Great price! Will drink many more.
Wonderful smooth IPA. Hints of grapefruit. Good crisp taste and color. Pricy but an excellent beer to be savored. Pure delicious.
"This beer is bright, clear, delicious IPA goodness!! It has such a smooth finish to it for a 7% IPA. The hops are fresh and full of citrus, pine, fresh cut grass and other herbal notes but the base malts come through clean and smooth too! Nice balance in this beer so I will purchase again."
Of course this beer is a great example of the style
"First sip at Manhattan Beach Bite at the Beach Summer 2014 with Andy, Theresa and Wyeth."
"Extremely balanced, excellent IPA. When people ask what an IPA should taste like, I point them to Sculpin."
I like it but it seems one dimensional to me. Leaves me wanting more
"A Fantastic beer,"
Keg of sculpin ipa drank.
Now this is a West Coast IPA!
Pours gold with floral aroma hops. Grapefruit bittering hops with a small amount of sweetness coming through from the malts.
"Huge head; semi-opaque golden hue; faintly citrus smell; silky and hefty mouthfeel for an IPA; oils are present, but cut by the alcohol; taste is balanced, rather light and not overly-complex. 7% ABV is very present. Pineapple and melon checked well by the hops."
Love love love it. My go to IPA. Very nice. Also who doesn't like beer with fish on it
Not bad ipa. Had in bottle but would recommend on a summer night
Don't get the buzz with this beer. Too pricey to boot.
Always order one when it is available
"Not sure where the hype around this one comes from. It's good. It's a very good IPA, but it's not some standout to my taste."
This beer was really crisp. It's also very fresh tasting. I'm a hop head and I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Its a little pricey but it's well worth the experience.
One of the best west coast IPA's...getting easier to find in the south east now!
"one of my favorites, though I think the price point is a little high. Would go with Hop Nosh if I have the option."
Only ever had it in Draft but It's a great IPA and available in a lot of bars which is always nice.
This is my go to beer.
Have had it many times just now rating it. Overall good. Def west cost dry hoppy taste. Having it in draft and enjoying it.
In my top 5 that are available year round. Delicious. Dank. Cheers
Great!!! Delicious beer! VeryVery Favorite beer
"Aroma is a Hawaiian plantation (think pineapple) and a Florida citrus grove (think tangerine). Fluffy head and golden malt color. Flavor is coarse hops, citrus rind, and a touch of dank sativa (though not like the rank, dank sativa flavor of Fat Head's IPA). Bitter finish. Great West Coast IPA, a terrific ambassador of this style of ale. Alcohol is well-hidden."
"this one was really nice and smelled amazing, but I actually preferred the Grapefruit Sculpin. Just a personal preference."
The best IPA ever made by homo sapiens.
Great taste and aroma! Very good beer!
"Crisp, definitely has hops. Top of my IPA list"
Wonderful nose and amazingly smooth
"Just thought this was average....only sampled in a flight, so will try again in the future."
My rating of 3.52 is true and correct
One of the best IPA's I've had to date.
The best beer I have ever had.
"Never heard of this brewery on the east coast, but was intrigued when I saw it on the menu and read such positive reviews on here. Did not disappoint. Very impressed for a 7.5 at how drinkable it was."
"The price is what gets me, it's nothing special at all and it is ridiculously expensive, it's just a basic tasting IPA, I don't recommend it"
"Great beer, my new favorite. A little bit of citrus, smooth and not over powering bitterness."
Lovely aroma and a smooth finish.
"I caught the apricot more than anything, besides the usual hops bitterness, which comes in mostly on the back-end. A little orange peel and general citrus bite in there as well. A fairly smooth IPA, reminds me a little of two hearted in the sense that it isn't brutally hop bitter but has that punch softened by some nice fruit bounciness."
"3/11/15 (Draft, revisited) at Lucille's BBQ in Long Beach. Great balance, citrusy smell, hemp/earthy hop underneath. Nice dryi finish. Classic west coast IPA. 4.25"
"Pretty, golden brown, unfiltered. Fine, light head, good persistence."
"Very floral. Complex. Better near the end than the beginning. I don't love it as much as others, but not bad at all."
"Really good, glad I tried it, not sure how much I will buy it with the options I have around here"
"Really great beer, but very expensive."
Just an okay ipa imo
One of my top 5 IPA choices
Exceptional west coast IPA....but the Grapefruit version is better by far
"Love this beer. The smell is crisp, piney, and fruity. Huge hops on the taste upfront, followed by tons of grapefruit and then a nice blend of danky, fruity bitterness. Pine tree and grapefruit juice. When fresh, this beer is up there with the bests."
"Overall awesome IPA, great flavor, looks good. Very happy"
Tons of flavor out of this one. Great color and very crisp. Looking forward to my next two.
"For the past few months, I get out to San Diego for business and stop by Ballast Point Brewing Company (a friend told me to go there and boy am I glad I listened to him!). He told me to get the Sculpin IPA and I love it right out of the tap. Great look, smells hoppy and the taste is outstanding! Found it back home in Illinois now and have the spread the word about this yummy brew!!"
"Gateway beer for those who don't like IPAs. Very fresh, drinkable but with lots of flavor."
"Very good hints of all the flavors. Mango, peach and lemon."
"One of the few best examples of an IPA. It hits all the right notes, stings when it's supposed to, is fruity and wonderful at the right points as well."
one of the best IPA in the mkt
"Appearance: Amber-orange color, clear. Nice two finger, thick white head, nice lacing"
If you love spicy this is a great sipper. Had it on tap at O.C. which was perfect becuase one is just right!
"Honestly, I heard a lot about this beer so I ran to the nearest store to grab a 6er. I was quite disappointed. It's very pungent for an IPA."
"Pale orange in color, smells of mild grapefruit and floral aroma, bitter/spicy like aftertaste with mild carbonation. Goes down smooth. It's very good, but the grapefruit sculpin is better."
One of my favorite year round IPAs.
"great IPA, cant go wrong with this. Very smooth"
"I poured my beer into a pint glass, which poured smooth with little foam/head. The golden body and citrus and hops smell seems light and aromatic."
Way too piney.
I can quickly think of five lesser ranked beers that taste better than this.
"Awesome IPA base then add habanero peppers. Huge Chile flavor with enough spice to make it interesting. Pair it with tacos, and it makes perfect sense. It's definitely not a beer you can drink all day, but one you must try if you love spice."
Fantastic smooth taste in every bottle. Highly recommend!!
Fan frickin tastic! Very sessionable.
"For some reason, the first time I tried this beer. I didn't like it at all..... Then I had a Grapefruit Sculpin and loved that!! So then I had a Habanero Sculpin and I really liked that. So then I went to Buffalo Wild Wings and had a Sculpin IPA on tab and loved it!! Go figure...."
"I mean, is a review really needed at this point? This is a world class IPA that will stand the test of time. Enough said."
One of the best year round IPA's!
Everything an IPA should be. Great flavor
Exceptionally smooth IPA. Great floral aroma and great tasting finish.
One of the great beers!
"Poured from 12 oz can into std pint glass. Nice full fluffy head with medium retention. Very sticky lacing. For me this is a fantastically balanced IPA with notes of pine and citrus in the aroma. The flavor follows beautifully. Just a hint of astringent bitterness on the back of the palate but overall nice balanced mouthfeel. This has been in my regular rotation since I first tasted it. Very disappointed when I get an old bottle or a low turnover draft (I know, how could a keg of this last too long?). Lives up to the hype."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It was beautiful straight out of the bottle. Perfect amount of head, that left lacing around the edge. The smell was a mix of hops, pine, and citrus. Taste was a bit stronger than the actual IBU listing would suggest but was still fantastic. This beer is damn near perfect."
From 22oz bomber with best by date of 8/25/20. Grapefruit and licorice aromas. Creamy head with good lacing. Citrusy start with bitter hop finish.
A: Big white soapy looking head with mixed sized bubbles that sustains for daaays. Spotty lacing as it recedes sticks to the edge of the glass until the beer is gone. Crystal clear pale orange color. Beautiful looking beer
"Pours a deep golden hue with a two finger bright white head. The smell is a citrus bouquet. You get grapefruit, lemon, kumquat, tangerine. There is also apricot and a hint of peach, plus mild spicy notes. Quite delicious. The flavor follows the nose pretty closely, but it has a faint earthiness, reminiscent of English ipa. This is am no the best single ipas I have tasted. I continue to return for more."
Very pretty copper color.
"Yeah, it's good. Very good. No, excellent. But, 10,777 people rate it a 98? I don't see it."
How did the Bros. rate this above Heady Topper?!
"Great beer, taste is solid, great balance of flavors. After bite is perfect, such a smooth beer - on my top 5 list."
Look - 12 oz bottle into a tulip - pours a beautfiul Texas burnt orange with a big fluffy white head that leaves solid lacing. very good looking beer.
"Tasty, but quite to overrated West Coast IPA."
Great look great taste. .. Definite winner
"22oz bomber: This one pours a fairly clear, slightly orangish color. There was a pretty good sized head on it that left some lacing. Nice nose to this one. Pine, earthiness and a hint of grapefruit are the main aromas. Maybe some faint caramel malts and other fruits mixed in. The taste is good. An excellent combination of the different hops. Nice amount of bitterness to it. No residual sweetness from the malts. A very nice IPA."
"The IPA that changed my mind about IPAs. The smell, the taste, the feel, everything about Sculpin is near perfect !! Pine, citrus, hops, delicious !!"
Probably my favorite shelf IPA.
Welcome to Wisconsin. This will make a nice addition into the usual rotation.
"My favorite IPA, too bad they have raised the price so much."
"Appearance: Dark golden, heavy white head retention, very cleary."
Just an amazing beer. Incredibly refreshing and consistently delicious. I love the citrusy aroma. One of the best beers I've ever had. It presents Itself best on tap but drinks like a charm in any format.
"16 oz. can at Nanny O'Brien's Irish Pub in Cleveland Park, NW D.C.; dated ""14338 18:24""; poured out of the can into a standard pint glass; drank over 30 minutes on Tues., 01/13/2015"
Great IPA with nice hint of citrus
"Pretty darn good. Very earthy dank and bitter. Good amount of pine. Not really citrus tasting. So darn fresh and tasty. Big down side, too darn expensive. The price is reflected in the Overall category. I usually wouldn’t let something like that reflect my rating, but $16 a six pack is too much money. Easily could be a 4.5 out of 5 if the price was closer to $10 a six pack."
"Consumed 39 days after date on bottle. This is an excellent beer and my guess is if from tap would be awesome. Super smooth, you never get a bite from this beer. Strong flavors never jump out at you, but settle very nicely in the mouth. Had the grapefruit and habanero recently (both ok), but it's nice to get back to the original. While I really like this beer, I'm surprised by the bro's score of 100. It certainly ranks as one of the top IPAs, though. Definitely worth whatever you can get your hands on if you are a hopheads."
"Wow, you have to try it!"
"wasn't keen on aroma or taste, not bad but not to my taste"
"This is a well balanced beer, but nothing really pops for me in this one anymore. I enjoyed the grapefruit variant very much. However I think the price of this standard edition is a bit much when compared to similar offerings."
"I dont like many IPAs but this might just be my favorite beer. Yes, my favorite beer."
"BP just arrived in WI - this was bottled on 1/17 so it's really fresh. Light amber appearance with a nice two finger white head that laces great. Smell is a combination of bready malt and dank, weedy hops. Very nice. Tastes of malt, hop oils, pine, earth and a hint of citrus. Lingers quite long on the palate. Mouth feel is spot as is the carbonation. Overall I like this beer but am not blown away by it. The taste just doesn't live up to the hype and at $15 a 6-pack this will be a ""once in a while"" purchase for me."
"I got this here in Pittsburgh. Not sure how fresh it was, but it was damn good. This beer stays with you in memory. The taste is just fantastic. I would love to be able to try it fresh, I'm sure it would be unbelievable. Expensive here at 20 bucks a sixer."
"This may be the best IPA I have ever had. This has a smoothness and balance that you don't often find in an IPA. There is a perfect sweet maltiness present to offset the hops, while still keep them front and center. The hops present a nice juicy, citrus, hop bite. It still remains light and drinkable as well."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Nice golden color with a one finger creamy head, slowly dissolving. Excellent floral nose, hint of citrus. The nose of this is very distinctive. The taste starts slightly bitter and piney but finishes clean. Excellent carbonation for balance and mouthfeel."
Didn't do much for me.
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip
So much flavor and so drinkable. Very nice balance of flavors and perfectly smooth. I would drink this everyday.
This is my go to beer and if I had to pick one beer to drink that is readily available this would be it. 
"This is definitely a classic IPA. Not too hoppy, large aromas of fruit. I can drink this anytime. Perfect for any meal and not too rich on flavor and taste. In my top 10 for IPAs."
"This ranks near the top of the list for American IPA for me. Poured from a can into a tulip. Nice gold color with copper highlights with 2 fingers of white head. Light lacing. Smells grapefruit, some floral notes. Tastes of citrus, earthy hops, maybe a little peach. Mouthfeel is medium but kind of creamy. Good carbonation with some bite. Well balanced beer, full of flavor. Nice clean hoppy finish. A great beer"
"I have always wanted to try this but, never like the price. Has a very balanced taste. A mild fruity and citrus feel. Easy to drink. Nice color. Not overly bitter."
Picked up a pack of this from a local beer store and am very glad I did! Very unique taste. One of the more memorable IPAs I've had.
pours a dark orange with a thick white head.
Thank You Sir.....May I have another!
"A bottle, bottled about 60 days ago, poured into a red plastic cup. "
Really like the pine and tropical fruit mix on the nose. A touch more carbonation than other IPA's which really compliments the snappy hops. Solid beer!
Snagged a growler of Sculpin before word got out. An exceptional American IPA that is actually fairly easy to get and enjoy.
Very nice brew would highly recommend.
"For a ""west coast"" IPA, Sculpin is about as good as it gets. Pricey as it gets, too! Poured into a snifter, its a beautiful, clear orange/gold in appearance, with a moderate white head that leaves thick lacing on the glass while maintaining a ring around the edges and a sizeable island in the middle. The nose, for me, is largely citrus and tropical fruit over a whiff of biscuity malt. Taste is where it really shines--the citrusy hops are balaced with a piney bitterness (though not too bitter) over a very tastey malt backbone of bread and bisquit, low on caramel. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light on first impression, but leans to medium in the middle and thickens in the aftertaste, which is moderately bitter, in a really good fashion. Carbonation is perfect for the style--meaning high enough to balance and accentuate the hop and malt flavors.Overall, it's my favorite IPA--after Bell's Two-Hearted and Surly Furious. Is it worth the price? On occassion, or at least when I'm feeling flush."
"A go to, Great Ipa one of the best."
This is amazing. I am just getting into IPA's now and such. And this is AMAZING. One of the best beers I've had. Period. Fruity and mildly bitter that doesn't linger on the tongue. I'll definitely be buying more. I wish the ABV was a little lower so I could session out on it more but the 6 I drank in one sitting was fine lol.
"On tap at Thai 9 in Dayton, OH. Served in a tulip glass. "
I love the look and nose of this but the taste is just not there for me. Not my favorite style of beer anyway but not close to best ipa.
Thick head with pretty good retention. The hop flavors tend toward a nice grapefruit bitterness. Smells great.
"Good looking beer, poured somewhere between yellow and orange, not clear but not quite hazy. Decent head that dissipated rather quickly. The smell is awesome, I am getting some citrus jumping out at me and then you pick up some pine and malts behind that and I swear what seems like caramel in there faint. Wonderful mix. The taste left me somewhat disappointed, it was good but not great to me. The bitter comes in to fast and lingers way to much on the back of the tongue without the wonderful splash of flavor in the great IPAs. Had Heady and Sip of Sunshine recently and this one was not close. Possible that it was an old bottle so I will revisit sometime to see if I do not still find it overrated."
"Easily one of the best IPAs out there, nuff said"
I get the can packs. This is one nice IPA.
"No date, so perhaps it's an older bottle?"
when in the course of human events it becomes eventual that you will find the grail and fill it with Sculpin.
Great IPA. Wish I could get my hands on it more often. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
One of the best IPA's on the planet. Balanced in every way.
Pours translucent honey gold. The one inch eggshell head fades to a thick ring and cap on top and leaves thick curtains of lace.
"When fresh, this is one of my favorite go to's. My rating is submitted with that caveat. "
"Lots of frothy head, translucent amber color. Fresh citrus hops aroma. Decent malt background but the citrusy piney hops are the showcase here. Medium thick body. A very satisfying west coast IPA - Great paired with a meal."
instant blast of hoppiness out of the bottle...and on the tongue
"On tap served in a pint glass. Golden-orange. Moderate head and resilient lacing. Grapefruit scent. Great citrus hop flavor but with other flavor elements that give it a complex and unique flavor. (I read on the Ballast Point website it has mango and apricot flavor--I couldn't detect those individual flavor elements but they worked well.) Overall: fantastic. Intense hop flavor but doesn't cross the line. (More than once, I've found the bottled version disappoints as compared to the tap.) (9.25)"
This bottle can't be the freshest as it doesn't have the hop bite I'd expect from a beer with this rating
"Sculpin has a pleasant honey color with a surprising degree of clarity. A bit lighter and brighter than I expected. Quite a vivacious brew. So much so that I had to pour the can in to an IPA glass in stages, to prevent the foam from spilling over the top. The dense, white frothy head stood at least 3 fingers tall, cresting over the top of the glass by a good margin. Great soapy retention that lingered while gradually revealing pretty lacing. Big sweet citrus hops in the nose. As soon as the can popped open there was a burst of perfume fragrance. A subtle pine cone aroma underlies the zesty citrus. The flavors marry lightly toasted malts with a potent hop character. Despite the enormous hop profile, the bitterness is restrained. They're more of the tropical mango variety with a sweet grapefruit zest. There's a little alcohol warmth, without being distracting. A surprisingly clean finish with only some enduring tropical hop flavor. With a medium mouthfeel and corresponding carbonation this is quite easy to drink. That came as a bit of a surprise given the ABV and bold hop qualities. This is a well-balanced IPA that highlights hops in such a fashion as to give them center stage, but without overwhelming the senses. Big and balanced. I tend to prefer more pine and relish the intense hop bitterness, but this stands out to me for its supreme drinkability. This is an IPA that is accessible to both hop heads and neophytes alike."
"Rich golden color. Smells of hops mild citrus odor. Good hop flavor, well balanced, refreshing flavor finishes slightly bitter. Above average carbonation."
"In my opinion, the best IPA that comes in a six-pack."
The beer pours a very nice and clean white creamy head that takes a while to dissipate. The beer itself is a clear and clean deep gold. The appearance is very neat and clean with no haze. The look is pretty nice and crisp.
"Pours a clear amber with a small white head that receded fairly quickly,left plenty of lacing."
"Not world class. I hoped for world class but I won't even be buying it again. It's just another IPA. Maybe they increased production and the magic was lost when I finally got some. Maybe you need to have it fresh? I got my 6pack on the East Coast and, overall, I paid too much."
Great tasting IPA love this beer
"Recently tried this at one of my favorite pubs in CT this past weekend because the Ghabdi-Bot tap had kicked. My server mentioned he actually preferred it over the NE classic. What I honestly discovered was, in my opinion, an overrated IPA. Poured great but otherwise pretty standard in my book. Not saying it was a bad drink, but it was presented to me in comparison to Ghandi-Bot and that I thought it was far from. I would not go out of my way to seek out again."
"Nice aromatic IPA. It was orange, hazy with a foamy, looser head. Lots of hop aroma and flavor. Citrus dominated on each sip. Grapefruit and bitter backbones. There was not too much of a malt presence. Good beer, not exactly balanced, but very nice and appropriately flavored for an IPA."
"Deep golden pour with frothy head, I've read a lot of mention that the hops deteriorate quickly in this one, so I'll need to revisit. Initial impression was nonplussed. Hops had a slightly skunky aroma amongst citruses which followed into the flavor. Maybe just not my style (west coast) as there are more strongly hopped IPAs out there that I love."
Gave it a try for the third time. Really hoppy but harsh taste going down my throat. Starting to get use to it but still a lot better beers out there for better price
"really good ipa, love the hop selection"
one of my favorite IPA's
This is as close to perfect as any beer I've ever tried.
Just about the holly Grail of IPA's!!!
"Nose and notes of apricot, peach, mango, grapefruit, and other citrus flavors. Plenty of hop punch, but incredibly balanced and smooth. One of my favorite IPA's for sure."
On tap at http://www.vintage-eats.com/ New Market MD.
Really solid IPA here I've had a few times but never reviewed:
"Great color, golden light yellow. Light body for IPA with beautiful, smooth hops. Very drinkable for non-IPA lovers."
"A - golden orange, crystal clear (classic west coast filtration) white frothy head that hangs around"
Poured into shaker pint on tap 
I found the hopping a bit too aggressive.
"One of my Top 10, if not Top 5, IPA's."
"Very good IPA. Fruity and drinkable, not too bitter. Really surprisingly smooth. Delicious"
"Great, easy drinking ipa. Nice smell, lots of hop flavor, definitely a good one. A bit high priced at $15 a six pack in MD, but worth a try."
"Pours shiny orange, just a bit misty, a nice small fluffy head for quite a while."
Tasted On: 12-26-2014
Wow. This is an outstanding IPA. The most recognizable smell and flavor is apricot followed by an taste of grapefruit on the backend. There is a wonderful balance between sweetness and bitterness. Delicious and drinkable and my favorite at the moment.
Fresh in cans. Generally not as good in bottles - less dry hops noticed.
"Yeah, I have to admit, this WC IPA really satisfied my palate. Lived up to the hype. Here goes:"
Best beer I've ever had
Not too bad. Great fruity hoppy flavor.
In my opinion one of the bests IPA. Perfect.
Poured froma can into a tulip glass. A week old.
355mL bottle no best before
Could be the best IPA I've ever had.
"One of the best standard IPAs I've had. Crisp. Fresh. Strong hops, but not by any means too much, in my opinion. This is my ""go to"" IPA."
"Pours amber with a large, lasting head."
Enjoyed from 12 oz. can
"I first drank this lovely at Stone in Escondido in 2007. At the time I was blown away by the citrus forward aspect of this beer. A couple of years later I toured the brewery just before this beer blew up in the national sense. We had a personal tour and were told they were putting 7 varieties of hops in each batch. The expen$e to make this ale was considerable. Thus the addiction began. I believe that, with my uncle, we put this beer on the map on the East coast because we were drinking at least a pallet/year. I have a set of garage doors nailed with thousands of caps to prove our consumption!! But what happened? As they grew this brew dropped off. I remember that on our West coast visit they were expanding tankage to outside fermenters. I believe this and hop shortages/prices changed this beer. Pliny on tap on the East coast, at least at Monk's, is close to what you taste in Santa Rosa. I can't say the same for Sculpin. Like a first love, she always fades with time. Thus the toying with grapefruit, kiwi, habaneros, etc to cover up the loss of what made this beer unique. Ballast boys- get back to the basics and make less so that we have ""more""!"
Drink fresh! Nom nom nom.
poured 12oz can into snifter. Not able to identify any date.
Bottle label data: none noted.
One of the finest beers to grace the earth.
"Tried it on a whim, and loved it!"
"Purchased at Total Wine, Tampa, $2.99 for the 12 oz bottle."
"Very good IPA, very drinkable gold/ orange tint. Citrus notes in front and excellent finish. I would say just a tad on heavy side but very drinkable. "
"Lovely aroma and hop notes, but it's too bitter for my liking."
One of the greats
"Normally, when you get a beer as hyped as this one, it is nearly impossible for the beer to meet expectations. Not so with Sculpin. It is pretty damn close to perfect. Just buy it."
"Clear orange with a thin white head. Ppured from a can. Hoppy aroma, hoppy taste, definitely bitter. I would prefer a bigger malt flavor. I'm not getting the mango that they say is there in the can. Solid ipa."
"Poured a hazy, golden-orange hue with a sustained, foamy white-head. This seems to be the typical American IPA look. I could not locate a freshness date but there was a number code on the label that may indicate the ale was bottled on the 213 day of 2014. "
"One of the best IPA's I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy on tap...as the reviews suggest, try this one if you haven't yet!"
Perfect beer
"Bottle, enjoyed with dinner in Anaheim. "
"One of my favorite IPAs. Tasted from bottle, can and growler pour, and absolutely delicious. It's a light copper color with a few fingers of head. Scents of citrus and pine. Taste is balanced, but definitely demonstrates that pleasant hoppiness you expect in a top IPA. Perfectly carbonated and a dry finish. A must for any true IPA drinker."
"On tap, Into a shaker pint, at the Union Taphouse in the Gaslamp district"
One of the best IPA's I have ever tasted!
"A:pretty foamy head, rich tangerine color"
Definitely an outstanding IPA and one of my go to's.
"November 17, 2014"
"The only reason I'm reviewing this beer is out of respect! I love this IPA! The most balanced /flavorful IPA I've hade to date! PERIOD! I've had growler fills, bottles and can! Awesome, awesome and awesome!"
"I got this on tap on the advice of the bartender, who said it was one of his favorites. I don't mess with that kind of advice! Here we go:"
Creamy citrus grapefruit with a very long west coast oily finish.
Love this beer and the fruity overtones it offers. Complex flavors and really unique to my taste compared to most IPA's
Wowza....... just an amazing beer.
Fantastic! Not enough can be said. Perfect citrus and hop burst throughout.
"Take note Dogfish Head 90, you got some competition! This may now be my favorite IPA!"
"An amazing beer on draft, a little less amazing in cans and bottles I've found."
"Ballast Point Sculpin has a thin, white head, a clear, slightly bubbly, orange-gold appearance, and fairly heavy lacing left behind. The aroma is of strong piney hop resin, grapefruit, and generalized citrus. Taste is of all that, with sweet, white bread, and strong, but certainly not harsh bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, and there is a bit of an unfortunate chalky aspect. The finish is dry and easy drinking. "
Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Reviewed 5/1/14.
On tap at Buffalo Wild Wings
A: clear; deep gold color; 1 finger off white head that receded slowly to a thin cap; very nice lacing;
"When you consider all of the IPA's regularly available in northern California including the most famous regularly available (although in limited supply) brew (nod nod, wink wink), I believe this tops them all. Having consumed these top IPA's numerous times and side by side, I have come to the conclusion that Sculpin tops them all. A rare combination of all that hoppiness has to offer in a very drinkable brew. Many may consider this a very hop forward beer but in the spectrum of what is out there these days, Sculpin offers a hop experience that is flavorful and very smooth. Best of the class."
"12 oz bottle purchased from CJ's Doghouse in Lansdale, PA for $3.25. No bottle date. normally I wouldn't buy an IPA without some sort of date, but I haven't had this yet and decided to roll the dice. poured it into a Sam Adams glass just for the hell of it."
Pours a golden color with a bubbly head that is a thumbnails length high. Good lace retention.
"I agree with other reviewers that the aftertaste is too strong (think next morning...) but I'd give this beer a 5.0 rating for cooking. Risotto and American IPA? The perfect match, and my first choice for an ""additive"" is currently this beer."
"This is what IPA's want to be when they grow up. The smell is amazing, the taste is transcendent. This beer comes as close to perfection as humanly possible. I hope I can find it on tap someday."
"Nothing beats fresh Sculpin. Addictively good. When it comes to IPA's Two Hearted is up there, but Sculpin has it beat, by a decent margin. Sculpin is SO drinkable and smooth. Even if you aren't an IPA drinker, you will not find this offensive."
Delicious!
Good Stuff
"The aroma is tangy with lots of fruit, like grapefruit and banana. The taste is sweet and strong with hops. A very well balanced West coast IPA."
"Pours a bright, vivid, orange-gold color, topped with a nice little puff of white foam. Excellent lacing, sheeting down the glass all the way to the bottom."
Phenomenal representation of a West Coast IPA
Very good IPA. I would get it more but it's so pricey by me ($14-$15) a six pack and I could get just as good or better for less. Still a great beer.
Great all around IPA.
"Poured on 10/27 from a can in to a snifter. Canning date was 7/24, so this brew was a little over 3 months old."
Best IPA I have ever tried.
Nice citrus flavor with a grapefruit finish and very bitter. I'm not a fan of IPAs but I wanted to give this one a try due to its high marks.If I was buying an IPA for a friend I would pick this up.
"Wow, not what I expected. Sculpin has all the physical characteristics of a good/great IPA but that, let's call it grapefruit, nose and front are matter of personal preference. Not my cup of tea."
Best IPA Ive ever had.
"A: Light, murky orange/amber. No head, little lace. Poured like water"
"Great smell right from open. Had one in a pint glass, and one straight from the can. Suggest the can."
"A: Rich, foamy, white head that leaves concentric lace rings. The brew itself has just the slightest bit of haze, but it is barely there. Rich, light copper hue."
22 oz Bomber.This has a very nice taste of grapefruit with slight lemon.Very Hoppy beer.Solid IPA with a solid 7.0ABV.This is one of the better IPA`s out there.I noticed that just about all the Ballast Point beers are coming out in cans now.Makes it alot easier if you are going on a picnic or other outing.If you haven't tried this one you owe it to yourself if you like IPA`s.
Great well rounded taste
"Really, this beer is not good. Aftertaste is like fish, its namesake. Not crisp, not refreshing, not sessionable like a west coast IPA. I don't know how it even falls in this class. Its bad fruity with a bad aftertaste."
"Sculpin has 3 things that play against it: One, no obvious freshness date, which reveals an inconsistency of product. I honestly forget what good, fresh Scupin tastes like. I'm sure it was good, but cmon, get a freshness date clearly marked on your bottle so I don't have to fuck around. Second, it's way overpriced compared to Bell's Two Hearted Ale, and the Noda Hop, Drop & Roll, which are IPA staples, and competing for my business for that style in my area.. Third, when you have other fresh beers that are very good, and this one isn't fresh, your taste buds begin to tell you that the other's are better, even if they may not be all things being equal fresh Sculpin vs. fresh Two Hearted vs. fresh Hop Drop. You guys need to fix this. I already complained about this, and received free beer, but the issue has still not been rectified."
Almost perfect.
"Just a step below Stone IPA, but being from San Diego, it lives up to the standard!"
This is one beautifully built beer. The grapefruit notes and hoppy after glow make this a real treat and might be one of the best west coast IPAs on the market. If you can find it.
Top 3 on my short list of IPA's..!
Had this on tap in a cool little bar in Chico. Many patrons were enjoying this beer.Quite a treat to find on tap.
"12 oz bottle, deciphering the bottle code puts this at Sept 22. Very fresh."
"It was hard not to rate this a '5', but considering the fact that I've never rated anything a five on the ground that-that would require some sort of undefined perfection, i had to settle - unwittingly - with 4.75. This beer is phenomenal! I had it at some random sports bar with a mixed crowd and velvet couches, but I was happy to get lost in my active enjoyment of the beer over gorgeous flatscreens showing two super exciting, MAJOR, college football upsets at the bar - it was easy too. Many people have rated this meticulously and eruditiously on the quality of it's various elements, but let me tell you, this beer is all ""emotion and feel;"" no need to quantify the greatness of this beer."
There were great aromas coming from this brew. The tastes was of a familiar IPA I very much enjoy. This was a sure do again.
Hoppy bite but light enough to have a few.
I had two hearted first but find them very comparable. I'l give the crown to two hearted since it's $3 cheaper.
Fresh sculpin is hard to beat.
Smell the HOPPS right away. The lemon is first to come out with the hopps. Take another sipp and enjoy peach & mango! INCREDIBLE!
"11/04/13 From bottle at home. Very mellow for a renowned IPA. By the power of suggestion (reading the company blurb) I detect hints of mango, peach & faint citrus which all add up to a well thought out blend. Deserves the rep."
A: [2.75] Slightly hazy golden color. Forms a nice 2 finger head. But the head dissipates rapidly in a patchy fashion. Once the head is gone there is not much lacing on the glass. The can lists a Julian date code (2 months old) but no ABV or IBU.
"The best thing about this beer is the smell. Mrs. Cox said it smelled like grapefruit and if grapefruit were actually heavenly, that would be true. And, if grapefruit actually tasted heavenly, it would be true about the taste, too. The feel is soft and nice (oh yeah, that made sense). Lovely stuff."
Nice bitter brew but not sure it's really worth the high price tag ($19/6pk).
"Pours a deep golden amber with a medium off white head, light lacing. Aroma is a citrus grapefruit hops with a very good sweet caramel malt character. Taste is sweet caramel malt followed by some good citrus hops with some very good grapefruit tangy notes. A medium bodied brew has a smooth mouth feel and moderate carbonation, easy on the palate and taste buds. The finish is a well balanced combination of caramel malt and citrus hops with a bit of lingering grapefruit tangy flavor. Overall a solid, very good, tasty and enjoyable IPA"
This beer is perfection and easy enough to drink pretty often. Complex with floral notes and well hopped.
This is my favorite IPA.
"Wow. I understand why this beer is rated so highly now that I have finally tried one. Unlike many IPAs which are very citrus and flowery, this contained notes of darker fruits. Well balanced and clean, this is an expertly crafted brew. What a nice change from the average IPA! Definitely will buy again."
"Appearance: A bright, clear, and clean golden color. Awesome head with rocky formations and very good retention. Lacing is nice and thick. Great head. Awesome head. "
Nice and aggresive flavor. Very hoppy. Truly one of my favorite beers.
"A - Clear, light orange, copper colored brew, pouring up with a fat, pillowy white head, reducing to a thin film, and extensive lacing."
Great IPA. A lot going on with the aromas and taste. Well balanced with a nice lingering finish. One of my all-time favorites in this category.
"A: Copper, mostly filtered with a hint of cloudiness, little carbonation, 5 fingers of off white rocky melting snow head, spotty pointed chalky lacing."
This one sold me on west coast IPAs
"Riduclously drinkable IPA. The flavors are subtle, yet complex, marvelous hopping at the finish. Not as massive as others, but that's to this brews advantage."
"Seemed sorta oxydized, but was disappointed by the lack of substance compared to the outrageous price I paid. For the $$$, way better options locally."
"Nose: resiny, citrusy hops"
I get a very strong tea flavor from Sculpin. I don't understand the hype or why people are willing to pay $16 for a 6 pack.
12oz cold can w/freshness date into tulip
Must have for any ipa lover.
"This is one of my top 5 favorite IPAs. I've been meaning to take a trip to SD to visit their brewery... Soon, very soon!"
This Thing Bites On the Front End With a Cool Finish. What an IPA.
"A: Amber, reddish color; wispy head"
"My brother brought this beer back from CA for my bachelor party weekend, thanks L!"
"Great IPA! Very strong in flavor. Subtle hints of citrus keep it smelling and tasting fresh and crisp. Definitely one of my top favorite American IPA's, wish it was more popular in NC!"
"To be honest, I have been drinking this brew for some time now. It is one of my ""go to"" beers that I have access too. "
My first mobile review. Beach vacation eve and my educated father in law gifts me w Sculpin cans for those lazy sun-filled shore days.
"If you want a hoppy-nosed, bitter bomb of an American IPA... well friend, this is your beer."
5-5
Not overly hoppy but has a citrusy bite. A perfect combination to drink several at a time.
"One of the best there is. I could drink this beer all day every day and never get sick of it. Its got some hints of grapefruit, other good piney notes, and is just down right drinkable! I love scuplin!"
"Very prominent tropical fruit notes. The hops are present in the smell and at first taste. At 7% it is extremely easy to drink four of these without getting overwhelmed. I would say that this beer borders an APA and an IPA. Great tasting beer. Although fairly new to the hops game, I place this one in my top 5 beers to drink."
"About as good as an American IPA can get. Looked like, smelled like and tasted like an awesome IPA. Can't ask for much more."
"Best IPA hands down only wish it came in a 6 pack here in Jacksonville, FL as the large bottle is a bit expensive locally at $9 a bottle."
Look: golden light amber
"Great IPA. Picked up a 6 pack and enjoyed each one over two or three nights. Top shelf IPA, a bit pricey at almost $17 for a 6 pack but maybe that's just because it was bought in Maryland. Still good stuff."
Ballast sculpin. Pours copper color big foam and lacing. Subtle grapefruit nose and citrus. Surround of bitter with a light sweet malt below. Lemon rind bitter finish. All good. 4 4 45 4 425
"This is the best IPA I've ever consumed. In fact, it turned me into an IPA man! I crave the hops finish at times which has never seemed like a possibility before."
Pours a lovely hazy orange with a dense and compact head that leaves some lovely lacing all down the glass.
"since my first sculpin, all other ipas have been rated on the ""sculpin scale"". "
"incredible IPA, up there with Pliny the Elder, HT, and Julius"
This is what an IPA should taste like.
"A: 4 Nice moderate amber with a dense head, producing good lacing"
One of my favorites. Never disappoints.
"Amazing. A truly great IPA that doesn't mess around. Appearance is a dark yellow/orange with a thin head that trails the glass. The smell is an explosion of hops. The taste is the same with a ton of amazing hop flavor, really fresh and crisp with pine and grapefruit notes coming through. Would highly recommend for any hop heads to grab a bottle."
"I know this a very highly rated IPA, but I am not a fan. I have tried this beer on tap and out of a bottle. It pours a beautiful golden color with a rich creamy head , but I find the aftertaste a bit harsh."
One of the best IPA's available. Restraint and understanding of the palette make this one a special beer.
I like this one. Readily available too
"A light honey-gold IPA, clear with no obstructions. Pours with moderate carbonation, persistent head, and tiny, ambitious bubbles. Smells (and tastes) of mango, lemon peel, and bread. Has a slight citrus taste with perfectly balanced hops and is subtly bitter. Initial mouthful is smooth with a stinging aftertaste in the back of the throat...even that distinguishing attribute suits the beer and is not gimmicky."
"Delicious! This is the best IPA I've had so far….. Fairly new to the whole thing so that's not saying a whole lot, but I'm guessing by how highly rated it is It's one of the better ones out there. Lots of citrus and pine flavors, a little more sweetness to counter balance the hop bitterness, which is nice. Overall, smooth, beautifully balanced, and packs just the right amount of bite, while still incredibly drinkable and refreshing. I will buy this again and again and again!!!"
Classic favorite.
This is a really good IPA the 4 is because while I'm not crazy about IPAs
Appearance- Golden yellow with a massive frothy head atop the brew.
"Pours a golden amber with a thin, fizzy head and thick lacing. Smell is of citrusy hops, pine, and sweet malt. Taste is strong citrus hops, fruity sweetness and a bitter bite at the finish. There is an undercurrent of bready malt. Mouthfeel is moderately thick and definitely sticky with hop resin. This is an excellent substitute for Pliny the Elder when it's not available. The two beers are on par with one another."
"Doing this from a hazy memory, so excuse any inconsistencies"
"Just about my all time favorite IPA. What can I say to start it off... Its juicy, floral, fresh and crisp. Ballast Point truly made a world class beer. The nose has pleasant notes of lemon, tangerine, peach and pine. It is floral and light with fresh hints of melon, honey, and many citrus flavors that all come together with a crisp bite and a dry, yet juicy finish. I always look for that special beer which hits me as a masterpiece keeps me coming back to get more and more. Sculpin IPA truly fills that title. To me, its perfect. It is a testament to what creativity and experimentation can produce. Give it a try."
A: pours a deep amber gold with a generous off white head Pretty beer and clear. 
Light orange color. Creamy head leaves sticky lines of lace with each sip.
I bought a bottle of this to try as I keep hearing it's a good IPA.
330ml bottle served in a pokal glass.
"Love the hop palette on this one, something here reminds me of Two-Hearted but I can't quite put my finger on it. After hearing about this for years and avoiding it due to it being far more expensive than other beers in a six-pack, I'm glad I finally took the plunge."
A - An almost clear light amber color. Only a very slight murkiness. Thick foamy head with decent retention. Minimal lacing with lots of bubbles. 
I bought a bottle of Sculpin IPA at Total Wine and More. Poured in to a pint glass.
"Pours a light orange color with lots of carbonation bubbles. A good sized white foam head, with decent retention."
A: Pours a slightly hazy light copper with a short white head. Good retention.
"One of the best IPAs being brewed. Fresh, this beer is one of the best beers available. If you've never had it, at least try a single of it. Yes it's pricey but its worth More than every penny. Truly a world class India Pale Ale. Although since it's brewed in San Diego, freshness of this beer is paramount, especially considering I'm writing this from New England."
On tap.
Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. The label lists the abv at 7% abv. 
"This has to be the best IPA ever, right? Not double or triple but a regular IPA. From appearance to mouthfeel to taste, this beer is top-notch! Fantastic! Delicious. Pairs well with many foods. This beer is the best, home grown I'm San Diego, land of the IPA."
"Ballast Point Sculpin is listed by many as a great beer. I am often times leery of mass approval of anything, with that in mind I gave this IPA a try. it was poured into a pint glass and did have a very pleasing light color for an IPA. The aroma was strong but not overpowering. I took the first sip and POW, man was it good."
"From Whole Foods in Vienna, Virginia. Bottle has no freshness date. That is not a good idea for an IPA."
Nice american IPA of a somewhat transparent orange color with some amber tones and an ok foam.
"Appearance: Slightly hazy copper color with a thick, fluffy head that fades slowly with chunky lacing."
"Poured from a bottle into a KC Pils glass from Boulevard Brewing Co., Kansas City, MO."
Heard the hype & had to try. I was expecting a bit more in taste but was pleased overall. Definitely a laid back NW IPA that is very drinkable & enjoyable. I can easily see how the average consumer could get caught up in the hype but there are some better IPAs out there in my opinion.
Got this one because it is routinely dubbed as one of the best beers in america.
"Poured from can into willy glass. A slightly hazy golden-copper color with a thin head that persists. Aroma is a blast of floral, dank, piney hops...it's wonderful. Taste is also dank and floral mixed with some caramel and butterscotch. The bitterness lingers offsetting the fairly malty backbone. Mouthfeel is great....carbonation that lasts and a silky smooth texture throughout. Overall, this is a great IPA, worth picking up even considering the $15/6-pack."
Afte drinking this for years I am now going to review this old classic. 
A-Very clear gold color with a white head that leaves a lace
"Poured 12 oz can into a pint glass. Smells extremely piney and poured nice, but tropical flavors are busting out of control! Color is a lighter copper and head is 3/4 inch with a good pour. Had on draft previously and tastes as good now as it did then. I'm glad I discovered this beer. Super IPA."
Sixer sold from NJWineseller in Cranford. 
Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a moderately thick head that lingered. 
"Wow, this is one tasty IPA. A very smooth and fruity IPA that lingers on the tongue in a very nice way. The body is a bold fruity hop while the tail is a trailing bitter that tickles the tongue like only the best IPAs can. Personally my second favorite IPA (and I love IPAs)."
This is one of my go-to IPA's and a great beer. 
"A hazy orange in the glass with a nice quarter inch foamy head that lingered. Punch on the nose, of citrus. Tastes of grapefruit and pine. Some malty notes and a hint of alcohol. Feels heavy, a beer to drink one of, not make a session of. present but subdued bitterness. For me a really good, but not spectacular IPA. Will drink again."
"Very good IPA, to be enjoy any time."
"Had this originally rated as a 4.75. I have since revised it due to the fact that I can ALWAYS find it at my favorite beer store. Compare this against several other (5) rated beers (PTE, HT), which seem to come around less frequently than the comet known as Haley."
"Growler filled from tap, poured into snifter."
"Well, I'm reviewing my first beer on this site, might as well start with a good one. Picked up a six pack at Pinehurst Wine Shoppe, near Baltimore, MD. They regularly stock sculpin in 6 packs, it;s kind of hard to find it anywhere else in sixers."
"A - Medium-dark amber, inch of froth, mild lacing"
best ipa I have ever had.
"12oz can, code on bottom reads 14126, I believe this translates to 'canned' 5/7/14"
"This is my favorite beer to date! Today is my birthday and on Friday I'm taking off work to hit up the brewery down in San Diego. This has to be the IPA that helped San Diego reach it's claim to fame. Perfect taste and 7% to boot! The perfect beer for a beer tasting, kicking with some friends, or even for a raging weekend night."
This really is a great beer but it is really overpriced near me. This is strange because I live like an hour away from their brewery so I don't know if it is my local store price gauging or if Ballast Point is responsible. The store near me charges $18 for a bomber and there is no way that it is worth that much unless you have never tried it. 
"A - After a very frothy pour, Sculpin settles in the pint glass with a light amber coloring. The frothy head doesn't dissipate easy, and gives the beer a very stately appearance. Real nice. After some sips, the glass reveals some nice lacing. "
"I've had this a few times before, but decided to review it this time. What can be said that hasn't already been said? Either way, Sculpin is an exceptional IPA and a fine example of the work that Ballast Point is doing. The taste is full of fruit flavors (mainly peach, lemon, and grapefruit), complemented by a piney hop finish. The flavor is intense, but the malt keeps it from being overpowering. Additionally, It's listed as 7.0% abv, but you'd never guess it. The only downside is that it is a little on the pricey side--I guess you get what you pay for."
Ballast Point Sculpin India Pale Ale
"A: Pours a clear golden yellow with two finger off white head leaving fairly heavy lacing,"
Color- cloudy apricot. Full head. 
"Lots of different hops merging to create a memorable IPA. Layering of hops makes it bold complex and flavorful but not so hoppy as to overpower you. Beautiful light clear amber color. Slight head and minimal lacings. At 7% above - just the right amount of intensity. A very tasty and drinkable IPA. It's a ""can't miss"" for all IPA and Pale Ale lovers. Definitely recommend."
"I have a special place for the Sculpin, because this was my first introduction into REAL IPA's."
"Picked up a six pack of cans because of the buzz I've heard about it. Yes they had bottles but I'm a sucker for a can of beer. Smells really clean and floral and so smooth. Not overly bitter and I think rather than trying to pack as much hops into the can as they could, Ballast was more focused on creating a solid drinkable IPA. Mission accomplished. At 7% it may not be a great session beer (unless you're Irish like me) but one or two is good for circulation"
"Talk about flavors! Couldn't quite figure them out until I read the hop varieties in this one. Mango, pineapple, lemon, pear, grapefruit, and some piney notes. Pretty much the best IPA I can get here in houston. This is my go to special occasion IPA ! Really enjoying their selection of brews!"
What do you say about something when everything has already been said? 
Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Fairly fresh bottle as the brewery which is in close proximity
Served On-Tap
A - Nice golden colour. Slightly hazy.
BallastPoint Sculpin IPA 
Pour: a nice light brown brew with a white thin beer head. 
I've updated my rating to reflect my several experiences with this beer. The first time I had it in the bottle and it was very good and perhaps more fresh. I've since had a few bottles that weren't very good and some fresh cans that were just good. Still a good IPA but not worth the price.
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.
"If I am ever on deathrow, and I am allowed a last meal and can choose the beverage- I want a fresh bottle or can of Sculpin to be my drink. I grabbed a six pack of cans locally with a canned date of 5-20-14- just over two weeks old. The first six pack of Sculpin I had was about 3 months old, and boy was there a difference. The fresh Sculpin was the best ipa I have ever had. It was crisp and clean with the perfect notes and bitterness. West coast IPAs- fanfreakingtastic."
Poured bottle into glass. 7% abv.
A: Golden with a nice one finger ecru head and nice lacing.
"Pours a terrific gold with a fabulous head. Nice lacing afterwards. Good carbonation. Smell is great with lots of piney grapefruity freshness. I still can't get over the aroma. So clean and aromatic. Taste is equally impressive. Nice, clean, refreshing, lots of flavor. A great beer."
"Bought for a New Seasons grocery store in Portland, Oregon. Pretty pumped when I saw this one, cause its been on my radar for a while now. No freshness date, but I expect it to be pretty fresh considering the stores location (Hawthone) and this beers popularity. Poured into a snifter. "
"Looks the part. Pours a nectarine color. It's not clear like many other IPAs, instead it displays a slight haze, lacking the clarity (a good thing) of most. The head has the required meringue qualities, but lacks retention. Each swirl provides more and more lace."
This is my only review where i erased the previous review due to an old bottle. This is like a different beer all together
"Poured from can into tulip glass. Very nice golden color. Good 1-1.5"" head. Awesome smell. A citrus, hoppy, piney smell. Get a hint of grapefruit. Tastes just like how it smells. Delicious. Great feeling in the mouth. Not a long lasting or overly bitter aftertaste. Nice carbonation. This is near the top of my list. Great beer."
A. Golden in color - clear through glass with lots of carbonation. Head is 2 -3 fingers and settles into a one finger foam.
"Very clear, pale orange in color and a foamy white head with great retention."
A - Orange in color - with some haze yet also clear enough to see the bubbles rise. Huge frothy white / caramel colored head. Really nice cling and stick after each sip.
SC 450
I stopped into Whetstone Station yesterday (26APR14) for dinner with Artied2 and had a couple of this offering. Served in a ~12oz tulip for $6.50 each.
A: Pours a pretty golden tangerine color with a finger and a half of head. Cloudy. Nice lacing.
Bottle marked SC 421 14022 at 45 degrees into a standard pint glass
"Serving type: bottle, poured into pub glass. In South Korea of all places. I was skeptical at first thinking this might be a knock-off but as I have had the real deal recently I figured this would be a good one to have. I was not disappointed. "
"Just about as good as an IPA gets. Clear orange color, a finger of white foam that goes down quick. Tropical fruit heavy in the aroma, pineapple, mango, grapefruit. Clean tasting pine and orange rind in the taste. Slight cracker taste as well, but overall not too much from the malt."
This is a good beer. I love the fact that you can get it in a can. 
"Poured from a bottle dated 3/15/14 (well... dated as the 74th day of 2014). Appearance is nearly perfect - honey-golden liquid with a thick off-white head that leaves lots of lace as it recedes. I wish there were a few more bubbles rising through the liquid, but that's a minor quibble."
"Appearance: light gold, very clear. Fairly substantial and messy off white head and lacing. Nice enough though not particularly mind blowing for a legendary ipa."
You had this beer. 
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with a thin, white head that dissipates quickly and leaves good lacing. Smell is mostly fruity and citrusy and bits of pine. This is probably one of the more tropical fruit centered West Coast IPAs I've had. Taste is very forward with tropical fruit and citrus. A bit of pine bite towards the end. Just a bit of sweetness at the end. Just the right amount. The bitterness is not overpowering whatsoever. Mouth is extremely smooth, crisp, and light, with about average carbonation. This is not your typical pine bomb of an IPA. Overall, a great IPA, one of the best."
Briefly.
From a growler from FMcD's poured into a tulip glass. First pour from a fill from three hours earlier. 
Pours a lemony orange with a 2 finger head. Has a nice apricot fruity nose. The tongue is grapefruity with hints of apricot followed by dark fruit with a hint of malt. The mouthfeel is moderate. This is truly an awesome offering and will try it again.
"Deep orange with a big 3 finger white head and lots of lacing as you drink. Big citrus, mostly grapefruit notes, accentuated by peach and apricot giving this a largely fruity nose. Taste delivers, with some nice grapefruit bite, peach and mango all tied together with a sweet almost graham cracker malt bill. It finishes slightly bitter, but not nearly as much as expected. Very pleasing clean finish. Medium mouthfeel that's just spot on with carbonation. Great IPA that deserves its place toward the top."
Poured into an IPA glass and enjoyed over 20 minutes; bottle with a cryptic stamp on the label that suggests bottling within three weeks of consumption--but not sure.
"I had this after a series of double IPA's but it still held its own. Albeit in a slightly lower abv way. This ale had a nice head, excellent aroma, and great mouthfeel. There was an easy drinkability to this IPA. There was more bitterness than sweetness present but it was definitely in balance. Would definitely drink this one again."
"This is one of my favorite IPA'S as I drink it on a fairly regular basis. This review is from my growler pour, but I have also had it from a bottle and tap at a local pub. Each time, this beer is smooth, rich in aroma and taste, and never disappoints."
Honestly i don't see the hype in this beer. Found it a bit too sweet. The abv wasn't that high so it probably just had a high final gravity.
Got this bottle at Whole Foods in DC. From notes.
From notes
12 oz bottle dated 3-4-14
"Re-reviewing after having a pretty different experience from the first time I tried this. My old review (and scores) are listed below for science. The difference in experience can be chalked up to one of two things: vessel and/or freshness. The first review was a 22 oz bomber that was likely about two months old. This time around, I had it out of the can marked with a Julian canning date that translates to 3/6/2014, so less than a month old. Oh, I also poured it into a Speigelau IPA glass this time, so I suppose that could have had an effect as well."
Nice and shiny golden color teaming with bubbles. 
"12 oz. bottle, from a case dated mid/late Feb. '14, poured into my trusty 3 Floyds teku."
A:
"appearance; orange/ gold, lots of visible carbonation, tons of thick, off white head."
"A: clear hazy yellow/orange. Looks great in a glass. 2 finger head, looks amazing."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped SC443-14055. Sampled on March 23, 2014."
I generally don't reach for IPA's but I decided to give Sculpin a shot given the reviews.
"100 beers later on BA, I thought I would revisit an old favorite:"
I decided to try this beer on a weekend trip to the Adirondacks. After a long day of snowboarding on whiteface the colorful fish on the labelled beckoned with the promise of a unique experience far from wherever the contents of the bottle had been brewed. With the beer poured into a lovely pint class I was able to appreciate the copper color and slight head. The aroma consisted of enlivening hops and floral notes and the brew had refreshing bitter qualities.
"Malt seems thoughtful, but this beer is all about the hops. Layer upon layer of bitterness. Complex but not overcrowded. Smell and taste is spice, with some pine, and citrus. Finish is loooong and bitter. Can't wait to give it a shot out of the can."
Date: 3/19/14
"A: dark golden color, typical of what I see from a lot of dipas, finger and half of head. Clear"
"Appearance: Pours a hazy golden body and a frothy 1"" head"
"First review, umpteenth beer."
"Poured a golden orange color, very clear, with one fingers worth of white head. Smell is very citrusy with a good amount of floral notes and pine. The flavor is pine up front but doesn't give very much bitterness as the floral and grapefruit tastes come through after. The feel is medium as it is well carbonated. This is one of my all time favorite beers and the one beer I ask people to drink when they say I don't like IPA's to convert them."
Looking forward to this tasting... this one seems to be considered one of the benchmark IPA's
"My opinion of Sculpin? I don't know what the hype is about. In fact, I wouldn't buy it again. Especially for $16 for a 6 pack. It's actually a really good, really smooth, really flavorful beer. Until about 5-10 seconds after it goes down. Then that aweful, bitterness overcomes the mouth and has you cringing, waiting for it to pass until the next sip. But the bitterness just never leaves. It's a beer that COULD be amazing, but the bitter after-taste is completely off-putting. I love a super hoppy ale...but Im not a bitter fan. Give me fresh, springy, whole cone hops in abundance. But the ale better be complete with a fresh, crisp finish. This beer doesnt fit my bill. If you're a fan of bitter IPAs, then this beer is for you. But in my opinion, theres nothing world class about it - at all. Mye I've got used to the more malty backbones of DIPAs like Dirt Wolf, 90 minute IPA, etc. Although I'd even rank Southern Tier's IPA well ahead of this. Because its springy and hoppy, without being bitter and hard to finish. I might rate this offering slightly higher if at had a little more abv, at least I could start to feel good while choking it down. But I don't see what the hype is. It's an okay beer, but if you never had it, you wouldn't be missing much."
"bottled 13351, so this is 3 months old"
"This is truly a world-class beer. If you have not had the pleasure of trying it, then you are missing out. I am looking forward to trying many of their other selections of beer that have just made it into my region."
"I've had the pleasure of enjoying this beer many times and, looking back, I only wish I had reviewed it sooner. I think my palate has been altered since my first offering; an experience that probably would have resulted in a near perfect score. Make no mistake, this is a world-class AIPA."
A: clear pale yellow-orange with decent head and lacing.
Sculpin is about as good as it gets for an American ipa. I can't find a single thing wrong with this beer. That being said though . . . it's still over priced.
"Overall a very nice IPA and of the smooth variety. It has a nice aroma and bitterness to it. Poured into a glass with very little head. Carbonation seems nice and has a golden/orange-ish color. Overall a very solid beer, but on the pricey side. I'd consider buying again depending on the price."
"Best IPA I have ever tasted. Sculpin captures the bitter that I look for in every IPA. The smell and flavor are perfect. The color adds to it. The head when you pour it does not over-flow, and there is no stale taste to it by any means. If you are looking for perfection in an IPA this beverage is for you."
"Clear golden pour, with just a touch of amber, coupled with a very nice head and long lasting lacing. The nose is a complex blend of grapefruit, mango and other sweet tropicals against a subtle spruce. Light medium body with a smooth texture. The carbonation level is a touch above normal. The outstanding flavor profile is expertly complex and follows the nose. Grapefruit leads then flows into the sweeter hop flavors. In the middle the biscuit malt comes through against a subtle spruce flavor. The finish effervesces into a grapefruit bitter tartness over a caramel sweetness. This is an outstanding complex hop flavor bomb."
S-light sweet IPA aroma
Pours a golden orange color.
A-a clear light orange amber with two fingers worth of white head that sticks to the glass
Appearance: Clear gold with a perfect head and good lacing. Quite a bit of carbonation.
Appearance - clear amber golden color with white head
12oz Bottle poured into tulip 
Half inch thick of frothy white head. Light copper hue with good clarity. Nowhere as bitter as the DirtWolf I just had. The aroma is a balanced play of pine like hops and light malt backbone. Mouth is thick and sticky. The taste is a nice balance of pint like hops and light malt backbone. The bitterness is picking up as it warms. Nice!
Look - golden color with a great white head and lacing
"I've been up and down with this beer.. The first time I had it, it blew my mind..the second time I had it was in Vermont and it tasted very flat .. AND the third time I had it, it wasn't flat but it didn't have that nice hoppy IPA taste as the first time.. I think if you can find this beer fresh it's a top of the line beer but in my experience I was 1 for 3.."
Reviewed While Drinking
"Bought a bottle at a local liquor store. This beer poured with a yellowish-gold appearance, though I noticed a little amber when I brought it up to the light. Also, the beer had a mushy, medium-sized head with patchy lacing on the side. Very rich aromas mixed with citrus flavors, like grapefruit, and plant tastes like pine and herbs. These aromas were quite good in the sense that were balanced: nothing too strong, but very noticeable. Good taste of citrus, like lemon and orange, as well as malts and hops. Loved that lingering bitterness that came with every sip. Great, crisp mouthfeel that makes this beer refreshing, while not being a watered down drink. Overall, this was one heck of an IPA!"
First review on the site and first time trying this Pale Ale from Ballast Point. Very refreshing taste w/ nice citrusy aroma. Great introduction to the company and a very smooth India Pale Ale compared to others I've had. As a newer beer advocate I've definitely tried to find more and more of the site's 250 and this does not disappoint. Fully deserving of its ranking and will definitely purchase again and again.
This is an amazing IPA. It pours a beautiful gold with a nice white head. Wonderful citrus flavors from the hops and a nice mouth feel. If you are a hop head you can't go wrong with this beer. The bottles and cans are filtered. I've had an unfiltered version on draft in San Diego that is superb.
"A: Hazy amber with the fastest rising core of bubbles I've ever seen (including champagnes). Soapy head forms easily and sticks around, and to the glass. Reminds me of a rootbeer float- on my last, roughest pour, I had a kind of volcano-looking foam mountain that lasted even after my last swig."
Bottle poured into a glass
"This beer is exactly what an IPA should be. Outstanding in every way. I very much enjoy the Grapefruit version also. The Habanero was really good too, but not at the same level as the regular Sculpin and Grapefruit version. The Pineapple was a little to sweet and artificial. It's just a well balanced IPA from the fruity and mildly bittering hops to the even maltiness present. This beer is a regular on tap at the basement bar. Although pricey ($115.00 for the last 1/6 keg I just bought, although I was also able to find it locally as low as $105.00) it is worth every penny IMO."
"Poured a beautiful, clear, amber color to a tall, thick head, slowly settling to a creamy collar and leaving nice lacing. The aroma was big and hoppy less grapefruit and citrus to me though and more spicy, floral notes. The taste followed suite with some nice malty sweetness at first but quickly transitioning to spicy, floral hops with hints of pine and citrus rind. The finish is very dry and smacks of American bittering hops. Medium carbonation and body fit for style and keep the beer light and refreshing. Overall an excellent IPA, although much more floral and spice than the fruity citrus I was expecting from reading other descriptions (not a fault, just surprised)."
"clear golden-amber straw, medium head that poofs away after a minute. nose; hops (amarillo & simcoe) and high-key, astringent pine sap. not ""piney"", but real goddamn pine. taste; first impression - a tad undermalted. that's not a bad thing if the hopping schedule holds up and this one does. big bitter floral hops and citrus zests threaten to overpower the underprovisioned fruit sweets, breads and malts here, but it's the kind of losing battle that high-ibu fans want to partake in. the fruit sweets do show up though; grapefruit and mango (and primarily on the aftertaste). this beer stands out to me among ipa's for both the lack of high-malt and the lack of any kind of caramel or syrup sweetness mixed in with the fruit characters. delicious!"
On tap; poured into a pint glass.
You had this beer. 
22 ounce bomber poured into a tulip glass
"A: Pours a very nice, translucent, amber color. Creamy white head quickly dissipates with nice lacing on the side of the glass."
"Bought a six pack of Sculpin cans the other day. code on the bottom says 14028, so I am assuming this is pretty fresh - abt 2 wks old - unless I'm not deciphering it correctly. "
Serving Type) Poured a Pint out of a 22 oz. Bomber. Thanks to Wheelzntoys for sending this to me via trade!
"A translucent, golden body lurks beneath an inch of foamy, pure white head that lingers briefly before settling to a scant dusting across the surface of the liquid; minimal strands of lacing coat the glass. The aroma is of grapefruit and orange with a fresh pine punch. Some grass, herbs, and wet earth fill out the middle with a lemony zest towards the end. It tastes similar, with some large citrus notes up front that readily fade to a muddled, earthy center. Bitter hops give way to a soapy aftertaste on the finish, especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is thinner than anticipated, but well carbonated. Refreshing throughout with a dry finish. Overall, a solid IPA that I thoroughly enjoy. While there are plenty of new options available today, this one remains a staple and a great example of the style."
"Served fresh from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is nice orange haze with lots of lacing that seems to linger. Smell is fresh fruit but not that strong. Would like more punch. Taste is fresh but again not that aggressive. Mouthfeel is average and overall, I believe the first time I tasted it must have been stale as this experience was delicious."
Had a bottle pours a golden orange with off white lacing. Amazing smell of citrus and piney resins. The taste is a balance but lends more to bitter than fruity citrus. More grapefruit than orange but an outstanding IPA nonetheless. Leaves me craving more
"just had this on draft. one of the freshest tasting, flavorful IPA's I've had in a long, long time. Bright orange color, hops jumping out of the glass. you really can't ask for more, and at 7.0 percent it drinks so nicely."
The beer comes in a clear dark amber orange with a huge huge foamy white head.
From a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter.
"Great beer, very hoppy, more hop then citrus. a MUST TRY for IPA lovers. The overall feel from it is very hoppy upfront, and smooth citrus in the back. Beautiful soft color betrays the mouthful of flavor. The citrus notes are in the smell and tail end of the taste, but this is definitely overwhelmingly a hoppy beer... in a great way!!"
"Sculpin is a clear blood orange beer with a strong light brown foamy head. On the nose it's sweetness and hops are not too strong, not to weak but just right. It's taste follows it's nose, with a wonderful grain finish that comes later in the drink. This smooth refreshing beer is unique in it's just right balance and is a good option for a new IPA drinker and a nice change of pace for the hardened one. Definitely a must drink for the beer advocate."
"Appearance: Very bubbly, with a bright orange hue. Looks very refreshing."
"Appearance: Pours a light orange color. Nice, white head, very few carbonation bubbles."
"12 oz can poured a a beautiful bright golden elixir that omits a a finger or two of fluffy off-white head that is quick to dissipate however leaves a delicate foam lacing in the glass. The aroma is captivating with scents of citrus and hops and slight spice at the back of the nose. While the aroma is captivating the taste is addictive, a magnificent blend of bitter hops, citrus, bready malts, and a earthy over tone make for a fantastic beer. The beer has just the right mix of medium body and carbonation to enjoy from beginning to end. Overall I wish this was readily available to me on the east coast, but for now I will enjoy it often during my 6 weeks in beautiful sunny Southern California."
"12 oz can, coded on bottom 13357, which I assume means this was canned about five weeks ago."
"I am nuts about Sculpins little brother, Big Eye, so I have been waiting on Brewforia here in Boise to tap into the Sculpin. Poured bright into a 12 oz glass. Head in moderation, carbonation delicate. Aroma like slicing a grapefruit in half- fresh, clean,inticing. Mouth feel- the Sculpin is break dancing on my palette. Of course grapefruit, tangerine,floral oils, but not nearly as fluent as Big Eye. This beer is bold yet exquisite what ever that means in beer,I guess in your face good. Finishes like a world glass IPA should, balanced, complex ,mystifies the taste buds. Hats off again to Ballast Point. Great beer. Cheers!"
Out of the bottle it's nice and ruddy gold. 
"When I first had this beer it was the best IPA I had ever had (I had rated it a perfect 5), and I’ve had a lot of them, but I’m very very sad that they do not make it like they used to. Something must be done about this or they are going to lose a lot of market share after all of the money they spent."
"Dude @ central market suggested this, did not disappoint"
"A: Very light, golden-orange appearance. Quickly dissipating white head, with considerable lacing."
"Appearance: Pours a very light orange color, almost straw color. Few carbonation bubbles can be seen. The head is fairly short."
13311 - so reasonably fresh.
A: Beautiful translucent amber with an offwhite head.
"The pale amber color and a clear body were typical of the West Coast style of IPA. The smell was a mix of pine and grapefruit, with some tangerine thrown in too. Taste was spicy, piney, bitter, and out-freaking-standing. Just exactly what a juicy IPA should be. Medium body and a slippery mouthfeel fit the style perfectly. A bit of sugary sweetness in the finish to complement the bitterness. Drinkable beyond words, Can I have another please."
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 16oz wide-mouth Ball jar.
"I gave a bottle of Scuplin to my friend, whom never had it before, and he commented to me the next day that it was like this giant pint of grapefruit. That sums up why Scuplin is one of my favorites. There are plenty of IPAs with hop additions and grains that are similar to Scuplin, but never quite hit the bullseye like Scuplin. It really nice West Coast style ale, but gives the grapefruit hop aromas just the right finish, so as not to underwhelm or have that one note hop taste. Fantastic beer and highly recommended."
Sculpin IPA
"One of our favorite IPAs, always pick up a 6 pack or bomber of this fantastic beer when we get the chance. We recently visited this brewery last month, and even went on a tour. A solid brewery definitely. As far as Sculpin goes, a wonderful west coast IPA."
"Poured from bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Good sized head with an amazing amber color. Smells of citrus and hops. Goes down smooth., great mouthfeel. By far one of the better IPA's I have ever had. My first time experiencing a Ballast Point beer and was very impressed. Worth the price point."
A great citrusy IPA from a great brewery. Grapefruit-IPA with a clean appearance and superb taste. Would be a great introduction to what West Coast IPA brewers are shooting for. The beer more than lives up to its reputation as an absolutely outstanding IPA.
"I have had many, many Sculpins. On tap, cans and bottles. I usually love it and considered it one of the better CA IPA's that are widely available. However, I recently picked up a fresh Sculpin bottle (new label, 13252 date) after going all cans for the past several months. I have to say, this is disappointing. Its totally different then the cans in aroma, taste and mouthfeel. "
"Just a wonderful beer. Poured in a pint glass. 4/5 clear, Olympic bronze in color, thick foamy chunky cloud like head melts into your mouth. Light but full bodied and softly fruity. Amazing. Bottle art is spectacular too on the latest run of bottles."
Ap: light orange. Prob about 6 SRM. Good carbonation. Poured a 3 finger head from 22 oz bomber into 16 0z glass.
"Thanks to a friend, Mr. Atwill from Maryland, for sending this to Colorado for me to try. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass."
"Sculpin pours a clear darker copper color with a small lacing head. There is a strong, bold floral aroma. The taste has a very bold fresh hop taste, finishes very dry and a good hint of bitterness, no frills in this one. Great feel, great full flavors. Overall a very bold no playing around hoppy IPA."
"Well for hop lovers, this is a really tasty one, and should certainly be tried. Hops are the dominant force, lots of citrusy flavors, grapefruit, lemon and grapefruit peel, some bitter orange peel, and tons of bitey hops bitterness."
"The first time I had this I defintely didn't see the hype, but this has grown on me. The aroma shows pungent grapefruit and mild malt sweetness. The taste consists of pungent/dank grapefruit at first followed by sweeter tropical hops and semi dry finish. Definitely one of the best widely available ipas out there, but the six pack price will limit the amount of times I purchase this."
A-Orange/amber. Decent white head. Foamy. Bubbly lacing like after-tide foam. Held to light becomes shiny and golden.
"If you get a chance, do not consume this all when fresh. Age the second a few months and compare it. It is really better with some days on it. Or months."
No noticed freshness dating
12 oz. bottle poured into tulip
Poured from a can into my favorite Deep Ellum BC pint glass. This 6er was stamped with a mid-October brew date.
"Poured into a sam adams glass, nice white head developed, thick and creamy, with good retention and lacing. Aroma was very hoppy with strong pine notes. Appearance was clear with a dark golden color. Tasted off the charts of pine and hop, almost a tar type of note. More subtle notes of herb and grass. Mild mouth feel with a strong and bitter aftertaste."
A - Lots of carbonation bubbles up inside the pint with a color of orange sturdy head.
Appearance:
"I've had this in the bottle and on tap. Outstanding IPA!! I Kept seeing and hearing great things about this beer. I stumbled upon it at some tiny little craft beer/DIY brewing store in Port Jefferson NY. I wish I remembered the name because it was a great little store with a great selection and good help. Anyway, the beer caught my eye, and I said ""Finally!!"" Snagged it off the shelf and back to my hotel room I go! Fantastic taste and mouthfeel. I had it around room temperature so I could really get a feel of this beer. And it delivered! Since then I've purchased it several times as well as had it on tap. I think I prefer it from the bottle to a glass myself. But either way, get on this beer if you already haven't!"
"12oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer is pale to orange amber in color and crystal clear. Thin white head. Beautiful and distinct hop aroma (Galena? Amarillo?). Floral, rich, and delicious. Flavor is aggressively hop forward. Big on bitterness but also very enjoyable. Toasty and malty flavors bring just a tad of sweetness to make me coming back for more of this 70 IBU beast."
"excellent in a bottle. doesn't have that annoying pine resin over-IPA thing. even better on nitro-tap or tap. this is my favorite and i've tried more or less all the usual IPAs. ballast point also has a couple other nice ales, but this is my favorite."
Serving - Can poured into a Speiglau IPA Glass
Drinking this bad boy straight from the can like a piece of po' white trash! Can't beat the mango-guava-tropical nose. The hops make love to your tongue but in a totally violent way. Truly one of the finer IPAs out there. Would be a great beer to crush after a long run on a hot day.
Clean amber color with a thick head with good retention and leaving laces.
A - Clear amber/straw color with a finger sized off-white head. Medium lacing
"Beautiful appearance in the glass. Thin foam dissipates quickly, with lots of tiny bubbles, but fine lacing throughout. Sweet pine cone & grapefruit nose. Prominent hops up front balanced nicely with smooth citrusy malt and generous mouthfeel. Seems the perfect example of what IPA should be. Believe the hype."
"I've wanted to review this beer for a while, but I've only had it once. This is my 2nd time."
Appearance: Nice clear golden color with a short white head that leaves tons of lacing
"Time to re-review this one. Started drinking this in 2010 and it was one of my favorite beers. Great smell, very fragrant and sweet tasting. But then the recipe changed. Then the lack of bottle dating resulted in me drinking way old Sculpin so I stopped drinking it."
Poured into a tulip 8/14/2015
What a spectacular beer! I have read that many consider this the best IPA in the world and I can easily see why. The Sculpin lets you know you are drinking a damn good IPA without hitting you over the head with a one note hop bomb that wears out your palate. It starts with a nice dry hoppy bitterness that gives way to a good citrusy bite with a bit of apricot fruitiness. The strong citrusy aroma and full medium body really round out this top notch beer.
"A- Dark golden, with a thick white head. Retention is decent, with some lacing."
I had a 6 pack of this (12 oz bottles)
Appearance - Pale amber orange with 1 finger head and good lacing
Poured from a 12 FL. OZ. bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on day 260 (Sept. 17) of 2013.
poured from a bottle with the code 13305.
"On tap at torinado. Slight white film and lace. Colour is a clear orange gold, no visible carbonation. 3.75"
Updates:
Bomber to Sierra Nevada IPA glass.
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Moderate hand. No date on the bottle. New white label. Oo, fancy!"
A-pour with a really nice golden color with a nice one finger head
"A: copperish to Amber tolled. Slightly cloudy to clean. No sedimentation. Light to moderate clean white lacing, nice settle, perfect carbonation"
"L: Crystal, clear yellow with a decent white head and some good lacing."
This is as close to perfect as you want for an American IPA.
Very nice west coast IPA that pours copper with a bit of off white head. Smells of grapefruit and pine. Taste semi bitter throughout most of the sip with nice florals and citrus.. Bit of a bite and good dry aftertaste. Easily a buy again and hopefully continua to show up fresh on the shelves in NY
12oz bottle poured into Teku glass. 
"Thick, light tan and resilient froth topping a reddish orange brew. Big oily hops to the nose with slight caramel notes. Grapefruit to the tongue up front with a strong malt backbone and a herbal aftertaste. Some spice exists. Lighter than expected. This one seems pretty typical for the style, and I admit I wonder what I'm missing. Going with my honest opinion here, but will revisit when I get the chance. Perhaps I missed something."
"Poured chilled in glass, this brew courtesy buzzlitebeer"
Had in a shaker pint.
"Sculpin...how I love thee!!! It started out with a bomber bottle and is now readily available in six packs, and boy am I happy for that. This very well may be my absolute favorite beer to drink. Perfection in a bottle. "
Beautiful beer. A foggy orange with a beautiful head. A little boozy to the nose with a hint of orange and hops. Starts off a bit hoppy and sour but slides into a smooth orangey finish. This is an excellent beer. It's extremely drinkable for a (somewhat) high ABV. I love it. It really does everything I want my beer to do. Excellent. Just excellent.
"A: Amber body, slow-rising champagne-like bubbles. Huge foamy off-white head."
Poured this beer from a bottle to a chilled glass. 
12oz can to Sierra Nevada IPA glass
Poured into a goblet
"Ok its about time i rated this wonder! 12oz single bought from ""Lifesource"" in Salem. $2.19 Its an attractive pour..orange clear with a lovely half inch off white frothy head. Aroma is very hop forward,green onion,lemon zest and resin...some buried nuttiness from the malts. Taste is similar to nose but without the onion..spicy,hoppy,resin and grapefruit again malts an after thought. Mouth feel is certainly OK..rather flabby finish though. OK beer but not living up to the hype IMO."
Got lucky enough to find this beer at Total Wine and purchased a six pack. Hopefully more to come.
"Beautiful light orange color, with an equally beautiful nose with notes of orange zest, lemon and hops. Flavors of ripe apricot, lemon, and orange blossom balance out the persistent hop bitterness throughout the palate, even if it does finish rather quickly. The lack of depth with this ale is the major reason keeping it from being perfect in our opinion."
"This is a great beer, but between this and the longfin IPA I'd take the longfin."
"Appearance: Slightly hazy, deep orange color. 1/2 finger creamy head with awesome lacing."
"Bottled late September, but I heard she falls of quickly so I am working through my 6er pretty quick as it tastes great right now!"
"One of my favorite GOT TO beers when I'm traveling on the west coast this beer is so identifiable by its nose, big hoppy, grapefruit, piney explosion."
Re-review. 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.
Vibrant orange in appearance and developed a light and frothy two finger head when poured from a 12oz btl.
Had this on tap in SD both at the brewery at a another location. I have also had in the bottle. 
"Presentation: Label artwork is very cool, nicely done, and eye catching with a nautical/fish theme. Label gives web info, a bit of brewery info, as well as an enjoy by date of 6/23/12. Neck label has Ballast Point logo as does cap. "
"Appearance: Slightly hazy and light orange in color, with a large, frothy, white head. "
12 ounce bottle -&gt; New Belgium globe
12oz can(!) poured into an English pint glass. Thanks to MarkJC1018 for giving me this little gem.
Color is an orangish hello with a tall frothy head.
Cutting to the chase on this beer. It's been around a while and there are lots of reviews. I just had this beer today and in my opinion it rivals Lawson's Double Sunshine.
This IPA by Ballast Point is outstanding. You won't be disappointed. The aroma is great. And the taste is even better. ABV's at 7% and you don't taste the alcohol. Not heavy which I love because you can enjoy more than one. You can taste tropical fruits in the beer like mango and pineapple. Not a fruity beer though. Defiantly an IPA taste for sure. 
"bought a six-pack of cans, usually serve in a Sam Adams pint glass, poors easy to get a two fingered head. "
Appearance- Pours a transparent copper with a small white head that recedes to a small foam and leaves moderate lacing.
Poured into a tulip glass
Sometimes when I'm at the local beer store you can strike up a conversation with another patron and get some great tips. Ive had other Ballast Point beers and liked them a lot. Sculpin is pretty amazing. It pours a sparkling gold color with a decent head of foam. Good lacing but would have liked a creamier suds on top. I smell citrus but melon breaks through as well. Good carbonation and the bitterness doesnt knock you on your backside. A great IPA!
"Produced a two finger, white head. Some lacing. Beer color was a translucent gold."
Enjoyed this magnificent beer next Ina tulip glass alongside a Drakes Aroma Coma. Trying these two beers side by side made me realize the floral characteristics I had never noticed in the Aroma Coma. Plan on buying a 4 pack of the Sculpin to enjoy while watching some football!
A: Pours a golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that sticks around for a good while and leaves some nice lacing
"People always told me to try this and for whatever reason I never have. Very happy I just did. Haven’t smelled/tasted this much melon in anything else except Maine Beer Co. ""Another One."" I think this is my new go-to IPA. The bomber is great but i really like the six packs that seem new to the area (Mass/NH)."
"not familiar with Ballast Point Brewing before tonight, this was served as part of a tasting flight at Whole Foods in a 4 oz. tasting glass..."
"A- Caramel-amber, small but full dirty white head, excellent laces"
12 oz bottle poured into tulip glass.
Bought at the local Specs. Poured in to an Allagash goblet.
12oz can poured into a pint glass. Can code is SC 305 13211.
"I think that this is one of the best IPA I have ever had. It had a citrus note in the beginning and great finish. This is the type of beer that I want when I go out to dinner at a great restaurant. It is sophisticated and complex enough to know it is special. Great mouth feel and smooth going down. The appearance is a little cloudy, but worth the burst of flavor. I highly recommend."
"Poured from a can into a snifter. No date on the can or six pack box, unfortunately."
"This beer tastes like how you would expect a San Diego IPA to taste like. Lots of big citrus flavors. Mainly grapefruit I would say. Not much malt going on. 7% ABV isn't too hot either. Good mouthfeel as the bitterness doesn't scorch the tongue or palate. A very solid IPA. Not the best you can find in San Diego or even SoCal for that matter but a solid choice nonetheless. I was very glad to find it at Brewforia in Meridian, Idaho. So thanks to them for getting it fresh to a relatively small market. Cheers Ballast Point!"
22 oz bottle poured into an IPA glass. Enjoy by date of 10/10. Consumed on 9/14.

"Nearly flawless appearance for an IPA. Big billowing white head with fantastic retention, lace-city, over an orange amber beer. "
Fresh Sculpin from Brawley's Beverage poured from the can into a glass.
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tall pint glass. No bottling date.
"12 oz bottle. Pours clear golden with long lasting white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, biscuit malt and ripe fruit. Body is medium and crisp. Huge amount of citrusy, herbal hops dominate the palate with biscuit malt and ripe fruit provide some support. Finish is long and hoppy. Great IPA but hugely overpriced."
"Due to the shop I purchased this fine beer at I'm very inclined to believe it's fresh. Gazing upon this glass I see the picture of perfection when it comes to the proper appearance for an IPA. There's effervescence, flawless clarity, a foamy white head of some size, and the hue of a golden sun. The aroma is fresh and alluring, like fresh flowers and ripe citrus fruit. There's a notable presence of tropical fruits as well, such as pineapple and mango. It seems very juicy and zesty! Just like my favorite beers should, I am pleasantly surprised by the flavor due to its complexity. It is merely kissed by those fruity aspects of the aroma, because it's true heart is chock full of resinous, earthy bitterness. There must be an inclusion of Simcoe hops, because that type of ""fine cigar"" reminiscence is unmistakable. I absolutely love how the more coarse bitterness pulls on the palate while the lighter flavors dance in and out with each sip. There's just a tiny bit of breadiness from the malts, which is just right for this mix. The brewers at Ballast Point came up with a fantastic recipe here, that is a rare treat. It sticks and coats to the mouth too, just how I like the mouthfeel to be. The finish is dry, but not too dry. I also like how the ABV is not off the charts so I can drink a few of them. Overall, this is definitely one of the finest IPAs on the market."
A: Pours clear orange from a 12 ounce can yielding a one-inch thick off-white head which leaves rings and spots of lace.
"I picked up a 12 ounce bottle of this from City Swiggers on the Upper East Side. I don't remember the date on the bottle but my guess is this fresh was entirely at its freshest. After reading several reviews and seeing the ""world class"" status this beer has, I see that it's almost an entirely different beer when you can consume it very fresh. That being said, I enjoyed this but don't see what all of the fuss is about."
"From a 12 oz can into a wine glass. Reviewed from notes dated August 30, 2013."
"On tap at another hipster heaven - Chapter One, Santa Ana, CA."
"I cannot write anything better about this beer than any other entry you may find about it. It is a perfectly balanced IPA. Bitter, citrusy, slight malt sweetness, crisp...DELICIOUS. Stop worrying about rankings and start trusting your taste buds. This beer is world class."
Pour: A clear bronze with about a fingers worth of head with good retention and nice lacing.
"Over all good beer. Pours a little hazy, with a finger of head. Hop aroma with a nice malt balance. Tastes the same; hop forward with a nice balance of toasty malt. Finishes with a citrus hop tartness. Balanced. Maybe not as much as their big eye, but balanced."
Oh! Tomorrow I will taste this off against my #1 IPA Great Divide Titan and this one may win. It's more jammed with radiant flavors. 
"This beer smells and tastes like durians - which I love. It had a slight grapefruit after taste and a hint of banana ester as well in the nose. It won out in a head to head with 90 minute ale, Torpedo, and Hopdevil all of which I rate favorably. Complex, well balanced and clean. Very drinkable medium bodied IPA."
"A - Yellow-orange. I could care less about appearance, so unless it's really beautiful or really ugly, it will get the average of the other ratings. Who drinks a beer for appearance anyway?"
Poured into a pint @ Lost Dog Cafe
Every time I'm astonishing myself with:
12oz. can poured into a hotel tumbler. 
"This is my favorite beer in the planet. Citrussy bitterness. Like biting into a white grapefruit or the taste of that stuff people put on their fingernails to stop from biting them (hey some people like that taste, don't judge me.) My only problem with this beer is I can't get it living in GA. Ill be living in the city of angels soon though, can't wait."
A - Pours a nice orange with a one-inch white head. Good amount of lacing.
Big thanks to MrDave for the hook up with this:
22oz Bomber
Pours a clear orange hue with a one finger head with decent retention and sticky lacing. 
"Appearance - Pours 2 fingers of golden eggshell foam, pours a very slightly cloudy light golden yellow orange. Lots of small bubbles in the body, good looking ipa. I keep a solid finger of foam to the end of the glass, with a ring of foam after each quaff - perfect."
"6 packs on the east coast, SWEET! 3-4 weeks old. Cash money."
Poured into a pint glass from a bottle.
The three finger head is white; it sinks slowly leaving lots of lacing. The clear liquid is golden coloured. 
appearance - very nice golden color. pours a nice head and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. 
"Wow! Although I later learned this beer is famous, it was a surprise for me, and therefore wins its high rating on its own merits. Probably the best taste in a bottle I have ever had. Phenomenal take off, plenty of hops and complex flavors with the most delicate and enjoyable finish. Nicely done, boys! Sets the standard for IPAs."
Poured from the bottle into a pint glass
A deep orange color. Cloudy. 1/2 finger bubbly white head which hung around. Some lacing
"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a porter glass. This is a great beer that I've had from a bottle, draft and now in a can thanks to Ballast Point's decision to can their beers. I love it when great breweries can their beers because it makes it so much easier to take their beer to the pool or other places that don't allow glass. "
Bottle to tulip glass.
Opened the bomber I had in the fridge because I just saw cases of 12 oz. bottles at a local store and wanted to see if it was worth paying $50 for a case. Poured from the 22 oz. bottle into a standard Harpoon beer glass.
eyes...
I wish I had written out a full scoresheet when I had this beer. With a group of other folks after a meeting and did not have anything to write on with me. Not even a phone. This is what I remember from two nights ago. 
"Another re-review. Last time I had this was when I was new to IPA. Let's see if it holds up to my new, more ""refined"" palate. "
Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 12 oz bottle.
"For this popular beer, I wanted to have it a few times before rating, both in bottle and on tap. It's completely possible that the bottles I had were not as fresh, because I didn't like them. However, after visiting San Diego and also had it locally (yeah!) on tap, it changed my perception of it. In other words, it's best when fresh."
Finally picked up a 6 pack of this after getting a $2 off coupon from Binnys for IPA Day. Ever since Ballast Point arrived in IL I've had this on my want list.
"Appearance: orangey gold with fizzy white head, great clarity"
Pale amber with one finger of white head and moderate amount of lace. Smell is pungent hop aroma. Lots of piney hop aroma with a minor amount of malt.
Wonderful Beer! Reminds me of Heady Topper... And I can actually buy it locally.
"Beautiful IPA. Lovely balance. So glad it's back in CT. Lots of citrus, lots of hops. Little more west coast style all in all, but really just wonderful. Super fresh too! Nose is a little lighter than some big DIPAs, but it's still more than enough to get your mouth watering. And the actual flavors follow suit perfectly."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, 1/2 finger of head, dissipates quickly."
"22 oz. bottle, with enjoy by date of 09/22/2013 printed on the label. Exponentially stoked to try this beer based on the hype surrounding it. My first encounter with a bottle of Ballast Point Sculpin IPA, and my first beer from Ballast Point!"
12 oz bottle poured into pint glass
"a clean golden pour with 2 fingers of head which dissipated very slowly and left behind possibly the most lacing i've seen in any beer. aromas of pine and grapefruit, caramel, very hop forward. the flavor is again very hop forward mostly of grapefruit, citrusy sweetness with a lingering piney bitterness.. a nice caramel bready malt kicks in mid-palate. medium in body with moderate carbonation, creamy feel for an ipa."
Pale golden color gave way to a thick billowing head that lasted for quite a while and laced well.
"Pours light amber color with thick foamy head. Good head retention and excellent lacing. Hoppy, piney aroma that is slightly citric. Malty taste up front, followed by mod piney hop. Very good transition from malt to hops in this one. Mod bitter piney aftertaste. It is really a very good IPA. Oddly enough, it may not be my favorite from Ballast Point, although I know that many people would disagree with me."
A bar near me has started to carry a much better selection of beers which is where I got to finally try this amazing IPA. The color is a crisp golden caramel and it pours with a light head. The citrus undertones pair nicely with the hoppyness of the beer. Overall I was very happy with this selection and look forward to enjoying this again.
"Smell is fragrent floral and a little spicy, the taste matches the smell closely with no offnotes, doesn't have the silky or somewhat viscous mouthfeel that I prefer in my favorite IPAs but it is smooth nonetheless. Amber color with a creamy head. From my own personal experience, I consider this a top tier IPA. It is on my short list of IPAs to seek out when I'm making a beer selection..."
Served from the bottle into a nonic glass. Best by 11/27/13.
"In a word, perfection. Citrusy, lightly fruity, not much herbal hop flavor it all; a little residual sweetness from what tastes like a gorgeous marriage of caramel hops with the prerequisite two-row. Color is dark gold, not quite brassy with beautiful lacing and head retention. An exceptional and fantastic IPA, one of the best in the world."
poured from a 12 oz to a pint glass
A- Clear deep gold with a thin white cap that coated the glass all the way down.
"Thick, ~4 finger fluffy flat white head from a solid can pour. Very good retention. Brew is a light gold/amber, clear, transparent. Leaves behind thick lacing like a nightmare spiderweb."
Tried in the bottle and it was super. Then tried it on tap at the LA vegan beer fest last spring. 
"Canned 6/26/13 and picked up at The Beer Temple in Chicago. Oh, how I'm looking forward to this..."
"Poured from a 12 bottle into an IPA glass. Pours an orange golden color with a small fluffy head. Smells of earthy and piney hops, nice aroma. Tastes of earthy hops and nice grain bouquet. Beer is light bodied and refreshing, very much finishing smooth with good to slightly high carbonation. Overall, an above average beer."
"Pours a hazy sandy orange with a white head, Aroma is sweet and juicy with some mango and grapefruit paired with a nice, toasty bready foundation. Flavor is quite similar.Mold bitterness in the finish. A crisp, active mouthfeel. OVerall, great IPA. Glad to have finally tried."
"Golden and transparent in color; Bright, fruity, and floral in smell. This beer came recommended by a friend, and I suppose I can see why he likes it. Sculpin is a clean IPA similar to various offerings from Lagunitas, but less punchy than Founders. It's not as sweet as it smells, but hoppier than the nose suggests. It's also cleaner than a double IPA, while carrying some DIPA characteristics that I enjoy. The finish is dry and leaves your palette in a position to try something radically different without the side effects of stronger/wilder IPAs. This is a great everyday IPA, and I'd rate it higher if it were priced more reasonably. I don't think it's worth as much as it costs, but that's subjective."
"A- On tap in home, got a huge head of foam initially then subsidises to nice quarter inch white thick foam. Leaves pretty lacing on glass. Golden amber color but in low light not really sure. "

750 mL bottle poured into pint glass
"Definitely one of my favorite IPAs to date; Sculpin is hoppy, sharp, balanced, and remarkably tasty."
"I had this before from a bottle but found it better from the can. By the way, that can came from the creator of the canquest, woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, some citrus. Taste is bitter, lots of hops, some citrus, a touch of malts, pretty tasty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a fine beer."
"Sculpin IPA is a great beer. Although they recently changed their formula which I believe is a downgrade, this beer can be found at a lot of locations. It is distributed throughout every liquor store I've come accross and doesn't fail to impress anyone who dives into craft beer."
"This is a beer I've been wanting to try for some time. Heard its praise, never had the chance until it recently got Oregon distro. Looks great, very clear with a thin light head, good carb. The nose is my favorite thing about this, smells like a fair amount of amarillo went into it. I don't know how fresh this is, but I was expecting a bit more out of this one. The bitter is there, I just wanted more floral or citrus presence. It's there, don't get me wrong, I just expected more given all the hype I've heard. Maybe it's just the living in the PNW that's talking, but I think there are other IPAs out there to be had for cheaper that are of comparable or higher quality."
"Purchased at Total Wine in Phoenix, AZ. ""Enjoy by 08/12/13."" Poured into an Alesmith Ten Year Anniversary tulip glass. Golden orange in color, somewhat hazy but mostly clear. Rapidly thinning cream-colored head. Appealing thick, sticky lacing. Aromas of pine, candied grapefruit, lemon rind. Slight malt sweetness at first, but a sturdy bitterness quickly takes over and sustains throughout the finish. A caramel-sweet base carries massive citrus rind and pine sap flavors. Some soft apricot and mango notes appear throughout. Nice and light on the palate with a smooth, dry finish. Must-try for IPA aficionados, although somewhat pricey at $9 a bottle."
Enjoy by date 9/27/13.
A: Beautiful light golden/orange with small head and light lacing.
"Local to San Diego these go for $3 on tap at some spots. My go to beer if available due to how consistently it makes me happy. After trying HT I've now placed Sculpin at #2 on my IPA list... Sad story but nonetheless an awesome beer. Clear gold/amber color and citrus fruit on the nose. Mouth feel is good, very dry after it goes down with some bitterness. GREAT BEER. $$$"
Finally! Ballast Point is available in WA! More San Diego beer goodness for me to get my hands on. Been wanting to try this one for awhile now.
A - on tap at the World of Beer; pours a nice orange color with a 1/2 inch head.
"Pours out a clear brassy gold. Thin head. Some piney/citrus hops in the nose with a pale maltiness that's fairly prevalent. Touch of booze in the nose. Taste is fairly balanced overall. Quite a bit of maltiness and sweetness up front. Dries out in the finish a touch. Doesn't beat you over the head with hop flavor but has a pretty punchy bitterness in the finish. Bitterness lingers. I enjoy the bitterness, but I'd prefer a touch more hop flavor. Mouthfeel isn't thick and syrupy, which is a very good thing, but it could use a bit more body. Carbonation could be a little more assertive for my tastes. Overall this is a pretty solid IPA with nothing really ""off"" about it. I really just don't understand the $15 price tag for the 6 though. Give me a Stone IPA over this in flavor and price, but I can't really hate on this either. Again, this is solid, but I just don't understand the hype."

A 12 ounce bottle poured into a shaker pint glass. 
"Pours out a beautiful clear amber, the head is big and foamy. Reminiscent of its English ancestors, it dissipates quickly but still manages to leave nice sticky lacing. The aroma is big and bold, with nice tropical fruit notes. The taste is equally delicious and the numerous hops additions are apparent. The body is actually a little thinner than I would've thought for such a hopped up beer but it doesn't detract in any way. It's an incredible IPA."
"Pours a moderate sized head with okay retention. Beer is golden orange in color. Leaves a little less than a moderate amount of spotted lacing. Smells of grapefruit, pine, and orange, just a touch of breadiness."
"What is the relationship between a fish on a label and a killer IPA? I don't know but it seems that the majority of IPA's I drink with some kind of fish, fisherman, etc are kickass and this one is no different. This one was recommended to me by someone at the local bottle shop as I was browsing. At first I was hesitant to purchase an 22oz IPA for $7.99... I mean a DIPA maybe but an IPA??? He assured me it would be worth it so I took the bait(no pun intended with the fishing analogies). Well I'll be hooked(hey another fishing analogy) but he was right... this is one killer IPA. A perfect balance between hops and malt and everything in between. Amazing! Reminds me of another IPA with a fish on it from the great lakes... very nice. I know I shouldn't base part of my score off of price but I'm gonna have to slightly lower the overall by .25 simply due to it is overpriced for a 22oz bomber IMHO though I assume not the brewery's fault... if i could find this in a 6pk in my area it just may be a go-to. Very nice."
"Pours clear light amber with an orange hue. Not much head, no real retention. Bubbles are streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Soapy wet lace. Nose is good deep caramel malt, breaddy and it smells really smooth. Hops are fruity and tropical. Mango, hints of citrus, very floral and tea like and just a touch of pine for depth. Peaches too. The malt is really captivating me and I love malt. Taste is scrumptious. It drinks light and fruity and like iced tea. Body is supple but not biting, carbonation is ample but soft. The malt is so smooth and offers plenty of bread and a little cracker. It doesn’t outshine the hops though which remain delicate as the fruit takes over the palate. It’s juicy and sweet. It isn’t too oily or resinous but it has a good bitter and it it’s almost dry but not quite. It has perfect balance and it isn’t too sweet and the bitter isn’t all there is."
A: a very light orange with a one finger fluffy head that is hanging around. looks like a standard ipa

A - Clear golden body. light white foam head - 1-1.5 inch in height
A - Nice clear golden body. White foam head - 1-1.5inch in height with aggressive poor. 
An absolutely amazing India Pale Ale. This is a west coast IPA at its best!! The clarity of the beer is great. A wonderful balance of bitterness and dankness!! As huge fan of IPA's this along with Bear Republic's Racer 5 are my go-to's on any given day!! Keep up the great brew's Ballast!!

"A: poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass, light orange amber colored with a huge white head that lingers leaving good lacing, cloudy"
"One of the classic IPAs coming out of Southern California. Filtered clean with a rich, golden orange color when served at the bar. The combination of the hop flavor and aroma is what I really enjoy about this beers. Not piney but more floral/citrus. The malt body on Sculpin is minimal but not critical since the hops are not overpowering and the beer finishes clean and refreshing. "
A: pour light amber with a nice off white one finger head. Good lacing all around. Head has good retention 
"this ballast point ipa is pretty good. nice color- slightly cloudy. the smell is super hoppy with a touch of citrus. the taste hast that nice ipa bitterness, a good solid bitter. i do wish there was some more citrus in the flavor. that complaint is a stretch- thats all i got, if i have to say something. bottom line- if youre in the mood for an ipa this one will definitely hit your spot ."
"Not the first time I've had it. Last time I let a bomber sit too long in my fridge and it mellowed out way too much, I was underwhelmed. 12oz in to the trusty tulip."
P: Pours a clear (tiny specks) apricot body with a off white milky head that leaves behind wet sloppy lacing.

"What can you say about one of the best? Some might call this a hop bomb, but its balanced so well they would be as wrong as Ariel was for taking those girls. A strong, dry hop presentation with spice, pine notes off of a thin white, low carbonation head. Beers like this make me want to live in the ballast point parking lot."
"Poured into becker. Golden orange, the color of honey, with a thick fluffy white head that fades after a bit but seems to leave lots of lacing. Smells of floral hops with tropical fruit; pineapple and mango are noticeable. Taste is less hoppy than the smell; sweet and clear up front with hops coming in at the end, quite a bitter finish though. A great drinkable IPA though; if the hop flavor had been all throughout, it would have been more of a sipper."
"12 oz. bottle, best by 9/27/2013, poured into a Duvel tulip. With a reasonably aggressive pour, I get nearly two fingers of dense, off-white head, over a clear, light amber body that has bit of yellow tint. Decent retention a little lacing."
"A- Light in color, not much head retention"
"This is a very good beer and certainly one of the most drinkable IPA's I've ever come across. No real alcohol taste or hop bite...it doesn't have that devastatingly fresh smell, taste or mouthfeel but it's clearly a well put together IPA with excellent balance that makes it extremely easy to down without regret or hesitation. This would be a great beer for introducing people to IPA's or for those that don't like the bitterness. Definitely worth a try but not amazing."
"A - Nice, light tangerine color with a medium to large, bubbly, airy, foamy, white head. Really nice retention and a nice coating of lace."
22oz bomber poured into a snifter. Enjoy by date of 09/22/13. Ballast Point just started distributing to my area.
A - Amber color with three fingers of offwhite head. Moderate lacing.
A: Pours out a very clear amber color with one finger of white head.
Very pumped to have finally reeled in the legendary Sculpin. So happy to have a great wife to give me gifts like this for our anniversary.
What a great Ipa. I have had these at different times however. This is a beer you want fresh. If you are at the store check the date on it. It is not the best when old. And definitely don't age this beer. But when fresh it is pretty much flawless. It is closer in style to a Founders then a Three Floyds as it does not have all the citrus on the nose like a Floyds or even in the taste but it is a great beer. I would never say no to a Sculpin in fact I would hunt it out. It is worth the money.

"The best IPA I have ever had, great smell and taste, I love it!! It has hints of citrus, grapefruit and the perfect amount of hops. Tastes good on bottle, but much better on draft. It has a nice color that is a light golden color that is slightly cloudy."
"This was a great beer. Poured from a bottle at home. This San Diego brewery is top notch. Pours a nice copper color and the carbonation and head of the beer stayed consistent throughout the glass. As you get the initial smell, you know they banged out a perfect IPA. Very happy after tasting...great hoppy though balanced beer that is not crazy heavy in alcohol content which I appreciate. This is going to be a go to for me."
"I don't think I've ever poured a beer with such beautiful rich hearty golden color. The light fruity smell, in my opinion, is absolutely perfect. Let me say, I am still trying to become an IPA fan but I still struggle with the bitterness. As far as IPA's go though, this one is quite tasty although that may be that I am a fan of grapefruit and Sculpin tastes ALOT like grapefruit. Very thin and light in the mouth, that I really like, with a very light and fluffy head, that I also I like. I was drinking this one with some chips and salsa and for me, I don't think IPAs and salty foods go that well together. I think it really accentuates the bitterness of the IPA. Seems like it would have gone a lot better with a nice medium rare piece of beef. Next time...."
"Finally, at long last, I got the chance to enjoy a sculpin. actually, I enjoyed three of them! the setting was the strip house steak joint in the planet Hollywood casino in las vegas, Nevada. I sat down with my hockey teammates, who all ordered a fancy cabernet, but I asked to glance at the beer list, and there it was, sculpin ipa. it poured a beautiful cloudy grassy pale golden color, with an inch or so of off white head that lasts forever, leaves excellent lacing, and is easily reinvigorated with a swirl the wine glass I asked the server to bring me. the nose on it is long and hoppy, but not in that dank oily sweet fruity way that some of these are, but more subtle, not more simple, but more in focus, more sure of its identity. there are notes of fresh pineapple and spruce, but this is neither bitter nor sweet. its got an impressive degree of malt balance, as well as a yeast character that reminds me of some of the European ipa offerings. the flavor is standalone. its got a gorgeous hop bouquet, with some floral notes in there too, but I cannot quite place any of the specific varietals. less citrus and more pine than I expected, and a forever finish that's both refreshing and filling to a degree. the alcohol is impossible to pick out. feel is also lovely, with effervescently bright carbonation that tickles the tongue without being invasive, and a medium body that doesn't stand in the way of the flavor. this was the absolutely perfect complement to a 20 ounce bone in ribeye, dry aged, rare. I had three of these with my steak, and would have had more if they weren't 12 bucks a go. what a glorious ipa this is, distinct from the crowd, and worth every word of the hype. really sensational brew."
"Poured into a Sam Adams beer glass with an amber color and a light head that faded quickly. Smell of grapefruit and strong bitter taste on the front end. Floral hops linger in the mouth. Sweet malt back that nicely rounds out the hops. Very nice carbonation and just a bit of a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, not as good as I expected but it is an excellent IPA."
"Very clear media amber color, light head that fades quickly, some sticky lacing. Stong smell of grapefruit and and pine. Strong bitter taste on the front end. A very complex hope flavor with floral elements, grapefruit and pine. Floral hops linger in the mouth. Sweet malt back that nicely rounds out the hops. Very nice carbonation and just a bit of a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is an excellent IPA. One of the best."

"Chilled 12oz bottle, enjoy by 4/22/2013, poured into a Bell's snifter and quaffed today 4/14/2013. So this beer wasn't drank fresh- at worst this is a placeholder review for when I do get a fresher bottle. Thanks to mgm54 for providing this one as an extra."
"I don't believe I've ever given a perfect score, but this beer is amazing. It pours a golden orange with a thin white head. Excellent retention and lace. Aroma is of fruits,spice,grassy hops. Body is solid, and nicely carbonated. Taste is an explosion of fruity hops. Crisp and smooth with a great finish. I'm at a loss for words. I gave this beer a perfect score, because for me there is nothing that could be done to improve it. Go out and find this beer if at all possiable. EXCELLENT!"
Served cool from a bottle into a Dimpled Mug Glass.
"Pours a clear, pale amber color. Two finger head with good retention. Sparse, but nice and intricate lace curtains adorn the glass. Pungent, fruity, floral aroma. Even though this bottle is only 4 weeks old, if the info on https://sites.google.com/site/freshbeeronly/u-s-breweries is still up to date, it doesn't seem as aromatic as previous bottles I've had. Still, there's a lot to enjoy here. Well integrated tropical fruit, citrus rind, and sap."
You had this beer. 
"Appearance: Great finger thick, dense, fine head. Foggy. Golden orange with yellow and grape hues"
"Tried a bottled Sculpin for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was very good, but didn't exactly blow me away. I think it may have been sitting on the shelf for a minute. Last night I was fortunate enough to get in on a freshly-tapped keg of Sculpin at Taylor's Restaurant, and felt it worthy of a re-review."
Appearance: It has a nice hazy golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderately and leaves nice lacing.

"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a tulip. Purchased in North Attleboro, MA"
"Sculpin sits crystal clear in the glass, a light golden amber hue with a big rocky white head of foam leaving really nice lacing as you drink. Nice looking beer."
"A recent lunch at Rustico in Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, DC, provided an opportunity to enjoy this Ballast Point stalwart on cask. Poured into the requisite snifter, this beauty boasts a semi-translucent body of amber that shimmers seductively beneath a sheer veneer of spongy froth."
"Excellent brew from down San Diego way. Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA is a very light kind of American IPA, with the hops balanced well with lots of fruit and citrus. The finished product is very drinkable and smooth, with a broad, albeit, indecipherable pallet. Pricey, but excellent."
"22oz bomber, can't find a bottled on date"
Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass.
"Very beautiful beer. Clear, nice head and good retention. Aroma is dominated by tropical fruits which also come through in the taste. Dry and quite bitter aftertaste. Creamy body with just the right amount of carbonation. Very solid IPA!"

12oz undated bottle into glass.
A - pours a clear gold with a white head and some lace. Bubbly.
"Pours like liquid gold, with the beautiful bullion color to match. The nose is citrus, grapefruit. Mild carbonation allows for maximum hop exposure on tongue. Taste develops slowly, like a Godspeed You! Black Emperor tune. Aftertaste is lingeringly lovely. I'd sip this Sculpin sitting on a dock."
"Best by 25 May 2013. Trying to taste all of the beers of fame, so I traded for this one. Thanks to BeerThirty for the bottle. Tasted 16 March 2013."

"Picked up a sixer for $13.49, just getting into IPAs and this was the most I have ever paid in my life for a sixer, but man oh man....was it worth it."
12 oz bottle poured into snifter. 
"Pours a cloudy gold with typical lace. Lots of sweet orange on the nose, very nice. Taste? Well, maybe mine is a tad stale from being on the shelf for a bit, but I’m not seeing where this beer’s legendary status comes from. I get a fair amount of juicy orange, which I like, but it doesn’t have the biggest bite and there’s a funky aftertaste I can’t quite place. A good one for sure, but it wouldn’t make my personal IPA top-10."
Ballast Point Brewing Company - Sculpin India Pale Ale - 1pt 6fl oz bottle
"Very nice IPA. Aroma mellow citrus fruits, well balanced but not screaming pine like some good IPAs. Slight passion fruit. No head retention, not that pretty. Light amber. Very well balanced with sharp but quickly fading citrus fruit. Beautiful bitterness it finish with a sharp tang at the end. Great mouth feel. Coats your mouth. Overall very nice, not the best IPA in the world anymore but still up there."
"Look: Golden orange with a big off-white head, poured from the can"
"I'd like to start out by saying that if you are deciding to buy Ballast Point Sculipn IPA in a $9 bomber or the six pack for $15, do yourself a favor and go for the six pack. All of the subtle tropical delicacies are prominent in this flavorlful/hoppy and satisfying IPA. Truth be told, $9 is a steep price for a bomber, one that raises expectations extremely high,maybe too high, into the price range of the highly coveted Lawson's Ale."
"Nice pour - Amber to brown in color with a decent head at pour. Some lacing. Finer carbonation. Aroma is bitter citrus. Beautiful clean and refreshing IPA - flavor shows some floral and citrus but bolder than many with similar hop varieties. Sweet up front with a nice, long bitter after taste."
"12 oz bottle purchased from Beers of the World in Rochester, NY."
Best by 6/27/13
"Pale, golden with a ivory cap that melts away leaving sticky lace on the glass. Decent nose, grapefruit and pine with toasted grain. Tasty and decently hoppy with resinous pine and citrus notes up front with grain and hop oily bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. A solid IPA for sure."
"On tap at the Bridgeview Tavern in Tarrytown, NY. Nice straw color, pretty clear, very nice head, a great looking beer! The smell is all grapefruit and it's good; not overpowering, but good. The taste is good as well, but doesn't quite live up to the smell. Carbonation, mouthfeel, etc. all really well done. It's well balanced and is just a solid American IPA!"
"A: A very, very clear light copper color. About 3/4 finger white head made of medium sized bubbles. Head retention was decent, and it leaves nice lacing all around the glass."
"EDIT: This is definitely not as great out of the 12oz bottle (which was incidentally marked with a freshness date of ""07/2013""). None of the tropical fruits are present, and there's a tinge of citrus candied flavor but in a very underwhelming flavor. For the high price that this is for a bomber, it seems that finding the ultimate fresh Sculpin batch is going to be one of the most frustrating craft beer searches of my life."
"This brew has a mild aroma that at first had me slightly bummed. It has an amber color and pours a good healthy head. The taste is very good, the kind of IPA you could drink often. Overall I thought that this was a quality IPA and I would purchase again."
A: Bright gold/orange color with frothy head and chunky lacing.
Pours a beautiful clear golden color with a nice head. The smell is very nice definitely tropical and citrusy. Says enjoy by 6/29/13. It taste extremely fresh. This is my first time trying this beer. It was recommended by a good friend and this beer did not disappoint. Its very smooth and very easy to drink I will definitely be getting some more soon.
I'm not a hop head so maybe I'm missing the boat with this beer but I found it to be very average. The past month I've been drinking nothing but IPAs and this one is far down on my list. The aroma has some nice floral and piney notes and the appearance is above average but I found the taste unbalanced with little malt to balance the bitterness of the hops. The citrus flavors that others have mentioned were lacking and mouthfeel was thin. Maybe my expectations were too high but I just don't see the appeal. I'm glad I didn't buy the six pack.
Updated: 
"I absolutely loved this beer! Very smooth and easy to drink, yet still had a very complex flavor profile and appealing nose to it. Pours a beautifully clear and slightly copper hue with lots of small carbonation bubbles. One of my new favorites! I wish it was easier to get up here in Northern, California."
"Picked up a few bottles of this (no idea why I did not grab more) on a sojourn to Virginia Beach over the weekend. Enjoy By 6/15/13, exceedingly fresh."
"A - Very light. Pours a bright golden yellow, with a 3 finger head."
"A: Thin golden color, with a thick rocky white head. "
"Not sure why this gets such high ratings. To me, there's nothing special about it at all. Aroma is similar to Sierra Nevada Torpedo. A bit sour with a very small hint of sweetness. Mostly floral, hardly any citrus in the aroma at all. Taste is a little better, but not by much. Still no citrus. Just some bitter hops. Thin body, not much mouthfeel. Has sort of a ""tea-like"" flavor to it that throws me off. The finish is clean, doesn't leave much of an aftertaste -- I guess that's the best part of the beer. This is $13.99 in my area and it's actually worth about HALF of that. A big disappointment for me."
"Literally the best IPA on the planet. If you're lucky enough to make it to the brewery when they have their special Habanero brew, you're in for a treat. Sculpin IPA infused with with the spice of Habenero peppers...you'll have to taste it to understand. Very spicy, but the spice and the bitterness of the IPA blend perfectly."

"Bomber to my russian river goblet, best by 4/13"
"This is some of the freshest Sculpin I have been able to get a hold of yet, so I thought I would do a full review since it is one of my all time fave's. Bottle date enjoy by 7-28-13. This beer pours a nice golden amber with a finger of head. The first thing that really stands out is the aroma of fresh tropical fruits and citrus with a small hint of alcohol. The taste is outstanding, piney, citrus hop bite with a hint of malt. Outstanding job by Ballast Point on their flagship brew, deserves all the hype it gets! A staple in my fridge as long as they keep churning it out!"
Appearance: A very bright orange color. Clear clean look. About a finger worth of head on the pour which quickly dissipated. Some carbonation throughout.

Bought a bomber at an HEB in Round Rock for about 8 bucks.
"Thanks to GetMeAnIPA for this one... I've heard very good things and I've been ISO Sculpin for a long time. Pours a somewhat dull, golden-yellow color with a few orange and light-amber tints. Moderate haze throughout, topped off with a creamy and fine eggshell colored head - decent retention and some nice chunky lacing is left behind. "
"I had this beer almost exactly 5 years ago, before I started writing reviews, so I thought I'd give it another go. This one was a can dated 11/28/17, so it's about 2 months old. Pours a light amber with a modest off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Initial impression is a subdued blend of grapefruit, mango, lemon, and pine. Surprisingly mellow, but maybe that has something to do with the age. Mouthfeel is medium as is carbonation. Quite refreshing. Finish is slightly bitter but not objectionably so. Not bad, but not as good as I remember. There are many better AIPAs out there at a better price point."
"A: Fairly clear - beer colored actually - not light, not dark. Bubbles moving lazily through the beer. Decent head retention."
"Poured from a bomber into a Russian River Stemmed Glass. ""Enjoy By 04/13/13"" which is over 2 months from now."

I have been wanting to try this beer forever and finally was able to score a six-pack.
"This, in my opinion, is one of the benchmark IPAs (Pliny, Bells Two-Hearted, Stone, Odell Myrcenary). "
"An excellent IPA. Although this is not my favorite style, I have to give credit where credit is due. Comparable in quality to Two-Hearted. The initial taste is very good, while the hops tend to take over too much as you drink it (from my perspective). It's very balanced, smooth, and an easy drinker, so it is well done regardless. If you like IPA's, I like others definitely recommend it. Glad I tried it. I may do so again some day."
"From the growler (filled a day prior) to a pint glass, served at 42F."
Pours a nice golden color with a foamy white head that hangs around and leaves some nice lacing.
"I drank it straight out of the bottle, same as most my 12 oz-ers. So I have no idea what it looks like."
"Appearance: Orange-hued, a bit on the lighter orange side for an IPA."
"22oz bottle from Hops & Vines (Asheville, NC). 8.99. Best by 4/20/13, I assume that means bottled 12/20/12. Served in a Hardywood GBS goblet. "
"Sculpin has only recently come to my region, so for the time being I get to try it fresh. This isn't my first time trying it, but after having it a couple of times, it is time for a review. This one was bottled less than three weeks ago. Best by 7/21/13"
L – very nice golden peach color with finger head liquid white small bubbles 
22 oz bottle poured into a nonic pint glass at fridge-cellar temperature.
Off the tap into a tulip glass. One finger of head on a deep golden colored body.
"Pours golden orange, nice white single finger head. Smells and tastes a lot like dark fruit and malt, bready, caramel, lemon, earthy. Taste is malty for an IPA but has a nice hop presence too. This was a little less hoppy than I prefer. It is extremely balanced and easy drinking but it didn't hit me at a 100. I'd say this one is a little overrated, I'd love to try it on tap to compare."
Enjoyed after very fresh batch made it to the east coast--12 oz bottle in tulip glass.
12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Enjoy by 04/02/13.
"Appearance: Gold, good carbonation and head."
"The beer was poured into a snifter to better capture the aroma on this one. The appearance was a copper color with red accents mingling throughout the glass. A modest white head topped the glass with the beer demonstrating lacing and a solid level of retention as the beer disappeared. The beer exploded with a grapefruit aroma. It may be an exaggeration, but I might suggest you could smell this one from the other side of the room. On the initial taste, one detects grapefruit, papaya, apricot, and lemon on the back of the tongue. The IPA progresses from sweet to more bitter as the sample continues. Grassy notes emerge and the malt backbone is just noticeable. The presence of the malt is just noticeable enough to make sure this is something more than a hop-bomb. In the aftertaste, the citrus notes combine as though it has become citrus candy. There is a noticeable warming sensation that also emerges. The thickness allows that taste to linger with the warming sensation."
"Perfect IPA. Not sure what else to say, but I will:"
Appearance is transparent orange with a 2 finger head that coated the glass as it was drank. 
"A: average golden straw, transparent IPA color. Nothing special."
"pours a dark golden color with well defined pillow top head, looks great. Smell is a little bit of everything, from the hop vine. Citrus, pine, dank, it's all there, certainly not one dimensional and some nice bready malts as well."
"Trade from Ibrew2or3. Thanks. Had this just after a Westy 12, and it still shines. Pours loght orange, beautifully clear with a small and quickly receding head. This is one of the prettiest IPAs I have seen. Smell is divine, with floral grapefruit, pine, apricot, and mango. Smells sweet but not overly so. Best smelling for a non-double ipa for me. Bitter hop forward brew. Full bodied and sweet with heavy grapefruit and apricot hop notes. Medium mouthfeel with medium-low catbonation for the style. Lingering bitterness. Beautifully done."

For those who are fans of Nugget Nectar, this is one if for you. Huge floral hops bursting with the resin from the hop profile. Super hoppy with only the slightlest bite of bitterness on the palate."

I had never had anything from Ballast Point before and seeing how many people enjoy this, it looked like this was a good one to start off with. Even though I didn't see this as being outstanding, this was one of the better American IPA's that I've had and it nearly measure up to the flagships of Stone and Sierra Nevada."

Poured from a bomber into a tulip.
Here goes my first review on Ba. I just started drinking craft beer last summer. IPA's for me has been love at first sip. I chose the Sculpin IPA after reading reviews here for it. I picked up a bomber at my grocer. The taste was very smooth and the IPA bitterness was right where it should be in my opinion. The hops are obvious but so well balanced that it won't turn you off even if you are a non IPA fan this is a good beer. ABV is appropriate and this could easily be a session IPA. Sculpin lives up to its name and does not dissapoint.
"What can't be said about this delicious treat of San Diego. Drinking this beauty from the brewery is bliss, and having it in a bottle is near perfect - even room temperature."
Really excited to pick this one up on my trip outside of my home state of GA. Poured this into a pint.
"22oz bottle shared with a friend. Pours a hazed golden-tangerine color with a white head that holds decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are juicy, tropical and citric with pineapple, mango, and mandarin with biscuity malt. Tastes are biscuity malt up front with a touch of light caramel followed quickly by pungent & piny hops balanced wonderfully with tropical mango and juicy pineapple notes. Mouth-feel is medium and fairly resinous; finishes semi-dry & bitter, but incredibly balanced with sweet and bitter. Overall, this is one of my favorite American IPAs, but I don't buy it very often because it's quite overpriced in comparison to other solid IPAs in an oversaturated IPA market."
12oz bottle in Sam Adams glass
A: Poured from the growler into a Duvel tulip. Bosy is clear orangey-amber that appears more golden in color when backlit. Small head of white that leaves good splotchy lace with each sip.
A: pours an awesome light orange with a subtle rust-like hint. the carbonation is great and the head formation is white in color with tight tiny bubbles. head dissipates rather quickly but hugs the rim of glass.

First time taste
"Straight pour from 12oz pry-off bottle to a stemmed tulip (Belgian Independence Day tulip). Freshness date of January 24, 2013 printed in white ink near the bottom-left corner of the front label (“SC 173 ENJOY BY 01/24/13”). According to Ballast Point, their freshness dates are set four months from bottling, so I’m assuming this was bottled on September 24, 2012, making this bottle just a day shy of four weeks old on the day of consumption.

"Pours golden color with white head that dissipates pretty quickly. Bottle date reads ""enjoy by 10/6/12""...DAMN IT! How many times will it take for me to pay attention?"
Thanks to tone77 for this beer! The beer pours amber and copper in color. It has a short head of thick off-white foam. 
"What's not to like, here? Beautiful orange golden body with a nice head. Hints of peach and citrus hit the nose and a tinge of lemon on the tongue gives it a beautiful balance. Goes down smoothly and leaves a nice typical IPA aftertaste with more fruity flavors."
Poured from 22oz bottle into Duvel tulip glass.
"a: poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip. dated as ""best by"" sometime in January 2013 (not about to dig the bottle out of the trash to find the exact day, sorry) light copper in color with a big white head that settles into a thin lacing."
"A - Crystal clear, light amber. Thick two finger white head with amazing lacing on the glass. "
"651mL second bottled batch. Pours a clear, light amber with a two-finger, creamy, off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Okay lacing. Aroma is huge fresh grapefruit, tangerine, peaches and cream ice cream, huge butterscotch, caramel. Taste is fresh, citrusy, wet hops with butterscotch and a massive bitterness permeating throughout. Buttery, creamy on the palate that leaves a sort of oily mouthfeel. Wow. Fully quenching palate. 10/4/2009 9/4/8/5/17=4.3"
"The citrus and tropical aromas immediately seduce you into the secluded part of the world where tourists disappear and legendary tales begin. Are you ready for adventure? Sculpin lets you know she’s not your everyday IPA as soon as you wash up on the shore. She flashes her delicate pineapples and you finally wrap your tongue around her sweet mangoes for the first time. You see little difference between the celestial bodies as both the sun and her white gold complexion refresh your soul and tingle your libido. Her hops playfully nibble and bite, but never lose sight of why you came. She wants to satisfy but she doesn’t want you to leave. Each sip is a tease that both surprisingly exceeds legend and leaves you yearning for more. You want her again and again. Her siren song calls you and you only. This is why you’re lost, sailor. It’s because you want to be."
Poured from bomber into pint glass.
"I had this beer on tap at Hamilton's in SD today, and at the brewery tasting room 30 days ago. I've also had it in bottle multiple times over the last 4 months."
"Ithaca's Flower Power was my favorite single IPA....key word ""WAS."" Now it is the Sculpin. FP and Sculpin are the only 2 IPA's I've had, and I've had a lot, that perfectly capture the tropical fruit aspect of the hops..the pineapple, the mango the kiwi, the passionfruit. And not just the bitter grapefruit/orange peel. Don't get me wrong, I love the bitterness, which is why I love IPA's. Yet Sculpin blends these two worlds of sweet and bitter fruit perfectly with a creamy smoothness that is just unto itself. Exquisite"
A gentle pour produces about an inch of white head. There is some light lacing. Cloudy orange appearance.

Picked up at Jungle Jim's - 22oz bomber
A: golden color with a hint of orange. Nice carbonation with thick lacing.
"Pretty tasty ipa. Had a similar smell to PtE, its well balanced and pretty smooth. Best IPA i have had, not being an imperial. Its pretty tasty for an IPA, my personal perference is ipa that are not too hoppy. This 1 is again well balanced and pretty damn good."
"Much hazier than I expected, and with minimal head. pours almost more like a hefeweizen but with the head of a pilsner. Kind of underwhelming."
12oz bottle enjoy by 11/30/12 poured into a tulip.
Bomber into a Samuel Smith 10 oz. nonic glass. 
Probably the freshest I can get it. Best by 12-07-2012.
WOW!
"A: shiny golden/orange body, finger beige head,"
"Appearance is burnt orange with a half finger of head that dissipated rather quickly. The nose is reminiscent of a fresh pine forest. There is some light malty flavor, but the big taste comes from the hops. The bitterness simply grows into a hoppy crescendo. Frankly, I would consider this more like a DIPA than a straight-up IPA since the tongue tingles even after the last sip of this offering is gone."
"Pours a clear golden orange with a thin, creamy off-white head. Aroma is fresh peaches and some caramelized sugar. Taste begins with a huge apricot blast, followed by a caramel and fresh bread middle. After that is a raw, resinous piney hop flavor that obliterates your palate. Mouthfeel is rich. Carbonation is a tiny bit high. Overall an amazing IPA. I wouldn't say this is my favorite IPA of all time, but its not hard to see why its ranked #1 IPA on BA."
Purchased in a bomber from a Las Vegas convenient store. I was super stoked. Also had on tap at Public House in the Venetian. (Notes from the bomber though)
Until tonight I hadn't had Sculpin in years. Glad to have it tonight with some really good carnitas tacos.
Enjoy this bomber by 10/27/12 - this should be fresh.

"consumed on 6/29, while I was ""on Hiatus."" stopped by Blind Tiger while in NYC today"
On tap at Jose Pistolas in Philly on 7/6/12. Served in a tulip.
"Excellent beer..got to try this few times,and each time it remains world class.its one of if not the most refreshing ipa you will ever have..smell is very fruity an has some pine tint to it..smooth on bite an leaves you wanting more and more..a bit pricey for some but worth it..world class beer an any ipa lover has got to try.."
"On tap at The Banshee Pub...Scranton, PA. Served in a standard pint glass."
Appearance is hazy apricot golden.
Picked up a bomber of this from my local liquor store. Overall impression is that it's a nice crisp IPA on the dryer side (without too much caramel sweetness) and an extreme amount of hop flavor and aroma: citrus and pine.
"Doc review today. $MM-level deal and I’m pretty sure no one will read the summary or care about the risks until it goes south, when all of the sudden the group unit leaders will wonder out loud, “How the fuck did this get past legal?” Let me tell you now how: I told you it was poo-poo, and you went ahead and did it anyway because “we need the volume.” That’s how it got past legal. I was overruled."
Arrives a rich amber color with a thin filmy head of light tan.
A gift from Jake the Big Mistake. Thanks Jake!
"Aroma: Aggresive hop nose with lots of citrus, apricot, and peach. Some malt sweetness present."
A: Pours a dark golden liquid into the glass. Slightly hazed. The two finger high head is pale white and leaves nice and thick lacings on the glass. 
"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours clear coppery orange amber. Small white head with light lacing. Nice citrus hop aroma. A slightly sweet, well hopped IPA with good malt balance. Medium bodied. A quite nice IPA, worth revisiting."
Generally not as good as expected as far as taste. Almost a bit bland overall. Prefer IPA's more along the line of Odell IPA. Was really excited to try this one but meh. Not enough citrus tones overall and felt unbalanced. Maybe I got a bad batch. Too bad.
"Enjoy by 09/27/12 (day before my birthday). Emptying this one in a Church Brew Works pint glass. Prices out here are always a quite exceeding for this brew. Rather than fronting $19.99 four a sixer or nearly $75 for a case, I forked over $5.75 to take this one home."
"I've had this several times in the past, but can't remember the details. This is from a recent tasting on tap at Blind Tiger, NYC."
Interesting beer. Thought I should try this as I like more balanced IPAs that have the malt backbone to support the hops.
Serving type: 12oz bottle poured into standard pint. 
Look: Translucent orange/copper color with a foamy 1 inch off white head and excellent retention quite a bit of lace circles the glass
This beer had been on draft at my local and I had enjoyed a number of pints of it while I was there. I recently heard someone say that this was one of the best examples of a west coast IPA. I'm not sure I'd agree with that but it was a very good beer.
"Finally got a chance to try this, one of the highest reviews IPAs on the site. I must say.. it lives up to it's billing. One of the most well balanced and flavorful IPAs I've had, satisfies the hophead in me but isn't overly bitter and remains smooth and tasty. Not much can be said that already hasn't been, but if you get a chance to try it you should without any hesitation."
"on-tap at big city, allston MA. (review from notes)"
"Live review. Poured from the 12 oz. bottle that I bought as a single from Save-On Tobacco & Beverage in Mentor, Ohio yesterday for $2.50 into a clean, clear glass. ""SC 140 Enjoy by 090512"" stamped on the neck of the bottle."
"Ah, finally, an IPA that is really good. Seems a lot of the ""hey lets make a brewery"" brewers are producing things that are labelled as an IPA, but really taste like old stale hops! Don’t get me wrong, you have a few out there that are making some really great IPAs and this is one of them. Clean, fresh, bitterly hoppy, foamy, citrusy...hits all the marks! Really nice IPA!!! I’m drinking one now!!!"

"Had the pleasure of reacquainting myself with this excellent example of the American IPA style 6/11/2012 on tap at Redbones BBQ in Somerville, MA. I figured, being a hophead and all, I had to write a review of Sculpin, so I made some notes. Beer was served in a standard 12 ounce pint glass (don't let them trick you into thinking it's 16 ounces of beer you're getting–this isn't England!). "
"Had on tap at simple pleasures in San francisco- pours a surprisingly clear golden color with a healthy 1.5 finger head, decent retention and beautiful rings of sticky lacing. "
"22 oz brought back from a trip last week to Boston. Insane that I have to go to Boston to get a beer brewed in San Diego, when I live in Salt Lake City. Poured into my beer goblet. Bottle has an enjoy by date of 090712 (I think, it's hard to read)."
"Pours clear gold with a huge light tan head, leaving tons of lacing down the whole glass from the well retained foam."
"On draft at Zimmzys in the Shore. Nice golden yellow color with a compact off white head. Nice lacing. Nose is all apricots and mango, absolutely love the smell of this beer. Tastes like it smells, mango and apricots with some nice bittering from the hops. Such a timeless classy brew. We take it for granted with such availability both on shelves and on tap."
I was lucky to find this at the local growler station. I poured it into a fine tulip glass.

"On tap at Cork City in Hoboken, Really loving the draft list they are putting out these days. Though is was served in a chilled glass, uh and sloppily poured because it was 11pm on a Saturday."
Definitely agree with other reviews concerning a peach or mango note. I also detected some honey undertones as well as citrus and of course the hoppy bitterness.
A - Pours a golden amber with a small head that retains rather well. Very nice lacing.

Clear golden color with a nice one finger white head. There are lots of bubbles in this one.
"A: Poured from a bomber bottle into a pint glass. Coppery tan in color, with a gorgeous 2-finger, off-white head. Great lacing, a clear look, and a nice effervescence. This is a beautiful beer."
"What a great all-around IPA. Solid aroma, great mouthfeel, flavor that just keeps lingering. I've had the privilege of enjoying tho on tap which is obviously the best way but even out of the bottle this is a great beer. I love this beer in my top 10 maybe even top 5."
"A: One-inch just off-white frothy head, light-golden color, good carbonation and lacing "
"Tulip glass, about 55 degrees."
"Served in a pint glass at The Tipsy Crow in San Diego, CA. "
"A light yellow copper color with a sturdy white head and fantastic lacing. The aroma offers a floral sweetness and mild citrus hop. Very pleasant but not powerful. The first swallow gets tasty grainy bread with a polite lemon overtone. Almost a rye quality, grassy too. A medium bodied brew with lightly viscous, yet peppery feel. I consider it to have light but full carbonation as well. Highly drinkable and understandably popular!"
This ipa has a clean appearance and a crisp hoppy flavor. The aroma is fairly weak for a premium beverage like this but it does not have any negative characteristics at all.
Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into my New Belgium snifter.
Glad to finally have this available in my neck of the woods--Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Clear copper/orange with a frothy head of white foam.
Right away I am digging the style of this beer. It is crystal clear and the color of a dirty blondes silky beautiful hair. The head is aggressive and firm (that's what she said) with pillowy fluff and tons of lacing. This is a pretty brew.
"Smell is like i said before, nicely fresh, hoppy, fruity, and floral...but this time a good. Flavors have a kick of pine and lemon around the edges, with mango and peach in the middle...I don’t find it that one-dimensional this time...in fact, I think the hop combination in this one is rather awesome. I reckon this bottle was a lot fresher than the first one I had...not sure of release dates, though I know this bottle just showed up, so its gotta be fresh.."
"12 oz. bottle from the local liquor store, poured into sam adams perfect pint glass. Dark gold, slightly cloudy, with 1/2"" head, giving way to abundant lacing with a 1/4 "" top."
"It pours a very beautiful orange color, with a hint of goldfish yellow, with a white head, not too much color in there. Just right for the style. "
Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a tulip glass. poured an orange color with about a half inch of white foam. The smell was not noticeable. The beer did not have a particularly notable taste or mouth feel. The beer did leave a lacing on the glass. Overall I was disappointed. Was really looking forward to this since I found the strong hoppy flavor of Big Eye to be an incredibly enjoyable beer. I won't be buying Sculpin again buy will continue to try Balladt Point based on my experience with Big Eye.
Appearance: It pours a light brown with a hint of yellow but unlike a lot of IPAs this one is pretty clear with just a slight haze.
First day BP's in Texas. You know I've gotta try out the Sculpin. Bought a six pack at Lone Star and cracked one into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.
Thank you CasanovaCummins for this
"22 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a generic pilsner glass in a friend's gaff in low altitude San Diego, California. Bottle acquired at Ballast Point a few hours ago. Reviewed live. Expectations are high; I had this on draught in Orange, California back in December and it was the best IPA I'd ever had - even though I usually don't like them since so many are imbalanced. I'm hoping the bottle measures up to the draught. "
This beer pours a clear pale orange with no head and no lacing through out.
"12oz bottle split with my old man, poured into a pint glass. Appearance is hazy orange with a one finger cream colored head that receedes to a decent film. Smell is of orange, pine, grapefruit, maybe a hint of mint. Taste is sweet malts, bits of orange and pine, rather smooth for an IPA mouthfeel is thicker than average for an IPA. Pretty decent, but didn't knock my socks off."
"Aroma: Light resiny hop aromas up front that quickly bring on thoughts of fresh peaches, apricots, and lemon zest. Clean fermentation character. Slight bit of pine tar. Candied oranges appear as it warms."
Yellowish-orange in color with a decent white head. Plenty of visible carbonation and another brilliantly clear beer.
I had this in a bar while in California and I thought it was interesting enough to get a bottle and bring back to Toronto. Notes from the bottle tasting.
"Hops, or more precisely, grapefruit pith, takes over the taste totally. There is just nothing else to say. "
Was very happy to find a bottle of this in ny last week! I always wanted to try this
"Finally picked this beer up, have seen it for a little bit, and have been told to try it, but at $10 a bomber I was slow to do so."
"First Sculpin ever. Stoked that BP is started to come to Ohio, hell fucking yeah!"
"12 ounce bottle, stamp on bottle says best by 070612. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy (mango, grapefruit) hops, along with some caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pine, citrusy (mango, grapefruit, lemon peel) and spicy hops, and some bready malt. There's a nice lingering bitter/fruity finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit slick and has good carbonation. This is a very good brew. But at $14.99 a 6-pack here in Ohio, I can get either Columbus IPA or White Rajah at a much better price. With that being said, Sculpin is definitely worth trying, I wouldn't turn one down!"
"Various number of bottles, tastes/smell/etc were all consistent."
Poured into a Dogfish signature snifter. No readable freshness date.
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a bright golden with a slight haze, nice fluffy eggshell white head, decent lacing and nice retention. The aromas are just what I'm usually looking for. Although they aren't as in your face pungent, it smells absolutely wonderful. Dank. Tons of mango and pineapple; extremely tropical. There's also some ripe grapefruit in the mix. There are some juicy flavors going on here, and still finishes pretty dry. The flavors pretty much match the nose and doesn't let down. Sweet, although the malt definitely takes a backseat. Mouthfeel is right on, lots of carbonation, smooth, and on the heavier side of medium-bodied. This is a pretty bold beer at 7% abv, but the alcohol goes unnoticed. Wow, dank right here.."
Pours a lightly hazy amber color with a thumb sized cream head with pretty decent lace.
"This golden-orange colored pour has distinct peachy aromas. Pine flavors up front with citrusy bitter hop notes on the finish. It has a pretty effervescent carbonation that really wakes up your mouth. Kind of a raw, ripping IPA that's big on hops and packs a tingly punch."
"Appearance - Pours a somewhat clear, golden orange with a thick, 2-finger head which dissipates quickly leaving behind a sparse lace."
Poured from 22 oz bottle into Duvel tulip.

Sculpin India Pale Ale
Poured a clear orange-gold with a finger of fluffy off-white head. Floral aroma with lots of pine and a touch of caramel.
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into an Allagash cervoise glass. Bottled is stamped, but not with a date."
"A - Copper orange with minimal head, slightly cloudy"
"Pours a darker shade than expected, verging on amber. Foam is thick and bright white in color. As the foam receded, a ton of lacing is left behind on the glass."
"Sculpin sports a pale-orange, clear body with a touch of the foaminess on top. Grassy, herbal, piney and citrusy hops play over top a candy-like malt aroma. A taste reveals pretty much exactly what the aroma hints at: A nice blend of all the classic hop qualities, well balanced by the mild sweet malts. It's bitterness is very firm but not overbearing. it finishes very nicely with a medium body, and not too sweet. Overall a top-notch IPA."
After about 500 of these I figured it was time for a review.
Thanks to davemont for including this as a much appreciated extra in a recent trade.
"Poured into a chalice glass, Sculpin has a translucent pale golden color. The foamy white head piles up nicely at first, but recedes quickly to a moderately thick ring around the glass with some surface foam. While there is some lacing, it's definitely not the full on spider web effect that Stone IPA has."
Pours a pretty gold with a soft white head. Nice lingering notes of hops and earth up front.
"A: Pale, hazy, yellow. Maybe a dark lemon peel, or perhaps pear color. Nice amount of soft head. "
"a fun surprise from a trade with acurtis - thanks man! poured from a bomber into a Deschutes imperial pint glass. not sure about when it was bottled - there is some mark on the bottle, but it's pretty obscured."
"Best Before May 13, 2012"
Pours a golden hue with some haze but not much. Huge bright white sticky head. Massive grapefruit nose with some spicy pine and slight touches cracked black peppercorn and apricots.
"Review from tasting notes of March 25, 2011. Bottle from Browleys, Charlotte, NC courtesy of Mom! Thanks Mom!"
"I have been looking forward to trying this one for a while, and it was more than well worth the wait. I poured the bomber into my DFH snifter to find a great golden yellow body with a full white one inch head a small amount of sticky lacing."

"As usual, for my West Coast IPAs, thanks Ren (bigsippin)"
A: Pours a crystal clear medium golden yellow with light amounts of visible carbonation and a finger tall off white head. The head reduces by about 50% very quickly but the rest remains throughout the beer. Moderate lacing is observed.

Poured from a bomber into my Deschutes tulip...
"Huge grapefruit hop nose. Head pours tall, but backs off relatively quickly. First taste is more pungent than I expect, with cirtrusy undertones. Swishing around in the mouth a bit gives more of a vegetal flavor. Malts noticeable only in a little sweet aftertaste at the end, hidden between an initial sharp bitter taste upon swallow and a softer bitterness lingering in the mouth afterward. "
"Appearance: Very nice cloudy, golden-amber color with a two finger head and plenty of lacing."
pours a very nice orange and you can see a lot of carbonation in the body. With a 1.5 finger egg shell colored frothy head with good retention leaving a laced rim around the glass.
Yet another thanks to John for this one. 
"I have this on tap and in the bottle. This was the first beer I had at Ballast Point Brewing Company. The color is a nice golden orange color, that reminds me very much of the Sculpin fish that this is named after. The aroma is rich with many different, smells, the strong is that of citrus fruits with orange and grapefruit being some of the strongest. A very hopy taste with with a nice balance of flavors, the cirutus flavors are balanced nicely with that of the malted hops. Over all a great IPA"
"I bought this beer without hearing anything about this beer or Ballast Point. I tried another IPA from ballast point, big eye IPA it was ok but when I opened the Sculpin the aroma was awesome. Tropical fruit filled my nose and a peach , apricot, mango and citrus flavor hit my taste buds and then a nice dry bitter finish. I live in Indianapolis and I can not get this beer but I drive an hour and a half to Champaign, IL to get it. Sculpin is ten bucks for a bomber and I will not spend that much very often on a beer. I have bought 2 cases of bombers so far. It is the best IPA I have had. It is also the best beer I have had. It is a fruit hop foward beer that I could drink everyday. I tend to like all the fruit hop foward beers but many are only good to have 1 or 2 before your taste buds are over saturated, this beer is exceptional"
On-tap at Bullshead in Lititz.
"I must say that I like a damn good IPA and Sculpin just so happens to be one of those. North Carolina just doesn't seem to carry anything but the 22oz., but I'm alright with that. Sculpin is the type of IPA I could drink at any given time... like right now! One of my favorite IPAs of all time. Nice job Ballast Point!"
"On Tap at The Hangar in Amherst, MA. Right down the street from ZooMass."
"A - Bright, translucent pumpkin orange. One-inch yellow/white head which retained for a bit. Solid head retention. "
"so i poured this beer into a pint glass, the appearance is a nice dark copper color with very light champaign bubbles, with a nice frothy head that leaves a nice bit of lacing, it actually held it own from the top of the glass till the very bottom. mouth feel is smooth with light carbonation with a nice hop dry/bitterness taking over. i did taste some light sweetness..maybe syrup or a light vanilla taste. smell is piney with good slightly bitter hops. i did notice that in the initial bitterness there is a grape fruit and maybe orange rind coming through,but quickly calmed by that sweetness in the after taste. A.B.V is subtle and actually hidden by the sweetness that stays on the tounge. a great beer good balance. i enjoyed this very much, and could definatly see this stocked in my fridge."
A - Pours a straw yellow with a hint of orange color with two finger white head that fades rather quickly.
"Poured into a Stella glass. Pours a hazy orange yellow with a sticky white two inch head, leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is grapefruit, fresh cut grass, passion fruit, and pine. Taste is very balanced with all flavors, grapefruit maybe most prominent. Body is medium, perfect amount of life, on the dry side, and very drinkable. This is a great IPA not sure of its age, but awesome despite that huge problem."
"22 oz bomber, no date on the bottle, poured into a snifter."
12 oz. bottle poured into a standard pint glass.
On draft at Pizza Paradiso in Old Town
"I used to really love Sculpin. I would periodically stop by the Scripps Ranch brewery and fill up a growler at least once a month. Many times I'd stop by the brewery just to get a pint. Life was good, and I was excited to have such a world class brew within a few minutes of my house."
Poured on tap in a 5 oz tulip glass at Haven Gastropub. Reviewed from notes. Expectations very high.
"Orange colored Indian Pale Ale with a soapy head with wonderful lacing. Overall the hop profile was good, the beer was almost oddly smooth for 7% abv, with a fantastic lingering mildly bitter hop finish. Overall, a solid and smooth IPA definitely worthy of a try but did not really live up to the hype in my opinion."
"Note: This review was a re-post from my former account, jmkratt, which was hacked and I lost all my reviews...sorry for the redundancy."
"Color is light amber to orange, with a huge soapy head that lasts and lasts. Lots of lacing on the glass too - this one's a beauty. The smell is other-worldly, with citrus hop scents assaulting the senses - mango, pineapple, and orange. Huge hop flavors continue into the taste as well. Delicious grapefruit bitterness builds through a crescendo that peaks with a tangy bite in the finish. Hop oils coat the tongue, and put a smile on my face. Perfect carbonation. If you love beer with a big citrus hop taste like me, you must try this one. It's one of the best. I don't see anything that can be improved."
"Re-reviewing the Sculpin IPA from Ballast Point Brewing Company out of California now that I got ahold of a fresh bottle. How do I know this bottle is fresh? It came straight from the brewery! After two negative experiences with out-of-date bottles, I got in touch with Earl Kight )the director sales and marketing at Ballast Point) and he was nice enough to not only send me fresh replacement bottles of Sculpin and Big Eye IPA, but also an unexpected bottle of their Victory At Sea Coffee Vanilla Imperial Porter -- a beer I have been dying to try for quite some time! Thanks Earl. This review is for you."

"A-Pours a orange/gold with a thick white head. It leaves some lacing, but not a thick lacing, all the way up the glass."
22-ounce brown glass bottle poured into a tulip glass. Served at approximately 40-45 degrees F.
Served from bottle into my DFH Chalice. 
"From notes, reviewed 1/14/12."
"My first review, go easy on me fellow BA's."
Another great IPA! I have been lucky enough to have scored 2 bottles of this amazing beer. I had to be really picky to find anything wrong with this brew. 
"The big, bad Sculpin. Hoping it's not spoiled based on the place of purchase. Why do I continue to buy beer from there?"
"Sculpin India Pale Ale by Ballast Point Brewing Company is an average example of the style. I found that like many IPAs, the pine flavor was overwhelming. I don't find skunky, bitter, and unbalanced beer all that appealing. On a positive note, it was a gorgeous amber color. I liken it to a hot blonde with bad breath."
12 oz. bottle. Here's hoping this one wasn't chilling on the shelf too long!
"Thanks to corregidore for this tasty extra! The last time I had a Sculpin, they didn't print dates on the labels but it tasted way past its prime. I'm stoked to finally get the chance to try it fresh. This one is marked ENJOY BY 10/27/12. Dope. Poured from bomber to pint:"
Had on Tap at Kickbacks Gastropub in Jax.
Poured from 22oz into tulip. 
"There is a very clear goldish color to it. Bubbles, but not a ton. A big bubbly white head and lacing. Nice almost minty scent to it. "
Appearance: The beer pours a golden orange body with a one finger head. Retention is great. It lacks the clarity of some other IPA and Double brews.
Thanks to sugit for this one.
"Single finger head with nice lacing on a amber gold clear body. Very nice sweet aroma with mostly grapefruit and pineapple notes. Flavor is very different with mostly a dry, pine and musty hop taste. Moderate to high carbonation and medium body. Overall a very good IPA"
"How much more can be said about this beer besides the personal stories. Yes, it's a world class ipa. I agree. I've been looking for this beer for about 3 years and finally found it at a beer store on long island. After so long you would think the beer would be a let down but infact it lived up to the hype. An outstanding ipa! Very hoppy but not harsh. So easy to drink for the style. Another highlight is the crystal clear orange hued body which is a little different. This is some beer alright. If you havent had it yet, look for it. Hopefully it doesnt take you three years to find."
From a 22 bottle with no freshness date. Poured into a Duvel tulip.
"Poured a orange/dark honey color with a thin white head. It had a grassy, piney hop aroma. The taste was balanced up front with some nice malty flavors and finished off with a refreshingly bitter flavor that lingers on the toungue. The body was appropriate to the style. It wasn't a hopbomb like I expected like most highly sought after IPAs are, but this was overall just a very well done beer. Nothing is overdone or overly assertive; it's just an above average IPA and an almost perfect example of the style."
"22oz bottle (no freshness date), poured into a tulip. Beautiful golden orange with a thick, billowy white head, easily two fingers tall. Faded to a thin ring with little lacing."
From notes on 12/04/11:
"22oz bottle poured into my pint glass. Obviously no bottle dating. C'mon, Ballast Point, please start dating your stuff."
Had on tap at Lord Hobo in Cambridge Mass.
"This beer pours an amber color with a bit of white head. Has decent retention, but no lacing. Aroma is very assertive with lots of citrus hops, and a mild caramel note, with some floral honey like notes as well. Taste is very similar with a good, clean, mildly assertive bitterness balancing a mild caramel malt profile. Mouthfeel is light, dry and refreshing. Carbonation is a bit lower than I would have liked, but very nice nonetheless. This beer is very good. So many good IPAs around."
"I was assured this bottle is fresh from the brewery in the last couple weeks. I will take their word for it, as the brewery does not believe this is information which is pertinent to pass on."
A - Clear copper look. Very little head.
A: Nice golden orange with a decent-sized white head and strong lacing.
Bottle from Phyl21ca.
"A - Pours with one finger of white foam on top of a perfectly clear, copper colored body. The head settles slowly and leaves nice, thick lace."
Appearance: Perfect clear amber gold with a hint of orange. Nice head from the tap and decent lacing that sticks around when the beer is long gone
"Sampled at kickbacks gastropub in Jacksonville, on tap in a 16 oz. pint glass."
Poured from a bomber into a Guinness pint glass produced a straw yellow brew and it has a gorgeous slightly off white 1 finger small bubbled head with very nice heavy lacing. 
22oz bottle poured into a oversized sniffter
"Had it on tap at Vintners. This is an excellent IPA. One of my top three in the category. The others being Bell's Hopslam and Dogfish Head's 90 minute. I think this compares very favorably to Hopslam. At least on the East coast you can't get this beer all the time. Great head and appearance - lovely golden color. Fruity aroma with a hint of hops. The taste is fantastic, not too bitter, just the right amount of fruit/sweetness to offset the bitterness from the hops. Overall a wonderful IPA."
"Hm, now its only less than a week old."
Picked up a couple bottles of these from a very generous Stormking47. Poured 12 oz into pint glass
Thanks to cosmonick for sharing!
"Poured from a draft into a plastic cup at Gaglione Brothers in San Diego, Calif. Color was golden orange. Minimal head when I got it, maybe ½ inches. Decent amount of lacing on the top. Healthy amount of film on the sides. "
served on tap in a tulip glass.
Poured from a 12oz bottle (no dates) into a Bruery tulip.
Thanks to ThaFATkid for sending this bottle.
"A: Clear yellow orange pour with a big white head. The retention is great as the head recedes to form a nice cap atop the brew, and laces quite nicely down the side of my Founders Goblet. A ton of bubbles race from the bottom to the top."
A great Cali IPA with an intense bright citrusy aroma and taste. 
Had on tap at Pizza Port - San Clemente.
Big thanks to Dobby for this one!
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Beautiful to look at in a simplistic way, ordinary golden/amber color, but remarkably clear. Smell is great, hops, pine, citrus, little hint of caramel somewhere. Tastewise, for sure there is a nice hop bite, but along with it comes grapefruit and a bit of malt. Would have liked a bit more body/resin in the mouthfeel, but still pretty good."
Poured a nice thick dense white head. Crystal clear pale orange body. Lacing is sticking all over the glass.
Had this on my tick list for a while. Not sure how old the bottle is but it has some weird date code and no sediment so it's OK by me.
Poured with a nice head of 2 fingers.  The beer has an amber tinge.  Great head with lacy retention.
Re-rate on 04/22/2016
Appearance - Clear amber with the perfect amount of carbonation. 
Poured from a bomber into a straight pint glass.
Poured from 22 oz bomber into a Bruery tulip
A: Transparent orangy gold with no rising carbonation and a two finger sudsy head. 
"Poured from a bomber into a weizen glass. Beautiful looking golden cloudy pour with a 2 finger off white pillow head. Great lacing throughout and good retention. Smell was of citrus and apricots. A note of grapefruit on the end. Not an overpowering smell, but adequate. Taste followed the nose with was a good fit of citrus malts and adequate hops. Very much on the fruit end which was a surprise. Complex but not too tart. Hides the 7%ABV very well. Feel is full with a lot of carbonation. Not watery at all. Overall- A very solid IPA which is not really my style. Enjoyed the fruit tones with a good amount of hoppiness. Reminded me of citrus bubblegum which is a compliment to it's full flavor. Notes of cloves added to the complexity. A great sipper that I will be having several more of in the future. Very tasty-"
Thanks to Adam @ Platinum for this one
"Had it on-tap in a pint glass at Vine & Barley in Port St. Lucie, Florida. "
"on-tap at big city, allston MA. (review from notes)"
"A: A typical IPA, nothing impressive about the appearance of this beer. It is a golden yellow with somewhat decent head."
Presentation-Cool little bottle with what seems to be a Rock Cod on the label. Caught some last month while out deep sea fishing off the coast of San Fran. 
The color is orange much like soda with a big head. The head is composed of medium large and surrounded by a thick lace nice..head is great but color is ehh.
Enjoyed in a pint glass
Poured into tulip glass.
"I've had this several times, on draft, in bottles, in San Diego even, and I frankly don't get the ranking. I never get much smell off of it, and it tastes fine, but nothing special. I expected a blast of hops to the nose and the tasebuds, but it hasn't been there in over 5 tries. It was suggested that Sculpin must be absolutely fresh in order to shine, so I'll keep trying and revise this review if it ever happens."
Poured from 12oz bottle into Mad Elf tulip.
A- Pours crisp and clear with a modest head.
Had about a gallon over the coarse of 3 days when it was on tap at Lupulo. 
22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Thanks to KevSal for this huge want.
"Absolutely love this beer, love that I can find it pretty easily in MA now. "
"64 oz growler poured into Duvel tuip several times. This is a staple in my fridge, I felt it was time to review it. "
Bought a 22 oz bottle back at the Homebrew Mart in early June of this year. Poured into a snifter for review. 
22oz Bottle 9/2011
Appearance - Slightly cloudy with a golden body and nice lacing.
"Pours a rich, thick head which dissipates after about 90 seconds to a cool, thin layer. Has a deep golden color with that white head. Scents of some kind of a peachy, grapefruit hit the nose. Possible warrior hops? Exploding creamy malt fired back by a buckling generosity of mean, kick assed hops. Very bitter, but the bitterness fades back as the malt catches up. Extremely refreshing. Super beer for year round consumption. Website says 70 IBU but I say this tastes to me as if it is in the 90's. If you are a hophead or an IPA fanatic, this is one for you! Not for the the unsophisticated palate, for sure."
Thanks goes out to Bill for helping me get this one. 
Thanks to sendsilk for this bottle. Review from notes. Can't wait to start seeing Ballast Point in Ohio later this year.
A - Nice orange with a big 2-3 finger white head.
"Excellent two finger head on the pour. Bright amber coloring as well as a strong floral nose. The first sip brings in notes of grapefruit and leaves your palate slightly dry with a breath of citrus. Not overly carbonated but lively enough to excite your senses, leaving you wanting to drink more. "
"Poured into a Duvel tulip, thanks to Exiled for the extra."
"A beer named after the California Scorpion fish, Does it have a sting?"
"12 oz. bottle, purchased 9/2011 from a reliable bottle shop, no dates on bottle"
Thanks to Pat D for this bomber of Sculpin straight from his West Coast beer trip. I poured this one into my Ebenezer's 2011 Belgian Fest tulip.
Thanks barfdiggs for the trade!
"This is the very first craft I tried that tastes of citrus and grapefruit from the first sip to the last, without fading to pines and resins."
"A: normal IPA - clearish, slightly orange, good head that dissipates quickly to leave fine lacing. "
"Poured a 2"" white head with staying power. Lovely clear golden color. There's a strong hops smell featuring pine and grapefruit. Taste is a milder version of the same smells. There's a decent length finish. All in all I'd say it smells like a top rate IPA but tastes more mid-range."
"22 oz. bottle brought back from visit in November to Southwest. No freshness date, but ""SCU75 23091"" marked at base of neck. Poured into tulip glass."
Reviewed with Kiddynamite920. Thanks man! Super fresh sculpin bottle poured into Deschutes tulip.
From he tap to a pint glass. 
"Appears as that nice solid IPA amber, crazy-stiff, three finger head with large bubbles. Solid up top like a silly little bubble bath. "
"This pours cloudy golden with nice head and juice resin lacing. The smell is floral and mildly fruity. The flavor starts with a crisp bite but turns smooth with a subtle amount of fruit and punch-in-the-face hops. The flavor works through bitterness but it does not take over. I can taste some pleasant grassiness…but not overpowering. The whole feel is pretty much here and gone, but I would not classify it as “rounded” because of the lack of sweet malt. I love this west coast style, and would easily put this beer in my top ten. If you are looking for a rounded IPA with malt and hops at war, this is not it. If you are looking for awesome hop bomb that is easy to drink, this is a must try. Delicious."
"It poured a deep amber with an airy, foamy two-finger head that receded all too soon. The lacing was awesome - I imagine shapes with lacing, just as how children imagine shapes made by clouds (this one was an arm reaching into the bottom of the glass, perhaps to sop up the remnants of this amazing brew). Even from the moment I opened the bottle, the cool, reassuring smell of mango, grapefruit, jackfruit, and dare I say it - maybe even a hint of durian - wafted through the air, made even more pronounced after I poured and swirled the glass. It evokes memories of a breezy Philippine summer, and the freedom of racing through the rows of sunflowers lining University Avenue in Diliman after a hard-fought academic year. "
"Bomber poured into a tall tumbler, Big Eye is light gold with a white head that leaves heavy, Brussels style lace. A light, clear body and big white head leaving gorgeous lacing, exactly what I look for in an IPA. "
650ml Bottle - huge thanks to zacs for this one
Looks a little like an IPA. Tight lacing.
Poured from the 22oz bottle... 
A: Bright golden yellow. It has a creamy white head that dissipates after a few minutes. It leaves a very fine lacing around the glass.
The beer pours a super clear gold color with a high frothy white head that stuck around for awhile. Lacing is clumpy and random. Aroma is fairly piney and citrus-like but not as pungent as i would have liked. While the taste is very good i think i expected more of the fruity and tropical flavors that we all love. Lacking was the super fresh and juicy hop character i was hoping for. Feel is moderate to light making it quite drinkable. Slightly sticky with nice carbonation. Nice pale malt flavor is there but not dominating which is how i like it. I expected more out of the hop character but I will see if the next bottle I can get is fresher!
Appearance: a hazy golden body and a frothy head retention is good as is the lacing
"Second time I have had this beer. Both times from a 22 oz. bomber. Great smell and color. Slightly less hoppy than other West Coast IPA's, but very well balanced. Pours foamy with a nice cream-colored head, not quite as silky as Russian River's Pliney, but certainly a tasty treat."
A - Clear amber-orange with a 2-finger off-white head with mild to moderate lacing.
"A&S - Pours a beautiful hazy bright orange, finger worth of rich white head."
Really excited to try this one...been looking for it for months. Thanks to my buddy for bringing me a bottle back from Capone's. Was served in my Yuengling pint glass.
"A: Nice bright orange with a two finger white head. Fairly clear, sticky looking"
"thanks tom for picking up these bottles, i definatly owe ya one!"
A: Pours a clear orangish amber color with a thick off-white foam head that has moderate retention. There is some nice lacing down the sides of the glass. 
"On tap at Apex PDX, enjoyed in relative peace day after Portland Beer Week California Beer event craziness (barkeep said it was more crowded/crazy than Pizza Port event earlier in the year, eek), 8.27.11."
22 oz bottle poured into SN Snifter
Served in a pint glass.
Pours a nice bright gold with a small white head. Really looks good.
Poured into an 8oz tasting glass at the Pony Bar in NYC. 
"I've been fortunate to have Sculpin from a Philly Beer Week firkin before, but now it's time for a proper review. Grabbed a couple of bottles from a friend who stumbled on a case."
Appearance: Poured a golden amber color that is slightly hazy with nice head that stayed a while and leaves good lacing.
"Poured into a pint glass,"
"Pours tea-orange into the glass, with a retentive frothy head. The nose contains a huge bouquet of pine and citrus elements. Flavors of grapefruit, mangos, pine resin, tea-leaf tannins and fresh grassy hops intermingle in a perfect balance. Although complex, each pull provides an easy quaff and a light-round mouthfeel. Carbonation is smooth, yet provides for a lightly zesty palate. Perfect execution of an IPA. Great brew."
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.
Appearance: Golden yellow. Clear but with little floating pieces of yeast. Two finger white head with good retention.
"22oz bottle with batch code SCU88 on neck, poured into Hair of the Dog tulip, reviewed on 8/20/11."
Poured from a 22oz into a my Founders pint glass.
"Wow, this is one heck of an IPA. Cask-conditioned and pumped into a pint glass, amber-gold with a glow, topped with an off-white head of 1/2 inch. It looks like a sparkling beer with a perfect carbonation to it. Good head retention and some nice sticky lace clings to the glass. "
poured from a 22oz bomber
On tap at Mugs Alehouse.
"A - A hazy gold color with an egg-shell white head that stays for a long time, receding slowly."
"Poured a shade of gold that promises good things will soon come. Big white head, lacing, a bit of stick. Scent is impressive, lemony citrus notes, hops permeates the nose. Taste is a nice balance between the sweetness of the malts and bitterness of the hops. Not sure what is at the back, I guess bittersweetness. I have been waiting to try this and I was not disappointed. Overall, a great brew."
"Small 4oz pour at Mondial de la bière 2011. Appearance: Dark gold with lasting white head. Aroma: Spicy hops upfront, some citrus and a considerable malt presence (toffee, caramel). Taste: Bitter but not overly so, balanced with caramel notes and spicy hops. Palate: Solid with medium carbonation. Overall: A good IPA but I was expecting more from its reputation. Maybe it wasn't very fresh."
650ml bottle. No date. I hope it is fresh.
"Pours slightly hazy gold with a great foamy white head. This is certainly hoppy. It is a predictable but welcome delivery of citrusy hops. This one brought Avery’s IPA to mind, just a little more balanced and a bit lighter on the palate. This is refreshing for the style with plenty of grapefruit and juicier citrus flavor. Malts are just sweet enough and not too thick. I’d drink this on a regular basis if I could."
"A: Dark, cloudy yellow. Creamy head and nice lacing."
"Served on-tap in a 20oz (?) tumbler at Capital Ale House (Richmond, VA). Reviewed from notes."
"Bronze in color with a thick, sticky, lasting head. Lot's of sticky lacing. This is what IPA's are supposed to look like. From the moment I pop the cap mango feels my olefactory senses. Other citrus fruits are noticable as well as sugar cane. Flavor follows the aroma with a huge hop bill that doesn't tear your mouth apart. Sculpin has perfected the balance. Again mango is what I notice first with other citrus fruits. Grapefruit, lemon and a touch of sweetness for balance. It appears they only used pale malts in this one. Thank goodness as that let's the hops shine. Mouthfeel is medium and both sharp and oily. Great beer by Ballast Point and I was lucky to find it while vacationing in Myrtle Beach."
12oz bottle unknown date. Served around 45F. Thanks to Ryan for this unexpected extra!
"A- poured into a tumbler glass, the beer is dense, but very light hued. Looks like lemonade."
S- 12 oz bottle into a pint glass
"On-tap at Toronado San Francisco, July 2011. Deep golden amber with sufficient head and lacing. Wonderful citrus and floral aroma that seems to permeate right to the center of the brain. Taste is right where I like an IPA, Citrus and Piney wonderfulness held up by sufficient malty backing. Resinous mouthfeel which coats the tastebuds for lingering effect after every sip. "
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a light golden color with a thick cream head to it.
22 oz. bottle into glass pint.
This beer poured a deep clear golden color with a creamy tan head building about two fingers high. Great retention and good lacing.
22oz bomber poured into a pint glass
"Sculpin IPA has the kind of extraordinarily hoppy nose--bursting with grapefruit and pine, with hints of menthol--that lets you know you're in for a bitter blast. So strong are the hops aromas that they all but cover the malts, which only come across with light hints of brown sugar and toast. "
Thanks for the bottle Randy! Poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy golden orange with a finger of head. 
22oz bomber poured into Sam Adams pint glass
On-tap at the main brewery's tasting room.

Ballast Point Sculpin IPA 7.0%
"Poured from my tap into a tulip glass on 7/6/11, the day after cleaning the line."
Really light orange with a bright white head.
"My absolute favorite IPA. This is what good beer should be. The nose, the taste, the mouthfeel, the drinkability, the balance, and the ability to drink pint after pint...is all there. At 7%, it's perfect. If you're into your IPA's, and like something with some nice fruity tinges to it, this is it. I guarantee you can't have just one. I'm drooling just thinking about it whilst I type this review."
Copied from my old handle
Ballast Point Sculpin is an IPA with a great smell and a mediocre taste. The bitterness of the hops is evident without any of the other great flavour characteristics.
"This beer was delivered in a pint glass with a nice foamy head. A sticky lacing lacquered on the glass. A typical, golden-rod color, with a fusion of orange and light yellow hues. A very citrus-y smelling brew, with floral tones and a sweet smell of mandarin dresses the glass. I also experienced hints of grapefruit, completing the presentation."
Bomber poured into New Belgium globe.
I'm giving Sculpin this high of a rating because of how much I've enjoyed it over the past three years.
A - Pours a golden amber/copper with fluffy two finger head that leaves a lot of sticky lacing.
"Fresh batch into the area, 12oz bottle into a pint glass. A bit cloudy, dark gold color (nearly orange) with 2 fingers of thick creamy head. Nice retention and lacing as well."
12 oz. bottle poured into a DFH Signature Glass.
This beer pours a crystal clear gold with a medium head that leaves some a good amount of lacing as it recedes.
"Pours with a short, snowy head over an nearly orange body."
"I had this beer on tap at David Copperfield's here in NYC. I found it to be an exceptional IPA with a subtle bitterness and an intense lingering grapefruit hop flavor. The mouth feel was a bit resiny but quite refreshing, the beer poured with very little head at all and the color was a very clear orange. Reminded me of Sixpoint Bengali Tiger only a bit more fruity and not as malty."
"A = a real pretty, bright, golden yellow [and cuz I poured it somewhat quickly] a two finger head floating....disappearing quickly, and replenished with more beer :)"
On Nitro tap at Hungry Monk in AZ. A nice golden pour with thin white head (where is my Nitro?). The smell is piney but subdued. Taste follows the nose but the hops are way dialed down to normal. Mouthfeel is good and creamy but not as I typically see in nitro porters / stouts.
The beer pours clear copper color. A fluffy head floats on the beer like a cloud over the ocean during sunset. 
"Purchased as as single from Wine and Beer Westpark in Glen Allen, VA - DFH snifter"
Poured out of a bomber into my Duvel Tulip. 
Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. No freshness date as far as I can tell.
Pulled fresh out of a new case right in front of my wonderful girls eyes! I can't believe this is finally in upstate NY!
"HOLY $%@$!.Pours a clear, light amber with a two-finger, creamy, off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Okay lacing. Aroma is huge fresh grapefruit, tangerine, peaches and cream ice cream, huge butterscotch, caramel. Taste is fresh, citrusy, wet hops with butterscotch and a massive bitterness permeating throughout. Buttery, creamy on the palate that leaves a sort of oily mouthfeel. Wow."
22oz bomber.
Was way better before they sold out and changed the recipe!
Had on tap at Pizzaria Paradiso Old Town Alexandria VA.
"On tap at The Birch in Norfolk,VA for thejewreview.net"
"22oz. bomber with no freshness date, poured into a Sebago Brewing Co. tulip glass."
"I visited Ballast Point Brewery a few months ago and remember that I did drink this IPA, but I had already downed a few prior and didn't remember how great it was!"
Tasted may 28th 2011 (from notes)
A nice big bottle of a highly ranked IPA. This should be fun.
"SCUUUULLLLPPPIIINNN! Finally. About time I tried this legend! Thanks to dmsohyea, I have a bottle of this San Diego-brewed behemoth in my hands. Thanks again, dude!"
12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Thanks sleepyhead for hooking me up again!
"A: Pours amber orange in color with a thin layer of foam atop that subsides to a layer of film. Plenty of lacing around the glass as you drink. On the pour, carbonation looked to be a tad high with lots of rising bubbles and some clinging to the edge of the glass. It seemed to subside a bit afterwards, though, and now looks quite solid."
"Clear dark gold colour with a moderate, creamy, dense white head. Good head retention."
8 ounce pour at the Pony Bar...
Pours a fairly mirky golden-amber color with a good bubbly white head. Medium retention and lacing. Visible carbonation. 
Appearance: Golden yellow color with a moderate white head that slowly faded.
"Finally found the elusive Sculpin here on the East Coast, at Party Beverages in Newburgh, NY. Paid 8.50 for a bomber which I feel is still pretty steep, even after drinking this excellent brew."
Half pour into a Palm tulip
"Had many times and is a go to IPA, decided to finally review one here."
From a bomber to a SA perfect pint glass.
"Sculpin IPA looks like the typical San Diego forecast: clear and sunny with only partial, temporary clouds overhead. The beer sure does shine, even despite a soft-pressed haze (probably due to the fact that it's loaded-up with enough alpha acids to burn a hole through my shirt!) The second pour generated a much firmer, hardier head that left a mess of lacing. "
22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass
Light golden with a very very slight haze. Small but decently retaining head. 
Reviewed from notes; originally 6/10/11.
Thanks Cam
Huge thanks to my man Evan (optimator13) for this much wanted IPA!
"One of my favorite IPAs here. Last time I had this, it was my victory celebration beer in Glendale, AZ after the national championship. Thanks to stupac2 for sending it down to the beer desert in which I live. No freshness info. Enjoyed on 06/22/11."
On Draft Pizza Port San Clemente. Pours light golden with creamy white head. Strong aroma of hops and tropical fruits. Flavor is mainly C hops with nice malt balance. Combination of hop flavor w/ hop and fruity aroma is amazing. Very drinkable. Love this beer! So glad it's now in six packs.
"I had this beer pretty fresh from GBX in greenville, SC. Looks grest inch and a half of head pop and heavy lace. Smells like heaven, if heaven smells like mango and grapefruit. Good caramel malt with citrus hops, this is the kind of IPA I try a bunch of other IPA's for. Well balanced. Medium carbonation and just the right amount of boozey taste, I like a little. This one is a keeper. I wish I had a sixth barrel in my fridge at all times, paycheck willing. Good Day."
Date: 21 July 2011
From the notes I took at the Mondial.
A- Bright Clear orange with a sediment in the bottle. I did not pour the end into the glass. Nice lacing.
"This beer was one I was really looking forward to trying. I can't imagine anything much better than my favorite ipa on Nitro. The color was your typical golden hue which was mostly clear. The smell was good but not as strong as the normal sculpin.Tropical fruit --mangoes, pineapple and orange pith. I can't tell you how much I enjoy the nose of Sculpin. The taste follows the nose. Plenty of tropical flavors that consist of pineapple,orange,tangerine and some mango. It is bitter on the finish but has that slight biscuit quality to take out some of the bitterness. I wish there was a way they could put this nitro in a bottle because the creaminess that comes from nitro has to be experienced to believe. Nitro adds a whole new level of mouthfeel to what I already think is a amazing beer and my top ipa. Overall I love this beer and hope to have it again. I wish the nitro version was a little fresher which would be my only complaint and therefore I enjoyed the regular version better. When I did the side by side of the two versions the color of the two was night and day different. I did enjoy the mouthfeel of this beer. Glad I got to try it."
12oz bottle received in trade from G311. thanks vince! ive been looking forward to this one for a while now. drank from my samuel adams perfect pint glass. 
Poured from a 22oz bottle and shared among a handful a friends. 
"Poured into a Surly pint glass. Dark side of bright orange. Lots and lots of carbonation bubbles cloud this just a bit but I think I would call this pretty clear in transparency. All of those wonderful carbonation bubbles lead to a wonderful, sea foam looking head. Just a hint off of bright white and really sticky. Lace looks like it's gonna be just as sticky, and is. Nice, fat lace rings and spotted webbing line the inside of the glass at the end."
RR 'tion glass.
A- Pour a dark golden with a healthy head. Beautiful beer.
"Poured from a 22oz bottle to a tulip glass. The color is a clear gold with some copper highlights. White frothy head sits maximum of two fingers over the body. Retention was a little underwhelming, average for an ipa but leaves thick lacing on the glass."
"cloudy orange in appearance. head fades fast and leaves a white ring and a good amount of lacing. smells like a big bouquet of hops. citrus is most noticable and some pine, earthy hops also. taste is dominated by citrus/ grapefruit. slight pine taste just before the bitterness sets in. has a clean crisp mouthfeel with a slight dryness on the end. i'm glad my local shop finally started to carry this (or i finally noticed it) as this is an excellent ipa."
"I'm to the point now that if I see this at my local beer store I just buy as many as I can. This IPA is well worth the $2.75 a bottle I get it for. Sculpin pours out as a pleasing golden color with a nice soapy looking white head. The head settles and leave a white bubbly film over the beer that leaves a pretty damn good lacing down the glass. The smell of this beer is very inviting. It's got hops in there along with Grapefruit, lemon, orange, and a faint aroma of peach. The taste is very good as well it's gives off a really nice sweetness upfront followed but a cotton mouth bitter dryness in the back end. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation to it. Overall it's a very pleasing IPA, once of the best that isn't an Imperial in my opinion. The more you have the better they get. I really hope Ballest Point never pulls out of PA."
"Note: As this is a bomber, it's obviously an older bottle. "
650 mL bottle poured into a goblet.
"Tastes are citrus hops and awesomely more citrus hops, maltiness, floral and unfloral hops, fishy yeast, peppery flavors -- aspicy backbone-- a little heat, dry sugar, canned soups, garlic, flower stems, rye, pepperoni, losanges and aged, bittersweet sweetness."

I tasted this beer for the first time after I realized it won the World Beer Cup for International Pale Ale. Rarely for a beer drinker do you encounter the beverage that you feel was designed perfectly for your taste buds. I'm not sure if this is the best beer out there but for me it is at the top of the list. Although this beer is a lighter IPA it tastes hoppier then most DIPA's. 
"While eating out with some friends at Digger O' Dell's in Riverhead, I was pleasantly surprised to find this, along with several other fairly rare and tremendous IPAs, on the bar's bottle list. Having heard of its legendary status among hop heads, I quickly snatched one up for immediate consumption. "

Review #50
Pours a clear golden (with orange highlights) with a foamy white head that lasts and coats the sides of the glass throughout. Some active carbonation.
"Couple half growlers of this confirm it as probably the best beer I have had. Orange-ish gold color has a frothy white head, leaving white lacing down the entire glass. Not quite as aromatic as the bottled version. Taste does not suffer. Lip-smacking citrusy hops and a perfectly-balanced body hold this brew down. Taste is smooth and bitter. A rare treat on tap or in any version. Fantastic brew that everyone must have."
"Average pour gets it foaming up close to half the pint glass, settles for a bit in the three finger range and then down from there, slightly off white, hard to imagine more whipped up froth and airiness, very good retention as well as gluey stickiness to the thick lacing streaks. Deep golden hue to the liquid, slightly metallic looking, consistent throughout, curiously for all the foam virtually no visible bubbles. Sour, zesty orange and grapefruit citrus sets the tone early in the nose, pepper and salt, fresh green grass, pine cone, pressed rose petals, wild yeasts, way in the back row you may find a few chocolate and coffee notes. Full-bodied, here the huge foaminess brings a creamy texture to balance against the bitter invasiveness of the hops. Grains, grasses, snap peas, pepper, coarse country breads, pine, coal tar, no doubt your tongue tingles and feels alive. The sour grapefruit, orange citrus leaves some room for the apricot, peach fruit to vaguely soften things. As in the nose, the cocoa, malt and coffee accents are super-subtle, more present at warmer temps. Given its high energy level is not over the top and pretty close to true stylistic form. Hard not to feel refreshed after a few sips, doesn’t need to be mixed with Red Bull."
Impressed with this offering in every capacity except East Coast availability.
Had this one on tap at Foster's pub in Mt. Pleasant. First day of my vacation so I figure it would be a good beer to kick things off with. I've had this one a handful of times now but I'm finally reviewing it.
Received this one from Crabbicuss in N00b BIF 4. Thanks a lot bud!
"Pours a cloudy orange with golden hues and a pure white, foamy head that really takes its time before dissipating to leave a scattered, yet sticky lacing behind."
Thanks to my buddy Chris who brought this one back from SD for me. Poured into 10oz glass. Poured a clean orange-amber color with about an inch of just off-white head that had very good retention and lacing.
Courtesy of the Charleston Beer Exchange
"Pours a slightly hazy, light amber with a finger of white, creamy head that lingers. Lots of bubbles keep rising at a decent rate for a while. The nose is excellent, lots of piney hoppiness coming through, very fresh smelling. The taste is more of the same, but with a deeper level from the malts that balances the hop flavors quite well, almost giving it a woody character. There's also a bit of citrus flavor at the end. The mouthfeel is light with a fair amount of carbonation. Overall, this beer is quite enjoyable and has a nice balance between hops and malt."
On tap or Brewhouse in Weymouth.

A friend brought some back to share from a trip to California.
This looks great. A crystal clear golden hue.
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a nice white head. A very mild citrus hop flavor comes off the nose. A very light, clean citrus hop flavor carries through the taste. Good balance - not too sweet and a good hop profile. Good mouthfeel, possibly a bit of extra sweetness in the body. Overall, this is a very good IPA. You can do far worse than Sculpin, especially fresh."
Thanks to Jesse for this one.
2010. Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass
"It's appearance, though mentioned on the bottle as a lighter IPA balanced with big-time flavor, was a bit lighter than I anticipated. I could actually see through it and it was more orange than yellow or brown."
"Sculpin is all about the hops. Lots of them. Lots of kinds. Enjoyed a bomber in a nonic. Pours a hazy amber-orange with a thick cement-solid, 2-finger off-white head."

Review #4
A: Pours a deep and hazy yellow orange with a quarter of an inch of dense white head.
"Appearance: Medium golden yellow, leaves soap style suds on the glass while drinking."
"Review from a very fresh bottle. I have had a few not so fresh bottles since and it really drops off quickly IMO. If my first try of this beer had been an older bottle, this review would be much different and I would not have sought out the beer again. Since I was lucky to have it fresh, here we go:"
"A: Pours a hazy orange amber with several fingers of foamy off white head. A fair size layer retains, and leaves nice lacing."
Thanks to Ynot2 for the bottle as an extra.
"i feel as though i have drank a lot of ""west coast ipa"" over the last five to ten years but i have never had this one before. and given the hype -- it actually delivers. this is right up there, on the top of the SoCal dry, fruity, hop forward West Coast IPA - heap."
"This brew pours an impressive hazy apricot hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a two finger fluffy white head with heaps of lacing,the smell is piney,citrus infused hops,boiled candy and pineapple,it has a medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of grapefruit,citrus zest,pineapple,boiled candy,a touch of marzipan and finished off with a nice sherbety,piney hop bitter kick and overall a very nice sample of an AIPA and will buy again before it dissapears."
"A: Beautiful color, great lacy head, just enough transparency but has a great texture."
"We pour a brew the color of goldenrod. It holds a three finger almost white head, which retains nicely, leaving thick, battered lacing around the glass. No sediment is noted, but there is a faint haze to the beer. Carbonation appears to be just below average. Fruit is abundant throughout the nose. We get sweet honeydew melon, cantaloupe and, as promised by the label, apricot and mango. The only aromas that are stronger are citric hops, with a huge lemony scent, and big grapefruit. The malts help balance, and give an earthy quality to the brew. As we sip, the first thing noted is the bright, citrusy hop character. In the taste it is thoroughly grapefruity, as opposed to a more lemony flavor. This is cut through the middle by sweet fruit, with peach, apricot, and faint red apples as the main contenders. The hops come back in full force at the end, but appear a bit more piney than citrusy. Sugary sweetness also sees us through to the final drop, but is well integrated amongst the other flavors. The aftertaste breathes calmly of bittering hops, faint citrus, and clean, darker malts. The body is light to medium and the carbonation is medium to high. The mouth is coated nicely, as this brew feels on the more syrupy side. Ultimately, however, the mouth is dried with a chalky astringency. Despite the overall lightness there is a decent sipability, and relative creaminess. The abv is on the higher end, but this guy drinks quite nicely."

Ballast Point Sculpin IPA
"No bottling date that I could find, poured into a wine glass."
Review adapted from notes taken 10/6/10
"Snot I am starting to like IPAs more and more. Something about the great citrus flavor. Two finger head of thick foam, good full lace with much cling. Color is a 9 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of grapefruit, lime, malt, pepper, and pine. Taste is very sharp and refreshing, with flavors of grapefruit, pine nuts, lemon peel, roasted malt, and vinegar. Mouthfeel is creamy and full, with good zing. This brew sneaks up and kicks your behind. I will try to get some more of this fine beer."
From 22oz bomber to Bruges hybrid glass on 4/16/11

"Drank on Tap at Monk, Fremantle"
"A - body has an unusually bright orange hue, nice head, lacing carries through"
"Poured on-tap at the brewery, this beer was served in a pint glass. I'm looking forward to this because I have had it before in a bottle and I have always enjoyed the beer. The colors are brighter than the Big Eye IPA that Ballast produces. The beer was slightly hazy, but more orange-toned to the amber coloring. The beer had no head to speak of. Heavy aromas of cedar and citrus hit the nose, with a very strong, hoppy background. Grapefruit sweet and tart on the tongue, with mild, peppery, green hops to balance. The beer is extremely well balanced, and ridiculously smooth. Tart and bitter aftertaste, with a surprisingly smooth finish. Well balanced and smooth bodied, I could drink this one all day."
"Thanks (again) to Dempsey16 for this delicious brew! Bottle to pint. Flagship for its type! Picture-perfect. Very good bouquet. Just. Plain. Tasty. Goes down as nicely as it hits your palate. If you can't get them, trade for them! The only thing better is a double..."

12oz bottle $3 from Abe's of Bethlehem
"Served from tap into a flared pilsner. Poured a golden yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, citrus, and pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, citrus, pine hop, citrus hop, and subtle grapefruit. It had a medium feel (almost resiny) on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew as I'm sure you are all well aware. I had this awhile back in the bottle and it was quite heavenly. If I'm honest I MUCH preferred it out of the bottle as compared to the tap. It still had a nice flavor but it just wasn't as balanced. The pine aspect really overpowered in the tap version. It improved slightly upon warming up a bit but still lacked that heavenly aspect. Still a definite must try!"
"Pours a light orange with a bit of golden yellow mixed in. One finger pearl white head, good lacing throughout. Awesome nose. Mango, grapefruit, floral hops, bit of apricot and more awesome tropical fruit. Light, crisp and extremely well integrated hop flavors. Mango up front along with a hint of apricot and yes, peach, as advertised. The sweeter hops give way to grapefruit and lemon flavors in the middle portion of the beer. A bit of semi-bitter pine resin and floral hops follow before some of the tropical sweetness from the beginning of the beer comes full circle on the close. Awesomely hopped, extremely well put together hop forward flavor profile."

"Pours a golden body w/ great head and lace. A hoppy nose for sure as well as piney and floral plus a touch of booze and sweetness. Easy to drink for being so hoppy as a medium body w/ citric hop bitterness and a mild, bready sweetness balance each other. On the backend there is a crisp, dry finish. Very hoppy but not a tastebud killer as I pick up some fruits like grape and sweet, plush fruits but those don't kill the minor malt presence."
Poured into a pint glass.
"One of my favorite brews. A very slightly hazy appearance, with a light copper color. Some spiceness and hop aroma is present, but tells nothing of what is to come. The taste is amazing, starting with a Mango taste, progressing to a spicy pineapple taste, and finishing with pine. Amazing. The first time I tried it, I thought it had some sort of flavoring added. One of my favorites, I love you sculpin!!!"
This is a really wonderful IPA. Love at first sip.

A - Pours a golden color with tinges of orange in the light. It is clear with carbination running though it. The head on mine was aggresive from an aggresive pour.
Picked this up at Abe's in bethlehem.
Had this Sculpin on tap at Lord Hobo before Extreme Beer Fest.
"Beer stores around here just got this one in, so I assume it's fresh. No way of confirming though."
This one pours a lighter than expected glowing gold with slightly murky clarity. The head formed quickly to a creamy eggshell mass and had good retention. 
"On tap at a The Fishery here in SD. Poured a nice amber and decent head retention with lacing down the side as it settled. Wonderful smell of sweet apricots as I worked my way down the pint. In the end I found it to be nicely balanced with the hop bitterness, fruity sweetness and drinkability."
"Pours amber with a thin white head, lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma has a lot of citrus and almost tropical hops, very potent and absolutely amazing smell. Taste starts out with the same fruity taste as the aroma, almost entirely hops with a touch of malt. While the flavor is great, the finish is bitter and the hop flavors feel sour towards the end. Too much hop bitterness without enough malt/yeast sweetness to balance it out, while the beer is good, this is disappointing. Mouthfeel starts out smooth with medium-strong carbonation, ends more sour/bitter. Still quite drinkable, but the hop bitterness becomes overwhelming as I finish the beer."
"In the latest installment of ""Angrytrator goes to the beer store,"" I'm re-reviewing Sculpin. I haven't bought this beer in over a year, because it's simply not worth $9 / bomber or $7 / pint. "
"A - Poured into my SN tulip. Has a beautiful pale, but cloudy, orange color, with an off white 2 finger head. Appears to be very carbonated, as bubbles continuously appear from the bottom center of the glass and float to the surface. "
"Great overall IPA. Live the aroma, sweet with apricot and grainy sweetness. Little tail, and slightly bitter for my taste. Pretty darn nice. Not a total fave, but certainly interesting flavor and incredible aroma. Yum, but enjoy carefully with that 7 percent kicker."
"Poured half of a 22oz bomber into a Cigar City Snifter, while the other half remained in the bottle until the snifter was emptied and then poured into a Liefmans gold-rimmed Goudenband Cervoise glass. "
"Way better than the bottle. One of the best looking IPAs I've had. Great, frothy off-white head, perfect lacing, typical IPA amber beer with high clarity."
"I have been drinking this beer and loving it for a few years and I feared when they started making it in 6 packs it would diminish in quality but thankfully I was wrong, poured into my Bruery Tulip glass."
"Bottle: 22oz, purchased a couple days ago."
"App - A light hazy copper with a bone-white, one finger, frothy head."
What a beer! The smell is second to none..the perfect combination of hops brings out mango and peach followed by bitter pine hops with a clean crisp finish. A perfectly balanced American IPA ..A gold medal winning beer for a reason..definitely one of my favorites.
"On-tap at Beer Revolution. I've had this before in the bottle, but very nice to have this super fresh from the keg. Pours a golden amber with a thin, finely beaded head that leaves some superb sheets of lacing. The aroma exhibits some lovely notes of fresh floral, citrus, and pine aromas. I'd kinda forgotten how good this beer is. Just delightful flavors of pine, citrus peel, and some sweet, pure malt, all beautifully in balance. Delicious!"
A: Looks great. Nice coppery color with a slight head that sticks around nicely. 
"Bright-yellow golden appearance. Cloudly, hazy looking thru the glass. Bubbly creamy head sticks around after a few sips. Hop juice. Mmm"

"This is the best west coast IPA, It's hard to imagine a better IPA, the closest IPA that even compares is the GreenFlash West coast IPA but side by side their is a clear separation of complexity. "
A: light orange.. very bright.. tight bright white head..
"First pour into a Duvel tulip produced two to three finger head that softened within a minute or so. A light, clear golden color with orange hues. Swirling reduces the head to a half finger."
This delicious IPA was recommended to me by a local store. The clerk said it was one of the best IPA on the market. I wholeheartedly agree.
Many thanks to AugustGarage for the chance to taste this incredible IPA.
"IPA's are not supposed to get much better than this: fresh Sculpin served on draft at the perfect temperature in a big Duvel tulip. The beer is extremely hazy, it's as if I can see hop oils swirling around in the chill haze. The soft orange glow of the beer is highlighted with a fluffy white cap of foam that carries the aroma with it. There's really no other way to describe the beer other than tropical--it smells like fresh cut mangos, papaya, and tangerines covered in orange blossom honey. There is a little pine aroma but the fruit dominates the nose. The taste is a lot the same, juicy fruit, sticky pine grounded by sweet lightly toasted malt that provides a nice roundness of flavor and mouthfeel. The bitterness really comes in at the end but there is enough residual sweetness and mango flavor for good balance. The carbonation is spot on with just enough prickliness to dance on you tongue without drowning out the hops. It's hard to imagine a better IPA but perhaps I would like one that's a little earthier with more herbal woody hop flavors and less papaya (a fruit that tastes like meat to me). Otherwise this is an excellent beer and a great experience on draft"
"Had this a while ago, finally decided to grab another to try it again. Pours a dull gold/orange with absolutely pure white head that retains incredibly well, laces a ton, and generally is magnificent. "
"Really chunky head, sticky lacing makes it fun to twirl the glass, very coating. clean straw colored body. very nice."
Appearance: Nice one inch frothy head. Really nice pale golden hue to the beer.

"This growler was courtesy of thagr81us (thanks Calton!), who sent it to me for my birthday despit the package I sent him being destroyed by FedEx. The growler ""popped"" when I unscrewed the lid, unleashing a multitude of in your face bitter and hoppy aromas. This was poured into a Goose Island pint glass. It poured a rich and beautiful gold in color with a two finger, whispy off white head that laced the glass. The aromas are very wet, bitter, and full of pine. It features very citrusy and sweet hops. There is so much going on here for an IPA! I love the variation. The taste of is of pine and honey. I'd say that this is somwhere in between Hopslam and 90 Minute. It's excellent and a must try. It drinks very crisp and has excellent carbonation. It doesn't leave you with cotton mouth like many IPAs and actually leaves your mouth watering for more. This beer is superb! Thanks for the birthday growler Calton!"

Poured into a pint glass and laced all the way down. The nose was big grapefruit. Lots of hops and citrus. Taste was wonderful with a big hop punch.

Smell is malty sweetness with a balance of big tropical fruit hops, slightly jammy. Taste starts off with a huge pineapple flavor, enticingly bitter but not overpowering, crisp and very tasty beer with a good malty backbone. Medium light body with a light but active carbonation. A very solid IPA, easily the best of its style and up there in flavor and appearance with the best DIPA. Will gladly drink this any day."

"Had this at City Beer in San Francisco. I love that you can actually have beer right in the store! Pours a bright orange colour with thick white head.

Medium bodied carbonation. A beautiful IPA, one of the best I've had."

A - Hazy amber straw sports what can only be described as a perfect head. Retention is respectable. although the lacing is a little thin. 
"I finally got to try Sculpin, thanks to a trade with Ultraman 9000. Poured a slightly hazy, deep golden color with a nice head. Some nice lacing after 10 minutes as the head disapated to about 1/8 inch. The smell was as expected from the track record of this brew - a nice grapefruity aroma that I have seldom experienced. The taste was very well balanced...smooth and full of grapefruit and citrus notes. I tasted this one side by side with another highly rated IPA and the Sculpin was more balanced and did not have as much bite/ bitterness as the other. This is one great IPA. I could drink several of these . An exceptional brew!"
On tap at Common Market in Charlotte.
A: Golden color with a little less than a finger of fine head.
"To begin, I have to say that, given the hype and the claim from very trustworthy beer connoisseurs of how complex this should be and all the tropical fruits that should be here, I'm starting to believe Overlord's claim that this beer has changed. I have no previous experience with it, but of the few people I know personally who have, nobody thinks it's still the same recipe done the same way. It's great, but I don't review by hype."
"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay chalice. A nice head was formed but it dissipated rather quickly. Aroma for me is grapefruit and resinous herbs. Not unlike many other west coast IPA's that I have had, though that's not a bad thing. Taste surprised me a bit as based on the aroma I was expecting something a little heavier and more syrupy. "
Poured into a Duvel tulip.
"Poured into a fluted tulip, it's quick to generate a fluffy head of sticky foam. Instant resiny aroma packed with floral/herbal hops and tropical fruit. Color is a light high-clarity orange with tiny rising bubbles. Lacing forms in sudsy sheets, and sticks around for awhile."

"Sculpin, huh? One of those sought-after gems on BA here. Hey, it's good, yeah. Not unique. Just real orange on the spectrum of looks and, in a skewed way, flavor. A lot of citrus/tropical elements to the brew. First off, it sports a lovely smooth, Orange-Julius-foamy head that holds tight and lasts awhile atop the misty-dank sunny-orange corpus cervezus - very attractive on a seaside holiday frozen-cocktail tip. Brightly-pulsating waves of melon/custard/pineapple/coconut/ project feet from the glass - quite enticing, yet almost pedestrian. From here, I lose sense of the whole ""IPA"" tag and tune in to a citrus-zest-fest-injection. Not screaming beer/ale with the sip... Fruity, smooth, and thick. Refreshing, but leaving some citric-slick smear behind. Nectary to an extent. Complex collage of tropic fruit dominates, surfing a wave of bold, creamy, dextriny malt - apropos considering this mix or balance of the hops - couldn't imagine this with a snappy, dry feel... It's good - not representative(?) of the (moderate) degree of hype I've been attuned to. Happy to have met with it this one time."
"A - Hazy, burnished yellow-gold. Frothy, thick off-white head. Carbonation looks light."
from notes 12/3/10
"220z bottle poured into a tulip. No freshness info. Pours a relatively clear and bright amber, more yellow than orange. One inch of frothy foam slowly dissipates leaving good lacing. Little carbonation. Beautiful nose! Mango, pineapple, and fresh, piny hops. A hint of rich malt sweetness can be detected under it all. Medium-light bodied but also flat. Not syrupy at all though. Goes down smooth without destroying the palate. Bight and playful hops have only light resiny character. Citrus, orange blossom, and pine on the palate with almost no trace of malty heaviness. Just the way I like it! This is probably the best non imperial IPA I have ever had. I can only imagine how good this would be if it were fresh from the brewery."
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a nonic glass
"a. orange, light gold. nice silky head, lingers lightly."
A: An amazingly clear copper body capped with a small white foamy head that recedes quickly to island foam.
"12oz bottle. Poured a murky golden haze. Retained a nice head and carbonation throughout. Smell consisted of pines and ""sweaty"" hops. Tasted a big hop character, mango and lemon zest. Crisp and light bitter finish in regard to mouthability. Drank down smooth; a nice and solid IPA with an interesting character."
a-huge white head that will not go away. Golden body that is full of fizzy bubbles.

A: Poured into a New Belgium globe. Pours a hazy golden color with a large 3 finger head that lingers for some time. 
"22 ounce bottle courtesy of trade from mobz24, poured into a snifter glass."
A bit frustrating that there is no bottle date for a rather expensive IPA. The appearance is a dense orange with a nice frothy head. The smell is intoxicating. Strong citrus and floral notes. This can't be fresh because it tastes like rotten grapefruit. A little more bitter than the average IPA. Very little after taste. Drinkability is surprisingly still high considering it isn't fresh. I will have to review this again with a fresh bottle.
Poured from a bomber into snifter. 
From 12 oz bottle to pint glass
"I poured this IPA into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was ugly cloudy colored but did have a very nice luxurious poofy head. The Hay colored beer was very hoppy and smelled very hoppy also. Just like it should have. I think it was what an IPA should be but I will not buy it again, tooo hoppy for me."
"A - This beer pours a nice golden orange color, that has a good clarity to it. It also has a nice 2-finger white head on it, that left specs of lacing behind as it slowly fell. This is a great looking beer."
Poured into a snifter. Shared with mjyoung.
"A very solid example of an IPA and my favourite of the lineup at an IPA tasting in October. Great pour with frothy head. Clean clear and crisp. Smells like hoppy goodness with some citrus and just a hint of malt. Tastes like a balanced hop profile between a few types of hopes... some citrus, floral hints, very good. A bit bitter on the back of my tongue but overall very drinkable"
Had a 22 oz bomber. This bottle did not say limited release so I assumed it was fresher. 
Poured from bomber into tall glass.
Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a footed glass. No freshness date on the bottle.
Poured into a Duvel tulip. 
"Poured from a bomber into an imperial pint glass. The color is a hazy orange hue with a large white lacy head. The head dissipates after a few minutes. The smell is centential hops through and through. The taste is floral, bitter, rose hips and a bit citrusy. The body is a medium and good carbonation throughout. I would drink this every week and now that it is available I probably will. This is very similar to my other two favorites (Two-hearted and Stone IPA)."
A: Cloudy and orangish-yellow hue with a thin cream colored head; beautiful lacing
Recieved as a extra from Tieman.
Bright orange color with a creamy white head that leaves plenty of sticky lacing.
"12oz poured into some sort of goblet/tulip hybrid at The Union Brewhouse in Weymouth, MA."
"Wow!! This is Avery Maharajah's civilized little brother. A blast of grapefruit hops in the nose and taste, but not as challenging and in-your-face as Maharajah. Pours a color half way between dull gold and light amber with an average size, slightly off-white head. Average retention and thick spotty lacing. "
"Wow, 2011 is almost here...Crazy this year has gone so fast. Well, I loved the Ballast Point Big Eye IPA, so here goes the flagship Sculpin..."
"Very tasty beer however not worth the $10 for a 22OZ. Better off buying their Big Eye IPA ( $13-$14 a 6-pack) which is a staple in my fridge. I waited forever for my local Package Store to finally stock this. Needless to say, I was let down just a bit. After reading reviews and seeing how highly this beer is rated, I am a bit surprised as I do not feel it is any more special then their regular lineup of quality beers. Very good beer just not worth the $ in my eyes. I'll buy it again, just not something I'd pick up every time I go to the store."
Thanks to Decadance for the bottle. Review input from notes.
Poured from a 22oz bottle into a large tulip glass 12/27/10.
Thanks to mlaroche for this want extra of mine.
This beer pours a brilliant golden color. Filtered with a foamy white head. Lacing remains up and down the glass. The aroma is nothing short of incredible. Citrus smells emanate from the glass.

22 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.
Pours a golden hazy amber. With a think bubbly head.
"On tap at my local pub. The beer presents itself in a pale orange golden hue. A finger of dense white foam dissipates quickly. Excellent lacing. The smell is pure citrus. Orange peel dominates followed by a slight hint of biscuity malt. Taste follows the nose. An explosion of orange, tangerine, and mango hits my pallet at first quaff. This is the juiciest IPA I've ever had! The hop bill sports seven different varieties yet the beer is perfectly balanced with a easing bitterness and subtle malt backbone. Finish is juicy, bitter and sweet all at the same time. Feel is medium bodied and carbonation is spot on. Drinkability is dangerously high due to the delicious taste and completely hidden ABV. This is quite honestly my favorite single IPA of all time. I have had it many times on tap, bottled and on cask and it never fails to please. Seek this out and enjoy!"
"Great honey golden orange color. Puffy dense white head, noticable lacing that slides down the sides of my tulip glass. The aroma is a blend of strong citrusy hops, grapefruit, pinapple and fresh cut grass. Really fresh, real nice. A hop explosion, grapefruit, citrus, tropical fruits and grassy undertones. Simple clean grain flavor. Long lasting lemon citrus bitter finish. Nice mouthfeel, not watery, not thin. And oh so drinkable. "
Pours a golden straw color into a snifter frome the bottle. Nice medium sized head that leaves a lot of lacing.
"Nice active bright white head on top of a very clean and bright body of yellow/slight orange color. It really looks amazing. If you drew a picture of a beer, this is what it would look like."
One of the more celebrated IPAs on the market. A big shout goes out to Mulder1010 and STEG for hooking me up with bottles of this stuff. Cheers! 
"I've had this several times, but recently decided to get the pen out and do this beer some justice. Picked up a bottle from Boonton Liquor Outlet in Boonton, NJ. "
"Split 22 ounce bottle with my buddy Griff, who brought it over to my place for some sampling yesterday. Review done from notes. Bottle was poured into my Kona Brewing shaker glass."
A- Golden Hued with a Medium head.
A - Pale honey
"This is truly a great IPA. Breweries around the country are all trying to create a tastely, high quality IPA but all are coming up short of Sculpin. The color is a wonderfully solid and has a great luster. Aroma is all big, sticky, icky, piney, citrusy and rainy hops. Taste is an exceptionally good combination of hops and malt (but mostly hops thank goodness). Taste is more on the bitter/piney side than the malty side. Mouthfeel is very crisp and clean. I could get used to this."
Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a standard pint glass.
Great Double/Imperial with a bountiful of hops and nice citrus notes that leave a deceivingly low alcohol presence on the finish. Sporadically hard to find with unreliable distribution. It seems to ebb and flow through inventory at local stores in the Phoenix market. One of my favorite limited/rotating release finds from Ballast Point in 2010!
12oz bottle poured into SA perfect pint.
"A: Pours a hazy orange color, nice frothy white head with good lacing down the glass. "
Pours a slightly hazed tangerine color with a creamy and pretty dense two fingers of beige head. Keeps a pretty full and ample lace with a nice amount of coating on the sides of the glass.
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. The night before I sampled this just lightly chilled. It was quite good. However, tonight's sample had been thoroughly chilled in the refrigerator overnight. Slight chill haze and yummy head with excellent retention. Grapefruit and piney nose was enticing. I even got more grapefruit and yummy citrus hoppiness when it was chilled further! Excellent brew. I recommend it cold. Exceedingly refreshing also despite the abv! I want another!"
22oz bottle into a shaker
Active review:
"One of my absolute favorite IPAs brewed today. Finally a 12oz bottle, big thanks to petesuphi. Shared with him. A true hommage to the Goddess Ninkasi, herself. "
"Finally got around to trying this gem. Shared a few with my brother. Bomber poured into Duvel tulip. Two fingers of pillowy head sit on top of a beautiful orange, golden body. Smell is floral and citrus leaning on the citrus. As I let this fish swim on my tongue, the pineapples, peaches and citrus goodness fills my mouth and goes down clean leaving nice sticky lacing on my glass. Dangerously drinkable and just solid all around."
"My first Sculpin! I've been wanting to try this beer for some time, glad I was able to score a couple bombers. "
"a: shaker pint, golden amber in color, served with a creamy layer of carbonation that retains well"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into oversized tulip. Beer was bright golden orange, with a little bit of haze. The aggressive pour created a smokestack of light creamy head, which took a good while to recede. The nose was aroma rich - predominantly grapefruit/tropical fruit, with a little bit of pineyness behind it."
Served from a bottle into my 30th anniversary taster tulip.

Bottle provided as an extra by thedindaniel. Thanks Daniel! Just received it today and decided to drink it ASAP to get the most freshness out of it.
appearance: golden color with good head retention
"Outstanding IPA. This one ranks in the upper echelon with PtE, Hop Stoopid, Racer 5, etc, etc. Friend stopped by unexpectedly with a bomber bottle and I was more than happy to help split it. Pours a bright pale/light orange color with nice head and foever lacing. Smells wonderful---fresh hops, pine, fruit, etc. Taste follows suit with a creamy bitterness and dry finish. Very different than BP's Big Eye IPA which is much more malt dominated. The malt in Sculpin seems very minimal or light. Easily one of the best IPA's I've had the pleasure of drinking. Too bad bomber bottles are so pricey --- $8-10 locally."
"Terrific beer in the vein of modern IPAs that use primarily late addition hopping for maximum hop flavor and minimal bitterness. This seems to be the trick for converting people that say they don't like hoppy beers, and even paves the way to eventually liking the beers with more hp bitterness."
"Pours a light amber with lots of fine sediment, two finger foamy white head that fades to a thin cap leaving a few splotches of lace. Smell: a blast of bright pineapple, grapefruit rind, nectarine, light biscuit. Taste: pineapple, soft tropical fruit notes, peach + lemon tea, biscuity base. Light-medium bodied with prickly carbonation. According to their website this is year round now, and FL is a new market so I presume this is fairly fresh. A very good IPA, I see why it is highly regarded... there are a few other beers with *very* similar profiles that are rated far below this one though, so the (prior) limited availability has likely influenced the rating."
Thanks to hophead247 for throwing this in. Poured bomber into an IPA specialty glass.
"Picked up a growler of this from my local shop. Was really impressed with it. Great appearance! Pours a hazy golden color with a nice head that left a decent lace. Mouthfeel of citrus and pine. Excellent hop presence which is what I like. I would like the mouthfeel to be a little more heavy. Overall, believe all the hype behind this beer. Though it is over priced, its well worth it. Too bad its not readily available round here."

Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip.
"very nice... a lot of hype about this one, and it pretty much lives up to it. just a simple, delicious san diego ipa. pours a fairly clear, glowing burnt-gold with a big white head that never goes away and leaves tons of lace as the beer goes. nose is fruit galore mixed with a nice, pale malt backbone that lends mild sweetness and blends and harmonizes just about perfectly. the malt character amplifies the hop profile instead of simply adding tons of sweetness to mellow the harsh flavor of tons of hops like other less-finessed ipas from ballast point's neck of the woods. mango, peach, nectarine, melon, citrus, pine and resin (read: pot) all with a really bright, pure, fresh-fruit-juice-on-the-beach-in-SoCal quality. speaks of the place where it comes from. unmistakeable. that awesome ocean-air-tropical-paradise thing that you get from the best SoCal ipas. taste is well-balanced, and like the nose suggested, the fruity hops (and yeast?) incorporate extremely well with the pale malt, which produces some sweetness and a touch of toastiness. some pineyness comes through in the end as well, and it kind of zips it up rather than bitters it up. medium body that seems to effortlessly carry the weight of all the hoppy goodness. another example of how well-chosen the grain bill is here. long, hoppy finish that is very mild on the bitter and virtually free of any alcohol taste or aftertaste. i've kind of grown out of my ipa phase, but this one was really well made, tasted like san diego in a bottle and definitely left me wanting more. a real treat. sets the bar as far as i'm concerned."

12 oz bottle poured into a globe glass. 
Nice solid head and plenty of lacing. The color is a pretty standard gold/amber for an IPA but there is an amazing amount of bubbles.
"from a 12 0z bottle it poured a slightly hazed golden yellow color with a fresh white 1 finger head that stayed with good lacing on side of glass really fresh looking..smell was pine forest with citrus and tropical fruits just bursting with hops. ..taste was crisp pine with loads of tropical hops..mango,pineapple tastes fill the pallet and just resonate full hop flavor ...then grapefruit and and floral hops..malts were there also..mouth feel crisp and fresh well carbonated and full of tropical hops..drink ability is outstanding this bottle was extremely fresh so full of hop flavor really one of the top 5 ipas ive had"
Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a Duvel tulip.
"A nice slightly hazy golden color with big pillowy white head. Some lacing, good retention. Smell is big grapefruit, big pine, big hops, basically. I would say it's citrusy with some piney undertones. The flavor follows suit with some big grapefruit flavor, followed by a piney finish. A bit sticky, but not dry on the finish. Clean bready malt underneath. MF is medium, very smooth, good drinkability. Overall, a really well put-together beer, though it kind of reminds me of very fresh Two-Hearted."
A: clear golden brown. white foam with some lacing.
A - Hazy Golden West Coast IPA
Finally scored a bomber if this one. Poured into a Sam Adams glass.
Pours golden yellow. No haze. Exactly what's expected. Take a picture for your IPA Fancy magazine. 
Picked this up at a local store when someone left it behind after the clerk had put it aside. Never picked it up. Thought it was a good find. 
a - golden liquid
"I drank this fine brew back when I was starting my quest to drink the top100. This review is from notes, but I almost don't need them because the memory sits so well in my head. I think I still taste it."
"poured into a snifter. nice orange hi-c color with very white fluffy head. very citrus-like smell, grapefruit, orange, hint of lemon. the taste as smooth as hell. Very nice citrus flavor and nice malt balance. Also some nice hints of tropical fruit, maybe some peach. the bitterness is mild and subdued, which was an extremely pleasant surprise. it's there just enough to remind you you are drinking an ipa, but it's not strong at all. the mouthfeel is nice and lively. extraordinarily smooth for an ipa. I'm normally not one for hype and tend to be disappointed, but this was fantastic."
"I Picked up a bomber of this gem at Julio's the other day. Employee told me that it was no more than three weeks old - awesome. This one was poured into a large Piraat snifter. The pour gives way to a massive four finger bone-white head that mushrooms over the top of the glass. The head slowly, very slowly faded away and leaves behind some of the stickiest amazing looking lacing I have ever seen. Even after a few minutes a moderately sized head remains floating on top. The color is ruby, burnt orange. "
I bought this one out of town because simply my town doesn't carry this ale.
Pours a dark gold with a mild chill haze. Wonderful and large off-white head--settles to a dome. Leaves a ton of chunky lace.
"A: The beer is slightly hazy and golden yellow in color. It poured with a large white head that slowly faded away, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface. A very light amount of carbonation is visible."

"I love this beer because it really expands upon what an IPA can be. The honey-gold color and thick head are lovely. The sharp aroma of hops is clean and powerful-spice, citrus, pine, and strange tropical aromas that I normally wouldn't expect burst from the glass."

Purchased at City Beer in San Fran for $8.99
"Appearance - Nice generous, off-white foamy head which leaves a lot of lacing. The beer has a cloudy amber appearance."
Appearance - This came out a gorgeous darkish-orange in color with incredible clarity and a wonderful sheen. The head was perfectly perched on an easy pout. As it slowly went down it left a thick film all along my mug. This is a real beauty shop.
"an orange pour of something quite nice in the nose. a textbook balance of all the aspects of an IPA. Orange clear with a nice white head. there is retention. nose is a perfect balance of malt pollen, floral hop, and citrus fruit. otherwise the body seems to be just that. its right in the middle. textbook. feel is a bit soapy. grapefruit..."

"Ballast Point Sculpin, 22oz bomber picked up at Liquor Outlet Wine Cellar. Pours beautiful hazy orange color with large white head in shaker. Head sticks to glass nicely. Great aroma of grapefruit and hops. Super citrus flavor, clean malt base. Light, smooth and silky. Very drinkable, this is a superb brew. I was worried that the bottle may not be fresh but that was put to rest the moment I open the bottle and poured it. It smelled excellent before I could even get my nose near the glass."
12th review on BA
Ballast Point is a new arrival in Florida. I'm eager to try the much-hyped Sculpin.
this must be fresh because it sports the black label.
A: Pours a light copper/golden hue with a fat head and thick lace from start to finish with a good amount of effervescence.
A- Pours an orange or a dark golden with a slight red hue. Half-inch white head. Plentiful lacing. Magnificent.
A. Golden Orange Hue with impressive lacing. This is one good looking IPA

"Wow. great beer. poured from bomber. the color is so nice: orange/peach color. great carbonation with an awesome head. smells like peaches and citrus with some hops. extreme pleasant smell. the taste is incredible. great hops, and some initial peach flavor. how a great ipa should be. mouth is crisp with a very clean finish. i drank the whole bomber, and this was a very easy thing to do. "
22oz bottle pour into 12oz sam adam glass.
"Now this is what I like in an IPA. I like them to be something more than just a flat bitter hop bomb. The beer pours a nice copper color with a nice head. Smells very nice and the taste just shines. There is a solid, slightly sweet malt base behind the hops. The hops linger with that slightly sweet flavor. I could drink a ton of these. One of the best IPAs I've had - right up there with Pure Hoppiness, Furious, ans Town Hall Masalla. Now if I could just get it here without breaking the bank."
Huge surprise gift from a fellow BA upon moving to town.
"Wow this is an amazing IPA. Pours a slightly hazy golden copper color with a big white head. Aroma is full of citrus fruits and pine. The taste is loaded with citrus, tropical fruits and hops flavors. Nicely balanced with the malts; this has good bitterness to it, but it is not too over the top. Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect for the style. Medium-light body, moderate carbonation and quite smooth. Great drinkability, the bottle did not last long!"

"Half growler purchased fresh from Decicco's. Pours into a tulip glass with a billowing, thick white head of foam atop a hazy, amber-gold color. Great lacing and at least a finger of retention."
"I had been interested in trying this for some time, and was always puzzled as to why it was not available among the other Ballast Point brews in Virginia. Nonetheless, when I saw a bottle, I snatched it up. "
On draft at the Ballast Point Brewery in San Diego.
"So I guess Ballast Point brewed this batch especially for the DC area. Lucky us! If we don't continue to get this stuff in our area after the overwhelmingly positive results that this smart move will produce (IMO), then I think I'll cry!"
Serving type - 22oz bottle

Beautiful IPA. A light orangey-gold with a slightly off-white head that settles slowly and leaves a thin film on the glass and a thin layer on top of the beer.
A-Pours a hazy golden color with a finger thick head and nice uniform lacing on the glass.
"22oz bomber with the tan label. I guess that means it isn't the new one? Regardless, BP doesn't distribute to western NY. The store owner brought these up from NYC himself. I'll take what I can get."
"Drank from a bomber on 9/30/10, smell is really fresh!"
"A - Bright golden yellow and orange. Poured into my RR ""tion"" glass with a nice, thick creamy two finger white head with good lacing."

Golden yellow with a heavy haze. Four fingers of dense level super small white micro bubbles. Excellent lacing.

"Having been disappointed by this beer twice before, I decided to give it one final shot to live up to its reputation. Fool me thrice, shame on me. This one was poured from the tap at Tops into a small snifter. "
"Pours with a thick foamy head leaving lacey rings all over the glass. A beautiful rusty orange color with slight carbonation. Smells of a variety of citrus but the grapefruit really breaks through more than anything else. At first the taste matches the strong hints of grapefruit in the smell, followed by a punch of hops that complements the sweet citrusy flavor perfectly. Very slight alcohol finish but so so smooth I could sip on this all night long. Excellent!"
Pours a hazy dark golden color with a couple fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a layer on top leaving some nice lacing on the glass.
big thanks to nerdrocker101 and the Traditional GIF for this one.
Reviewed from my tasting notes of a decent sized sample I consumed at an epic tasting event held with the members of the SMBDC.
A killer side by side with regular sculpin at spinnerstown hotel. Double dry hopped with palisades and cascade and cask conditioned. Baller!
"22oz. bomber poured into my new DFH hand blown glass. Thanks to djmichaelk for this one. No bottle date, but this is the old lable."
Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. No freshness date but is believed to be fresh because of the new style label that was just released.
"A: Nice head retention, glowing orange with a bright clarity allowing light to penetrate like a beacon of brilliance beneath feathery lace."
a - poured a one and a half fingers thick eggshell colored head into a snifter that settles into a thick ring with good sheeting and tremendous lace. the body was a bright amber color.
No longer a limited release as witnessed by the redesigned bottle. But still the King of IPAs...
"Poured from a bomber into a fluted Allagash chalice. Beer is a clear golden orange. The initial four fingers of snow white fluffy head was very beautiful, lacing lightly on the glass as you take sips and the head dissipated. A beautiful beer, that you should see in daylight to do it justice. "
"I have had this on tap and in the bottle. Never a bad day with this beer to look forward to at the end of the day. Nice aroma, big IPA bite, and really cant say anything bad about it. "
I found the last 22oz. bomber at Brookline Fine Wine & Gourmet for $10.99. Poured into a pint glass.
"Pours medium orange with an off-white foamy head. Good clarity. I expected more lace -- some, but not much."
"This is one of the neck coded bottles (according to BP, they just started neck-coding the bombers ~6 weeks ago). Poured into a pint glass"
Picked up a bomber at DeCicco`s.
Huge thanks to portia99 for throwing this in as an extra!
Just had this fresh on tap at Capone's on 9/15/10.
A- golden orange thick white head tons of lacing 
A- Pours a nice golden yellow with generous 2 finger head
"A - Pours a crisp golden orange color with a moderate amount of carbonation, and very nice head retention. Easily a two fingered creamy head of foam. Looks good."
22oz bottle poured into pint glass. 
"Wow, this brew is incredible. Pours a clear orangeish amber with a one and a half finger off white head that takes a minute or two to dissipate to a small ring."
A: Pours an orange/light brown color with a 1/2 in layer of just-off-white head
This is one wonderful beer. 
"A - Nice medium orange, perfectly clear, big bubbly one finger white head, lots of visible carbonation."
"Clear golden color with a massive white head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is full of tropical fruit. The label claims apricot, peach, mango, and lemon. I definately pick out the mango but the other hop aromas meld together in a fruity punch. The flavor is 95% hops. More tropical fruit flavor with just a hint of dryness in the finish. Bitterness is moderate which surprised me a little thinking this was going to be a palate shredder after taking a whiff. The body is a little light but is pleasantly carbonated. I would place this beer in my personal top 10 of American IPAs. Just not enough malt to suit my Midwestern tastes."
Enjoyed among new friends at the epic beer tasting. 
Brought this one back from a recent trip to Myrtle Beach. Hoping it held up from its long journey all across the country.
"Have had this many times in bottles, on tap and cask. This review is from my first time having it. In a bottle when it was still a VERY limited release (2008). Pours with a large, rocky, yellow tinged head covering a hazy yellow body. Aroma of apricot, pine, mango and some caramel. Taste is pine bitterness with some exotic fruit. Syrupy with lively bubbles. This stuff is awesome!"
"Big thanks go out to Pabs311 for throwing this in as an extra during the Math Trade Round 2 BIF. Saved for a few days, chilled in the fridge, and poured into my snifter to be reviewed and enjoyed live."
"Poured a hazy orange with a thick 3 finger head. Nice lacing. Aroma is incredible, citrus and floral hops. Light to medium body. Light to medium carbonation. Good mix of grapefruit, mango and pine. Very drinkable. This just might be my favorite IPA yet."
On-tap.
"At only 7% ABV, this crisp hop bomb has the explosion of flavor usually reserved for an Imperial IPA. "
Poured into a snifter on 9/4/10

"Growlers of Sculpin for $14 at Green's in Greenville, SC? Yes please"
Poured from a bomber into an over-sized wine glass.
"22oz bomber. Pours a light orange color with a thin head and lacing throughout. Great aroma. Citrus hops, grapefruit and maybe lemon smells. Taste is more citrus with a bitter aftertaste. Hoppy as well. Pretty smooth. It is certainly a bit dangerous how drinkable this beer is. This is one of the few IPAs that can hold their own against Imperial IPAs. Damn good."
"Appearance: Very pretty orange/yellow color, kind of cloudy, with a off white head that settles into little islands of foam across the top of the beer"
Growler poured into a Duvel tulip. See-thru glowing golden orange body with impressive retention from the seemingly modest 1-finger head. Loads of crackly lacing. 
"Bought this bottle a while back, but have been waiting for something special to have it. Skyping with a good friend seemed the perfect occasion."
"Pours a dark golden colored body with minimal haziness. A huge frothy white head tops the beer, slowly fadding to leave big sticky splotches all over the glass."
"Having read the reviews for this beer I was very anxious to give it a try. Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to locate in the Sacramento area. In any event, I finally located some on a visit to the Bay Area."
Thanks to my homeboy Petey for grabbing this from Julio's yesterday.
"This was a nice IPA split from a bomber among a small group. It hides the ABV % nicely, though I'm not sure if you would have a bunch at once. "
"Poured into snifter. Amazing aroma of citrusy piney juiciness. One of those ipa's that you really don't even need to drink... Just smell. Borderline double ipa,has as much flavor as one. Biting bitterness with great citrus taste. I could go on and on. Just spectacular, bottom line."
"Pours a golden color slightly tilted toward the dark side, with a good fluzzy, fizzy white head. Decent retention, but eventually settles into a thin crown with whispy film floating along the top. Moderate lacing."
Poured into Duvel glass. No date on bottle.
A: Pours a yellow-gold. Very clear and beautiful beer.
I finally was able to have this beer on draft and it was worth the wait. I also tasted this beer from a bomber but I got a much better feel for it after a full glass. It pours a nice orange-golden color with about a one inch white head. It laces very nicely on the way down. The floral and citrus aroma is ony point with its flavor and really prepares you for its smooth but not over pouring taste. This IPA is very drinkable and I hope to have another glass before it runs out. I would definitely recommend trying this beer on tap.
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to copper color with a white head. In the aroma, grapefruity hops, big citrus. In the taste, dry grapefruity citrus hops and a nice malty backing. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry grapefruity rind-ish aftertaste. Super big hops, nice everyday drinker at 7%."
Appearance - Pours clear honey with a bone-white head that leaves behind splotchy lacing.
"A- Poured from the tap with a 1/2"" white head, which slowly receded to a haze layer and some nice sticky lacing. The body was completely transparent and straw-yellow in color. "
"22 oz bottle, no freshness date, $9.99."
On cask at Al's of Hampden on 8/5/10. This was the dry hopped version with Simcoe hops.
"A: Light Amber color, 1/4 inch of head. It definitely said ""Drink me"""

Poured from a Growler into a snifter 
Brand new batch (new label artwork - that's all I know).
On tap at Holy Smoke BBQ during the snooglefest 2010 tour. The best pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches I have ever had. I've had this in a bottle but fresh on tap gives it that little extra kick. Wow compliments my bbq perfectly. Smells of fresh hops citrus and bitter grapefruit. I love this smell. Heavenly. Tastes like everything you could want in a hop forward citrus bomb. Balanced. It was a challenge to make this beer last.
A - Really nice straw color with a nice fluffy 2 finger head that has huge lacing. Not only does the head not go away there is almost a solid layer of lacing down the sides of the pint glass.
"22oz bomb bottle poured into 22oz Harpoon IPA pint glass; poured cold and warmed during tasting. Pounced on this when I saw it yesterday at the awesome Sam's Quik Mart in Durham, NC."
"22 oz bomber courtesy of cmurren25, much thanks! Pours a slightly hazed, light orange color with a large and fluffy off-white head. Supreme retention and lacing, great looking brew."
"What a beer, my new favorite IPA. Pours a golden orange hue into a Portsmouth brewery tulip. Smell is exceptionally fruity with mango, apricot, tangerine and pineapple all intermingling with each other with pine undertones throughout. Taste is initially perfectly balanced with hops, bitterness fruitiness and sweetness, but just a smidge, and I mean a smidge too bitter on the finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth up front with a prickliness at the back. The only hit this one had for me was its very very slightly too bitter finish but it was much closer to a 5 than a 4.5. A well executed masterpiece Ballast Point."
Poured from the bottle into a stemmed tulip glass. I've had this brew several times now and have always enjoyed it. This will be my first review for it.
22 oz bomber.
Presentation: Bomber bottle poured into a pint glass in two parts. This is my first time trying this beer after hearing a lot about it. No freshness date (as far as I can tell) on the bottle.
Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a pint glass.
"Short review, because I only got a taste. Growler was filled less than an hour before tasting"
"Poured into a fluted tulip, it's quick to generate a fluffy head of sticky foam. Instant resiny aroma packed with floral/herbal hops and tropical fruit. Color is a light high-clarity orange with tiny rising bubbles. Lacing forms in sudsy sheets, and sticks around for awhile. Concentrated citrusy hop flavors of pink grapefruit and bitter orange pith. Residual leafiness and a juicy mango aftertaste. Pale malt is relegated to the back of the bus, but provides a slight tip to the balance scale. Moderate and creamy carbonation with the obligatory hop bite to it. Slightly dry in the end with a fairly long finish."
"22 ounce bottle, 20 ounce nonic."
Poured from a 650ml bottle in a DFH signature glass.
"Finally got my hands on one of these bottles from my work. Pours a beautiful, bright, slightly cloudy orange color with a nice white head. The citrus hop aromas hit my nose the second I opened the cap. Tons of sweetness and citrus with a nice piney edge as well. Smell is reminiscent of Pliny the Elder. Taste however differs (which is expected considering Pliny is a DIPA). The taste is still DAMN good though. Initially I get some nice hop bitterness, immediately followed followed by some fresh pine with grapefruit, mango, and orange flavors. It end with a very crisp bitterness. The mouthfeel is very dry and crisp. Very ""west-coastish""...a great example if you ask me. The drinkability is quite high. Could probably drink 3 bombers of this stuff."
Many thanks to Trevor (advent) for this!
Finally got my hands on this brew...last bottle at the store. Poured into Delirium snifter.
"Thanks to Eric and Doug for hooking me up with this as part of our trade. Crystal clear yellow-orange pour with big fluffy two-finger head and great lacing. Big, unique, fresh, hoppy, complex nose that's perfumy and floral with lots of citrus and fresh grass. The taste is just as big and just as complex. Full of tangerine, grapefruit, pine and resiny, fresh wet hops with a touch of peaches. The balance of this beer is absolutely perfect. Great bitter hop bite, but a nice sweet, malty backbone to make this probably the most drinkable beer I've ever had. The mouthfeel is great, crisp and dry and just a tad resiny and chewy at the same time. I've had this beer once before when I was in San Diego on business, and it blew me away then. I have to say that this has just become my favorite IPA of all time. I'm trying to savor every drop as I finish off this bomber. What an awesome beer!"
I had this particular cask offering at Al's of Hamdpen - it was dry hopped with Simcoe hops. Served at cask temp in a nonic
A firkin hand-pulled at Al's. This is dry-hopped with simcoe hops.
A: Pours an opaque deep yellow with about two fingers of foamy white head. The head quickly recedes to a thin ring.

"Got a case of this mailed to my home yesterday from Ballast Point and split it up among ramnuts, maltmaster420, skourtis, vkv822, and madhomebrewer. Thanks guys for making this happen! Time for the review. "
Pours a bright amber color with decent head and nice lacing. Beer even LOOKS tasty.
"What can I say about this beer that everyone else hasn't. I don't need to tell you what it smells or tastes like. There are plenty of reviews doing just that. What can I tell you about this beer? Drink it...drink lots of it! not just a fantastic IPA but just a great well balanced beer. If I could get it here in GA, it would be in my fridge all the time."
"I was happy to find this at a local store, I didn't think anywhere was stocking this right now....pleasant surprise."
Bomber into a snifter. 
"shared a bottle with a couple great BAs, thanks to rhodeska for the pour.Pours a medium orange-brown, with a thick head that ends up leaving a thin layer and an island of creamy head. has a steady stream of bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. smeels great, of sharp bitter citrus american hops. smells Really, really good. tastes a little sweet, but with a big citrus hop bitter profile. tastes really good, but, the citrus hops don't have the crisp, fresh taste that make these beers world class... perhaps the bottle isn't fresh, I'm not sure. a good beer to be sure, but not incredible. feels pretty decent, but nothing extraordinary. never harsh, could drink several."
Thanks to Genghis22 for this beer!
"Enjoyed on tap at TJ Finley's in Bay Shore, NY."
Picked up a bomber last week at Bevmo for $7.99.
100th Review!! Yay! had to do something great and this is great!
"Golden orange, lighter around the outside. Gentle pour elicits a small white head; however, the tenacity of the stick, structure, and lacing of the foam leads me to believe that good, hoppy things are in store. Slight haziness, but fairly clear with streaming bubbles. "
Poured off KnB Cellars new 32 tap system. 
"Amber-orange in color with a dense white head that leaves a consistent white cap and wet lacings on the glass. Big floral, hoppy aroma. Grapefruit and tropical mango aromas are fresh and clean. Velvety smooth feel with refreshing carbonation. Sweet malty flavor in the beginning that leads to big grapfruit, mango citrus flavors and a clean balanced finish. Good balance of malt and hops. An excellent IPA and very drinkable."
"Poured into my Zatec fluted glass. A medium golden color with about 2 and a half fingers of white head. Smell blasted up my nose of tropical fruit, peaches, and grapefruit. The smell that made me love IPA. Tastes very grapefruity and peachy. Very nice dry, medium strong bitter finish. Love this. Zaftig. Nice medium carbonation. I would drink a million of these."
22 oz. bottle
Special thanks to beerman207 for bringing this one back to me from his recent trip to PA. Review is from notes taken on 7/22/2010 and poured from the bottle to a tulip.

"okay this definitely gets an A+ in my book.. i've had this a few times but i'm finally going to review it.. All i have to say is... Are you kidding me??? i've had pliny, had so many good ipas and double ipas.... all i can is.... this is only a single ipa.... so i think this is the best ipa there is! truly phenomenal beer and of rating this as a single ipa, then it is way up there!!"
"On tap @ Prime 16, New Haven CT"

A - Pours a crystal clear straw with the frothiest head I've ever seen. Fantastic. Lots of lacing.
Damn thats a scary looking fish.
100th Review!
"Tropical flavors leap out of the glass, drawing you in. You draw..."
Appearence- Golden amber in color with a thick white head.
"Poured from a 650ml bottle into my Hoppin' Frog pint glass. No bottled on date, but it was refrigerated (thank God) in the store where I bought it..."
Pours a golden color with big fluffy white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. Carbonation is lively.
Got it at Bev4Less... best liquor store around :)
Got this beer at the good ol' common market.
Served in my trusty Devil's Backbone willibecher.
"Appearance: minimal inch head, hazy, bright gold in color, high carbonation"
This was recommended to me by Mike Brawley at Brawley's Beverage. Mike never steers me wrong!
"HUGE thanks to glazeman for this one. This has been one of my biggest wants since I've been getting into craft beer, and it surely did not disappoint. "
poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass:
"22oz bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice frothy off-white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is like a freshly cut grapefruit, loads of citrus with a nice sweet malt backbone. The taste is just about IPA prefection, loads of citrus hops with a nice amount of pine as well. A nice burnt caramel backbone provides the right amount of balance. The beer is on the light side of medium, very smooth and refreshing after a hot day. This is without question one of my favorite beers, I can't wait for it to come out in six-packs this fall."
Thanks to the Hulmeville for this one. Poured a very soft looking hazy auburn with an extremely white heading. Left lacing all around the glass and left a nice white cap all the way until the end.
"Pours a nice deep golden color with a thick and frothy white head that retains impressively and leaves beautiful lacing. The aroma is equally impressive, with big citrus fruitiness upfront, along with some pine resin and passion fruit, some biscuit, caramel, esters, and alcohol...not especially complex but impeccably fresh smelling. The flavor is also nice, but a bit of a letdown from the appearance/aroma...notes of citrus and piney hops initially, a little mint, biscuit, herbs, caramel, orange marmalade, alcohol and a slight hint of funk. The mouthfeel is light and sprightly, and drinkability is excellent. Overall a really nice IPA, with a fresh hop character that is pleasant and clean at the same time, there isn't a massively bitter finish like with some lesser IPAs."
Appearance- A nice yellow-orange color with a nice white head. The head soon dissolves into to a thin lacing.
Bomber acquired through a worldly and generous tasting buddy.

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle, no date"
On tap at Capone's... 
I picked this up at work yesterday as soon as I figured out that we had it in.
"Poured from a bottle into a Duvel oversized tulip glass. Golden appearance with about a half inch of head. Citrus hops smell that carries over into the taste. Not the biggest hop bomb I've ever had, but very drinkable. Wonderful beer completely deserving of its ranking as a top IPA."
"Poured into a tulip pint: Deep gold body, transparent but hazy with moderate nucleation. Three fingers of glistening, off-white, lumpy, bubblebath head. Leaves big rings of lacing."
"A: Decent head with some minor lacing, medium straw in color, extremely transparent - 4.00, S: Quite pungent and loads of pink grapefruit and pine, lemon zest and tropical fruits on the nose, mildly brash countered with a slight floral aroma, a wonderful aromatic American IPA - 4.50, T: Defined hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue, slightly grassy, grapefruit pith and pine, malt is present but hides comfortably behind all the hops, clean alcohol flavors - 4.50, M: Medium body, faintly dry - 4.00, D: This is one extremely drinkable IPA, extremely enjoyable and one I'd gladly drink again - 4.50"
This beer immediately developed a much larger head than I'm used to from an IPA. Be careful pouring this one. Tightly packed bubbles underneath a cloud-like cover that has some serious staying power. The beer itself remains active underneath it with ample carbonation in the amber glow of the beer. Sticky and splotchy lace lines the sides of the glass. 
"A:Orange copper color, almost no head"
"On draft at The Chip Shop, Brooklyn, NYC. "
22oz bottle into Duvel tulip.
A - Appearance is extremely exceptional. It's pitch perfect clarity has me thinking that it may not be naturally carbonated. Pours a thick rocky white head that dissipates slowly. Beautiful apricot color. Lacing is decent.
Pours an amber orange color with life and a thin foam head. Has an aroma of grapefruit and pine with hints of apricot. Has a creamy bitter taste with the bitterness becoming more pronounced through the finish. You get a very subtle hit of sweet up front and then lots of malt on the finish. Very tasty. But I feel it is a tad overrated.
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Perfect Pint glass. Instantly, a huge, 2-3 finger head formed...did someone put a slice of angel food cake in my glass? The foam receded slowly, leaving tons of itself behind. The body is yellowish gold with some tangerine lowlights."
A - Body is an interesting amber on top and yellow on the bottom. Heavy carbonation. 3 fingers of very rocky white head. Great rims of lacing. 
Served in a 22 oz. bottle.

Received in a trade from StormKing47 a few days ago.. let's see how this beauty tastes..
"Thrown in as a very generous ""extra"" by ""thebouch01."" Thanks Kevin!"
"Pours a hazy mango orange with pocketed white foams that fades to a clinging ring at the edge of the glass that leaves sheets of lace. Nose is pineapple and skunk with a hint of other tropical fruit. Huge fresh papaya juice malts are crept up on by a hint of nettle but pineapple and lemon sorbet hops assertively take over. Hint of mint to finish.Tight tingly clove oil linger. Round, creamy, medium-full."
"22 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada imperial pint. 7% ABV, Bottled and shipped from the brewery a few weeks ago. Niiiice and fresh."
"A - Mostly clear golden in color with a small white head, but it has decent retention and fairly good lacing down the glass."
Had the very last bit available at Beachwood BBQ on Friday...couldn't have been happier.
"Pours a clear pale amber colour, trails of bubbles up the glass leading to a very pleasant head, creamy-coloured with good retention and nice bubbly texture on top. Lace is pretty nice and clingy. Looks good."
Served on cask in a somewhat tulip shaped glass at the Stone Brewery (12 oz pour).
"22 oz bottle poured into pint glass. No freshness date visible, but I was told it was a brand new shipment. "
22oz bottle poured into my New Belgium globe on 5/27/10
Pours a bubbly and rich gold with a trace amount of foam and moderate carbonation. Looks malty and smooth.
A- An ever so slightly hazed orange liquid with a creamy white head that has excellent retention for the style. There are some streams of carbonation making their way to the surface.
"A: Pours a clear, pale orange, capped by a frothy two finger eggshell colored head. Retention is good and leaves lacing down the glass."
Kickin' off IPA-athon part deux with busternuggz.
Poured into my pint glass the beer is clear golden yellow. Two fingers of off white head fade slowly to leave sticky lace everywhere.
This beer came to me thanks to sodonne1. Big thanks man!... The beer was served chilled in an imperial pint glass.
"Poured into my Duvel tulip, Sculpin is a lovely light orange color. A good sized (~ 2 finger) creamy white head forms and leaves behind plenty of lace (though a little more would have garnered a 5). Sculpin smells incredible, a mega blast of peaches and juicy grapefruits. The first sips then are a little bit of a disappointment, as there's a little bit of an unwelcome bitter undertone to the citrusy flavors, that when combined with the clean hop bitterness is just too much.This issue fades as the beer warms though, so a bump up to a 4 is warranted. The medium carbonation is very fine, to the beer's credit, and the body is, for a beer with no appreciable malt presence, surprisingly full. Sculpin was a bit of a mini roller coaster ride for me, thrilled with the appearance and nose and initially underwhelmed with the taste, only to have the beer recover beautifully. As one would hope, there's no heat at all from this 7% ABV beer, a fantastic example of a hop forward IPA"
A: poured a light orange with yellow hues and a thin head that left pretty good sticky lacing.
A: Poured an orangeish-lemon with a good clarity and an impressive 4 finger plus rigid foamy head that was wallboard in coloring. The head towers in the middle breaching the glass rim with a sturdy structure that remains so for a good time only then yielding and leaving fat sticky trails for a lacing down the glass. Soft crackles and pops can be heard from the carbonation breaking the surface and head providing for both a good audio as well visual appeal. 
"Cute little fish on the label, and the world's number 1 IPA in the bottle. Let's see how this goes down."
22oz bottle sent generously by G311 in a trade - thanks for adding this want!
"I've had this beer multiple times in bottle, on cask and draft and am finally getting around to reviewing it."
"Pours a surprisingly light, but very bright golden colour, with a huge and robust three fingers of frothy cream-coloured foam. Lacing makes some extremely intricate patterns down the glass. The bright colour actually wins me over as I'm looking at it, and the lacing is so gorgeous I might have to take some erotic photography of it."
"I have had this beer more than a few times but never written a review. This one is based on a 22 0z. bottle. Poured a light golden amber with an ample two-finger head which dissapted into a white covering fairly quickly. Lacing was on the lighter side but lasted. Nose is a wonderful collection of orange and mango, some pine and floral hops. Taste starts with a some sweetness and citrus and then quickly folds into a pleasantly dry and mildly bitterness. There is some alcohol warming at the end as well. Feel is medium to light and oily. This is a very refreshing beer you must try - IF it's fresh. Highly recommended and near the top of my favs."
"A- goldeny straw appearance, cloudy, not to long of ahead retention, "
Poured from bomber into SA perfect pint.
"again, thanks to BigBRob for this one"
"After hunting for many months, this one finally became available in West Springfield, MA. So, of course, I had to snatch one up. Given that it's in the top 100 beers right now, a $10 price tag seemed like a great deal."
Bottle: Poured a hazy orangey color ale with a large frothy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus hops with deep caramel malt backbone is quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by loads of citrus hops with some floral undertones though no grapefruit notes and a deep and solid caramel malt backbone with balanced sweetness level. Body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done with great balance between malt and hops.
Poured from a 22 oz bomber and shared with friends.
Picked this up at Perry's Liquors and shared with newtonty. 
A - beautiful golden pour with a finger head. A quarter inch remains throughout with light lacing.
"Tasted from bomber bottle. Pours a clear, pale gold with a medium white head that dissipates quickly. Nose is hoppy with some malt and some tropical fruits. This is somewhat malty on the front of the palate with a stone fruit sweetness on the mid-palate. The finish is bitter hops. Overall, this is a very solid single IPA."
"After much waiting, I'm finally getting to try the legendary Sculpin!"

Ive been waiting for this beer for a long time. I made a trip to Pittsburgh and brought back two bottles. This is a review from our second bottle.
thanks again pastradul
"Poured into my SA glass, a goldish/orange color with about one finger of head, with good lacing. The aroma given off was of tropical fruits, but to my taste, it was grapefruit that stood out the most. Crisp and clean, very easy to drink, well balanced. I like this beer. I've bought two bombers, will be going back for more...."

"I got this in a recent BIF from boralyl, thank you so very much. I have been wanting to try this for a while. Poured into my NN glass at 41 degrees. "

Reviewed on 4/26/10
"Had my first Sculpin in 2009 and the rest is history. Picked this up at The Best Damn Beer Shop in San Diego while on vacation. Had a limit of three per person. Awesome representation of a sweet looking fish on the label. Bomber pour into a pint glass and I am met with a yellow gold hazy brew with a nice big white foamy head. The aroma is amazing. Peaches, pears, grapefruit and lemon zest aroma. Taste is kick ass. Not as much grapefruit as I thought which was nice. Hoppy, bitter on the initial sip and tangy bite on the swallow followed by the drying of the buds until the next sip. At 7% this is extremely dangerous as multiple bombers can be easily achieved in one session. One of my favorite IPA's on the market."
"Poured a pale yellow. Not too impressed by the color but the head was nicy and fluffy, almost couldlike. Minimal lacing."
Had this on cask at the Firkin Festival 2010. Not sure if it's exactly the same beer as it says it's 8.7% abv.
Sipping on this one as I type... form a bomber (obtained from foppa78 at DLD - thanks bro!) into my Dogfish Head signature glass.
Poured a fresh bomber into a tall glass and instantly a nice foamy head began to form and retained well as I wrote this review.
22 oz. bottle tried 9 Apr 2010.
"I was surprised to see this beer on the BA top 100, as I've found Ballast Point's other offerings to be good but unexceptional. I finally located a bomber of Sculpin at Fat Head's in Pittsburgh last weekend and cracked it open last night."
"appearance - pours a golden orange with some opaque qualities, decent head and lacing"
"Pours a golden orange, nice pine and citrus on the nose. Taste is more of the same with some hop and alcohol bite balanced by some orange-y citrus flavors. Mouthfeel was prickly with nice carbonation.This was a nice IPA, but I'm not sure why it is ranked so high here. Good balance I'd guess, but Ive had a handful of single IPAs better than this, including Ballast Point Big Eye, not sure why this one gets all the love."
"Extremely happy to find this on the shelf at Whole Foods Bowery. Like many, I've coveted this for a while."
"Stopped by the brewery while visiting parents in SD and picked this one up, let's see if it's worth the hype."
Appearance: Pours clear light orange and full of carbonation. Capped with a nice big white fluffy head.
"Light amber color with a beautiful white one finger head with nice retention. The smell is out of this world. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple, and mango. This smells very much like the Abrasive Ale I had this afternoon."
"Nice! One of my favorites from this brewery. Poured a rich three finger head that slowly receded to one finger head with bumpy foam. Nice aroma, very floral, piney and hoppy. Nice orangish hue but clear. Goes down smooth but since I purchased in a bomber, probably not a session beer. Will definitely try this agin. Nice label, too. Thank you, Whole Foods."

Pours a goldenrod hued yellowish amber color with a small frothy head that leaves a bunch of sticky lacing.
"a- bomber poured into a pint, nearly two fingers of creamy, fluffy head with great retention that fades slowly to a covering of lace, bright honey coloring, crystal clear."
"Poured a nice deep yellow with orange highlights, good carbonation running from start to finish. The head was creamy white with sticky lacing."
"22oz bottle into a wine glass. If i could penalize this beer for not having a bottled on date, I would. For what it's worth, I got this bottle at a respectable store (Manchester Wine and Liquors)."
"Been wanting to try this for a long time, and finally, here we go, popping the top...and you can smell the hops immediately once the cap is off."
A honey gold amber with a touch of chill haze and a cream colored cap. Retention is great with a touch of carbonation visible. 
"Finally got a chance to try Sculpin, I did not think I would get a chance to try this in Rhode Island. Pours a nice golden amber colour with a huge white head. The beer leaves a decent lace on the glass."
It was with great anticipation that I opened this bottle of Sculpin IPA.
"Pours a beautiful bright gold color, with a huge white head that quickly disappears. Incredibly intense fresh hoppy nose here, with peaches, apricots, pine, citrus and bubblegum. Tasting this one is a huge letdown after that amazing nose. Mostly hops (pine, fresh mown grass, lemons), with no real malt to balance it out. Not all that bitter, and really not all that complex. A solid, but far from spectacular, IPA."
Pours brilliantly clear golden-amber with vigorous carbonation and a thick creamy white head that leaves sheets of sticky lacing.
"From the bomber Sculpin pours a rich orange hue, somewhat hazy. Really nice fluffy head, with good lace and decent retention."
"This is a great IPA and a hop heads dream. The beer pours a nice amber color with a good head, some lace, some retention. The nose is very piney, some orange citrus hop aromas, some sweeter malts lurking in there too."

A: Pours like liquid gold. 1.5 fingers of bone white head.
A: Pours a golden yellow with a nice creamy head.
Pours clear gold with an ample head that dissipates into a ring of light foam. 
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with very minute hints of amber. Very generous fluffy white head with a healthy amount of lacing. Looks great, though when I had this on tap I'd say it was a bit more clear and yellow.. befitting a west coast IPA."
"Appearance: pours a orange color with a 1"" head that breaks to a thick surface foam. Some spotty lace develops."
On tap @ the Old Grove Ballast Point location on 3/18/10. Served in a pint glass.

"Sculpin pours a hazy, dark straw color with a big, creamy off white head on top. The foam has great retention and leaves behind lots of netted lace on the glass. Inside the beer is a flurry of small bubbles slowly rising up to the surface."
"Split a bomber with a fellow BA. Received from another fellow BA. Thanks, buddy! Reviewed from notes on 3/20/10."
"Look: Bright golden/amber color, clear, thick white head with very good retention & uber good lacing!"
Appearance: Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Beer is golden/yellow in color. There is also a slight haze to it when held to the light. There is a great 1-2 finger head that is very frothy and pillowy. Great retention and nice carbonation.
"Pours golden/blonde. Definitely on the light side for an IPA, but with good reason (read the bottle). "
"Yellow-gold pour with a loose white head. Very catty with lots of ammonia like presence, some floral pine, honey and a faintly minty, very bitter finish. Medium-thinnish body with moderate carbonation. This just wasn't very impressive. The body and mouthfeel were really lacking. Big intense flavor for a standard IPA though."
"Poured into a snifter with a darker almost marigold orange, white haze and strong carbonation bubbles float to the top."
"12oz pour, on tap @ Fat Heads Pittsburgh, served in a mini snifter"
22oz bottle poured into a pint. the guy at the store guaranteed this to be less than a month old.
A - Light golden orange color. Quarter inch of of thick head that dissipates quickly.
Got this from a friend at a local beer store...
Officially my favorite single IPA.
Poured from a bomber into my tulip glass.
"Went out beerhunting tonight (no KBS, sadly!) but I did find some Sculpin. In Massachusetts! And the beermongers assured me it was fresh. Well, okay then! Rushed home, fridged one up and poured into a Stone IPA tulip."
L: Pours a nice golden yellow orange color with a medium bodied tall white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down.
i want to give this beer all 5's but i actually feel there possibly could be a better IPA out there somewhere... maybe. i really do think this is the best IPA i have ever had.
22oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint. No bottled date. Major thanks to mb2696 for the bottle! 
From notes:
"Pours a little golden hue. no fizz but definitely visual signs of carbonation, no head. Very nice aroma. lots of citrus and pine . It gives off a nice medium bitter aroma. This beer is light bodied. I feel like a lot of breweries will have a huge hop bomb backed by some malt, but not this one (those beers are also usually 9% and up, this is under 8%, this note is probably referring to the fact that I drink more DIPAs than IPAs). The taste is pretty good. This seems similar with it intentions as beers like Hop Juice: all about the hops, not the malt. The flavor leans more towards the citrus notes than anything, leaving a slight grapefruit taste in your mouth. The pine notes are there to balance it out, but not too much. This beer is has a bunch of flavor is not in your face. There's no direct attack from the hops, but they don't go unnoticed. Start to finish your getting a bouqet of flavors. I think as the beer warms up a tad some sweet flavors some out. Notes of grapefruit are really starting to show. I think for me to really enjoy that I'd like more malt, but it's a minor complaint."
"Served poured out of a bomber into a pint glass, lots of initial carbonation in the bottle but poured very smoothly, medium amount of head, dissipates pretty quickly but stays around due to constant release of carbonation. "
"Pour - big, bright orange and yellow with a glow that makes you think of that first morning sunrise of a long vacation. This is all topped off with a big fluffy white head."
"Bocktown had this on tap, it lasted from Wednesday nights tasting to mid day Thursday. I'm glad I stopped in for some lunch time beers on Thursday. Appears a pale copper hue with a bubbling bright white head, forms intricate fine lacing down the sides of my glass as it dwindles. Aromatics have a full blown hop garden going on with bountiful citrusy graperfruit and tropical fruit tones, raw floral and herbal qualities as well, with some mild sweetness making it's way from the pale malts. Flavor was brazenly bitter full on assault of bitter orange peel pith, floral herbal hops, and again tropical fruit juiciness. Pale malts gave enough bread and biscuit components just to balance out the huge hop profile. Killer experience I can't wait to try more from these guys, mouthfeel was oily resinous medium bodied ale. Soft mellow carbonation made this one lubricatingly smooth experience, drinkable as all hell. I'm 100% sold and I'm glad I found this brew that I have been trying to track down for over 5 yrs now, a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh beer scene."
Got this bottle in a trade with Sideswipe... Poured it into my New Belgium Globe glass.
Had as part of a tasting at the Ballast Point Brewing Company. Served on tap in a tasting glass.
"Intro: Considered rare where I live (Massachusetts),the Sculpin has quite a reputation..."
Had this one in a pint glass from a 22 oz. bomber immediately following a Pliny the Elder. Let's see how it stacks up. 
"A - Pours a great golden color. Moderate white head, with average retention and little lacing."
"Pours a bubbly golden body with an enormous off white thick bubbly head. This beer leaves a lot of lacing as it subsides, very nice."
650 mL bottle at refrigerator temperature poured into a snifter.
Pours a creamy golden/orange with slight white head. Some nice lacing and carbonation evident.
Got lucky to try this little dandy at a Ballast Point Pairing at my local Whole Foods last night. From notes on 2/28/2010.
22 ounce bomber acquired via trade from JesseTheHut. Thanks Jesse! This is the start of my west coast IPA tour!
"Bottle pours clear amber orange color with off white head. Aroma is pine, grass, pinapple, and lemon. There are just wonderful citrus flavors not typically present in other beers in this style and this one has them all in one. Medium mouthfeel. Flavors follow the nose and finish dry. Really nice beer and one I'd drink regularly if I could."
Ballast Point: Sculpin IPA (No date) (Tasted 02/28/10)
"Pours a clear straw color with a decent white head. Head sticks around, too."
"Firkin of Sculpin in a pint glass a few times. Thanks goes out to Ballast Point for deciding to send this dry hopped version (amarillo & 2 other hop varieties) to Philly at the Sidecar Bar, I love this town."
"Golden amber, thick one inch of off white head; cloying lace."
"Nice bright gold with big white head, lots of retention."
What a hard beer to find... Saw it on the best of BA and needed to seek it out. Found it on tap in the Hulmeville Inn in PA.
This is an excellent IPA. I finally got my hands on some. I can't believe how hard this is for me to get when I live an hour from the brewery.
Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass.
Thanks to 7ways for the trade on this one. I've been eager to try it. 
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome! Wow, what a hop nose on this one. It's light with mostly a pale malt grist. It's incredibly bitter with a ton of citrus hops. The taste is great as well. It has a tremendous hop flavor thats bitter up front and resinates in the finish. It's light and easy drinking with a solid pale malt base. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a wonderful beer. It so incredibly smooth and drinkable. The hop character is outstanding."
"Always great to come in possession of a fresh, highly-regarded IPA. There's never any hand-wringing over when to drink them, because the answer is always ""as soon as you can!"""
Poured ontap into a 12 oz glass. Appears a hazed orange in color with a small white head and some lacing too.
Big thanks to Tiklmelmo for sending me a fresh bottle
"Poured a clearish light mahogany with a thin bubbly head. Nose is nice floral and piny hops. Mouthful is a bit on the thin side. This is a nice an easy drinker for the hop fan, and also for the non hop fan. The hop flavor is prevalent but not overpowering. There is a hint of sweetness up front, then it is full on hops with a nice and long lingering bitter finish.Very well balanced and extremely drinkable. Very solid IPA from BP...definitely on my top 10"
22 oz. bomber poured into a tulip.
Fresh filled growler served in a standard pint glass.
"This beer poured slightly hazy golden amber into my imperial pint glass. Very nice fluffy head with fine lacing and marathon head retention. Wow, the aroma of this beer is insane. Citrus, pineapple and other tropical fruits. I am also getting some peach and other crazy fruity smells. I am detecting sweetness as well, but it really could just be from the amazing fruity hop bouquet. They need to make air fresheners that smell like this. The taste is like a hop punch to the tongue. I have heard beers described as tongue bruisers, and this one is a prime example. Hops, hops, hops. Pineapple, peach, citrus, pine... it is pretty amazing how intense the hop flavor is. Adding to this is a pretty high amount of bitterness. The bready malt is there, but really does not add much to the beer. It is basically just playing the role of a wingman to the hop goodness. My critical side keeps telling me that it is way unbalanced, but my hop loving side could care less. The more I drink this the more I like it. I would say this beer is fairly light bodied for the style, and the mouthfeel is not necessarily the best. A little bit too sticky dry from all the hops. Quite drinkable, but I find this beer is better to savor and enjoy the great aroma."
Acquired in a trade (thanks Jusdrinkit).
"I've finally gotten my paws on some Sculpin! This has to be good! Served this chilled, in a pint glass, from twenty-two ounce bottle. "
"Appearance: Pours a pale, light, almost clear golden color with near two inches of crisp, snow white head. Quite a bit of medium carbonation flowing to the top of the bubble. The head is pretty persistent, and what disappears leaves nice, foamy lacing. The head and lacing are excellent, and while the color at first seems a little strange, its clear and beautiful when held to the light."
Bottle to pint glass.
22oz bottle poured into a DFH snifter
Poured this very light amber with a clingy white 2 finger head that stuck around for a very long time. Had a slight haze to it and a slow steady carbonation. Delicate lacing left on the glass the whole way down.
Serving type- 22 ounce bomber poured into a mug.
Poured from the bomber into a clean pint glass
Finally able to track this one down. I found this at Nikki's in Providence RI. I think I may have grabbed the last two as there were none left had 1 already. Drinking and reviewing this one now.
A big white head recedes ever so slowly atop a clear golden brew. Thick sheets of lace remain. I could gather the lace with a spoon it is so thick. Nice.
"Picked this one up from a recommendation of a friend, turns out its a great brew and rated as the highest American IPA on the site, nice score!"
"Random generosity of Kaiser81 landed this guy on my doorstep a couple of days ago. Thanks for the excellent brew, Ryan. Poured this into my new New Belgium globe. Poured a tawny straw colored with a great off-white frothy cap on the top. Nice white lacing is left behind as I slowly put this one away. The head retention is pretty impressive being that I drank this one over the course of an hour."
i just found this bomber sitting by itself after my last beer haul - must have been lost or stashed behind other beers for a while - 
A nice hazy golden brew that has a thick white head. Slowly disappears leaving behind some white lacing right down the side of the glass as you drink. 
On-tap at Father's Office Santa Monica. I looked for this one for awhile in LA a year ago with no luck. It was nice to finally see it after being out of the country for a year in a mostly lackluster beer country.
"Poured this into a pint glass, where it exhibits a large white head atop a yellow-ish body, slightly orange in tinge. The head dissipates slowly and leaves some nice creamy lacing spiraling down the side. "
"A 22 oz bottle (with the lovably unattractive fish on the label) poured to a pint glass. Surprised I've never tracked this one down before...even more surprising is the San Diego---&gt;Long Island---&gt;Portland route this took to get here (a nice extra from SpeedwayJim). If you're scoring the 'carbon footprint' at home, think of Sasquatch..."
"Was excitied to see this when I picked it up @ Whole Foods, for $9.99. Pours a bright glowing orange/light amber color with a frosty/foamy white head that leaves a swiss cheese lacing. The smell is great, citrus notes stand out of grapefruit, but probably more on the tangerine side, piney, spicey herbs also come through, very nice. The taste is also very citrus-y with a complex hoppy bitterness taste, some caramel sweetness in the finish, with a lingering hop finish. Not a heavy IPA, easy drinking, well rounded, what I look for a great IPA, not too malty, just enough malt to keep the hops balanced, love the citrus in this one. Hardly can detect the alcohol. Wish this was available year round in a 6-pack!!"
I traded for one last year and was lucky to be able to find two bottles local this year thanks to the Craft Beer Outlet in Philly. 
"Had this one on tap at The Library in Pittsburgh, yes Pittsburgh!!"
Big thanks to portia99 for sending this one as part of the Bowl Bash this year. 22 oz. bomber poured into my Cigar City tulip.
"Everyone says how ugly this poor fishy is but I kinda like him (or her, I didn't check) in a lovable loser kind of way. "
"A- just like an ipa should look like. straw color, bright yellow. 1/2inch head. can tell it is all hops and no emphasis on malt. "
"Picked up a big bottle of this from the good folks at Abe's Cold Beer in Bethlehem, Pa. There was a lot of hype around this brew and I'd had the good fortune of trying Ballast's Big Eye IPA, so I was pretty excited to try this brew."
"Awesome Awesome beer! Worth all of the $10.50 I paid for the bomber. Crisp golden color. Foamy white head. If you're looking for a Grapefruity citrus IPA this is your beer. Tough to come across but if you see it, defiantly pick it up. Well hopped but not overly hopped. Has piney notes to it but defiantly a citrusy IPA. "
"Ah, the elusive Sculpin. This fish has eluded my grasp many a time, but I've got him this time! Although I had this on-tap last week, this review will be for the bottle. "
"Amazing IPA. Golden Orange body with an antique white head. Great lacing leaving thick rocky sheets around the edges of the pint. Smell is heavenly: so much citrus and even moderate pine notes. Big juicy ripe pink grapefruit, pineapple slices, vanilla cake batter and tangerine wedges. Very similar in the taste with a sharp pineapple cake flavor, fresh citrus salad (sweet lemon, mandarin oranges and pink grapefruit). Pine in the background, amazing mouthfeel, unlike any mouthfeel I've every experienced before in this style. Bubbles are ample but not sharp, silky and sudsy coating everything. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable, I will be a happy camper when I move to the San Diego area this year."
"Poured out of a 22 oz bottle into a half liter stein, and kept topping it off. Looks very yellow color and a clean white head. Looks like it could be a plisner- almost. "
Appearance-
Poured from bomber to oversized snifter. Thanks to womencantsail for hooking me up with this. Thanks andrew!
Reviewed on NYE at friends house. Shared among 2 people. 
"Bomber into a Duvel tulip, in a side-by-side tasting with Alesmith IPA."
Clear body with a medium gold color. Thick creamy white colored head was two inches and held a few minutes. Decent amount of slow rising carbonation bubbles. Sticky lace clumps.
"A - transparent straw, pilsener color, with almost two fingers of white head that reduces to half of a finger quickly, moderate amounts of active visible carbonation "
Got the word from aglose45 that Abe's has a few of these stashed behind the counter. Thanks for the heads-up Adam!
"Poured into a pint glass. The body on this IPA is a clear peach color with a big sticky white head that reduces quite a bit in the first minute, but then manages to maintain a thin layer across the top during the rest of the session. Some light lacing on the glass."
"First, if I could give extra appearance points for the bottle art, I would. Poured into a pint glass. Body is a clear golden with much bubbling, nice airy white head that foams and bubbles nicely. Kind of like sea foam, but without the sick residues. Some lacing. Smells nice and hoppy with a little hop-metallic tinge. Good bitter citrus smells, like sticking my nose in a handful of pellets. A little fruity, but I wouldn't associate the smell with a light IPA over a fresh-hop."
A- Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter... starts with a 1/4 inch off white head that disappears leaving some spotted lacing. Beer is a light amber color with next to no activity. Second pour produces a nicer frothy head that disappears leaving a healthier ring of lacing sticking to the glass
"This beer pours a clear golden copper with a huge white frothy head that leaves great lacing and lasts forever. The smell is a very good and strong aroma of citrus hops,grapefruit,and tangerine. The taste has a bitter first taste,then citrus blast of grapefruit and tangerine. The taste is very crisp with bread yeast and alcohol and a smooth finish. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. A great beer."
Thanks to masterhombrewer for making the trade 
Served in an imperial pint glass. Pours crystal clear and pale orange with an inch high head of frothy off-white foam that settles out slowly leaving a mogul field of bumped up mounds.
Served in a nonic pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 
Thanks to Kaiser81 for trading this one to me. 
I must have done something right. Went from no Sculpin to having two different BAs give/trade me a bottle this week. Icing on the cake? My local store just got some in. Wow! Thanks to jlindros and augustgarage!
Served from a 22oz. bottle acquired in a trade from jlindros (Thanks man!) into my Brooklyn snifter at the appropriate temperature.
"I've had numerous, ultra fresh bottles from HopHead84, this one is from dyan. Thanks to all. I've yet to review Sculpin, perhaps I've had too much fun drinking it-a great sign to say the least."
"I've had this in my cellar for a month, waiting for that special occasion but I couldn't wait any longer. The beer poured this beautiful orange - brown. It looks like Arizona Green Tea. There's lots of carbonation up front. I thought I poured it carefully but it still managed to bubble up around the rim. "
"A: Bright, clear, and golden with very thin white head."
Poured from 22 oz bomber. 
Bomber with no freshness date served cold into appropriate glassware.
Acquired this one from speakorspasm so a big THANK YOU! goes out to him!
"Pours goldish colored, and fairly light. Not cloudy at all. Tall white thick frothy head that remains for a loooong time. Very sticky patch lacing. Smells very different from most IPA's than I'm used to. Kind of fruity, grapefruit, lemon(citrus)."
"22.5oz poured into a 12oz wine glass (I know, need to go shopping). Found 2 bottles at K&L in Redwood City and 4 at Whole Foods!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Wow, beautiful orangish-goldish color with a frothy white head. Serious amounts of lacing going on here."
Pours a clear golden with a ragged white head that fades quickly. Plenty of lacing on the glass.
Poured from 22oz bottle into pint glass
22 oz. bomber
"A - Pours a golden honey color. Completely clear, with a nice frothy white head."
Poured from bomber into an over-sized snifter.
Poured from bottle to tulip. Thanks to billab914 for a chance to get my hands on this.
pours clear golden with a white 1 finger head that leaves notches down the glass
Poured from the bomber into a Sam Adams Sensory glass.
My second bomber of this pours a crystalline golden orange with a billowing three finger head of creamy white foam on top. Plenty of active carbonation. Stellar! Aromas start out with huge citric and tropical fruit hops and tons of resins. Green and a touch floral as well. Mild crystal and light toasted caramel malt backbone. Hop profile is just great here and draws you in with every inhalation.
I've had this at Ballast Point in Linda Vista many times - but only in sample sizes. Much diff in a bottle - I wish they brewed this year round and had it on tap...
A trade with JoeyBeerBelly landed me this brew. Thanks Joe!
got a bottle as an extra from a clown who sent me some black tuesday. killed it tonight.
"Extra from SwillinBrew. Thanks, Gil - this was a great bonus! Split with a buddy pre-gaming for a trip downtown to see a hockey game."
I picked up a 22oz bomber from Capones in Norristown PA. Poured into a Weyerbacher tulip glass.
"I had this on tap today at Capone's. It is a pale, golden honey yellow with a sticky white head. The smell is rich with copious amounts of citrus and tropical fruits. The flavor follows, sweet citrus, mango, guava. Sculpin has enough malt for balance, leaving a crisp finish. It taste like a DIPA with the drinkability of an IPA. The beer lives up to the hype."
"A - Poured out a clear, golden yellow color with a small, white, bubbly head of foam. It left soapy trails of lace."
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a hazed apricot orange color with a fluffy 2 finger head that leaves some clingy lace on the glass. This is a rather fruitful IPA to me with notes of mango, pineapple, and orange along with a citris rind hop bitterness. Starts of subltey sweet with the tropical fruit notes which is then accompanied by a building citris rind bitterness that lingers all well after your drink is finished. Some warming alcohol notes on the back end. Overall, just a wonderful IPA and in my top 5. Medium mouthfeel."
"Looks like a standard IPA, nice color, nothing spectacular. Smells very much like a standard citrusy grapefruity IPA. Tastes the same. Maybe a little more bitter than I expected. Well balanced nonetheless, a little maltier than I expected too, but I guess that's needed to balance the heavy alcohol and bitterness."
10 draft pour into a tulip ($6). From notes.
"thanks city beer store, sf"
"Appearance: Clear, golden, with a moderate head."
I was lucky enough to buy a case of this beer a month or so back and I am finally getting around to review it!
"Pale orange apperance with loads of carbination streaming up. Thin frothy head, nice lacing left on glass."
Poured from 22oz bottle. Split with my friend who just got done tattooing me that night. Many many many thanks go out to mjl21 for this one. You rock Mike!
"Poured into a pint glass, Sculpin IPA is hazy gold, with a full finger of rocky head. "
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery (a HUGE thanks to Euel for sharing this). Beer doesn't get much fresher than that.
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into my Harpoon IPA shaped pint glass. Got this one in a shipment from South Bay Drugs.
"22 oz. bomber into DT tulip. Exposing my beer ignorance at Wally's in L.A., I only picked this up after serious raving by the buyer and a customer. Thanks, guys. As foolish as I may be, eventually I end up with the good stuff and this is no exception. "
22oz bomber acquired in a trade with FooFaa. Thanks Dan for this killer extra.
"I've had this beer many times in the bottle and on draft, but this is the first time I've sat and enjoyed it while at the computer. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a standard pint glass. Serving temperature was around 45 degrees."
Thanks to Mauerhan for this!!!
New review updated 8/10/10 and score from this one.
"A - A vibrant, golden yellow body with carbonation bubbles running to the top...a tight, creamy, white head stands about three fingers and by the end of the glass only settles to about one finger...great lacing"
22oz bottle poured into tulip
"As an ardent fan of IPAs in general, I was excited to sample this highly sought after West Coast creation from Ballast Point... Probably one of the best-balanced india pale ale's I've recently tried... up there with two-hearted ale and just about any other I can think of in recent memory... Pungent, citrus aroma reeking of tangerines and oranges up front, with a subtle bitterness that was tamed as time went on..."
"Paid $9.99 for a bomber from Perry's Liquor in Livermore, CA. Poured into a large snifter to review."
"Appearance: poured a hazy amber color with a thick, off-white head."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into an Arrogant Bastard 0.5 L glass. There is no freshness date. Beer is hazy and amber in color. Carbonation is moderate to high with biggish bubbles. Head is thick, large bubbles, leaves some lacing as it falls away."
"Poured a nice yellowish orange color with good carbonation and a small white head. Nose is pine, grapefruit and other citrus, perhaps ornage, apricot. Taste is huge citrus and pine , sweet and nice bittering. Mouthfeel slight alcohol more citrus, pine and hops. Drinkability is phenom!"
"Pours a hazy, orange-gold with a 3-finger, frothy head. Lots of lacing."
22oz bomber poured into a tall pint glass. Courtesty of MASPuros who has become my favorite BA...thanks Mike!
I drank this from the 22oz bottle into a rochefort chalice.
"Poured this bad boy into my Bruery tulip. Clear gold color with a decent half inch head, decent retention. A little bit of lacing, but not much."
"A - golden amber, with a 1/2 inch head that receded pretty quickly, leaving streaks of lace that lingered for quite some time"
California dreamin' Sculpin IPA. 2009 bottle.
Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a New Belgium globe glass.
"Thanks again to ipa247 for this west coast IPA, poured into a perfect pint."
22oz. bottle poured into our Portsmouth tulip glasses:
Bomber pours a hazy golden amber body with a tall offwhite head. Excellent retention and lavish sticky lacing.
Poured from tap at Capones in Norristown. I've been wanting to try this on draft for some time now.
This beer was a referral from Hooliganlife. I would never had went after it without his recommendation. 
A-Light hazy golden..light egg white creamy head...nice lacing..
Poured into a pint glass from a 22 oz bomber bought from the Ballast Point Brewery yesterday
"A- Pours a golden hue with a nice, 2 finger, frothy off white head that is extremely chunky."
"This poured a nearly clear light gold with a little bit of white head. It smelled like juicy peaches and pineapples and fresh lemon, with some sweet mango and light honey. It tasted like grapefruit and pineapple with some peach and mango, and a bit of tea leaves and honey. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a clean bitter aftertaste. Overall this is definitely one of the best IPAs out there. Delicious tropical hops flavors that few other beers can match. There was an herbal hops character in the aftertaste that was reminiscent of Ruination, which I wasn't a huge fan of, and I thought it could have used a hint more body. So there is honestly some room for improvement. But this was still a fantastic beer that was very easy to drink but also a delight to sip. This lived up to the hype."
"Finally, I have drank the highly praised Sculpin IPA!"
Poured from a 22-oz. bottle.
"22oz bottle - no freshness date, but they may as well, given that it sells out so quickly, and is much better when still in diapers."
App: Light to medium amber with a great white head from a cask... the head stays for awhile displaying excellent carbonation. This looked perfect to me.
"A: Gold, a little hazy, nice lacing which remains all along the glass."
10.24.09 Lost Review
Shared this one with capra12. Poured from a bomber into a tulip. 
Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Mikkeller tulip. Extra special thanks to tai4j12x for this kick-ass extra in our recent trade!
"A - Pours a clear copper with an inch of off-white head, fair amount of retention if poured somewhat vigorously, small amount of lacing"
"P: 22 oz bomber w cool spikey fish on label, had this one at cellar temp"
"On cask at Ballast Point night at Blue Palms in Hollywood. Served in a Ballast Point pint glass (which I got to take home :-), and subsequently in a 20oz nonic (one serving was simply not enough)."
Just in today at Capone's. I guess that's as fresh as it gets in PA. Poured into a standard pint glass. 
On tap at the Daily Pint.
"Poured from a bottle, into a pint glass at the Stone Brewery. "
"A-Great color, awesome amber golden color that is clear slight haziness."
Many thanks to hopsleeroy for sharing this bomber while watching the UT-OU game (hook 'em horns!!).
Thank you Matt Olesh for acquiring a case of Sculpin. A bomber of this fantastic brew made my week.
"There were two choices at the Daily Pint in Santa Monica... for now. Sculpin IPA and Sculpin IPA cask (very rare). The Cask is the one I will write about know. It has a very hazy orange glow in the glass. The head is like a high school cheerleader (very bubbly), and boy does it last a long time, also served a little warmer. I tried to get the owner to tell me what kind of hops they use but he said he could tell me but he would have to kill me. All I know is there are 5 different kind of hops in this beverage and taste/smell is very citrusy. Long live the cask!"
FINALLY! After months of trying to find this where I live I finally found it while going to my good friends bachelor party in Fountain Valley. I was extremely happy when I ran across this down there.
"Smell: If they don't infuse this w/pineapple or peach juice they really have a special secret. More obvious citrus than I've had before. Sweet malt and little tartness in the nose, but mostly citrusy sweetness."
"A.) it's Gold, kind of hazy, and pours a great white head"
A very different beer in the bottle than when on tap!
"22 ounce bomber, w/o freshness info. $9.99 at DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY."
"Orangey-straw in color, slight haze, sticky white head."
"A: Golden, a little hazy, nice lacing which remains all along the glass."
"Poured from this 22 ounce bottle into my Stone Levitation glass. Beautiful golden, brassy color with a slight chill haze. Stark white head hangs around for quite a long time. As it does falls it leaves awesome lacing."
"I've head so much about this gem I've been salivating already since I finally found the bottle yesterday. Must be pretty fresh too. I'll have to pour this baby into my oversized DFH snifter, as with any awesome IPA. "
APPEARANCE: 
"Thanks a MILLION to two BA's, each sending me a bottle of this! Thanks to beandip (Adam) and BevmoIan (Ian) for their contributions to my beer addiction."
Had on tap at the Blind Pig today.
"Poured a cllear amber with a thin white head. Strong citrus hop aroma, not much else going on in this one for aroma. Up front citrus hop flavor with peach, mango, and oranges in the background. Finishes bitter, kind of on the thin side even for this style. Very easy to drink, love the mango in this one."
Pours golden orange with a 2 finger beige head.
Grabbed 2 bottles from Ledger's in Berkeley. Hot off this weeks delivery!
"Another perfect example of a beer living up to the hype. The hop aroma and flavor are ridiculously fresh. Just enough malt is present to balance things out quite nicely. The mouth is probably the best part. Smooth crisp and refreshing. Excellent beer, highly recommended."

poured from a 22 ounce bomber in to a pint glass.
Ballast Point- Sculpin
"Nice golden color, one finger head, very carbonated."
Finally... I get to the fabled Sculpin IPA... I've heard so much hype about this brew that I'm afraid it won't live up to it...
"I have been wanting to try this for a while and it just happened to be on tap at Armsby Abbey today. I have tried a number of other Ballast Point brews, but have always heard great things about the Sculpin and it did not dissapoint."
Got this from my guy Fred in Cali at beverages4lessinc 
"A phenomenal IPA. Sculpin pours a relatively pale shade of golden amber with a creamy white head. The aroma is very hoppy with notes of peach, grapefruit and wildflowers. The smell is quite intense for the size of the beer. The flavor is dry and hoppy. I particularly like a good dry IPA. The hops are different, but it reminds me of Pliny the Elder in that respect. I was inspired to try them side by side and they're quite similar beers, both magnificent. Sculpin is clean and strong. The mouthfeel is quite dry with lots of pleasant bitterness and no alcohol. Sculpin is one of the finest beers that I've ever tasted and probably my favorite IPA thus far. It's great stuff and it's a shame that it's not more readily available."
Was lucky enough to get a bottle of this in California from Freddie over at Beverages 4 Less.
"Poured into a plain ol' pint glass from a lovely Ballast Point Bomber provided by that most excellent of friends, eliottjw."
"Pours a clear orange yellow, nice creamy head leaving amazing lacing. Smells primarily of orange and citrus, tangerine, grapefruit, touch of yeast breadiness. Tastes of peach and orange hoppiness with a moderately sweet malt backbone. A nice peach and mango like bitterness gives way to a light dry finish with some more peach. Nice clean carbonation complements an excellent body. "
"22oz bottle. Served in my Bells tulip. One of several bottles I obtained from multiple traders. Thanks guys! I've had this a few times before. One fresh bottle, one not so fresh. This one is fresh and begging to be consumed."
A- Hazy golden straw color... full fluffy white head. Good retention and lacing.
"Good thing cbutova is on the look out 24/7. Pours a hazy gold that clears over time. Nice thick head that has some fight in it, lacing is moderate, carbonation fueled the head immediately and is not visible in the body. Smell is phenomenal: lemon, mango, orange, apricot. This has got to be the best smelling beer I've come across. The taste follows the nose quite strictly. The hop explosion it produces is amazing. I could use a little bit more of the fruit from the nose but then again that might cause an imbalance so this is a tough call. It's an extremely well balanced beer, a little on the hoppier side of the IPA style. The mouthfeel is nice and full (for an IPA), with a dry finish that leaves you salivating and thirsty for more. This beer has exceeded my expectations of what an IPA can be. Ballast Point wins with this one."
"The elusive Sculpin has been caught. I would have saved this for #100 but it's an IPA and I wanted to drink it as fresh as possible. Grabbed this one at Table and Vine in W. Springfield today, they had 3 cases, I snagged the last two on the shelf (maybe more in the back). Pours a very golden color with a hint of orange, has a very bubbly two finger head that retains very well for an IPA, the carbonation on the pour is extreme, pour it carefully. Thick lacing is left on my pint glass as I drink this bad boy. Smell here is probably the best beer smell I have ever put my hands on. So much great things going on, a huge fruity aspect to the beer (mangos, peach, apricot, lemon), the sweeter fruits perfectly balanced by floral and piney hops, greatness. Taste is a bit different than the smell, less of a fruit characteristic but still enough to be very noticeable, a huge aggressive hop blast comes onto the tongue but backs off as you swallow to allow a very good sweet fruity taste to come through with an eventual delicious hop after taste. A very complex smelling and tasting beer. Mouthfeel is very well carbonated, medium bodied and a bit oily, maybe a TINY bit of alcohol warming but no alcohol taste = a very well balanced mouthfeel, I hate to give all 5s but its starting to look that way. Drinkability is great, the taste is enough for me to drink this all day long, its not filling, the price ($10) was worth it any day of the week, no bad flavors to ruin this one over time, and I would buy this one again over and over and over."
I love poking my head into city beer on the way home from the week. You find great surprises on tap.
Reviewed at the Gotham Cask Festival at Rattle N Hum enjoyed with a new friend Sam aka Cootercaster on 9/11/09. Thanks to Sam for letting me know about a highly rated IPA and also Patrick from RNH for hosting.
Poured from a bomber into a mug. Words cannot express how excited I was to finally have an opportunity to try this beer.
"taste- crisp, clean, bitter, lemon peel, citrus oil"
Big ups to BdubleEdubleRUN for sending me this!
"Pours an ever so slightly hazy golden with a massive, frothy white head that retains remarkably well. Sticky icky too."
"So I'd heard all the hype about this beer and was wondering if I would ever be able to try such a highly acclaimed IPA. Well I was in my local bottle shop the other day and what did I spy out of the corner of my eye, the ever elusive Sculpin. Anyway on to the review. "
"Clarity. Glowing, a golden glow, the sea at dusk, the fishies all pottering about their daily lives, and one in particular, a Sculpin, of course, a couple-finger-tall white head that floats about and leaves a sticky lacing along the walls as it drifts. Can one smell under-water? There has to be that possibility..."
On cask at Rattle N' Hum (NYC)
"Fresh bottle shared by bring - thanks for ""bring""ing this! Upon opening the bottle, it's obvious that this beer is legit. Awesome, intense floral hops waft from the bottle. This absolutely dominated Alpine Pure Hoppiness in a side-by-side, and that's saying something."
On tap at Stone.
a friend of mine picked this up for me at the Port Brewery and said they just got in it. i don't see a bottling date but couldn't be too bad. 
Poured from a 22oz bottle at Devil's Den
Pours an orangish cedar color with a silky white head. Excellent lacing and retention.
"Was at the Blind Pig in Champaign last weekend and saw they had this on their bottle list and had to give it a try. This may not be as fresh as it could be, I don't know the day/month this beer was originally released, but it has been kept in a cooler for at least that long I think so it shouldn't have deteriorated too much hopefully."
Received in a trade with Buckeyenation. Thanks Brad!
"Alright, this one lives up to the hype. Finally snagged a bottle of one of these beers. Hard to believe it took this long, considering I live in the same city its brewed. On to the review:"
Apperance: clear golden with a thin head that dissapates quickly. ... Hey is this a bud in disguise? 
Great extra thrown in by masterchiefMD. Thanks again Chris!
Great extra sent from DRINKNDRIVE and included in the Gentleman's BIF by SrandyCarter. Big ups to both of yas.
22oz bottle poured into a Portsmouth goblet.
"A - Very light orange to darker yellow color, but transparent."
Sampled from a 22oz bottle in a DFH shaped pint glass. Purchased at the brewery.
Bottle (2009)
"at first thought it was gonna be light because of color . cant really taste the hops, really smooth but fruity at the same tikme. no matter what i say to me it was a good IPA cant wait to have again on Friday when the liquor store gets it back in stock. so good. must buy . just basically a really good ipa different doesn't seem to follow that same trend of just hops, really balanced out."
"Bottle received in a trade with funkydelic, thank you so much for getting this gem to me!"
Poured from the big bottle.
"A: Clear yellow-gold. Pours with a big, foamy head that reduces to about 1/4"" or so. "
"A: Poured from a fresh bomber into a 16oz pint glass. Slightly hazy, pale orange color. Very little head. Looked very viscous for an IPA. No sediment. "
On cask at Verdugo bar last night. The dude at Verdugo said all the places that got casks yesterday had a different type of hops. Ours had amarillo hops which he said made it a little dryer.
What a crazy beer!!
Thank Christ I can drink again after a week on meds. Let's break this cold streak with a cold one... and what a cold one! One of my white whales finally come ashore.
"Enjoying this thanks to JoeySchlitz. Pours clear gold with a white tan head. Smells and tastes of grapefruit and more grapefruit. But the flavor is fairly well balanced with malts. So not a hop bomb. Body is medium thickness, as is carbonation. Fairly drinkable for an IPA. Good, but not memorable. Not sure how this is so high in the BA stratosphere."
"poured a clear gold with orange highlights, last bit cloudy but no big sediment. white diminishing head. aroma is tropical fruit, citrus, and honeyed floral notes. nice sweet bready malts are cleared out by the big smooth hop bitterness. smells and tastes like a dipa but a bit lighter in body. frothy, prickly mouthfeel with a smooth bitter drying finish. very nice overall."
Pours a slightly hazy light golden with a 2-finger creamy white head that has very good lasting power. Tons of tiny carb rising. Nice lacing.
"A- Bright golden color with a big white head that left patchy, sticky lace. "
Very good looking clear golden body with a soft fluffy head. The head lingers forever and leaves a load of lacing down the entire glass.
22 oz. bomber (no freshness) poured into sweetwater pint glass...
A- Pours a pretty clear golden yellow color with a huge white head. Head has great retention and leaves some nice lacing.
"At long last, nepotism rears its ugly head on The CANQuest (TM)! For those not in the know, I write for Ale Street News (and others) while my cousin, Colby Chandler, is the specialty brewer at Ballast Point B.C. "
On tap at Toronado.

"I was so pumped to see bottles of this at my local store. Whenever a beer has this high of a rating, I wonder if it really is that good. This lives up to the hype incredibly. "
"Poured from a 22oz bottle, with no apparent dating on the bottle, into a Burgundy Schott Zwiesel glass."
"Pours a very pale straw color - nice and clear. Kind of a light orange. With a vigorous pour, you get quite a head, a less vigorous pour will yield a nice dense little pad of carbonation. It leaves just a bit of lacing, and has decent retention. A little lighter than I'd expect, but very nice looking. Upfront, the nose is very leafy and grassy. Just like fresh hops. But then you start to smell some grapefruit, some peach and mango, a little lemon, then just pure powdery, polleny resins. A brilliant hop profile. If you can smell any malt, it's light and powdery. The taste follows suit pretty well. Comes up with some sticky, resinous hops at first. You move from grassy and floral, kind of herbal, actually very herbal for a moment, then to a bit of citrus, then really leafy and resinous in the finish. Nice hop profile. The malt is a little sticky, but overall, this is a very dry beer. There isn't much breadiness, but there is a slight crackery taste. The malt profile is a bit tough to judge when this one is fresh, but I kind of like it like that. Very nice body. About medium, with the perfect level of dryness. Not quite puckering, but definitely no sweetness to block out the hops. Pretty good. A bit thinner than a really great IPA though, and it's a little sticky feeling. It actually was kind of slow starting, I just wanted to relax and savor every little sip, and I really did. I loved it. Overall, one of the best IPAs out there. It almost borders on DIPA, but its still a bit different. A great beer, and if you can find it, but it immediately."
"Bottle Pours a clear golden with a frothy white head. The head lasts well and produces spotty lacing. Has a good hoppy aroma of spruce, citrus, peaches, and some bread. Has a good carbonation. The flavor is real good. Mild bitterness, with good hoppy kick. Real smooth mouthfeel. Blended very well. Has a medium body. The texture is a touch oily. Has a good solid finish with an excellent aftertaste. I waited for this one for a while. Too bad the store only sold one to a customer"
"Shared a bomber at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA for $14. Totally worth it. This is easily one of the best IPA's I've had in sometime. Reminds me in terms of quality of the pint of Town Hall Masala Mama I had last week. The hops jump out of the glass once the beer is poured - I love when that happens. The hops are a mix of spicy citrus that are juicy, but dry and drinkable. There are also tasty notes of apricot, white grape, and orange peel.The aftertaste just doesn't go away. I had to go out of my way to find an even bigger beer to follow this up, otherwise this beer would have still been hanging on my palate."
"Pours a rather pale orange color, with a huge two finger, white head. Just some stray carbonation in the brew; excellent clarity. Heads sticks around a while, and leaves a little lacing. Great work on the aroma hop additions, as this may be one of the most delicious smelling IPAs. There must be some combination of Cascade, Amarillo, Simcoe and the like, as it is an excellent citrus hop aroma (my personal favorite). There is a mix of sweet mango and tart grapefruit, I just love it. Taste is not as pronounced as the aroma, but is certainly an excellent IPA. A slightly more earthy hop flavor is in the taste, but still retains the citrus characteristics I love. Near perfectly balanced, as the hop flavor is there, prominent, without being overwhelming. Light and crisp in your mouth, and just a little hop slickness left in your mouth after a sip. The balanced hop profile makes this quite an easy sipper, no rough edges at all. I love some ""hop bombs,"" and this IPA certainly has hops, but you have to appreciate the balance coming from a beer with this amount of hop aroma and flavor."
"A: Yellow, almost straw-colored (great to see an IPA of this magnitude that's actually a pale ale). A rather thin white head settles in a moderate pace. "
"Had this out of a bomber today that I'd been saving for a special occasion, and turns out HBO's Sunday Lineup was that occasion. Poured into a pint glass and away we go."
"From a 22oz bomber, poured a couple of shades darker than straw yellow, but not quite orange, with a thin white head that dissipated rather quickly."
"Appearance 3.5: The color is close to that of a lager, very yellow and light pale. Though, it is more opaque, giving it a translucent cream soda quality."
Fresh 22 oz. bottle.
Scooped a bomber at the Charleston Beer Exchange - I love this stuff!
Had this on cask at the bishops collar in philadelphia. First time at that bar and i will definetly be back.
"22 oz. Bright golden pour, some white head and bubbles. Light caramel malt and a ton of citrus, green apple, pine in the strong aroma. Taste is a mirror of the aroma. Tons of hop bittering mid through the finish. Quite lively mouthfeel, refreshingly so. Brings me way back to when I had my first Sierra Nevada Pale and I thought wow. This did that, only after much more experience on the pallet. This is a must for any IPA fan."
A- Crystal clear gold with a touch of orange. A decent head forms from a semi-aggressive pour and forms tons of sticky lace as it dissipates. Beautiful beer.
"Tried this on cask, but wanted to grab a bottle or get it on tap before I gave a review. So finally dug up a bottle, and interested to see how it compares."
"Great to get my hands on some of this stuff (thanks Roger at Bestway).Poured into a small tulip glass a clear light golden with a clingy 1/2 finger white head.Holy smokes the aromas are just awesome!A mix of big citrus and tangerine just jump out at ya,a hint of caramel/biscuit is there but its a little faint but hey who cares the hop profile is frickin great.Fresh hop flavors abound with tangerine sticking out the most,its lemony with a bit of mango and overripe pineapple,the sweet biscuit malt base does not hide itself as it holds on thru the duration of the glass.Iam not sure if I have had a beer of the style with such fruity hop complexity,wow this is worthy of the rating."
poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass.
Finally this beer was available in SF. Been wanting to try this for a while. 
22 oz bottle purchased at the Charleston Beer Exchange. Special thanks to those guys for letting me buy this relatively scarce brew since I can not get it in GA. Poured into a Sierra Nevada Hop Tulip.
"Grapefruit on the nose and on the tongue. Sharp citrus that I absolutely love. Pours nice looks pretty all that good shit, holds a nice head to the end, but taste is where this one is at. Really a well done IPA at a sensible ABV level without sacrificing taste. Surprisingly deep in flavor. Dangerously drinkable too, i would prefer it in a sixer, but i take this one any way I can get it. case worthy to the extreme."
"Draught at the brewery. Gold with a white head that laces the glass well. The aroma is one of the most intense hop blasts that i have ever stuck my nose into. Pine, peach, apricot, and mango are just HUGE in the nose. The flavor has the same gigantic juicey hops but a relatively low bitterness that perfectly balances the bone dry malt. Speaking of malt flavor, you'd struggle to pick out much if anything through the hop juice. Medium, almost light bodied with medium carbonation. This is really a hop paradise on tap. I had a bottle a couple days after sampling it on tap, and while excellent, it didn't quite live up to sucking this nectar right out of the brewery's tap. Very similar to Pliny in that freshness is the world."
22oz bomber. no date. tasted in early may 2009.
"The beer pours out a beautiful, clear golden color with a large bright white head. The smell of this beer is filled with citrus scents (lemon and grapefruit) and pine notes."
"Mmmm, stinky...."
"Pours a lightly hazed golden-orange under a thick, creamy head. Smells deliciously stinky. Dank, sugary citrus pulp, juicy ripe mangoes, peaches, and melons. Juicy, zesty, and resinous. First sip isn't seriously bitter, but definitely very flavorful. Sweet grapefruit and orange pulp...all out hops are the name of the game here, but it's not overwhelming. Bright pine needles creep in when held in the mouth for a few seconds. Juicy, oily, floral and obviously very well made. Medium bodied and chewy with just enough dryness to make me drink it down way too quick. Damn you drinkability! I'd love to have some more of this...like on tap...right next to the couch. But, it's $9 a bottle and I can still get a 6-pack of Two Hearted for about the same price, so I'll make do. Highly delicious though..."
"Thank you to everyone who didn't show up to Teresa's today, so that there was still some of this left when I got there at 1:30PM. 3 more glasses poured after mine before the keg kicked."
"Found this amazing beer at Whole Foods in Irvine, California and I'm glad they had some reserves in the back. I'm drinking from a pint glass on a warm summer afternoon."
"BPBC Sculpin IPA pours up with a persitant off-whitish head that perches above the slightly hazy, orangish-amber colored body. The hop dominated aroma is surprisingly piney with some notable citrus. The overall character is fruity (blood orange, mandarin, pummelo) with plenty of evergreen qualities. There's a moderate graininess with some biscuity, cracker nuances. The flavor starts off with some caramel sweetness that's underscored by a firm, marked bitterness. The lightly warming finish is fruity & spicy. This medium-full bodied American IPA is firm & resinous, but surprisingly easy to quaff. Hats off to the crew at Ballast Point. Here's to the reclusive Sculpin monster!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear golden almost yellow orange color with a small white head. Leaves some lacing down the sides. I haven't seen to many IPAs with this color but it looks pretty good. Aroma is pretty strong and good, smells piney to me more than anything and a hint of citrus. Smells great. Taste is bitter at first and finishes pretty smooth. Pretty piney which is great, I've been looking for a piney IPA for a while and this one seems to be doing the trick. Decent mouthfeel, kind of light but yet medium bodied. Drinkability is high, not to high of an ABV and with a good taste it's real easy to drink. A great IPA, I'm more into DIPAs and IIPAs and not to many regular IPAs really get my attention to much but this one does, I think it's the pineyness."
drank on 5.13.09 at home - heading to Napa Valley tomorrow to visit Russian River - woo hoo!
"22 oz. bomber bottle with a gray wrap around label. In the middle of this label is a colorful drawing of a poisonous Sculpin lying at the bottom of the ocean floor. It looks like he's either waiting for his next prey to swim on by or he's sleeping. At the top of the picture is ""Ballast Point"" in bold blood red letters and at the bottom of the picture is ""Limited Release"" in bold black letters. Off to the far left of the label is where you'll find all the mandatory US info. To the far right of the label is a lengthy paragraph that talks about Ballast Point's humble beginnings and a description of the beer. Just to the right off of that is Ballast Point's phone number. So if this expensive beer sucks, I'll call them up to complain. The one thing missing from the label or bottle is a bottled date or some kind of vintage year."
"Thanks to Deuane for hauling some bottles up to me to spread around with the NEPA BA's. Poured from a 22ounce bomber bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Sculpin appears a hazed golden yellow color with about two fingers of quickly fading, fluffy bone white foam. The head leaves behind a thin sticky lace on the inside of my glass. Nose and flavor consist of both ruby red and white grapefruit juice, peel, and pith, bitter essential citrus oils, medium toasted bready grains, lemon, pungent hops akin to skunk weed, mild notes of resinous pine, a touch of tropical fruits such as pineapple and mango with some sweet malt coming in towards the end to shoelace it all together. Very pleasant, dry and bittersweet finish that leaves the tongue tingling a bit. Dis be some great shite!"
"Have had this one sitting in my cellar for about 2 weeks and decided to pair it up with a wasabi, soy, garlic tuna steak on Sat night."
22 oz bottle poured into a mexican tulip - fridge - 2009
What can be said of this brew that hasn't already been posted?
Thanks to Jeff and ScottyBorgata from TJ's in Paoli for hooking me up with a bottle of this.
Poured fresh at Ballast Point.
"Bottle thanks to WeeHeavySD. Pours a clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma of grassy and garlicky hops. Flavor of bitter grapefruit and garlicky hops with a touch of citrusy sweetness and fruity hops in the finish. Certainly hop dominated. The hop profile is not my favorite, but this is a damn good IPA and extremely drinkable too."
"I somehow missed the release of this beer in bottles while on vacation last month. After a pretty exhaustive search (plus a pint or 2 on tap), I managed to track down a bomber at the new Craft Beer Outlet in northeast Philly."
"At last, thanks to our boys at the Charleston Beer Exchange and friend Raverjames, a growler of this sweet, sweet nectar has landed in my fat little hands! I gathered two beer geek friends and we dug in..."
bright orange...1 inch fluffy white head with good retention....moderate lacing on the glass 
Bottle into red wine glass. Big thanks to Scott (calinalu) for this beauty. Served at about 45 degrees and up.
Thanks to Ffejherb for picking up a bottle of this for me.
Poured from a 22oz bottle into an imperial pint glass.
Big thanks to Matt for grabbing one of these for me.
"On tap at Capone's in Norristown, PA"
Thanks to emerge077 from grabbing this one.
Thanks to Alex for the trade.. nice to try a different IPA.
I poured this one from a 22oz brown bomber bottle into my Fuller's pint glass.

"I'd heard about this for awhile, and then last week my favorite beerstore employee handed me a bottle as I walked into Peabody's. Impressive."
Thanks to IBUnit63 for this one.
Got this bomber from super fast shipping trader JessetheHutt! Thanks dude!
Huge thanks to Weibull for hooking me up with the tasty beauty!!
Thanks to Weibull for sending a few bottles my way.
"Huge thanks go out to IBUnit63 for this long awaited brew! Pours a pale golden orange color with a huge three finger billowy head that had great retention and left some thick rings of lacing down the glass. My goodness, I could smell the hops from 5 feet away. Enough grapefruit and citrus aroma that this seems like the cure for the common cold. A nice piney aroma is also present and almost zero maltiness in the nose. Sometimes I just love these IPAs that are practically absent of caramel malts and let the hops shine, but it's not often. This is lovely, though. Very nice bitter, hoppy flavor, mostly consisting of grapefruit, orange and possibly some lemon zest, rounded out by a light piney flavor and some cracker like toasty malts giving a somewhat solid backbone. Body on this one is the only that it's lacking, being on the low side of medium, but it really is the only less than desirable quality. Incredibly tasty and very easy to drink. This really is a great IPA. Thanks again, Larry!"
Received in trade from a great BA (jtrockchalk)...thanks Joel!
Thanks Kadonny! 
"Pours a beautiful, nearly-clear golden. Nose is pine, melon, mango, bubble gum, light citrus, and vanilla. Flavor is resiny hops, light fruit, with a nice bitterness and a perfume aftertaste. The hops are really put on front stage here and make for a delightful beer and one of the best examples of the style (a slight nit: the taste was not quite as strong as the aroma predicted). With a crisp, wet feel it makes for a refreshing summer (or anytime) beer. Highly recommended."
I think I have a new favorite IPA
"Based on 2nd bottle (cheers Bitterbill!) I'm bumping up Appearance, Drinkabilty & MF"
"I was lucky enough to find this at the Econdido Bev Mo, tucked way in the back of BP section."
"A: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a golden brownish color and a slightly cloudy consistency. There was a big, foamy, long-lasting head and some good lacing."
"Glad to be able to try this highy hyped and hopped offering from the west coast, thanks to raoulduke37. While I haven't been wowed so far by other Ballast Point offerings, the Sculpin is totally solid across the board. Pours very light, crisp clear and golden, with a gleaming white head, excellent lacing. The nose is deep pungent grapefruit juice and lemon, piney leafy hops, and a bit reminiscent of another popular controlled substance... The flavors in this one all meld together in beautiful hoppy unison, but the main thing I'm getting here is still the grapefruit juice, and a nice bitter citrus rind, along with slick, resiny hops. The most grapefruity beer I can ever recall having. Somehow this extremely flavorful beer remains light and lively on the palate with a dry bitter finish, and very refreshing and drinkable. At one point I was thinking of this beer as a double IPA, and then the light airyness of this beer reminded me that it is just a standard IPA really pushing the out limits of the flavor envelope. Definitely a top-tier, world class IPA, wish it was more readily available."
A - Pours pale and clear. Color looks to be a medium gold. The head is just a shade away from white and sticks around for three to four minutes. It tops out at about two fingers and becomes rocky pretty quick. Lacing is spotty at best. The color is much lighter than expected but that just makes it look more refreshing overall.
"A--Pours a pale copper color, very bubbly with about two fingers of head using a standard pour in a pint glass. Pretty good lacing left behind."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle that my buddy got from South Bay Drugs into a pint glass. No dating info on bottle but was just released so know it's fresh. It was a slightly hazy golden color. Multiple carb streams and some lacing. It had a massive off-white head that very, very slowly settled to a constant foam cap."
"A clear, bright copper body with lots of active carbonation bubbles. A big, thick, soapy off-whtie head with fantastic retention; it leaves great lacing too. Good looking beer."
"I have had this beer in a bottle, but the growler was the real treat. This is a wonderful brew in the bottle, but on tap it is just about the best IPA out there. "
"A - Poured from a growler into a pint glass. Pours crystal clear gold with a tint of amber and a big, fluffy white head that slumps a bit and sticks around."
"Thanks to fatboyjim (for including this as an extra) and goodspeed94 (for trading a couple of these to me recently). Not sure who's this was, but here it goes."
bomber poured into la chouffe tulip..
"Well, hell...thanks to Dan from Marty's for informing me of this new arrival. This is one I've been jonesing for and it's finally touched down amongst the Massholes. For this hop bomb it's the Reidel Vinum Cabernet glass. Gizzit a tumble..."
Thanks to aerozeppl for cracking a couple of these bottles.
Had three pints on tap at the Khyber in Philly... first bar in Philly to put this bad boy on tap... Had the privilege of trading for a bottle recently (see my other review) and lets just say on tap it was equally as divine... mouthfeel was a tad improved as was the nose... however i already gave it a 5.... can i give it a 5.1 here???? 
Pours like a BA mag advertisement with a one cm head. Color is a little lighter than expected. Smell is mostly pine with a bit of citrusy hops. Taste also has a hint of something sweet which was not expected. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth & this is very drinkable. No hint of the ABV is noted. A great IPA worth seeking.
Poured into a Portsmouth snifter this beer yielded a pure white head that stuck around for the duration of the beer. Absolutely fantastic lacing.
Acquired via trade...thanks Dan! 22 ounce bottle poured into a snifter. No bottling info is given and comes in at 7%.
Special Thanks to Dan for @ Marty's for hooking me up with this awesome IPA. I've been wanting to try this for some time... It was worth the wait...
Bottle.
This coveted bomber was poured gloriously into an imperial pint glass.
Thanks to jac5084 for this one. Poured into two pint glasses.
Most delicious new IPA I've had in years.
"Oh geez, another San Diego IPA. 22 ounce bottle from Liquor Warehouse, on to th beer:"
Notes from the SD Toronado.
Poured this 22 oz. brown bottle into a Tripel Karmeliet glass. No date. Thanks to Joey at South Bay Drugs for this one. The body was beautiful and clear golden-orange. The crisp white head slowly faded to a light film. Tiny velvety bubbles slide down the glass leaving only minimal lace.
poured into a pint glass from a 22oz bomber.
"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber. This one left a nice two finger foamy head that stayed around for quite a while. The brew is light golden with a touch of orange. Absolutely LOVED the smell. I reminded me of a HopSlam (sigh). Lots of pineapple and citrus, with a definite backbone of malt. It smells very promising. Taste was a bit of a letdown - I was expecting HopSlam, and didn't get it. Extremely hoppy and spicy, no sweetness here. Lots of bitterness, citrus, lemon zest. I didn't enjoy the overkill of bitterness on the mouthfeel. Overall a great brew, but not one that's worth all the trouble to get. I would like to try it on tap, or cask."
"650mL bottle purchased from South Bay Drugs for $8.99 (not including shipping). The beer is crystal clear, color of straw, with a thick wet foam that laces in dry sheets on the glass. The beer smells incredible, citrus fruit and herbal hops with a strong malty scent underneath. The taste is not overly abrasive, more delicious with the hops lending less bitterness and more flavor. Tons of fruit flavor, not just citrus, excellent. I found this too easy to drink, the bottle was gone in no time. Way worthy of the hype."
"Cask at Hamiltons in SD. This from cask is stunning. The aroma is tops with any beer ever. Cask from the 1st batch might have been life changing. This recent batch doesn't have the corn flavor like I tasted in the previous 2. Smooth and a bit short and watery on the finish. Cask conditioning changed all that. Great texture, nice that it was served cold. Super aroma. Nice complexities and finish that stretched further than any other sculpin. But man that nose was stunning."
"Had this one on cask at Hamilton's Tavern on April 24, 2009. "
"Thanks to goodspeed94, whose box of hoppy goodness I'm going through at freeway speeds. Don't want to let these bad boys sit! Plus, I need some bitterness to wash the taste of the last ""beer"" I tried out of my mouth. Hops away!"
Always a sucker for a new IPA to try and Ballast Point usually puts out some tasty beers. Let's give this a try
On tap at Toronado SD
Bomber.
22 oz bomber. Thanks to torchednoodle for the trade! 
HUGE thanks to ShrLSU for including this in my Secret Bunny Package. 22 oz bottle poured into my snifter.
A great big fuck yeah goes out to the local boy fogdog for this one! Thanks Kevin been looking to try this one for awhile.
Thanks to dukedebourgogne for this one.
"I had this today (3-19-2009) at Ballast Point's Old Grove location. According the the description on the sign inside the tasting room, they added 2oz. each of Crystal, Centennial, and Amarillo hops directly to the Sculpin keg."
"I just got back from work from my lunch break excursion from Ballast Point (Scripps Ranch Location). They hooked up this special keg of Sculpin with 2oz each of Crystal, Centennial and Amarillo hops."
22 oz. bomber purchased from the brewery 6 months ago. Refrigerated entire time.
"22 oz. bomber courtesy of seanpachefddfa - thanks a bunch!! Split w/ dkachur, w/ my portion poured into a 22 oz. brandy snifter."
Thanks Sean for the trade
22 oz bottle
"A two finger light tan head quickly turns rocky as the active bubbles slowly fade. Dots of lace are left behind. Body is a beautiful pure rich amber in color. Nose is so big with luscious mandarin orange, fresh cut flowers, dandelions, and more citrus. Really gets the mouth watering. Hops are fresh, crisp and very juicy with first sip, really highlighting the citrus feel. Mouth watering all over the palate with a very subtle bitter character, not harsh at all. Carbonation is just right and carries a floral mineral feel on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel has a crisp lingering bitter thickness. A sesionable, drinkable IPA that is uniquely refreshing."
"A huge thanks to PretzelCity for sending this one my way. One of my favorite beers to date, this was just amazing."
decided to have this one on the first 70 degree day of the year. This was part of a birthday gift from my brother seanpachefddfa.
"Pale orange pour, slightly murky, nice head"
"A rare treat courtesy of Mauerhan (thanks Topher). 22oz bottle served in a standard pint. Poured a pale orange-gold with a hazy clarity. A quarter inch bright white cap embedded with tiny ringlets quickly dissipates into a soapy slick with a bubbly band around the edges of the glass. Some jagged slashes of lacing are revealed as the brew recedes. Nose is sweet grapefruit. Taste is bitter piney up front, followed by apricot and sweet grapefruit in the middle and a lingering bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied (but closer to light), with a consistent background effervescence without being overly prickly. Easy drinking and refreshing. Bitterness was intensified because it was initially served a little too cold; however, the true flavor and complexity is revealed as it warms. Great IPA (think I'm finally starting to figure out what this hops thing is all about)."
Appearence is a copper orange hue with a thin white halo around the rim. The lacing is think but noticeable.
"Appearance - Shiny orange to almost copper on color. Found the head to be a little flat and thin, but it still manages to leave a more than adequate coating of lace. The body is very light as I can see my fingers through the other side of the glass."
Appearance: Poured with 1 finger of off white foamy head that dissipated over 5 minutes to a thin rim around the top leaving some lacing. The beer is golden yellowish-orange in color and is clear. 
Thanks to mcallister for the bottle.
A- Large bubbly white head that dissipates quickly leaving a small foamy cap. The beer is a nice golden orange in color. 
Poured from bomber to pint glass. Thanks to Natashrai for the split!
Thanks to NOBama for this one!
Bottle shared by ajsdad.
"Pours a crystal clear light orange with a thin white head. The nose is an all out assault of juicy tangerine and bubble gum. The flavor doesn't live up to the expectations set my the aroma, but still its very good with some piny and citrus hops. Medium body and super easy to drink."
This one has been sitting in my fridge for far too long. Let's have a taste. Thanks Nick of ThreeWiseMen for hooking this up.
"Ah my boy Carlos, thanks buddy!!!!"
Scott (swnicholson) was extremely generous in hooking this midwestern BA up with a some quality west coast brews. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.
Thanks fo Bitterbill for this gem!
Hazy paleapricot appearance. Slim white head.
"I was never especially interested in seeking this beer out, but when it was offered to me in a trade, I wasn't gonna say no, thanks to srandycarter for hooking me up with this rare IPA. Pour in to a tulip glass reveals a clear golden coloration, and a white lacing of white head. Very potent hop profile in the nose, my mom equated it to my old smelly hockey bag. I definitely get the mango and peach smells alluded to on the blurb on the side of the bottle. Faint garlic and onion can be detected to from the hops. Taste is very pleasant, and not nearly as extreme as the smell as far as the hops are concerned. At the same time, the dominating flavor is hops, it is like hop juice with hints of fruit here and there. Mouthfeel is somewhere between light and medium, and surprisingly the malt can be felt despite all the hop dominance. Drinking this will be a delight for any hophead. Well executed beer we have here from Ballast Point. Very complex, and I am sure I am only scratching the surface of what is happening with this one. If only this was distributed here. Oh well, final note: I love the Sculpin fish on the label. Cheers"
22oz bottle from SouthBay Drugs at 52 degrees.
"Received in trade from jtrockchalk, thanks for the opportunity!"
Received today from dqderrick .... Immediately put into the freezer for a flash cooling ... this is one that I wanted to try as fresh as possible.... Thanks Derrick for the super trade!
"Thanks be to god to PretzelCity for this trade. A bomber poured into a pint, which yields a smallish off white head of foam that all but disappeared by the time I looked again, leaving behind only a hint of bubbles which pool around the glass. The lace itself slides easily back into this vibrant, golden & crystalline beauty. When I dream of a west coast IPA it looks similar to this visage."
Thanks to swnicholson and jamescrames as they have both generously hooked me up with bottles of this. 
"Got this one in a trade from HoppyIPA. Thanks, David."
"A- Light orange, very clear with a small amount of head. Soapy like foam left on top after the head died down. Very patchy lacing on the sides of my tulip."
Thanks to Jtrockchalk for giving me the chance to try this one.
"This, the latest rendition of Sculpin, pours a rather clear orange golden in color with a half inch of slightly off white airy head. Head settles to a surface cap in short order however, leaving lots of temporary lacing through the pint."
"Received a bomber through a trade with weibull, big thanks man. Hope you enjoy the ST choklat. "
"Pours a bright pale goldeh amber and orange tints. Large, fomay white head kicks off after a vigorous pour. Tons of spidery lace clings to the glass as the head settles down."
Got this recently in a trade with JessetheHutt. Thanks a lot Jesse! I still owe you one!
Appears a transparent gold with a small white cap that slowly fades into some soapy bubbles. Spotty bits of lacing are left around the glass.
"22 oz. bottle, 7% ABV. Crystal clear golden color, with a decent white head. Good head retention, and a great deal of sticky lace left on the sides of the glass. "
swnicholson is once again the man for tossing this in.
"Pours a surprisingly pale golden amber color with subtle orange hues and a deep foamy white collar with nice retention and a reasonable amount of Belgian lacing with each mouthful. The smell is amazing; aggressive and complex...from the bottle neck, peach-apricot (as suggested on the label) and from the glass a more prominent citrus and piny resin. Full flavored, a hophead's dream! Grapefruit and piny resin tastes explode and linger well into the aftertaste...that's what I'm talk'in about!! The mouth is hugely hoppy and tangy yet light in texture and carbonation. I'm seriously tempted to crack open another bomber...but that would be borderline gluttony [Wikipedia...(disambiguation) derived from the Latin gluttire, meaning to gulp down or swallow, gluttony is the over-indulgence and over-consumption of food, drink, or intoxicants to the point of waste.]. I am willing to compare this one to Pliny the Elder...many similarities, but this one has a noticeably lighter body. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
22 oz. bottle into a snifter; no freshness date needed for this limited release
appearance- poured an amber orange with 1/2 inch thick white head. great lacing around the glass
Appearance: Pours a nice golden-straw-orange-sun
Reviewed 12/28/2008 (bottle):
"First thing you notice is how clear this beer is. A copper color with some reddish hues when light interacton occurs. A small white head thin and whispy in body, little lace except for a blanket here and there."
Bomber poured into chilled pint glass. This is a fantastic IPA. 
"Pours with a frothy, two finger thick, pale, tan tinged, off-white colored head. The beer is a clear amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma certainly hits the spot for any hop lover with a melange of herbaceous, spicy, fruity, citrusy and yes even dank hop character. Malt, I don't know much about that, though I am sure there might be a hint in the aroma some where, right now I am focusing on the hop aromatics that the malt character is supporting. Vibrant lychee, ripe tangelo peal and bitter grapefruit oil round out the fruity hop aromatics, but in the deep draughts of the aroma it is the herbal hop components that reign. There are turpene rich hop notes, a slight grassy edge, perhaps a hint of chive, but what really jumps out is the essential ""hemp"" oil components; sticky, dank, resinous, slightly rosemary like, touches of pine tar and a spiciness that almost make my nose itch. Definitely a hop heads beer by the nose."
Poured from a bomber to a pint glass
"Pours a barely foggy amber with a thin creme head. Nose is pine resin and slight citric tones. Flavor is that biting acrid salty hops tone. Pine is definitely there. It's biting, but still smooth enough somehow. Feel is typical on liquid and carbonation is even. This is an easy to drink IPA, but it's best judged when you look at it as a San Diego IPA as opposed to an IPA in general. Still, I like it."
"A few cases of Sculpin made it into distribution, picked up a couple bombers for $7 each at BevMo."
Poured chilled into my Surlyfest stein.
"22 oz. bomber, love the label,"
9/22/09
"Thanks to d0b for giving me a chance to try one of these. Not sure of the age on this 22 oz bottle, but it's been in the fridge at both his place and mine."
"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours clear orange-gold with a spongey white head. Great floral hoppy aroma with lemon and oranges. Clean, bold hop taste throughout. Good amount of grapefruit with tangerine, pine without resiny stickiness, and maybe a little pepper. Bittersweet malt in the finish without being overbearing. It has the hop bite and taste of an Imperial, but the body of a regualr IPA. Excellent."
22oz bottle acquired in trade with WeeHeavySD (thanks!). 
"With great appreciation to Torchednoodle, for this tasty excellent IPA. Orange appearance with white head. Grapefruit aroma, very nice.Very smooth, very drinkable. Great resiny hop. One of the best IPAs I ever had, and the bottle picture is cute too."
"Pours a clear, light orange color with two fingers of foamy white head."
"Poured a dark golden color with a medium sized, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of more resiny pine (gotta love San Diego!), citrus fruits, caramel malts, and floral hops. Taste of toffee malts, citrus fruits, light malts, and a dry bitter finish."
"From bottle (June 21, 09)"
Thanks to HopHead84 for this bounty.
Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a Lost Abbey glass.
"This beer pours a light amber (not cloudy) with a 2 fingered head and lots of lacing. The smell is wonderful, fruity, nutty, hops, spices and you can even get some sense of the malts. The taste is wonderful as well, beautiful fruity flavors with some nut flavor and citrusy hops and a great malt base to it. Very well balanced and certainly one of the best IPA's I have ever taste, I had to take a double take to see if it was a DIPA. The mouthfeel suffers from a very dry aftertaste, but the carbonation level seems nice. I could see myself drinking a bunch of these in a night :)"
HUGE thanks to torchednoodle for this brew.
Had several of these on cask at Bella Vista at their grand re-opening yesterday. Definitely was the highlight. 
You can keep all your IR stouts. This beer has to get top marks. I've held off on reviewing it even though I've been drinking it steadily since its release a couple of weeks ago. Every time I put this stuff in my mouth it reminds me why I started getting into beer in the first place.
"Pours a very clear gold in color with only a ring of froth. Smell is very piney hops. Taste is very green, brutally bitter hops. This is very fresh and very green. Very bittering and tongue ripping. This is a aggressive and brutal onslaught on your palate. The bottle is incredible, I could only imagine how this is on draft. Wow."
"I only had this thanks to the sick generosity of OlieIPA, who literally stumbled on the release and brought me a bottle. Thanks kid!"
Received from Mauerhan in trade recently. Thanks for this tasty beer!
Pours a moderately hazy orange with a nice frothy two finger white head.
Thanks to brdc and stoutsnipas for sharing this beer.
"Thanks olibeer22 for this one, large capped bottle poured into a tulip."
A: Golden in appearance with a beautiful one to two finger head. Very frothy looking (if that makes any sense) accompanied by lacing that seems to show the history of every sip. Beautiful!!
i without any regret or any sort of second guessing give this beer a five out of five. 
"22 oz Bottle from Churchill's in San Marcos. Pours cloudy amber orange with a fluffy white head. Sweet aroma of hops and citrus. Flavor begins with sweet hops and ends with hints of lemon and orange. The citrus flavor and aroma really dominate, but it is very nice and very easy to drink quickly. Refreshing! A very very good double IPA!"
"Received in trade back in May, but unfortunately I can't remember who I traded with anymore."
"Bottle poured at the brewery during RBSG 08. Golden color, tightly packed white head, good lacing. Caramel malt aroma with accents of tropical citrus and stone fruit. Flavor is cakey malt, orange, grapefruit, and pineapple, with a solid bitterness. Long dry finish, extremely drinkable."
"A- clear and bubbly straw in color, excellent retent on a fluffy white head"
Drank from a 22 FL. OZ/1 PINT. 6 FLUID OUNCES./650ml bottle
Thanks goes out to Bitterbill for this brew.
"Poured from bottle into a tulip. Pours a beautiful clear orange with a huge pillowy white head. Big & delicious aromas of citrus. Tastes like a perfect west coast ipa. Lots of hops up front, citrusy and bitter, but not just a hop bomb. Very balanced. Very drinkable. Right up there with the best ipas I have ever had."
"Pours a brilliant clear light amber with orange highlights. Billowing head with clumps of bubbles and massive 3-D stick. Pungent array of hop aroma's. Pinapple, mango, a veritable citric salad. No real malts detected. Starts with pineapple and apricot marmalade flavors some minty hop flavors as well, gives way to some candied lemon and dried fruit sweetness in the middle. The malts at play are light and definatly take the low road. Finishes with a punch of resiny citrus flavors wich coat the tongue. Only a moderate amount of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is spot on, slick and crisp. The ethanol is nowhere to be found here. I could drink two more bombers after this one, I don't advise it but, I could. I guess it's a good thing I only have one. Fantastic stuff, I will definatly seek this one out again. "
Bottle shared by MiguelMandingo. Thanks!
"Got this particular bottle from mikesgroove, thanks mike for hookin' it up."
"Pure west coast hops in the nose. Authentic and just how an IPA should be. Very vibrant. Color is a very light gold, with ample foam. Flavor, however, is a bit of a letdown. Doesn't have a lot of malt depth. The hops arn't as vibrant as I'd like. Needs more bitterness. Still high quality, but just not as hoppy as I'd like."
Big thanks to biegaman for cracking this one at his annual saison tasting. Grub was also kind enough to open one about a week after.
"Sunkist orange with banana peel borders. The good-sized crown is the color of pineapple mousse, is at least as creamy and is twice as sticky. Foam bridges leave a gorgeous array of picture-perfect lace when they eventually rupture. The haziness imparted by yeast or hop flecks would have turned an already attractive beer into a gorgeous one. The label fish... not so gorgeous."
"sampled may 24/08 as part of biegaman's annual summer saison tasting, with a mix of BA/RB represented. not a saison, but i'm not complaining! biegaman contributed this one. thanks again jan! i also got one of these as an extra in a recent trade with seaoflament, so thanks too to carlos."
"Received this bottle courtesy of lightindarkness. Thanks, Christian. "
22 oz. bottle poured into a mug.
Received this beer in a recent trade with WeisGuy. This is my first Ballast Point brew and I'm lucky to get to try it. Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale tulip.
From a 'found' case as a result of a recent inventory at South Bay - called at a lucky time and was allowed to buy just one.
"Poured a clear yellow-orange into my 20oz mug, with a off-white head that rather quickly dissolved after rushing to the lip."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle to a pint glass, the liquid is a light copper with great carbonation. The head is a tall 3 fingers, white, and leaves lots of lace."
Got this one as part of 80s BIF. Thanks Jw347!
22oz bomber courtesy of South Bay. Thanks Joey!
Ordered this from Joey at South Bay.
"Pours a bright, clear, gold, topped by a thin white foam which leaves some spotty lace. The aroma carries an abundance of resiny/floral hops with loads of citrus. Some sweet malt notes lie mostly in the background. "
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter. Clear orange body with a small white head. Smell is downright incredible, with lots of oily hops, citrus, and a complexity I can't describe. Very strong piney hop taste, especially for a singe IPA, plus a biscuity, malty background. Mouthfeel is more like what I expected from a single IPA: not too light and not very heavy. Top notch drinkability: the whole bomber was gone before I knew it!"
A - Fantastic light tan head that's creamy and billowing. Clear orange body. Big bubbles shoot from the bottom of my standard pint glass. Lacing.
Appearance: Perfectly clear pale amber with a dense frothy head that leaves behind thick sheets of lace. Can't really get any better here.
"So this one goes out to Joey. He had been bitchin at me to try this forever and ranting and raving about how it was the best IPA under the sun. Finally, it was in bottles and I could take him up on this. Yesterday afternoon seemed like as good a time as any to try it out, so went over to Dad's for a little while and popped this open while I was there."
"Wow...I seem to keep running into some of my favorite brews lately. This one is no exception and gives Two Hearted a run for my favorite IPA. Pours very similar to Two Hearted in fact. Very clean amber golden pour with lively carbonation and big fluffy white head. Sticky lacing down the glass. Very pungent smell of fresh citrus hops. They're all over the spectrum but the main culprit as in many cases is grapefruit. This is super fresh smelling stuff. A slight candied citrus edge but the scent says it's all about the hops. Just unbelievably sharp and crisp scents rising up. Taste is another explosion to the senses but it can't quite live up to the smell it carries. Juicy, citrusy hops with a resinous pure hop juicy glory hiding under it. Very exceptional. A little bittersweet malt backing with light caramel. A very nice biscuity flavor is noticed later and provides a great compliment to the brew. Exceptional mouthfeel that tickles the tongue with bitterness and perfect levels of carbonation. It goes down so damn easy and just makes you want more. Damn, speaking of which, I wish I had more! "
Consumed 04/11/08.
"22 ounce bottle from Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA, April 2008. Price not recorded."
I got this bottle from South Bay D&L. Thanks Joey!
I love the BP robust series. I don't know how much longer that BP will be under the radar with beers like these.
Bootleg Sculpin :-)
Big thanks to Weibull for generously giving me this bottle.
"I bought one of only three bottles available for sale at TJ's Everyday. I know its being discontinued temporarily probably because of the hops shortage, and I feel lucky to have scored one of the only bottles in the whole state of Pennsylvania. I shared this 22oz. bottle with 2 friends of mine, and they both have had enough IPA's by now to know that this one tasted like grapefruit. Very smooth grapefruitey flavor provided by the hops. Like most west-coast IPAs, it almost could pass as a DIPA, as the boozey taste is there as well, and the sweet malts. However it is not a full-blown DIPA to this well-trained IPA-lovin palate of mine. It is drinkable but I gave it a 4 because we won't be seeing it in PA for a long time. Its kind of a shame."
Ordered this beer from South Bay Drugs and Liquor. Thanks Joey!
"22 oz bottle, served in a big wine glass at 52 F/ 11 C."
Poured into a Stone IPA flute glass. Immediate pine aroma hit the nose as the glass filled. Clear light amber color with a small head that dissolved quickly with light/medium carbonation. Huge citrus and pine smell that carries onto the palate. Very light on the tongue...almost Summer ale and pilsner like. Fades to a sweet/light/hoppy aftertaste. Slight alcohol taste as the beer warmed up. A very good aromatic IPA that leaves the door open to the next endeavor.
"22oz bottle courtesy of a trade with KingG, thanks! I always take a sniff off the bottle before pouring and this smells great! The color is a dark, but transparent, yellow and the head is full, sticky and firm. The aroma is pure West Coast IPA, piney, fruity, citrus, very nice. The flavor is a very green, almost vegetal hop flavor. There are also melon-rind notes which remind me of the Dorado DIPA. It does not quite live up to the aroma but it is still tasty. The mouthfeel is decent and the drinkability is good. Overall, this is a good West Coast IPA but I prefer the Big Eye from Ballast Point."
22 oz. bomber poured into a nonic.
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Orangish color with a large head that dissipates quickly into a smaller one. Aroma of citrus and flowers thanks to the hops. Maybe a touch of sweet malts underneath. Taste is bitter and resiny hops, that fade into a floral and slight malty sweetness. Overall the flavor is all about hops like it should be. Medium-bodied with nice carbonation. This a very tasty beer that I could see myself drinking frequently. In fact, I had this on-cask the other night at Hamilton's and I drank quite a bit of it."
Awww....suki suki now. 
Here's to uber-drinkable IPAs.
"Dammmmn, what a beer this is. It's not as intense as some IPAs, or even the Dorado DIPA made by Ballast Point. This is a light, subtle, fruity, exquisite IPA that you should make every effort to taste. Appearance is a rich orange color with fluffy white foam. Smell is an intense peach and apricot flavor. The taste, as I mentioned, is not as intense as say a Stone or Dorado, but is unique among the IPAs I've tasted. Peach, apricot, lemon, grapefruit, plus the bitterness you'd expect. Really incredible mix of flavors which hint more than overwhelm. Carbonation is just right. I don't know what more I can say, except that this is a very special beer."
"Poured from 22oz bottle into PP 7th ann. Real Als Fest english pint glass. Poured a golden orange honey color with thick foamy white head. Smell is a mixture of citrus, malt, and floral hop notes. Taste is like eating a grapefruit with a slight grassy bitterness followed by semi sweet malt profile. The alcohol is well masked in the flavors with a crisp mouthfeel and medium to light body. Carbonation was in great balance with the taste retaining a creamy feel. This is one of he best tasting IPA's on the market right now with just the right alcohol level and great balance still with an upfront grapefruit taste."
Pours a clear golden color. Nice finger head that fades leaving a nice amount of lace.
Pours a golden orange in the glass with a full finger snow white head that lasts and lasts and leaves beautiful mapping in it's wake as you drain the glass.
Super fresh bottle courtesy of Weibull...
"A - Gold goodness, near white .75 inch head, clinging persistent head."
"A- Poured into an imperial pint glass, this fish pours a clear light-gold color with a white head that settles to a thick, patchy layer over the beer. Each sip leaves behind an array of web-like lacing. "
"This beer pours a clear golden color, with a light yellow tinted head. The head fades slowly, leaving a large amount of lace."
"5 ounce serving today at Ballast Point 's 11th Anniversary celebration, only cask beer available, their Sculpin IPA on hand pump which they call ""Firkin"" because it does not have CO2 and it is grav fed"
08/11/07- Had on tap at the Bistro IPA Fest.
Had at the Linda Vista brewery on tap in a 4 oz taster
Pours a semi-hazy medium amber color with a thick off-white head that slowly dissipates. Citrusy hops dominate the nose with notes of fresh grapefruit and pine. There is some sugary sweetness up front along with a light citrusy fruitiness followed by a strong bitterness of grapefruit rind and pine oil. A thoroughly enjoyable IPA here.
"Wow, this is one heck of an IPA. Cask-conditioned and pumped into a pint glass, amber-gold with a glow, topped with an off-white head of 1/2 inch. It looks like a sparkling beer with a perfect carbonation to it. Good head retention and some nice sticky lace clings to the glass."
Had this on tap.
Appearance: Arrives at the table with a hazy golden body and a frothy head; retention is good as is the lacing
"Smooth delicious IPA. Many tropical notes, not too hoppy or overpowering. Slightly sweet from the fruity flavors."
"Appearance: bright golden color (think macro pilsener) with very slight haze – not NE IPA-style, more like a slight chill haze. The head forms a ½-finger of off-white with fair retention."
My standard go-to semi-premium IPA
"Have had this beer multiple times from both a can and from a tap. The pour results in a cloudy dark-orange/amber look with a thick off white head. The smell is strong and features a plethora of fruits, mostly citrus and light. Taste is reflective of the smell with a citrus hop flavor that has a slight bitterness. Mouth feel is light with moderate carbonation. Overall, it is fruity but in a refreshing way and not sour. There is still some bitterness and hops present. This is one of my favorite IPA's."
"Got in a BIF from KMitch. 12 ounce can into tulip glass, no can dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carrbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy, and sticky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 6.6%. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink with the moderately bitter/resinous/drying finish, not overly aggressive. Not as intensely tropical/juicy as I expected, but rather old school feeling IPA. Nice Centennial, Galaxy, and Citra profile. Centennial seems to have the most presence. Very juicy, dank, and earthy balanced hop complexity; nice bready malt backbone, with minimal residual sweetness from lingering dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and well made style example. No real complaints."
"Bought this at Trader Joe's. Checkout lady said they couldn't keep it in stock. I'm on the hunt for local beers that kick ass, and this beer has been highly rated."
Damn fine beer here. To the specifics....
Big thanks to JBowenGeorgia
L - 2-finger stubborn offwhite head atop a translucent yellow body.
"There is a reason Beer Connoisseur rated this one so high. I am not big fan of IPA; but this one is excellent! Pours a pale gold with a slight haze and nice head. Lots of interesting aromas - tropical fruit and a hint of pine. Goes down smooth and crisp. Has a nice snap of bitterness at the end, but not offensive or over done. Short aftertaste. If you are not a fan of IPA but still trying to find one that you like. Try this one, you will not regret it. Top of my IPA list."
"Met one of the guys who opened the brewery randomly in FL. Him and his girlfriend gave me their last can to try as we couldn't get it in JAX. Just awesome, smooth, crisp and easy to see why it flies off the shelves in GA."
"Tired it multiple times and have failed to be impressed. Don't know if my taste buds don't work but it does not,do it for me. Had other ""fruity"" IPAs that I prefer."
"Tropicalia 12oz can poured int Duvel tuplic. ON 07/11/18, BY 10/09/18 stampd on bottom of can."

"Another great Georgia IPA, a definite NE Style IPA. Hops and Malts are balanced. Smells of tropical fruit, taste follows. Followed by a somewhat piney slightly bitter tale. Another Classic, extremely hard to differentiate a clear best IPA in this state."
"A: Pours with a creamy, off white, three finger head and a clear, straw gold body."
12 oz can dated 6/13/18 poured into Funky Buddha snifter. 
"4.1/5: Wonderfully drinkable and easy, yet bursting with tropical flavors the same; would be a go-to if I can find it more easily"
poured into pint glass very light nice golden color nice bit of head that quickly turns to very light lacing around the glass heavy tropical fruit and citrus on the nose flavor is very tropical and citrus that has just a very pleasant light hoppy bitterness in the finish this is definitely a top 10 IPA an absolute beauty
This beer is perfection. So thankful the ATL area shortage is over.
"From a 2-week-old can, pours a moderately hazy gold. Two fingers of white foam leaves decent lacing. Smell has tropical fruit, citrus, earthy herbs and a touch of pine. Taste follows, combining fruity hops with some resinous pine. Moderately bitter, good body. Fantastic stuff, nice to have so fresh."
Thankfully this beer is widely available for me. Big juicy tropical aroma and the taste follows perfectly. This is a seriously good IPA. One of the best.
From the 12 oz can in a snifter. This nice IPA from the little lady's daughter and beau
My favorite summer time beer!
Acquired via trade. Can date of 2-8-18
Very tasty! Reminds me more of a NE IPA! I see why it is the top rated IPA from GA and was rationed.
"Poured from can into tulip good 2+ finger cream colored head, stays several minutes and reduces to 1/2 finger, great lacing. Pale golden in the glass, slight chill haze. Smells of pineapple, mango and grapefruit, smells really bright and tropical (like the name). Taste is initially pineapple and sweet malt, slight bitterness on the front and the grapefruit comes in thru the middle, strong grapefruit, good grapefruit, finishes fades off with a very mild bitterness, and am left with a grapefruit pith aftertaste (not in a bad way). Almost a creamy mouthfeel, on the first taste."
"Tropicalia came to me as part of a NBS box, and it was (as of yesterday evening) my favorite Creature Comforts beer thus far. It was unseated this morning by a blind tasting of Awaken, My Love - but per style, Tropicalia is still my favorite Creature Comforts pale."
Appearance is a somewhat cloudy dark orange. Poured with 2 fingers of white head.
"Pour is a golden yellow, significant hop haze, and a pillowy off-white head. The nose has oranges, pineapples, and passion fruit in equal amounts."
Canned 03/15/18!
Thanks to JBowengeorgia for this one. 12oz can poured into 12oz goblet. Poured a cloudy honey-gold color with 3/4 inch of white head that had moderate retention and lacing.
I'm not going into detail here it's local to me so I'm partial but with that said it's a little fruity for me.
"Bright orange body, clear, white head, lots of lacing. Strong pine and citrus, pith and solid malt at its core. Feel is brisk and pleasant. A delicious and rewarding IPA."
"Floral. Orange, tangerine, melon and red grapefruit. Biscuit malt. Lighter bodied. It's clean and fairly crisp. Really well rounded and balanced. Straight forward and good. Easy drinking. If I had easy access to this, I'd drink it a lot."
I have had this drink countless times and definitely recommend trying if you enjoy IPAs. Not aggressively hoppy and typically a great fruitful note. However I consistently purchase cans that are very cloudy and poorly filtered which is somewhat unsettling.
One of the best IPAs out there!
This is the best beer I have had.
Best IPA in GA hands down. Almost could be labeled a NE IPA with the intense juiciness.
"12oz can, dated 12.11.17, poured into 14oz snifter glass."
"Pour into standard pint glass with medium head, head dissipated slightly after a few minutes. Deep amber with a slight haze. Strong notes of grapefruit on the nose with subtle hints of naval orange and a pinch of sea salt. Medium bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Strong citrus notes on the taste, but resolves in a medium bitterness."
"Appearance: Pours a darkened gold body with some particulate haze. Foamy, frothy, white head."
"Poured with a medium head into a standard pint glass. Lots of grapefruit on the nose and other citrus fruits. I would like a more pronounced hop profile, but overall a great beer! Cheers"
"Floaty haze, orange, ok head. Fruity aroma, mild blueberry and orange juice. Fruity flavor, slight bitterness at the end, finish is a little odd. Ok beer."
"Surprisingly hazy brew, pale lemon yellow color. Solid head production and OK retention."
"This is the beer that turned me into a lover of IPA's. Citrus-y, hop forward, but not over bearing. It has just the right amount of bitterness, and the perfect nodes of passion and grapefruit that keep you coming back for more. The only bad thing about this beer is that I can't buy it in my home town."
"The first time I had it was at the Creature Comforts brewery in Athens, GA straight from the tap. Of the rash of fruity IPAs, Tropicalia is a standout!"
"First had at Yard House, Atlantic Station, Atlanta, Georgia, on draft into tumbler. To my surprise, Tropicália is styled as a more traditional IPA, but with boosted citrusy hops."
"Excellent IPA although a bit on the fruity side, almost seems like it has flavoring added. I know the super juicey IPAs are in so if that is your thing this one is one you will like."
"Pours fairly hazy. Nose is heavy of hops. Taste is great to superb with a very dry finish. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had, only wish it was easier to get."
"Definitely tropical on the nose. Bubble gum, fruit punch, pineapple, and guava. Nicely balanced with a hint of bitterness, lots of fruit, and malt sweetness. Easy drinking everyday IPA."
"A very good IPA but not a juice bomb by any means, if that's what you're expecting from the name. I was surprised by the aroma and flavor - seems like Cascade hops are predominant. Piney but sweet."
"I usually don't prefer IPA's but holy cow this beer is delicious. Great for summer, lots of tropical fruit upfront with the hops kicking in towards the end. Dangerously drinkable."
I'm trying this at Henry's in midtown hotlanta. It poured a clear copper with white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent had hints of orange peel. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink. Nice citrus peel presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it was a solid beer.
This brew is overrated. The South is not known for their IPAs. Can't wait to get back to the Northeast
Growler fill at Craft Beer Factory in Marietta. New craft pint.
"Aptly named I'd say, this beer just oozes sweet, juicy tropical fruit. I also tasted some melon and lime. The sugar cookie sweetness from the malts holds its own though, this is a very well balanced IPA. Fruity hops with low bitterness are what I crave and this delivers. An absolutely crushable IPA."
On tap at the brewery. 
Draft poured at brewery. Nice orange color with nice head. Fruits greet nose along with hops. Medium body with well balanced flavor on palate; hops and citrus. This is a winner each time! Not to be missed!
"An amazing east coast, juicy IPA. Very balanced."
"Canned 3/21, poured 4/13. Hazy gold/orange hues with healthy carb, moderate foam, strong creamy lacing. Citrusy hop smell with slight bitter backing. More balanced on the taste. Citrusy juicy taste is prominent but the bitterness is present. Very tasty and refreshing."
Canned 2/16/17
Dark gold/light amber color. Mild haze. Lasting near white head. Some blanketing lace. 
"Beautiful beer! Pours a slightly hazy peach color with a white head. Nose is of tropical fruits and grapefruit. Taste of ripe passion fruit, mangos and fresh citrus. Bitter but yet mellow and subdued. Medium to full body with a crisp finish. I really enjoyed Tropicalia!"
Well well well. Juice in a can.
golden orange pretty clear frothy head. smells like mango and sweet tea. taste topical sweet kinda malty. feels really smooth. not very complex kind of one note. just a sweet ipa with no redeeming bitterness. not bad not great.
"Poured into a wine glass. Canned 4 weeks ago. A hazy golden-straw color with a large frothy white head. Great retention and lacing. Bright aromas of tangerine, oranges, and mango. A hint of crackery malt. All citrus on the palate with the above fruits. A soft but prominent bitterness like grapefruit rind. Well-balanced with a dry finish."
Deep gold in color and clear with a decent amount of head that only a fraction remains. Significant lacing on a sip.
"Poured into a pint glass from a can (1/26/17), poured a clear orange color."
12 oz can from Athens GA that is only about 3 weeks past the canning date. 
One of the best IPAs ive had.
Can poured into glass
"Sweet tropical/citrus aroma. Very nice. However, sweet malt character was overpowering in flavor and there was a hint of booze which was surprising for the ABV. Will review again in the future. A lot of potential."
"I moved to ATL earlier this year and have had this beer in multiple formats. Overall, it is a quality, citrusy, solid IPA. It has a fantastic aroma and a pretty look. It is a great option on any draft list."
Type: 20-oz. draft
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
9-21-18
"Paradise in a can! This is the beer that made me jump on the IPA bandwagon, not too fruity nor too piney. I've yet to have the opportunity to compare it to any of the Alchemist, Trillium, FFF, etc. but I'm positive it would hold it's own. Great aroma, great mouth feel, slightly fruity at first but finishes clean with a hint of pine. Best part about is that it's brewed 15 minutes from my house so I can always get it fresh!"
I stumble onto a six-pack of Tropicalia when I visited The Beer Growler in Avondale for the first time to fill up on another brew.
"This beer won't give you the blues. Just about the perfect sweet spot for your modern IPA lover. Smooth easy drinker, a little malt to carry a healthy, but not overdone, dose of hops."
Poured at 44°F from a 12oz can (canned on 18Aug16) into a glass. Consumed on 09Sep16.
"A super juicy tropical IPA that lives up to its name. The palate and aroma are juicy hops, mango, pineapple, and coconut. It is very drinkable and I understand why it gets the hype because it deserves it."
"Beautiful apricot color with a big white head and some chunky lacing. Citrus and light hop resin round out a soft but noticeable aroma. Notes sweet orange, grapefruit flesh, tangerine, tropical fruit and a light resinous pine. Medium feel, smooth, slightly dry and very drinkable. A really great and juicy IPA."
"Consumed on draft at Terra Terrior (restaurant) in Atlanta. Had on a whim as the waiter mentioned it in passing as a new rotating tap addition, and very, very glad I did. Look is pale gold with just a wee bit of haze and a big, fluffy, white head that retained its form for most of the drink and left behind a nice lacing. Smell is bright and juicy with lots of citrus (mostly grapefruit) and a little pine. There's a slight yeasty element, and maybe some peppery cracker, and there's a decent malt backbone in there, but the aromas are really all about floral and fruity hops. Taste follows suit with sweet and juicy citrus (orange and grapefruit), tropical fruit, and a little bit of bitter and resinous pine. There's a meaningful amount of toasted oats and sweet biscuit in there, because the citrus juice is very pronounced but doesn't take over, and the bitterness isn't over the top. Feel is sizable, especially for the light coloring, very creamy, sticky, and carbonated. Very solid beer that I would love to have again."
"I had a pint of this while visiting Atlanta (the Book House Pub is highly recommended, by the way). It has a very nice hop profile and I'd definitely like to have this again sometime. Excellent beer."
"This is a great fruity IPA and one of my favorites plus since it's local, I can always keep some fresh cans in the beer fridge. It's got a pleasant nose, good mouth feel and it's easy to quaff. They have fun tours too as Athens is a great town- tour the brewery and it's an easy walk to several good restaurants."
"Probably one of the best, if not the best, IPA I've ever had. Great hints of citrus flavor (but not overbearing, extremely well-balanced flavor profile), very smooth, just an extremely refreshing IPA. Every time I went to the liquor store, they were sold out of it. I no longer live in Georgia, wish they had a larger distribution system, it'd be my go-to IPA all the time."
Tropical fruit notes are the first thing you smell when you crack a can of this beer. As you pour the beer it opens up and is best by the 3rd or 4th sip this beer really opens up on your palette with some complex and very well balanced flavors. Hints of mango and passion fruit blend with a light citrus piney hop flavor. Slight amount of bitterness on the back of the tongue gives way to the next sip to a balance that is quite exquisite.
Look: baller IPA
"L: Light orange appearance, clear, light carbonation. Put this one from ambient temp (~85 deg.) to into the freezer for 60 minutes as I could not wait to try. This may have subdued the carbonation. "
"Very piney and bright citrus. Pineapple, orange, grapefruit, mango"
Great IPA. Enough said
Appearance - The beer was orange with a brownish tint. A fairly sizeable head was produced. 
"L: pours a deep, golden hue. Nice carb and rich head present. Super clear pour. No haze. "
"Great beer. One of my personal favorites. Tropical flavors (citrus and passionfruit) dominate, with a somewhat subdued hoppy bitterness. As far as IPAs go, this is a less aggressively hopped beer that is more about the depth of tropical flavors than it is about hops. Great summer beer, and incredibly easy to drink!"
From a Can into a Pint Glass
Crushable and delicious
Pours a yellow-gold with a finger of thick head that recedes to a thin cap leaving strata of lacing. Nose is strong citrus - orange and pineapple. Taste similar but with a piney finish. Juicy and well carbonated. Highly enjoyable.
Very individual IPA. Stands out among the crowd.
Pours a cloudy orangish color with a thick foamy head. Retention is decent. Lacing is good. Has a nice tropical citrus aroma with a good piney hop at the end. Good citrus taste. Nice piney hop at the end. Somewhat astringent. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Decent beer.
"Tropicalia is easily my favorite IPA brewed in the southeast right now, maybe my top IPA of the moment. It's drinkable, flavorful, and is incredibly well balanced. Despite its limited distribution and the fact I don't even live in GA, it's available at a large retailer about 15 minutes from me over the state line. I make a trip every other Monday to stock up specifically on this beer."
A very solid IPA. It has one of the best noses I've ever experienced in an IPA. Very floral and refreshing. I wish they could scale and make more of this stuff.
Perfect citrus IPA
Neat!
"Poured from 12 oz. can into pint glass. It pours a clear golden-orange color with a one-finger, bright white head and extensive lacing. The smell features sweet, tropical fruit, including orange, pineapple, and grapefruit, along with pine needles and floral hops. The taste is a terrific balance of sweet juicy fruit and bitter hops, with a nice malt base. The flavors blend very well. This ale is medium-bodied, pleasantly carbonated, and very drinkable with a manageable ABV of 6.5%. Overall, this is an outstanding American IPA. I fully understand, and concur, with its world-class rating. I'm fortunate to have been able to sample it while in Georgia since it isn't distributed in New Jersey."
"This is one of the juiciest, well balanced IPAs I have ever had. Medium to light body. Perfect for a warm summer day. Only available in GA as far as I know, just visited last week. I live in Jersey. And I already miss the infamous tropicalia :("
"COD 4/13/16. Clear golden pour with a bit of orange. Quite outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention."
"Drove to Athens and bought three six packs of this wonderful beer! Smells of blended fruit. The name of this beer very much fits it's delivery. Just absolute paradise in a can. The balance between fruit, hops and malt is just perfect. I could drink this beer all day long, every single day and not get tired of it. Just absolutely refreshing!"
Pours - clear golden color with nice thick white head that lasts a good while. excellent lacing.
"For my first time trying this beer, I was instantly reminded of a Blue Moon as far as taste and feel, obviously because of the citrus taste, too. For me, it was like a hoppy Blue Moon. Somewhat complex through the finish. Very good beer."
look: clear Golden with big billowy white head. Messy lacing.
"A very juicy IPA- in fact, a bit too juicy for me."
"From 04/13/16 notes. Pours from a 12 oz. can into a tulip. Canned on 04/04/16, best by 07/04/16."
One of the absolute best IPAs I have had
Cloudy pale in color with a small white head that goes away quick. Has a strong hoppy mango smell with a hint of peach to it. Has a very hoppy taste and citrus aftertaste.
"Taking their foot off of the bitter throttle just a bit and allowing the aroma and flavor of hops to shine, The brewers at Creature Comforts are out to show folks who don't think that they like IPA that there's an IPA for them."
Had to change my review after I receiving some of these fresh (canned 2/26). I originally received a few in a trade and they smell and tasted like rotten fruit.
"I got to try this via a beer trade. Very nice IPA. I could drink a lot of this stuff. Very well balanced, this is a good beer. Cheers!"
Pours a golden light Amber color. Aroma is citrus all the way. Flavor is juicy citrus that leads to a nice aftertaste. Overall this is all around a delicious IPA.
This one was a real pleasant surprise. The reviews have covered this beer's profile but I wanted to add that this is a great example of an American IPA that walks the line between west coast and east coast styles. Really excellent beer and really glad it was given to me to try!
"an enormous thanks to wcu80 for sending a can of this across the country to me this week, super stoked to crack it, and its wonderful ipa, fresh and distinct and delicious. pours a crystal clear burnt orange color, a little more visual depth to this than a lot of the east coast india pale ales. the head is pure white, and inch high, and very permanent. top notch aroma on it. definitely a mix of hop varietals, but citra and amarillo come to mind on the nose. despite the color, there is a little less grain smell to this than it looks like it should have, not sweet or weighty at all. some woodier hops too, maybe centennial, providing depth and bitterness. the flavor lines up relatively well with the nose, but for me at least, citrus zest notes take over a little more here. orange and lemon peel, bright and bitter at the same time, and quite resinous on the feel, a touch of honey sweetness flashes in, and then very little left on the tongue after the swallow. well layered hops, it kind of keeps on changing and evolving through the sip, and even more as it warms up a little bit. i love the beer, i love the packaging, and i wish i had more of it. again a magnificently large thanks to wcu80 for the act of kindness. much love!"
Thank you to RussianDragon for the can.
"Appearance: Moderately hazy golden orange in color, with a small, dense white head that persists rather well. An irregular tidemark adorns the glass walls. The carbonation is minute, profuse and fast-rising."
Can dated 1/18/16 into an IPA glass at fridge temp.
Delicious beer. Had this at the brewery. Like a grapefruit sculpin but better and with more hop.The aroma is awesome...fruity and dank together.
"I've been hearing the hype about this beer for a while now and stumbled across some of it while on a trip down to Georgia. I'm definitely glad that I picked this up... beautifully golden and clear this beer is loaded with pungent hop aromas. Deep and citrusy, it is completely one dimensional which is okay with me. It tastes great for sure but not quite as intense as the aroma would lead you to believe. That being said, this is still delicious. Very glad I got to try this one."
"Dark amber yellow, no head. Citrus peel aromas hang above this beer abundantly. That aroma is reflected in the taste. A fruity, refreshing ipa."
"This is an awesome beer. It pours clear gold with a nice orange tint. There is a huge white head that leaves gobs of lacing all around. The aroma is oranges, mangoes, and pine with a sweet malty aroma. The beer is very fruity with the mango being the predominant fruit flavor and orange as an accent. There is a perfect balance of sweet and bitter from the malt an hops and the beer finish dry but with lingering hints of mango and pine. Really nice beer and what I would expect a juicy IPA to taste like."
12 oz can poured into tulip glass. 12/30/15
"12oz can poured into a tulip glass, canned on 1/20/16"
12 ounce can poured into a teku.
"Very aromatic. I was getting a grapefruit smell. Taste is super fruity, along the lines of Maharaja, just not quite as much. Very smooth, almost dry finish. Wonderful beer and the one I had was from a nearly 3 month old can"
Poured into a snifter from a can.
"How exciting! Two great beer people, Ray & Cornelia (or vice versa), know of The CANQuest (tm) & routinely send me beers housed in aluminum cylinders as a result. I kid you not, it pays to advertise! I always look forward to the arrival of one of their packages and this was a VERY pleasant surprise. Merci beaucoup!"
"Totally yummy. This is a wonderful beer that rivals the sculpin grapeftuit, but I actually think this one is better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Dran from the can. This is very floral, citrusy with a little pine, and insanely smooth. One if the best iPas I've ever had"
"12oz can, served in a snifter glass."
One of the best IPAs I've had. Tons of tropical flavors and minimal bitterness.
"Just under 1 month old, canned 11/24/15. Served into a snifter. "
Very smooth initial taste. Pretty tropical. Sting citrus notes.
Good aroma but way to fruity. Sort of a tricked up IPA. This is a somewhat disturbing trend lately with IPAs.
A Crisp and refreshing IPA. You can have fun with these.
12 ounce can poured into a tulip. No date on can that I can see. 
"Pours pretty standard for the style: pale gold, decent-sized head. Smells, for lack of a better term, fairly dank, with big green and citrusy hop nodes against a surprisingly assertive cereal grain."
"Received this beer in a trade. My first beer from Creature Comforts and I will make sure that it is not my last. Awesome IPA! Poured a dark orange with a little bit of a red color to it and gave a white head. Smelled great! Hops, citrus, tropical fruit notes, grapefruit..the one thing that surprised me was the sweet finish after sipping this IPA. Definitely would like to grab a sixer of this!"
"On tap at Hop City in Atlanta, into a shaker. Pours a glowering light peach, with a tint of red, minimal head but good lacing. Smells awesome...big dank pithy juicy orange, mango, guava, and some sweet breads as well. Taste follows the nose...this isn't real sharp and there's not a lot of bitterness but the dank citrus is very nice. Middling on the carb...pretty substantial body, and a little heavy and wet on the end."
Look - Golden/reddish orange color. Clear in appearance. 
Tasting poured into their belgian style pint glass. About a 10oz pour.
"From a growler from Tap It in Gainesville. Smell, taste and finish all fantastic. Best IPA I have had. Unfortunately I live in Florida so I will have to settle for lesser IPA's. Hopefully back to the mountains next year."
"The color of the body was golden amber, and the carbonation bubbles looked very small. The head formation was two fingers thick, and appeared stable. The smell was extremely tropical, with aromas of grapefruit, mango, blood orange, and melon overwhelming the nose. The taste was a natural follow up to the smell, with a very grapefruit like beginning, and citric tang, followed by a kick of spicy hops, and a cracker like finish. The body was medium dense, and the aftertaste lingered on. The mouthfeel was balanced right between juicy and dry. Pretty hard to find in the local liquor store, and sold in single cans with a limit of two per customer, and I grabbed the last pair."
"There really should be a new class of beers based upon the new hop flavor profiles that are hitting the market. Ten years ago, it was hard to beat a Sweetwater IPA, Hopslam, or Double Trouble for IPA's available in the SE. Now that the available hops have evolved, so has the beer. Tropicalia is one of the best ""new-school"" IPA's that I have ever had. It's full of the tropical AROMAS and flavors that I want in my everyday beer without the palate crushing bitterness of the older IPA offerings . Tropicalia has that sweet, southern malt backbone that which works perfectly for my palate. It tastes better than my favorite ""Session IPA's"", my everyday beers, along WITH the 2 abv points which I REALLY enjoy. I don't mind paying 11.99 for All Day IPA. but if Tropicalia were available to me everyday at 6.6% and 10.99 per six pack, I may never drink another beer ever again, ever. This is the best packaged IPA in the SE , hands down. I even prefer it to all of the renowned IPA's in the NE and West Coast because of the sweet, JUICY, crushable, balanced, tropical goodness that is Tropicalia."
Had this for a third time and edited accordingly. After a few weeks (same 6 pack) it tasted best. OJ and Citrus fruit on the nose with a taste that follows. Nice full mouthfeel for an IPA
"The beer is orange in color. The aroma is dank with hints of tropical fruits. The taste is pine, citrus, citrus zest, tropical fruits, melon, and sweet malt."
"I am looking at the other ratings and I am thinking that this can must be old (though there is no way of knowing due to the lack of dating). Nevertheless, it is very underwhelming. Though it pours like most IPAs and resembles others with the traditional orange color, it lacks the hop profile I would expect from such a beer. I definitely want to try this one again, assuming I could find it fresh."
Can to snifter. Thanks brentlepping.
Bought a growler from a place in georgia called Just Tap'd from the ladies recommendation. 
"Pours an opaque deep gold/pale amber producing 2 fingers of variously bubbled, frothy, beige, moderately lasting head that leaves a nice webby coating of lace. Aroma while not robust is wet & as touted on the can ""juicy"" being ""Hawaiian Punch"" tropical fruity without the perfuminess, particularly mango, pineapple & passion fruit, with citrus notes of orange & tangerine & floral/leafy hints backed by caramel malt tones. Taste is similar but the hoppiness is less tropical & more balanced with the stronger citrus, resinous & leafy/floral notes backed by sweet caramel providing a better hop/malt balance than the nose. Starts hoppy but slightly sweet, balancing toward bittersweet hops/sweet malt in the middle, gravitating slowly towards bitter again in the finish, slowly transitioning to mostly bitter in the aftertaste until the sweet is replaced by thin astringency. Just enough hop bittering & malt sweetness here to call this brew balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, wet, juicy & slightly prickly throughout becoming faintly drawing in the aftertaste."
"From can born 9/16/15 little over week ago. Pours golden with modest head. Smell very juicy and as name implies tropical. Taste follows up well and can compare with Jai Alai if you could get it fresh. Finish is crisp and surprisingly clean no after stuff going on. Home run here, now if they will can Bibo"
"This is my go to IPA, dank, tropical, delicious."
Pours golden cloudy orange with a one finger head. Smells like grapefruit and juice with some grain. Taste is ripe with bitter hops and juicy chewy-fruit flavor. Orange rind is present and fits nicely. The bitter hops are more present in the finish. Really easy to drink and enjoyable.
"Look: Light Orangey, slight Haze"
"People are comparing this to Jai Alai from Cigar City. It's like the sessionable version of that beer. Love the quick, crisp finish. Filled with juicy tropical flavor. Delicious!"
"On draft at taco Mac watching the first game of the nfl season. Pours a deep Amber color that has carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Nice frothy one inch head that leaves thick white clouds on the side of the glass. The smell is orgasmic with tropical flavors of pineapple, mango, orange and passion fruit. Taste is similar to the nose only somehow better with citrus bursts and a great balance of malt. This is my absolute favorite beer. Cheers!"
"This beer is every bit as tropical, dank and balanced as most of the New England beers that are getting all the hype."
That's a great beer.
Reviews this on draft at Creature Comforts.
Poured from a 12 oz can into a clear glass tulip. No freshness but I know it was purchased in early August. Very generously provided by good friend Erinn.
12 oz can about 3 weeks old
On draft in savannah. Golden in color. Thin white head. Lacing the glass. This IPA hits your nose when it arrives in front of you. Huge mango and pineapple nose. Awesome. Medium carbonation. Delicious.
Pours a white grape looking yellow with nice 1/2'' foamy head
Papaya orange color.
This beer is pretty damn tasty.
Beautifully done AIPA with loads of citrus smells and flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side but I guess that's what makes easy to drink one or three! Well done.
"Serving type: Straight outta Compton. I mean, can. "
Can thanks to rudzud
Received as an extra in a trade. Poured into a Kate the Great tulip. Shared with JLindros.
"this beer is juicy, balanced, and extremely well crafted. the proper care was obviously taken to create an incredible depth of hop flavor and aroma without being overly bitter on the palate. it's a beautiful gold to amber color. i get passionfruit, mango, & grapefruit on the nose and there is a nice balance of fruitiness and hop pine/floral character in the flavor. i can drink a lot of this beer unlike many ipas that wear out my palate with bitterness. it also has a nice full mouthfeel. incredible!"
"I was passing through Georgia on my way to Alabama on the hunt for this beer. First beer store sold out. Second beer store had none. Drove out of town after purchasing from the bottle shop and on my way out stopped at one boor beer store and found it. I was excited. I was then let down as the beer did not live up to what I had heard and read. This beer does not live up to its current rating although it is a real easy drinkable IPA with awesome aroma at the nose and good mouthfeel. Nice golden orange brown color with pine and citrus up front up at the nose. Not overpowering and overly bitter at the finish. All in all an enjoyable drink, not overly palate or taste provoking."
"L: deep Amber/orange color, especially with a nice tight lacy head"
I'm not an IPA guy all-around but this is a great beer. Bitterness is very balanced with the malt and it's bursting with great tropical aroma and flavor.
"Light in color and slightly hazy. Has a nice bright and juicy aroma to it. Lots of tropical, juicy flavors to it as well. Low on the bitterness. Light and easy drinking for the style as well. Very nice beer overall."
"Incredible for a georgia-brewed IPA and we are lucky to have it when it's actually on store shelves. Juicy, balanced, citrusy, crushable. Put this up against all those great IPAs out there that dont make it to georgia holds up well but should not have a high 90s rating. This and Cannon Dragger are the best IPAs in a market that doesnt really do IPA."
"12 oz can. Clear bright orange golden color with thin white head. Aroma is tangerine and peach, maybe some plum. A little on the sweet side, clean malt with citrusy hops that balance well. Hops are not in your face, but definitely present. The mouth is fairly slippery and it go us down way easy. Overall very good if wanting a fruity, juicy clean IPA. Can, August 2015."
"I like this beer, but for IPA's it is lower on my ranking scale. Delivered to me in a six-pack can by my brother while vacationing in Georgia. Very little head from these beers, but deliciously hoppy! Needs to be cold! Your non-IPA friends will stay away after a sip."
"This beer was as advertised. Hoppy, juicy and tropical. Grapefruit, orange notes paired well with the bitterness and sweetness, this beer will definitely be consumed by a lot of consumers on a nice hot summer day."
Poured from a fresh 12 oz can - less than a week old. Poured into a tulip glass. 
Poured from a 12 oz can. Undated can but received it in a trade last week so I'm going to assume it is around 2 to 3 weeks old. Poured into a small glass snifter. Aggressive pour leaves a 1/2 finger of head. The head comprised small white bubbles that dissipated very fast
best beer brewed in georgia. hands down
"Looks like orange soda. Small thin head that does not last long. I wanted to rate Look lower because of the head, but the color is just beautiful. It's my first ORANGE IPA."
"Exceptional citra IPA, Great smell and taste."
"Troplicalia from Creature Comforts was slightly disappointing. The pics I had seen of the beer made it look like some sort of Trillium/TreeHouse juice bomb. They people taking those pics must have had some really good lighting going on because didn't look like the pics I saw. Still a very solid beer, but it does not stack up with the best of the best coming out of New England."
A real easy drinker and nice feel. Some pine up front but with a nice tropical finish. Neither is overpowering and this drinks quite easily for the ABV.
One of my favorite beers. Creature comfort has nailed it with this one. Great citrus notes up front and a bit of pineyness on the back end. This has become my everyday drinking beer. Can't get enough.
"Enjoyable color. Wonderful tropical, but muted nose. Taste doesn't quite live up to the nose, were the tropical flavors fade and a prominent bitter (but not offensive) taste comes through. Finish is just the bitterness. Overall, if it tasted like it smelled, I would like it better but its a solid beer none the less."
"Solid IPA, light and highly drinkable, but lacking that juiciness of the upper echelon of the style. Looking forward to trying more from them in the future."
Pours amber with a nice head from the Growler. Hops evident on the nose and in the mouth. Extremely well balanced. Very flavorful. Yum! Dangerous!
This is an outstanding beer for summer. I really can't think of a better light but tasty beer currently available. This has the perfect balance that can stand alone or with BBQ. A real treasure that should not be missed.
Very malty looking out of the bottle with nice head retention. Some tropical notes in the nose but mainly catch the malt smell. Taste was small amount of mango and grapefruit but was faint and not as expected. Nice mouthfeel. Overall pretty good beer.
Best IPA I've had in a long time. Perfect balance. Great feel. By far the best beer I've had in the Southeast. Almost impossible to get unless you are in Athens.
"Smells awesome, but there's some kind of plastic aftertaste going on."
"I work in the industry and with all of the hype around this beer i was expecting my socks to be blown off when i tasted this brew. This beer is delicious, it has great body and a long lasting finish. The hop to malt ratio is very balanced and the color is what u expect for this style. I think that the score is a little high for this beer but it is a great ipa and one of my favorite ipa's coming out of Georgia right now. If u have a chance to taste it dont pass it up."
had this about a year ago and i remember it being good but not mind blowing..
"This beer matches the name perfectly. I get lots of tropical fruit in the aroma and the taste. Light in color, not overly malty, and perfectly balanced IPA"
Great beer nice balance of hops smooh and easy to drink is like the hawian punch of the ipa's my favorite beer so far I don't think it can get much better than this. It's the beer that u can't get enough of.
"This is a exceptionally refreshing American IPA. Vibrant orange look is complemented by a long-lasting, medium-sized head. Powerful combination of tropical and resinous scent. Strong citrus taste that lasts for quite some time. To my surprise, there is some malt in there as well. Great feel with expected carbonation. Had this fresh in a can, and on draft. Would say that the specific draft I tried was a little better with the lasting taste. Will definitely be making the Atlanta to Athens, GA drive to reload."
"This poured out as a nice golden color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer is very nice, lots of fruity hop aroma to it. The taste of the beer is much like the nose just not quite as strong. The feel of the beer is pretty good, smooth and sessionable. Overall it's a great beer."
"Don't know how old my can is, but aroma was very nice, not overpowering. A nice balance of tropical fruity hops and sweet malt (but not too sweet) in the taste. Creamy mouthfeel with a smooth bitterness. Very easy to drink. Wish I had more!"
"Can into a Gandhi-Bot tulip. Thanks, Lesley!"
"massive love to sirsteve42 for tossing this can my way (or forgetting it in my fridge in a post litasting haze....either way, cheers bud!). cracked the can and filled my beer hunter willie b."
Pours orange. 
"June 22, 2015"
"One of the best beers/ipas I've ever had. Not what i'm used to out of an IPA, not very hoppy or bitter, Has a juicy and rip taste/feel/smell. Once this beer gets more widely distributed it will be/is the next big thing. World class."
"Huge red grapefruit, dank cannabis, resin, pine, pineapple, mango, and tangerine form the aroma. It's a bit sticky sweet in caramel malt. Extremely fruit forward hop character."
"A: poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass, orange amber colored with short white head that dissipates leaving little lacing, clear"
"A: Light orange, thin white head, really good lacing "
Can packed on date 5-26-15
"I'm not a big ipa guy but this was pleasant & balanced. A lot of depth to the taste, and a nice crispness - A wonderful beer ! now if I could only find it again ."
"Can. Phenomenal looking can art. One of my favorites. Beer pours a hazy, dark peach color. Thin, frothy head. Aroma is very juicy. Juicy, fruity hops. Smells fairly sweet, too. Smells kinda like peach juice. Unique. Flavor rides with the nose. Sweet peach juice hops. Apricot, candied citrus, slightly floral. Rock candy and sweet bread malt. Was expecting a different flavor profile but I did enjoy the way they went with this one. Medium bodied. Bitterness is low relative to the style. Finishes with a light grassiness and fruit. I had super high expectations for this beer. I found it to be pretty tasty but not quite what I was expecting and anticipating."
This is a fantastic beer and it's canned and affordable! The tropical nose is outstanding. I get mangoes and papaya and it drinks very well. Very bright and juicy with a mild bitterness and finishes well. I would be a happy drinker if I could regularly have this in my fridge.
"Yeah, this is one of the absolute best IPAs I've had. I had it on draft at Trappeze in Athens and the smell blew me away. Then the taste... just as good. Brought twelve cans to take back to Bama."
Poured into a Funky Buddha Brewery snifter. No freshness date.
"Beautiful cherry wood orange coloring with a cream, white head. This is right up there with one of the greatest ipa aromas on the planet. Its namesake shines through with smells of pineapple, papaya, and the passion fruit. The aroma is balanced out with smells of floral hops. The taste is much like the smell. A hit of hops cut by the tropical fruit notes and just enough maltiness to feel in the gaps. There is a bit of soap flavor but it almost keeps the sweet and tangy fruit flavor from overpowering it. I even got a reminiscence of candied pineapple. This beer has a bright future ahead of it. It is bold yet subtle. A drinkable beer for everyone with the sophistication of top tier ipa. This is the IPA for the beach that I have been waiting for."
"March 9, 2016 can poured into a glass -- the nose is light citrus. On the front end, there's light citrus. On the back end, there's no bitterness, just a lingering citrus. I truly love this beer."
A big thanks to HopDawg03 for getting this beer for me.
There's a reason it is hard to find. It is that good.
Best IPA in Georgia. Period
This baby knocks the socks off of all other Georgia brewed IPA's. 
"Good grief cant find it , every liquor store sells out within one day. Two cases allotted , no kegs, just to show you the taste is wanting you to drink more. Nice lacing one the glass, hops and bitterness always up front, then you get hit with the passion fruit which makes this beer a sessional . Refreshing, the bros need to rate this. I took 50 investors at 30000 to raise enough money to blow this economy away with this beer. Move over Lagunitas and sierra."
"great, very smooth American IPA"
The passion fruit is what sets it off. Absolutely my favorite beer
My second rated all fiver. This is tropical and smooth. I've been waiting to find this and finally did. Amazingly simple.
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. The liquid is a cloudy golden orange, with a thick nearly-white head that leaves a ton of lace. Exactly what I would want it to look like!"
Poured from a can into an oversized wine glass
12 FL. OZ. can
Fantastic IPA. Very well done.
I made a special stop in Atlanta on my way home from spring break to pick up this beer. I am very excited to give it a try.
This might be one of the best IPA's I've ever had! Super fruity and tropical hop flavors dominate the flavor. I love this beer!!!
Went to can debut party.
Delicious crushable IPA. Great Brewski!
"Deep gold pour from 12oz can; thick, tight white head; good lace and carbonation. Dry hop pellet and lemon nose and flavor. Dry hop flavor is cloying. Medium lite mouthfeel/ my tongue tastes rusty...unfortunate hop pellet aftertaste..."
Very citrus forward IPA. The aroma is awesome and the taste is even better. My go to IPA from now on. So glad it is distributed in Atlanta now. Serious contender for the best IPA I have had.
Fantastic beer. It will be famous.
"Simply one of the best, if not the best, IPAs in the country. Incredible smell of tropical fruit upon opening it that fills the room and the taste follows closely. Remarkably drinkable. This deserves every accolade it receives down the road and I expect this to be near the top of the list very soon."
One of the best IPA's I've ever had. I'd put this up there with the very best.
This is a top 5 IPA for me. Absolutely outstanding...
12 oz. can poured into a pint glass.
Terrapin needs to start looking over their shoulder with this release from another great brewery in the Classic City.
"On tap at a local growler sore. Very refreshing, clean IPA."
Best IPA in the south.
The beer comes in a slightly hazy strawberry reddish amber.
Fruity IPA. Nice aroma and super smooth going down.
"I usually stray away from the kind of ""lighter, citrus forward"" IPA's but this one changed my mind. It's a perfect beer just outside of the session IPAs for day drinking in the sun and being able to still howl at the moon at night. I want one right now..."
"pours a slightly hazy, dark orange with a thin head that disappears within a minute. nose; big papaya, orange zest & rind, & citrus hops. taste; sweet malt, citrus hops, orange rind, papaya, melon, & a very light onion/garlic spice on the end. dominant & juicy papaya in the nose and taste. as others have said, it does have almost orange juice character that finishes very dryly. medium carbonation & mouthfeel. extremely well-balanced & hoppy. a winner. =)"
"Appearance – 90: Canned 11/19/2014, poured into a tulip glass. Color is a golden orange, almost amber. 1/4 inch of foam, with decent lacing and head retention."
Received as an extra in a recent trade with eee. 
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Pint Glass.
Thanks to my buddy Chris for bringing me a six-pack!
A bit too watery. Decent nose but the flavors arent there.
I've heard nothing but rave reviews about Tropicalia and now I see why after having my first glass. 
12 oz can poured into pint glass. 
Creature Comforts really knocked it out of the park with this one. The hops are all juice with the perfect malt backbone to balance it out. Not bitter for an IPA but thankfully not overly sweet either. Mouthfeel is up there with the best of them. No wonder this is so hard to track down.
"This beer was originally fantastic. I'm not sure what caused the change (maybe an increase in production for wide distribution), but the flavorful and citrus-rich IPA I first encountered is no more."
Appearance: Arrives clear amber capped by an inch of foam; the head fades quickly to a ringlet leaving a few strands behind
"Enjoyed this in tap at The Globe and found it on par with Sculpin and Jai Alai... Exquisite citrus flavor. Later had it in cans and found it just as delightful. At $9.99 (vs. $14.99 for Sculpin) it is both delicious and affordable. To be such a young brewery they hit a grand slam home run. I just hope they can replicate this in later batches because I like it! Thanks, Creature Comfort!"
"Bought a single can today to try out. The initial aroma is unreal. Super fruity with notes of pine creeping in. The taste carries the aroma quite well, with a good malt backing that balances it all out. Will certainly pick up a 6 pack next trip out."
"Pours a nice Pale to dark gold color. Aroma is extremely pungent with huge Citrus, passion fruit, and overall tropical fruit notes. The aroma bursts from the can immediately. Head retention is great on this can, it has a nice medium mouth feel that coats the pallet but dissipates quickly, slight hints of pine and grass, with a subtle malt & caramel character that comes through, but the hops are the clear focus here. The beer finishes very dry, making room for another sip immediately, and there is little to no linger bitterness. I know I am partial, but I come back to this beer all the time, and truly think it is as good as any I have had."
"I had a pint of this followed by a growler from Empire Pizza and Growlers in Dunwoody. An excellent beer, very fresh and bursting with citrus and tropical fruit flavors.Somewhat malty, but in a juicy rather than a biscuity way. Clean aromas and taste with restrained bitterness, but juicy tangerine, guava and pineapple. Crisp in the finish, and moreish. Very well done- I'll definitely have this again."
A- Nice amber/orange color in the glass. Semi hazy with pretty good head and lacing.
"This is a fantastic, juicy, ripe, tropical, IPA. It is a versatile beer in that you can sip at night watching tv, or pound it at a tailgate, bbq or party. I tend to get tired of some IPA's and jump around but this one is a staple. Tropicalia is a tasty and flavorful wonder liquid."
"Poured on-tap at the brewery and served in a pint glass, the beer is a hazy, copper-orange coloring, with a foamy, filmy, clingy, off-white head. Nose of tropical fruit sweetness, citrus, and resinous pine pitch, all well blended and balanced. Very aromatic. Flavors are tropical fruit forward, with a solid tone of pine pitch, cut grass, and bitterness. Pineapple, mango, and melon abound. Smooth, mid-bodied, with a slightly effervesced, clean, smooth finish. Fruity aftertaste, with pine and grass highlights throughout. Awesome beer!"
"Served in a snifter at Trappeze, a pub only a short walk from the brewery. "
"Appearance: Medium clarity orange body, one finger head with great lacing."
"Had on tap at the brewery. Pours clear golden amber with decent head retention. The nose has full-on citrusy hops and maybe a little bit of honey. Front palate yields some malty sweetness following mid-palate by an explosion of citrus (primarily orange and grapefruit). The finish doesn't linger as long as I'd like, due to the medium-to-thin mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very solid and balanced American IPA. Certainly not a West Coast-style hop bomb, but a great, sessionable brew. Can't wait for cans to become available."
"A: pours a light golden bronze, with a minimal head that vanishes quickly."
"Growler from 5 Points Bottle Shop in Athens, GA"
Tap to pint glass @ Russian River Brewing tap 
Jeez this beer is always awesome.
"On tap at the source. Poured into a pint glass at happy hour for $3.75, a light golden color with a one-inch thick white head which lingers long. Aroma is floral and bright citrus. Flavor is clean and very hop forward. Bitter finish. Packs quite a hop punch. Easy drinking. Seek this out."
A: Golden to pale yellow. Thick large loose bubbles. 3 fingers. 
"I happened to be there when they had this on tap. It really just hit all the right notes for me. Really drinkable, bright and hoppy, glad to have tried it."
My favorite RR Single IPA!
Thanks to eyebereej for sending this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from Russian River half-gallon growler into a Russian River pint glass.
"Burnished orange, typical translucent RR IPA,1 finger of soapy white head, splotchy lacing."
"Growler courtesy of Abbbp, opened with Gunch52 and TheReal_Adam. Poured into a Jester King Funk and Sour Fest Tulip."
Freshly filled growler filled at Russian River's pub
Enjoyed on tap on 5 October 2013 at Russian River.
"Had on tap first night at Russian River during the T25 party. Pour is clear golden orange with white ring. Nose is heavy hop, tons of tropic fruit a d grapefruit. Nose is sweet, taste is super hoppy and tight, so dry with huge tropical fruit and grapefruit. Really hop forward and tasty."
Massive resin on this one. Loads of oils with thick piney tones to it. It almost seems a bit much to me in that it's well beyond balanced. Just kind of a massive explosion of hops; if you are into that sort of thing.
"Buddy of mine had to go on stomach medication after trading for a fresh growler of this, so I inherited most of this growler. Here's a toast to your speedy recovery :)"
"Thanks, Craig. "
On-tap at the brewery.
2L swingtop growler poured into Founders snifter. Thanks to DeanoMac for this one.
On tap poured into a nonic glass. Beer is a clear orange color with no head with the glass filled to the top. A few bubbles here and there. 
On tap at Russian River. 
"pours a golden orange, thick white head, lacing down the sides."
"Thanks, Jeff!"
"It pours a crystalline gold with tight, white foam. The foam lingers, slowly compacting as it rests."
2L growler purchased at the brewery yesterday. Poured into a pint glass.
Served in a pint glass at the brewery. 
Purchased this growler at RR just 3 hours ago. This batch is listed at 6.81% ABV. Served in a pint glass.
Cracked this growler open on a random Sunday at Sean's.
Growler from Alex...not sure exactly where my review went. From notes. 
"Straw/light yellow colored brew with a bright white foamy head. Great citrus smells with pineapple and grapefruit leading the charge. Slight malt in the background. Very tart and bitter taste. No sweetness to be found. Very different from the aroma. Dry mouthfeel. Though this is quite bitter, it is still a relatively easy drink. Overall I wanted to be more impressed than I was. Still a nice offering and worth seeking out."
"light orange color, smooth mouthfeel, great hop aroma, sour tasting, light on the palate, slightly oily, bitter hop finish, medium-length finish, nice compact carbonation that stays active throughout the drink. would drink this again although i prefer some of their other offerings over this one-off."
"I had this a couple of times in 2010, both on tap and out of a growler. "
On tap at the Russian River brewery after a MTB ride at Annadel State Park.
"Epic handbottle from Devon I believe. Pours a dark gold with a frothy white head. Thank heavens for carbonating caps. Orange creamsicle aroma with nice mango fragrances and vanilla, maybe some grapefruit. Sweet hop flavors of orange and pineapple that fade into an almost tannic tea leaf note with bitter grapefruit. Fits the mold of all the great IPAs: derives its sweetness from hops, not malt. Nice resiny finish with plenty of bitterness to pad the drinkability, which is already dangerous. A great beer that I'd love to have fresh."
"Nothing quite goes with quantum mechanics like Hopfather, yet another RR IPA that I feel lucky to be able to try. Thank you, Chris."
"Pours a half finger of light tan head over an orange golden liquid. Smells hoppy lemon, rich orange zest and pith, hay, fresh hops, baby aspirin, pine, and mint."
"Had this at the brewery on 2010-08-22 in Santa Rosa, CA"
"Beer poured from a growler into a shaker pint glass. Beer is amber to orange and mostly clear. Despite this being a growler, the carbonation is spot on, great head, steady moderate carbonation of medium / small bubbles that rise through the beer feeding the white head of small and medium bubbles that leaves moderate lacing on the glass. Looks good."
"Thanks to Alex for shipping this from RR and Sean for sharing...Pours with little carbonation as the growler didn't hold well sadly. The beer is a really nice light peach color...The aroma is pretty nice, light pineapple on the front with lots of resin on the back. Sticky thick pine hops...The taste is really nice dumping some of the hops, thankfully as isn't isn't a dipa or have that high of an abv. All the RR ipa's are very similar, almost like the same base is used everytime, just boil the hops different times."
Yet another growler shared by drabmuh. Thanks Matt! 
08/13/2010 - 08/15/2010
9th on my tasting list at the Bistro 13th IPA festival.
I had this at Russian River Brewery today for my birthday and got a growler to bring home and had some from the growler.
"Draught at the Bistro IPA fest. Clear straw with a sticky head. Huge fruity aroma with grapefruit, mangos and peaches. Soft and rounded with lots of fruit in the flavor. Dry and light in the malt department, with a light body. The flavor is almost pure fruity hops, with no harshness or obtrusive bitterness. Not really like their other IPAs, and maybe only similar to sculpin in its profile. The spec sheet said 72 IBUs, but the bitterness is so smooth that you hardly even notice it. The amarillo hops add a really nice dimension to the aroma, with the mango and peach components coming through over the more citric notes you might expect from the cascade and centennial that are also used. Definitely another standout addition to the RR IPA lineup, and a unique one. Probably tied with Kern River for the best IPA of the festival."
"1st beer off a new keg at the brewpub. Tastes somewhere between Russian River IPA and Pliny the Elder. Pours golden with a thin, silky head that fades rapidly but leaves almost a continous sheet of lacing on the glass as the beer disappears. Smells fresh, and very herbal with some nice citrus creeping in. Notes of dill, some tanginess akin to yogurt, and a touch of earth and pine. Thinner style with not much malt prominence. Reminds me a bit of Extreme Hoppiness from Alpine. The taste is also fresh, clean, herbal and citrusy, with some pine that shows up on the finish. The other notes from the aroma are echoed here, but the dill herbalness and tanginess especially continue to build as the beer opens up and warms. The mouthfeel is clean and pure, a with a lot of nuanced bitternesss throughout. Another delightful IPA from Russian River."
"Edit 08/09/2010: The first batch was good, the 2010 batch is phenomenal. Scores updated accordingly."
Big thanks to Robert for breaking this one out at a recent tasting.
On-tap at the Russian River brewpub. Served in a pint glass. Big thanks to Adam (Nanoslug) for driving my wife and I up to check it out.
A: served on tap at rr. Pale yellow/orange. Little head. Transparent (looks filtered)
"Citrusy+piney floral smell similar to other RR ipa's. Somewhere between PtE and RR's regular IPA. Overall solid, not quite as good as pliney but its kind of in a league of its own. Had at IPA festival at the bistro in hayward, ca, for its debut appearance."
On tap at The Bistro IPA Festival
On tap at the brewpub. Poured into a RR pint glass. Comes in at 7.0% and 60 IBUs.
Goofy can but I had to try having enjoyed other beers from this brewery. Glad to see this in Wegmans in southeastern PA. Picked up a 4 pack for $11. Enjoyed one from the can with pizza on a hot summer day. Thought it was delicious. Glad I have three more. Great citrus and pine scent and taste is clearly Citra with nice bitterness. I detect a grape flavor and found it easy to drink. Another winner from Half Acre. Date on can 5/23/18. Enjoying on the east coast in easy July. Love it.
Poured from a 16oz can with a canned on date of 6/11/18; into a pub glass.
Never thought I’d dislike a Half Acre beer... but there’s a first for everything. 
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"
Can dated 5-3-17. DFH Tulip.
"Loved it. Local Chicagoian schooled in hometown IPA's (3 Floyds, Pipeworks, Revoltion, etc.). This is Half Acre's best effort by far."
Thanks goes out to cavedave for this brew.
Beer pours a cloudy orange color with a thick white head. Lots of sticky lacing is left behind as well as a residual thin white layer of foam on top of the beer. 
Pours a slightly hazy amber orange with a lot of white fluffy head.
"Canned 6/2. Hazy, bordering on cloudy, bronzish gold with mild head but pretty constant lacing with some particulates. Strong funky/bitter dank smell with a tart citrus in the background. Taste starts with a bitter dankness followed by a juiciness. Slight citrusy lemon flavor. Very mellow feeling for such a big and bold beer. Very well balanced between the bitter, the juicy, and the dank. One of the best Half Acte beers I've had."
"L - I really have no idea what's going on with the label here, but it sounds like I have a comic book to read. The beer pours a darker copper orange with slight haze. Not much, but I can't see shit through the other side. "
Canned 5/22/17
Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a finger of head. The feature of the nose is the essence of over-ripened fruit. The flavor is plenty hoppy and the grainy character of the Vienna malt really stands out.
"From a 16oz can dated 6/5/17. Pours a golden yellow with a nice head. Wonderful nose of citrus fruits (grapefruit and guava in particular), and a strong, dank palate. Really delicious."
"16 oz can...some stuff is wriiten on the bottom...but it makes no sense...Bright fruity sniff...typical hazed lighter amber, better the decent thicker strands of lacing...super smooth on the old tongue, fresh and fruity, with pineapple, mango, banana notes...simply delicious"
"This poured out as a nice hazy beer with a white head on top. Good lacing as well. The smell of the beer is packed with hops, it smells awesome. The taste is balanced between bitter and sweet but not cloying at all. The feel is really smooth. Overall it's a really solid beer. Worth trying!"
"Wow, I hope to have it again."
A: Poured from the can into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is slightly hazy dark golden/orange with a small off-white head.
Smell: dank and floral. Sweet malts. Orange and peaches.
"L- Pours a slightly hazy, golden orange with a thin, white head and good carbonation."
"Medium gold and reasonably clear body under a coupla fingers of white head; lace trails down the glass as you go... Lots of grain on the nose - very clean and fresh and, well, grain-y smelling - lent a rustic, earthy wholesome vibe to the beer; also present, mild citrusy impressions... The flavors went hand-in-hand with the aromas, bringing citrus to a rather lager-like malt profile - toasty and biscuit-y - really enjoyed the heartiness of the brew - had a rugged, nearly malt-forward vibe with lots of soft citrus splashing around... The body was medium-light-weight, moderately carbonated, and smooth but tangy... Dug it..."
Poured from a 16oz can into a speiglau IPA glass. 
"Poured a hazy golden orange color with just over a fingers worth of foamy white head. The smell jumped out of the can from the second it was opened, full of tropical fruits, pine, and citrus. The flavor follows suit as you get pineapple, candied grapefruit, and some pine to finish it off. The feel is soft and smooth with a light carbonation. Overall this is an outstanding IPA with a good balance of juice and bitterness. Grab one if you see it!"
16 oz can poured into a pub-style pint.
Fresh can poured into fluted snifter.
"Bright golden. A bit of head. A line of lace. Floral, honey, and lime aroma. It doesn't leap outrageously out of the glass. Restrained."
"Simply put, hands down the best IPA I've ever had."
Explosive aroma after opening the 5 day old pint. Pours a pale yellow with very little head and virtually no lacing. Terrific combination of juicy fruits and light piney bitterness. Not surprising..... Another soild beer from Half Acre
"Lemon- straw color with sturdy head and nice lacing. Pleasant, fresh aroma with nice balance of bready malt with spicy, piney hops. Flavor follows. Initial pine and grapefruit hop explosion. Then tropical juice. Next a smooth, grainy malt. Finally, a creamy finish. Perfect medium body and solid carbonation. Pleasant grainy texture. Again, creamy. Very good stuff. Love the balance, layers and dynamic experience."
"Underrated offering from Half Acre. Fruity, not overly bitter, and not as dry as most Half Acre offerings. I'd drink this year round if they made it available as such."
"Had on tap. I love this IPA, just packs so much flavor for not being a dipa. Bright, floral, hoppy, and plenty of fruit and pine to go around. Feel is almost pulpy with hop character. Smells like a summer dream, just delicious."
Wow...this beer had me with my first smell. Lots of tropical fruit and pine. The look is a little hazy with a nice head. The taste follows the smell with just a little bit of bitterness at the end. Nice medium mouth feel. Overall this is an excellent beer and very well done by Half Acre.
Look is a semi transparent golden apricot hue with off white head.
"The crack of the can dated 5/22/17 revealed such a pleasing aroma, I immediately began to salivate. Then I tasted it...mic drop. It's great. Tropical, citrus and tiny pine bitterness delight the palate and nose. Drink it if you can (pun intended). Cheers!"
Smells really good. Lot of tropical fruit and some citrus. Solid bitterness. Yes.
"16oz can dated ""TO THE MOON 5/22/17"""
"BHA 2017 has a great hops smell, cloudy golden look and a nice hoppy taste that doesn't have as bitter of a finish you might expect."
Canned 5/23/18; drank 6/16/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"On tap: poured into a chalice, color is light orange/opaque gold; head is off white wig fine bubbles."
"Bomber. Pours hazy light orange color, finger white head with great retention and lacing. Tropical fruity aroma. Taste is tropical as well, fruity wit a little citrus and a light cracker malt backbone for sweetness. Grapefruit and pine come out in the finish. Medium soft slick mouthfeel. Excellent IPA by Half Acre, the best I've had by them so far."
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bottle on June 19, 2016."
Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a fluffy head that leaves some dots of lacing .
"BHA pours a vibrant, light yellow-orange color, slightly hazed, with a fat finger of sudsy white head. The head lasts quite a while before leaving strong lacing."
"22 oz. bottle, no bottled on date that i can see. Released mid-2016. Interesting label art on this one. This beer sold out almost instantly at my local bottle shop (i managed to get the last bottle), so let's see what all the hype is about."
"Deep yellow-ish gold in color, fairly clear. Poured from a bomber, I've heard some tap versions have been hazier. Two fingers of white foam, retention is OK. Fantastic, hop forward nose. Citrus, tropical fruit. The taste follows, hop forward, with tropical fruits first. Bready malt makes a nicely balanced beer and a slight spiciness lingers. The body is medium-light with moderate carbonation. Finish is balanced and only slightly bitter. Excellent citra poweredIPA."
"Acquired from Bottles and Cans in beautiful Chicago, IL. Drank out of a Toppling Goliath King Sue teku."
"Pours a beautiful, slightly hazy, bright sun burst golden orange with a two finger head of plump foam."
This ones been sitting a little so the boozy notes are more present than in a fresh batch. First sip is boozy with lots of grapefruit peal. Pours a hazy orange with a nice head. I also get a lot of hop resin with this one. Great beer.
"On tap, poured into a snifter. The aroma is sweet grapefruit with a light, but noticeable herb spice. It pours clear amber orange with white soft soap head that leaves a wispy surface and a moderate light ring. The taste is a balanced medium high bittersweet. The texture is oily with a soft, fizzy carbonation and a medium full body flavored with citrus, grains, and herbs. It's finish is crisp with a citrus swell and a waxy and bready touch. It's also a bit soapy and grassy in feel and leads to an aftertaste that's lightly bitter and waxy with a flavor of toasted bread."
A fine offering from Half Acre. Pours a hazy golden/yellow hued with a generous head. Citrus and tropical notes on the nose. Heavy hop profile - the citra hops shine here with a dankness and bitterness really coming together in perfect union. Assertive malt backbone makes this an uncompromising IPA from Half Acre. Top notch.
"Pours a golden yellow with big pillowy white head. Nice lacing. Smell is clean with mellow hops, lemon, with sweeter hard candy notes. Taste a mellow citus, bready, light melon rind, banana towards the end (guessing torrified wheat mixed in), with little bitter residual. Body is light and easy going, perfect for summer. This has to be the most interesting Half Acre ale I've tried as you try to dissect the different eliminates. Super clean and refreshing overall."
"On-tap at Timothy O'Toole's, Chicago:"
"Lovely looking pale brew, topped by a lively white head. Aroma promises plenty of juicy, citrusy hops, along with a hint of dank herbs."
"I could smell this beer right when the bartender brought it up to me. Before I even took a sip, an explosion of tropical fruit and citrus!! Hops everywhere!! This is one of the best beers I've ever had and I tried Founders KBS right before it!! Try it if you can, Half Acre and the Chicago craft scene does it once again!!"
"A bit catty for me - well made, but hop profile doesn't do the rest of the beer justice. Too astringent and dank and without balance."
another super solid effort from Half Acre- Not as good as fresh DDC IMO but very good
Great bitterness and sweetness blend and a nice citrus and fruity bite from the Citra hop make this beer amazing
Hazy gold orange. White head with a lot of lace. A big amount of orange cotrus. Lemon zest. Bready malts. It's fairly juicy. Earthy and floral. Nice bitterness.
As good as it gets great nose great color great taste A+
"Pours a hazy gold with a thick white head that lingers for a while. Decent lacing. Big citrus on the nose with hints of dank and earthiness. Honey sweetness on the front of the palate then lots of grass, melon, citrus, and a finish that shifts to biscuit. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, an outstanding IPA and a fantastic showcase for the Citra hop."
Incredible balance and smoothness to this 7% IPA. Major hints of grapefruit and melon Including the requisite hop profile yet far from overwhelming or too filling. Love the light orange color and the white head with moderate lacing. An excellent beer.
"This was poured from a can that was thrown in as an extra by my favorite trader. Have been hearing excellent things about this beer and wanted to give it a shot, myself. Besides, who wouldn't go for a Citra-hopped IPA? It's a month old, so we'll see how it's held up. Poured from the can into a tulip glass."
"Poured from 16 oz can to glasses and shared on the deck on a warm evening. It's a hazy bright orange-yellow with pure white head that slowly fades. The nose is pure bliss - big citra tropical fruits - mango, passion fruit, pineapple, followed by a hint of sweet pale malt. Taste is fantastic - some dankness, lots of fruit, a little bit of pine, and a nicely sweet malt backbone. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy, average carbonation, pretty much perfect. Overall, this is one fantastic American IPA. How do I get more?"
Poured from the 16 oz can into a large tulip.
"OK, so, I loved this. This is my dream beer, I would drink it every day if I could, in quantity, so yeah, perfect 5. Here’s what I can tell you about it, from the 2014 canned version, poured into a wide-mouthed glass. This batch is much better than the last batch (last year, I think): Smells of strong citrus, pine and an aroma I can only describe as ""sweet"", like smelling a sour fruit candy -- it smells sweet but you know it’s both sweet and sour. It pours a radiant golden orange. Very hazy, intimidating, and inviting, if you’re into cloudy beers and such. I am... The taste/palate must be spoken of together. There’s enough carbonation to hit the right fizzy expectations, which lifts the intense but balanced strong citrus and light bready tastes, with a punch of alcohol you feel rather than taste. An amazing melding of hops, malt and alcohol. I can’t tell where the tastes begin and end, from the zigzag different citrus flavors to the malt sweetness and a savory flavor I can’t describe. I can taste the beer an hour later, and that’s a good thing. It’s like Zombie Dust, but made with love and not hate, and more alcohol. Perfect. I hope it becomes a regular offering when the new expansion (BEHIND MY HOUSE!!!!) is fully operational. I heard it’s a 100% Citra hop beer, so I doubt it will be available all year, but maybe more often? And yes, there’s a Star Wars reference here."
Had this stupendously good beer at the Half Acre Tap Room. Pours a beautiful golden orange. Strong scent of grapefruit and lemon. Taste is similar but much more intense. Body is medium and after a day of golf and mowing the lawn this beer went down oh so smoothly. Just wish I could take some home with me.
June 2014 release on tap at Half-Acre.
On-tap at Half Acre on numerous occasions. Also had a few bottles. Served in a pint glass.
Thanks to Robbie for this bottle! 
"A - Has the look of bright peach-orange juice, incredibly hazy and opaque (juice-like). Near half finger of essentially white head, solid lacing, poor retention."
Bottle shared by oline73. Thanks Steve.
The pour produces a smallish white head with some lacing. The color s hazy straw with honey and orange highlights.
"Enjoyed one of these last night thanks to my man totalbangover, who threw this bomber in as an extra...and what an extra it was! He was raving about this beer as all he drank while at the HA taproom and I can see/taste why."
"From: Gifted by my brother for my birthday, from Half Acre itself"
Bottle (2013)
A - Orange with a slight white head. Relatively clear.
"Appearance: golden, sunny, hints of orange, rocky bone white head."
650 mL bottle poured into a snifter. 
"22oz bomber from jermy in the recent pipeworks box. This was an afterthought on the trade ""hey, you want me to add a God Hates Astronauts?"" Yes. And thanks."
"650ml bottle, poured into a Half Acre SquidOwl Willibecher glass. "

"Hazy saturated orange, lazy rising carb trails, an initial finger of dense white foam. Lasting skim and a frothy collar around the edges. Spindly webs of lace in the glass."
"About my favorite citra-hopped beer, and one of the few beers I not only buy at its limited yearly release, but I also buy multiple. I'm a huge DIPA guy, and this is the only non-DIPA on my list of best pale ales."
22 oz bottle a little over 1 week fresh poured into a HA glass.
"Enjoyed on tap at the brewery, out of the cask with extra citra hops added (Gnarled Winslow) and out of the bottle. This review is of the bottle version."
This is the best beer ive ever had. Perfect amount of citrus and mouthfeel. ABV is a perfect amount for me as I find beers over 7% to be boozy and not enjoyable to actually drink. DEAR CALUSA - make this your flagship and not focus. Much more drinkable and flavorful!
Hazy though not as hazy as Focus.
Hazy IPA packed with citrus and hops. Juice bomb!
"On-tap at Caluso Brewing, Sarasota, FL"
"Oooh Citra don't fail me now! The IPA of Calusa is chocked full of the stuff. So juicy, radiant and seemingly dripping from the branch, but the tantalizing taste of oranges is just the beginning."
Solid all around IPA
Yummy
Dank! Dank! Dank Citra Hops! Nuff said! Killer beer that stands up to NE offerings such as Tree House Julius. You can smell this beer from a mile away. Awesome!
This beer can stand up to the offerings of the NE breweries. I have not reviewed a beer in several years. I feel that I have to take the time to do so here. 
A fantastic hazy/NE style IPA. Incredibly drinkable and juicy with overwhelming Citra flavor. 
"Pours a cloudy bright yellow color with white head. Citrus, lots of citrus on the nose, with some other light fruits, pineapple and mango, as well as a little pine; follows onto the palate. Medium bodied. Finishes with more citrus fruit and a light pine note."
"This is Citra (Hopped on the High Seas) clone and I am so happy to have found it! Color is more yellow and cloudy, but this tastes so much like I remember that Cigar City ""one-off"" that I can't believe it! I don't get the NE style taste at all, but who cares! This beer is pure Florida/island, citrus, sunshine in a glass! The best part is that, unlike that stupendous entry by Cigar City, Calusa Brewing hasn't forgotten how to make it. Congrats, Calusa. Major WOW!!!"
"A: A beautiful, hazy beer with a golden, straw appearance."
This is seriously the summer beer I've been waiting for from Florida.
Looks like a glass of morning orange juice given the haze and hue. Scent gives off a lot of grapefruit and tangerine. The bitterness is perfectly balanced and the oats give it a silky smooth feel. Very tasty and juicy. So drinkable it's scary.
"A: this beer looks beautiful. Light straw color, hazy but not so turbid that it looks like chicken broth. Clean white head and great retention that sticks around the entire glass. Perfect."
Citronious can hang with the best of the New England style IPA's. A single hopped unfiltered and hazy IPA is easily in the realm of tree house and trillium. Extremely drinkable and deliciously juicy; it is now my go to IPA.
"A: Straw Colored with light orange hue. Sticky bone white head. Decent retention. Ultra hazy, no yeast sediment"
"Straw colored liquid, hazy with a white head if great duration. Good lace left behind."
"Had on tap at PCBP. Excellent beer. Full NEIPA flavor (Citra and Mosaic in this case) with all th juiciness and citrus. Unsure but Vermont yeast seems to really bring it all together. Big malt backbone. A little bright on the carbonation, but I just like my beers closer to foam natural carbonation."
"Dank and delicious. Look is mostly clear with not a ton of lacing, but everything else about this beer is incredible. I drank this after Mass Riot and they are very different beers but equally delicious."
"This beer pours a golden orange amber color with a two finger, foamy white head. Retention is great as I had a one finger cap for the duration of the beer."
One of the best beers I have had in a while. Ben (the brewer at PC) continues to create outstanding beers. This may be his best yet.
"L - A mixture of dull orange and bright yellow. Not quite straw but the color of freshly blended bananas. Unfiltered, turbid, hazy etc etc. No light passes through. Completely opaque. Frothy white head."
"Pours a foggy golden. Good aromatics. A great combo of tropical fruit and grapefruit. A little bit of bite, but no burn like hoppy beers on the old profile have seemed to have."
Excellent beer in all phases. Tastes and smells like original Pseudo Sue when it was growler only on draft in Decorah. Similar full on citra hop profile. Refreshing but full bodied IPA. Huge citrus nose with a hint of melon.
Really hazy orange color with off-white head. Aroma has sweet vanilla notes and juicy hops. Taste is sweet and hoppy with juicy tropical notes and low bitterness.
"16 oz. can. Pours murky orange with a tan head. Even the foam looks murky. Smells of orange and lots of fruit. Mango and papaya and all that. Earthy notes behind it and a tinge of cat piss. Tastes of sweet pale malt, orange, and strong papaya. A bit of bitterness and that earthy flavor kicks in in the back end. Medium body and even a little chewy. Something kinda funny about this one. I think I enjoy it, but I'm not all that enthused."
Growler from the source. 
"Pours a hazy bold orange with a two finger head. Smells of citrus juice, rain water, and a little peppery. Taste is sweet juice, pineapple and mango, into a light subdued bitterness. Leaves behind the same initial juice blast that it starts with. Feel is smooth, drinkable and approachable. Overall, a very nice Trillium IPA. Hope they brew it again."
Appearance: Murky / turbid golden orange body. Thick bone white head. 
"The beer pours a hazy orange with a big white fluffy head. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of orange, lemon, cantaloupe, and melon. It tastes of orange, lemon, cantaloupe, and melon. It has a full body with subdued bitterness. A good IPA from trillium."
"The Permutation #38 pours an eggy yellow with not much of a head, and its citrusy smell only slightly more of a creamsicle than the creamier #39. It tastes like soft tangerine layered with delicate hops, a fluffy beer that still manages to tread the fine line between bitter and sugary well. Its soft consistency is almost unparalleled among beers, without it feeling particularly thick or heavy."
"Dated 5/16/18 on the bottom of the can, 8 days since brewing."
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Canton, MA"
Another home run from them. This new yeast really is able to get the most flavor from these hops and then Intensifies it. It’s just an orange blast to the face
Poured from a growler into a tulip glass.
Poured into a Sam Adams glass.
16 oz. canned on 05/16/18
"A lighter, let’s say, summer version of PtE that’s cut from the same cloth. Absolutely worth the effort to try."
Served on tap in a conical pint glass at Toronado Bar in San Francisco. Purchase to contrast with Pliny the Elder.
Shimmering burnt gold with a thick off-white foam that leaves drooping curtains of lace all over the glass.
"Bottled today, classic 510ml bottle."
This is about the most traditional/classic west coast IPA as one can find. Piney and Floral and a moderate to heavy bitter finish. A little to heavy on the pine and bitterness for me but I respect this for a very well made beer.
Pours from the bottle a beautiful clear gold with a foamy white head that leaves lots of lace. 
"Appearance: pours a clear, dark straw color with a one finger, creamy, soft head that leaves a heavy residue of lacing."
"To me, this is just an awesome IPA and, to a degree I prefer it over it's infamous DIPA brother. It's an easier drinker and the hop balance is just perfect."
"Had on draft last week at Monk's in Philadelphia for about eight dollars. This is my second beer from this brewery. This is a very solid west-coast IPA, would love to try again."
"Had it on tap in Manhattan Beach California. Pours a straw color with a little foamy head that leaves nice lacing. This is a fairly light and crisp IPA, not the most interesting I’ve ever had, but clean and well done. The nose is not overpowering but consists of nice fresh hops with citrus, tropical herbal notes. Pineapple, mango, and other tropicals along with grapefruit peel and pine come through on the taste. I found it unexpectedly better. Others may not think it is so bitter; for me, 100 ibu doesn’t taste so bitter when balanced against heavy malt. In a lighter beer with a lower malt bill, even 50 ibu can seem like a lot. Such is the case here. It certainly grew on me by the end of the pint and I could see the relationship to Pliny the elder. I will look for it again!"
"Pours a clear dark golden straw color with thick white head dissipating into bubbly lacing. Nose is mild hops and sweet malt. Taste follows with mild piney hops, more malt backbone and slight bitterness. This is classic west coast IPA ,balanced and delicious.Not too hoppy , not too much alcohol. Maybe the bar for which to judge all others."
"Long-lasting, West Coast pine taste that doesn't quit. Simpler than the Plinys, but a classic single IPA."
"Draft at Apex. Medium golden, kind of hazy. Small soft, creamy head. Aroma is soft hoop scents, taste erupts with big strong hoppy flavors, dry and tangy. Super well balanced."
"Quite pithy and piney, with contrasting floral notes that provide balance. A classic west coast IPA enjoyed on draft. Glad I had the chance to try this."
"In my amateur opinion, this is the IPA all other IPA’s should strive to be. I make it a point to buy this when I visit the brew pub so that I have it at home. I prefer it to Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger, easily my favorite beer."
"This is a very nice IPA, with lots of character and of an insanely floral aroma and flavor profile. It pours amber with about a finger of foam. The aroma is floral with some mild notes of some unripe apple and pear. The taste is well balanced and features yet more flower notes in the aftertaste. Medium body and decent carbonation. A very nice example of this style."
On tap at Falling Rock TapHouse . Every beer I've had from RR is phenomenal. Highly recommended
"On draft at Slow Hand BBQ in Pleasant Hill, pours clear gold with a small head. Aroma is mildly pleasant pine, floral and hops. Hoppy flavor is bigger than the aroma suggests. Solid light-medium, smooth feel. Overall a great IPA that I'd probably drink more of if it was more readily available."
On draft at Ladyface Alehouse. Can’t believe it’s my first time trying this.
"Aroma: A mild hop presence in the smell with a floral, sweet and slightly fruity presence. "
Bottled 5 weeks ago and tasted alongside a 1-month-old bottle of Pliny
Very good!
Bottled on 3/13/18. Drank from 20oz Sauvin Beer Glass. 
"On tap at Monk's Cafe in Philly, pours clear gold color with a frothy white head that faded real slowly and left very good foamy lacing coating the sides and rings as it went down. "
"On draft at brewery. Awesome amber gold with lacing, massive hop nose with citrus and pine, flavor was the same with good malt backbone to balance. Finishes west coast bitterness. Awesome goodness, truly a blueprint of what an IPA should be and at 6.1% it is not impossible to have more than one of these."
A dry and citrus~y IPA good for any season.
"Head reacted with great enthusiasm upon entering this vessel, as it grew it's off white frothy goodness to fairly huge proportions. Beneath lie a crystal clear pale yellow beer."
Poured from a tall bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip
This is such a fine beer. If you haven't had Blind Pig you need to do what you can to find it. Perfectly balanced and the hops explode with citrusy goodness.
"Pours gold. Thick, medium, white head fades slowly to a cap."
"pretty much perfectly crafted. got in beer trade and am glad i got it - a delight to try it for the first time...would happily fill my fridge with it if a could. great hops up front on the citrusy side, a nice malty backbone, a crisp bitter finish."
Bottle dated 2/21:
"Poured into a pint glass. A crystal-clear golden straw color with a one-finger white head. Great lacing in the glass. Bright aromas: orange, piney earth, and berries. Aggressively bitter in the West Coast style with pine, citrus, scratchy earth, and orange. So well-balanced with a lingering bitterness. A classic IPA."
"Pours a little darker than what I expected from an IPA. Head is white to off white. Nose steeps of the hops that await. 1st taste is amazing, but has a lighter taste than I thought it would. After taste has the bitterness that I have come to love about IPAs."
"Thanks, Jan! Enjoyed a couple bottles dated 1/11. Very excited to get my hands on anything from Russian River let alone this beauty. Perfect interpretation of what's become known as the west coast IPA. Golden orange pour that's neither crystal clear nor hazy. Clean. Lively body speaks to the perfect carbonation. Soft white head that eventually sags and lingers. Aroma of pine, melon, orange zest and grapefruit. Nothing pakalolo-like or overly fruity. Taste is pine, orange, grapefruit, melon with an anchoring bitterness that seals the deal. Drinks ridiculously clean and crisp throughout. Would keep this in the fridge at all times if I could."
"I had this following Elder on tap, so my ratings may be schewed slightly. Solid IPA, but a tad thin and not as hoppy as I had hoped. It is a good beer in its own right, but there are so many great offerings right now that this beer gets lost in the shuffle."
510 mL bottle dated 1/11/17. Thanks to DAN THE MAN for getting it for me. Poured into Belgian ale glass.
This is a great single IPA. It is very smooth and crisp with a lot of great hop flavor that balance this IPA out. I had high expectations for this beer and it did not disappoint. But still not as good as Pliny the Elder in my opinion. But I am biased towards DIPAs so that could be why.
"Had it on tap at Monk's Café in Philadelphia PA. What a treat to have Russian River on the East Coast! As a bonus, I also got to drink Pliny the Elder for comparison."
Bottle poured into snifter
Poured from 510mL bottle into a tulip. Bottled 10/21/16.
I like it slightly more than Pte. Better dinkability.
"Pours a straw orange color with 1 finger white head. Aroma- peach, pine, pineapple. Taste-much of the same. Very calm citrus fruit flavors. Somewhat substantial bitterness. Mouthfeel is refreshing. Overall, this is a quality tasting pale with nice bite of bitterness. (if that's your thing) Would love to try it on draft someday."
Serving: Bottle into a pint
"Got this as a bonus in a beer trade. It was shipped from CA to MA, so out of refrigeration for a little bit. Bottle date was a tad over 2 weeks prior to drinking it."
"Poured in a pint glass. Orange, amber color. The nose is extremely dank, but not much interesting going on besides that. Tastes of piney, resiny hops; albeit not too much different than any other dank IPA in my mind. An excellent, chewy accompaniment to my pizza, but nothing to write home about."
"Amber color, not much head. Smell is slightly alcoholic and earthy. Taste is earthy and bitter and delicious. Body is more light than medium, mild to moderate carbonation. This is good stuff."
"Copper with tons of carbonation, and 3 fingers of sea foam, fluffy, slightly beige head."
"At least as good as Pliny, perhaps even better depending on the batch and on your mood. Earthy, and smoother, with some almost woody notes and a little less bitterness. Very balanced and even more drinkable than Pliny, with a lighter personality (as a single IPA)."
"Russian River Blind Pig IPA pours a clear golden orange color. The head is a half inch of white foam that folds into a quarter inch of lacing that sticks around. The aroma has a very well balanced hop profile. The piney, citrusy, and floral components all marry well together. There is dank grapefruit, pine resin, pitch, flower pot, blood orange, and more dank grapefruit. This is a remarkably complex aroma. The taste is much drier than the aroma leads on. I think it looses a lot of complexity, because of that. There are some nice citrusy notes of tangerine and blood orange, and a little pine. The nice floral notes present in the aroma don't translate into the flavor. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a thin texture, and appropriate carbonation. Overall, I really love this beer's aroma, but only like the beer as a whole. As a lover of dry IPAs I never thought I would one day find one that was too dry for my tastes, but here we have one. Its lack of body is a real detractor for me."
A - nice golden Amber colored clear beer with a. Nice white head that leaves God lacing
"Has the usual yellow and light amber appearance, yellow winning the battle and producing a 3/4"" white head that is impressive with a good amount of clarity. Aroma drops pine and green. Plenty of aromatic Simcoes, usually a bittering hop right? "
"Golden amber in color, foamy, white head with streaky lacing. Mostly clear. The aroma is light citrus and caramel malt. The flavor is citrus, grass, some herbal notes, and malt. This is a well balanced, medium bodied beer with a bit of pine and grapefruit in the aftertaste. Resinous, but smooth. An excellent beer!"
"L: clear gold, with a billowing white head, some lacing "
Bottled 8/3. Consumed 8/15.
On tap at SD Taproom on 07/29/16.
L- Poured a inch of head with lots of carbonation. (Poured from a crowler)
"L: burnished bronze, crystal clear, and decent head. A west coast IPA lurks in that glass."
16.9 oz bottle dated 6/6/16
Bottle Date: 6/6/16
My #1 beer so far as far as taste is concerned. The ABV is a bit too low to have fun with but the beer is immaculate towering above even Pliny for me
"A: Lots of citrusy (grapefruit), slight pine and resin, coupled with a moderate malt sweetness. "
Pours a filtered golden color with 1 finger of a well-retained head. Great lacing.
This one pours a nice Amber color with a white frothy head and good lacing. The smell is slightly citrus and tropical with a hint of floral mixed in there. The flavor starts with some citrus and pine and ends with a slight peppery finish. The balance of malt and hops isn't as good as Pliny and mouthfeel is a little lighter than Pliny as well. This is a very good beer but if I had my druthers I would always take the Pliny first.
L: Beautiful gold color with a frothy head that slowly dissipates with lacing all over the glass.
Good looking color - dull golden. Little on the nose. Low carbonation. Pepper and tobacco on the hops - don't get west coast on this one. May have blasted my pallet on a previous beer.
Pint from the brewery
"Had on tap, looks a lot like Pliny the Elder: pale gold and pretty clear, with a finger or so of bright white head that leaves tons of lacing. Smells like pine and grapefruit, and tastes the same. Feel is medium. Overall, this is just a killer IPA. I had it alongside Pliny, and thought this would be a dialed-down version of the Elder. However, it was kind of the opposite: where Pliny seemed muted and restrained, this one was bursting with hop flavor. Terrific stuff!"
Pours rusty amber/orange with a thin white head. 
Sitting on the East Coast drinking a freshly bottled West Coast...
Best Beer Ever
"Depending on your preference or for me, which type of beer I am looking for at the moment, I would put this equal to PtElder. If you have a chance try both Pliny and Blind Pig before buying your case, probably want to go 50/50 (or buy a case of each)."
"Just an outstanding classic west coast style IPA. Tons of pine and citrus in flavor and aroma, and super easy to drink. Put me with the group that prefers over PtE. Cheers!"
Lot's of citrus on the nose and back end. Pretty damn good...looking forward to trying more from these guys. Round mouthfeel with decent amount of carbonation.
Pours a lift Amber color. Aroma has notes of citrus. Flavor is citrusy with a little pine and is pretty well balanced. Overall very nice IPA with good flavor.
A - A huge very thick head that holds well for over a minute. Clear light amber color with only minimal bubbles.
"I feel like I am giving the blind pig a low score. Its a very good IPA and I always get one when I'm at the brewery but, after having one next to other notable IPAs Im gonna have to say theres other beers i would get before this. Theres nothing wrong with the blind pig big, its a got a great orange/light look to it. Looks like a lot of other IPA's out there. I think I would have given this beer a better score if it didn't have deep bitter taste as the other IPAs i was having that day. (Bells two hearted) I still love this beer and would know doubt get it if i saw it on tap"
"Look - Like a pilsner with a hint of orange tint"""
A very grassy IPA.
Fresh bottle poured into snifter.
Under rated IPA
"Haven't had it in ages so I'll have to do a second review later, "
Look - A nice looking bright golden type color. Clear in appearance 
From Untappd.
This is a really excellent beer. Very well balance. Glad I had one.
"In my opinion, this does not fall far behind PtE, and I'd consider this a great substitute if you're having trouble locating any Pliny. It's got that great west coast bitterness, loaded with hop aroma and taste, tropical fruit essence, and a dank mouthfeel."
"On tap at Monk's in Philly. Pint glass arrives with a half finger of foam. Clear orange color. Aroma is awesome with grapefruit, orange, pineapple dominating. "
Poured from a 510ml bottle into a Speiglau IPA glass. 
"Bottled 12/01/15, bought at the brewery."
"Pint bottle. Clean bright golden orange, thin white head. Citrus peel n pine aroma. Front end taste is citrus with clean malt sweetness. The back end bitterness is the dominant flavor though, grapefruit peel and piney resin. Silky soft mouthfeel. Delicious bitter IPA."
On tap at Monk's Cafe. 
"A quintessential resiny bitter west coast IPA. Filtered to be perfectly translucent, fairly rich in color with some amber highlights. Pine and citrus peel on the nose, flavors are somewhat dank and a good bit of caramel malt. The alpha acids came through in the finished beer in a big way. For a 6%ish IPA you will get your money's worth of IBUs here. West coast IPA fans will be in love."
"Allegedly, this is the little brother of PtE, yet it falls short. It's not bad by any stretch, yet it's not on the level of many IPAs that are more readily accessible. I'm not a fan of clear beers that leave minimal lacing, so my score reflects it. Hints, and I mean hints, of citrus in the nose are overwhelmed by grass and distant pine. The taste offers faint orange peel and forest sap. Some lingering soapiness on the back end. Seriously, this just isn't as balanced as I would prefer, nor is there an overwhelming aspect of it that raises it above any of its flaws. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but not something I would grab were it readily available."
"Very clear, well balanced"
"Dark orange with foamy white head and huge lacing. Citrus on the nose, mostly grapefruit, with a little sweet malt in the back. Unexpectedly light tasting in comparison to the dark color. Well balanced with malt, hop flavor and bitterness. Light bodied and slaty flat feeling."
Poured from bottle purchased at RRBC. Pours a nice orange color. Good carbonation and medium white head. Smells of good malt and delicious hops. Taste is medium bitterness and awesome hop flavor lingering. Very smooth mouthfeel and goes down very easy. I could drink this every day if supply allows. Very good hop forward IPA.
"Near perfect IPA. Balanced, great hops overlays solid malt without excess sweet or alcohol. I would drink this every day if it were available in the east."
Received as a gift from @csp0380 – thanks!
Had on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia.
I think this is better than Pliny.
Blind Pig was awesome....sometimes it pays to trick or treat at a neighbors house that just got back from California!!! YEEEE HAW! It was perfectly balanced with notes of pine and orange peel citrus. It poured a copperish with white head and wonderful lace. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall....YUMMY!
Bottle date 10/19/2015.
"I had a pint of this beer at their brewpub. It had an great color, great head and incredible aroma. The taste was complex and awesome. Highly recommended!"
Finally was able to get a bottle in a trade. Got a Bling Pig and a Pliny so got to try them side by side. Bottles were two weeks old.
"Bottled 10/1. Drank 23 days later, and I'm hoping it hadn't fallen off too hard already. I only say that because it seems to be missing just that zing I'm expecting on the back end. Strong hoppy nose and taste combines with mild bitterness, slight juicy feel. I guess I'm being unfair and not meeting this one on its own terms, because I had a Pliny last night and that just seems to have the ""total package"" Blind Pig lacks for some reason. I don't know – maybe it's that Pliny has a higher ABV."
"Always like this beer. It's a nice mix of Midwest, and west coast. A bit bitter and piny, but not sharp. A bit malty, but not too sweet. Great easy drinker, especially fresh."
I think its better than Pliny the elder.
"Really good IPA. I have heard a few people say they prefer this to Pliny and thiugh each to his own I disagree. However, it's still excellent in its own right. A little more dry than Pliny overall and maybe just a tiny bit hoppier overall. Put it this way, I would never turn this beer or Pliny down"
"Transparent golden color, one finger off white head"
Serving Type: Bottle (dated 10.1.15)
This bottle is almost two months old at the time of review. The beer comes in an amber color. There isn't much aroma. A little bit of malt and pine. The taste is a pretty standard west coast malt character with some great hop flavor coming through. I think I would enjoy a fresher bottle more.
Received two bottles in a West Coast to East Coast trade. 
Slammable!
I loved this beer got this sent to me in a 22oz. Poured good taste was great I think this is the best beer from Russian River. Wish I could get it more out here in NJ.
Not strong or taste filled but hits the spot. Very good
On tap at Toronado San Francisco
Amazing
"Total classic, and I kinda love that the taste is ""classic IPA"" in nature -- piney bitterness in this one. Very floral. Some caramel sweetness as well that pokes through, but the story here is that piney bitterness that sits on the back of your tongue well through the last gulp. Nose is nice, pine, caramel, some faint citrus and a light herbal/earthy character."
"A very approachable IPA for amount of hop it carries, with lots of depth of flavour and a very dry finish."
"I really liked this beer and it certainly lived up to the hype. I am not one of the people who thinks this beer is better than Pliny, but this was still an awesome beer."
510 ml bottled on 082615. Exactly two weeks old.
On tap:
One of my favorite IPA's. 
Bottle 8/10 poured into a sniffer on 9/4
"Ok.. Russian does outstanding beers period, but this one did not live up to the hype.. Plenty of bitterness and quite hoppy made it a little unbalanced for me, still an exceptional beer which I'll try any day of the week..good IPA RR!"
"RR knows their IPA's and this one is done just as well as thier flaghip Pliny. Very smooth and easy drinking. Coppery coloring, fresh hops with both citrus and pine. Excited to dive into the 6 pack I just got from RR."
"A very tasty and easy to drink brew from Russian River. I was expecting a little more but I didn't get it. This beer seems like it is a little brother to Pliny the Elder.,I still would have another one and I would recommend you try it for yourself. If someone offered one to me I would not turn it down!!"
"Blind Pig on draft is a very exciting experience. I find it very smooth with subtle tropical fruit flavors with a big hoppy finish that lingers for some time. Carbonation seems to be middle of the road and the head dissipates almost immediately. Other than that, I love this beer and will walk miles, once a week, to savor a pint or two at a very fortunate bar."
"On tap at Monk’s cafe, Philly. Pours deep golden with fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, tropical fruit and bready malt. Body is full and tangy. Citrusy hops dominate the palate, while bready malt and ripe fruit provide support. Finish is long and dry. Excellent brew."
Pours a orange almost red hue with a off white head that disappears pretty quickly. The lacing on this is really nice and wraps the inside of your glass all the way down. Lots of pine and a bit of citrus. Not overly bitter and very well balanced. A top notch IPA.
16oz Bottle Dated 072715
"Solid American IPA, but with so many fantastic ones out there, it gets lost somewhere in the top half."
Love this beer. As much as Pliny especially after they tweaked the hops in Pliny. Aroma is floral and crisp and fresh. Taste is also crisp with notes of berry and citrus. Not unpleasantly bitter at the end. Beautiful golden color and creamy head.
"7/26...on tap at Monk's. Bright copper, low foam, but full lid. Spicy pine nose. Citrus too. Powerful balanced hop cuts through a malty base, grapefruit, pine abounds. Bitter stays with you. Delicious."
Growler poured into Russian River Chalice
"Poured into my tulip glass, I might actually like this IPA better than Pliny (The Elder). I know: that sounds ridiculous given the rankings. Pliny is more of a hop bomb, though, and this saps your tongue and tastebuds of their capacity to taste the more nuanced flavors of this amazing brew. Blind Pig, on the other hand, is hop-forward but is not overpowering in bitterness or pine. There is an amazing balance in this brew between green pine, caramel nuttiness, and fresh tropical fruit. Of the citrus, grapefruit and lemon are most notable (in smell and taste). As opposed to Pliny TE, I could drink this all day long… and at 6.1% above, I just might."
If you like IPA this is a great tasting beer for you. Balanced hop and citrus flavors that goes down smoothly. Smell has a hint of grapefruit and floral hops.
Look 8/10
"This IPA is average at best. It's good, not great. I don't understand the hype and people falling over themselves to get it. I'm sure it's because of the lack of accessibility outside of California or simply because it's a Russian River brew. Either way, I'd pass on this any day over Pliny. There are far more better IPAs out there that the average Joe can pick up at their local beer store or super market. So in summary, don't believe the hype on this one."
L: Pours orange tinted gold under a fairly persistent clingy 2” white foam cap. 
Pours golden with an inch head. Aroma is hoppy with notes of pine and citrus. Taste is smooth and crisp with balanced malt and bitterness. Happiness is just right and a slight sweetness. Nice mouth feel. Extremely tasty IPA that is underrated because of its shadow to Pliny.
6/16/16 bottle poured to tulip
"This is a really well balanced IPA from Russian River. A slightly honeyed, sweet ale with decent bitterness that keeps everything in check. Bright hops with a citrus note evident. Very drinkable!"
Via Trade with Michael B. Thank you so much I really enjoyed this. juicy balanced IPA from RR.
Pours a clear golden color with a three finger head. Wonderful pour. Head dissipates quickly leaving a little lacing and a quarter inch foam. 
This is an exceptional IPA. I actually prefer it over Pliny.
First time I had this I thought it was no good. I had no idea what I was tasting. Looked at the date and it was old.. finally grabbed a fresh one..in blown. This is one of the best ipa I've ever had
"Golden in color, not as much citrus as other out there. Can really taste the pine. Overall, very nice"
"IMO, a better offering than Pliny"
Typical IPA. Well balanced and very drinkable. Nothing out of the ordinary though. I was expecting more depth...
Good. Tried after a couple other beers and 2 Pliny's. A very good IPA but hard to judge after Pliny.
"Edges out Pliny, very solid beer"
Mouth feel is thin due to low ABV (not a complaint). I like this because you can drank more than one!
So dam good. Oh man they would only me by 6 of these to go when I went to rr.love it
A clear orange beer with a fluffy white head that leaves sticky lacing everywhere. The aroma is a big hit of pine with some sweetness and floral notes. The taste is tons of citrus with a bunch of pine. This is a really nice balanced and tasty beer.
"Pretty GD good. Very well balanced, glad I could try it."
A really tasty beer. I get a citrus and pine in the nose and the body is well balanced with the bitterness. It pours a nice golden color and finishes slightly dry. Really drinakble IPA from Russian River.
This is the stuff- even better now that it's draft only. Lots of citrus
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Great beer had it at the brewery and just a great IPA
Had in San ramon. Light colored. Hoppy. Great flavor.
"Pale amber (SRM 9) with thick white head; copious lace; great clarity and carbonation. Lemon nose with a whiff of grass and pine. Up front, citrusy hop/grass that is mellow pine in the middle; finish leaves a lite bitter hop taste on my tongue. Lite plus mouthfeel. Very tasty lighter IPA; hops are subdued with good balance between bitter and citrus."
"Very good beer. Reminds me more of a pale ale then an IPA, but then again that could be because I did a side by side with Pliny! Def worth a try but not worth the hassle to get. . ."
Not worth all of the fuss. There's hundreds of better beers to worry about getting.
"Bottled 4/16/15. Pine, resin, and grapefruit. Very hop forward but not a hop bomb. Lots of pine in the nose. Prefer it to the PtE I had last night, but that was was getting little long in the tooth. Would love to do a side by side of fresh BP and fresh PtE"
Perfect on a warm day. Light and refreshing with plenty on citrus aromas and notes and a strong malty piney bite.
"Poured into IPA speiglau. Golden Amber color. SRM ~13. One and a half fingers width of white head. Constant trail of bubbles. Smell was incredible: pine needles, juniper, and grapefruit citrus. Taste was clean and refreshing: crisp beginning with a building of piney bitterness. Punch of grapefruit and hints of orange. Great resurgence of creamy foam upon agitation. Moutfeel was crisp and clean, ultimately refreshing without being too light. Overall, a heavy hitting IPA that stands formidably against most conventional DIPA. Great beer from a great brewery!"
Clear golden-orange color with slightly off-white head. Aroma has the classic west coast hop profile with sweet oranges and also a solid malt backbone. Taste starts with sweet oranges but goes into bitter grapefruit pith territory and lingers on the aftertaste. Medium to light bodied with medium carbonation. A really classic but very well made IPA.
"Poured from a 510ml bottle dated 01/26/15 . Nice golden pour, slight white head but nice lacing.Nice citrus floral nose and a great burst of hops."
I like this one slightly better than Pliny the elder. Slightly less bitter.
"Bottle date 2-28-15, poured into a teku-really great IPA, kind of a perfect representation of the west coast style. Thoroughly enjoyed it, looking forward to more.."
"Pliny light. Looks like PtE, smells like PtE, but doesn't have that ""next level"" flavor profile of Pliny. So damn good though"
Had on tap at Stone Garden's and Bistro in San Diego
A: clear golden yellow. Medium white head
Thanks to Orthodoxkardia for this one.
I would choose this beer over Pliny the Elder.
On tap at Beechwood BBQ in Seal Beach of into shaker pint. Crisp and piney. Good not great.
"Top 3 IPA for me, much smoother and more subtle than Pliny IMO."
I think this is a very average IPA it just really doesn't have a lot of flavor.
Russian River never leave me hanging...always a surprise in the utmost positive...and their old standards are legendary...I miss NorCal...and so should you!
Exceptional flavor that increases the more I drink. Sessionable for sure. Quality ingredients that don't destroy my fragile antibiotic ridden stomach. Lingering flavor that makes me craze another one instantly. 
I thought it was every bit as good as Pliny the Elder.
Poor Blind Pig gets little recognition compared to Pliny. Blind Pig is just as good as Pliny the Elder.
"Light amber with a touch of orange and a big white fluffy head that laces well. Very straightforward nose, it smells like grapefruit. Taste follows with a touch of honey like sweetness and big grapefruit flavor. Simple but very good profile. Nice bright carbonation and a dry finish. This is a great IPA, simple but executed so well."
Best single IPA almost a double well ok a double either way it is great..pineytsr grassiness. Been drinking this since temecula days.
"Very clear, translucent orange-gold with a thin white head."
Got this bad boy from a great west coast BA'er thanks again @wesasmith!
Got this 3 weeks old as a gift from a great friend and fellow BA. Taste was a very crisp hop bitterness that didn't hurt like some IPAs. Not as refreshing as Pliny but very quality. Pours a clear dark orange with bright white head and lacing. Smells of pine and fresh mountain foliage with a hint of citrus hiding. Very refreshing but if given the choice I'd give the nod to Pliny.
A big shout out to Hopasouras for hooking me up with this beer on my first beer trade!
"Had on multiple occasions, which is awesome for PA! Not my favorite, but a solid representation of what an American IPA should be."
My go to everyday beer
I prefer it to Pliny and it seems to be harder to find. A great IPA and I dare say the best example of an IPA I have tasted.
Actually like this equally or better than their Pliny. Depends on the day. But one of the best IPAs out there. Well done!
Love this beer. My favorite from Russian River. It's a must buy... If you can actually find it.
If this was made at a different brewery it would get a lot more love but in the company of Elder and Younger it gets lost sometimes. One of the best single IPA's out there.
Poured from a bottle into a tulip
Pretty hoppy initial taste with a nice malty feel in my cheeks. More enjoyable than alpine duet and Pliny the elder but not as enjoyable as the alpine pure hoppiness.
"Better than Pliny and Heady, for me."
Prototypical IPA. Not so overdone as most are.
On draft at Monk's Cafe in Philly
I was just expecting a lot more from a beer that was coming from Russian River Brewery. It just wasn't for me.....
"Epitome of a West Coast IPA for me, it's hoppy, dry, bitter, but nothing out of proportion, instead everything obviously executed to a precise calculation. And it deserves an extra tip of the hat for extracting such great hop flavor out of a relatively (compared to today's IPAs) small 6.1% ABV. Pliny is great, but this isn't far behind."
"A good runner up to Pliny the Elder. Bitter, full of taste, nice amber color."
This is missing any real taste...
Poured from 510 ml bottle in to pint glass
Very solid!
500 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass
Not quite on the level of the Pliny's but an excellent beer
This beer is great. I think I like this beer better than Pliny. Much better balance of flavor.
My favorite pale ale by a long shot. This brewery can't go wrong.
On tap in a pint glass at Falling Rock Tap House in Denver.
Bottle poured into Russian River nonic pint glass
"Bottle from Lothore, thank you very much Tyler. "
"Pint tumbler pour at Monk's Cafe, Philly."
17.25 ounce bottle poured into a shaker pint glass. 
"Like a toned down version of Pliny The Elder. This is an excellent beer with a great balance of hops and citrus. If I could get this on a regular basis, I would. The difference for me when speaking of Pliny is the pine aroma and taste."
Pliny overshadows how good this beer is.
Great for what it is and what it did to the world of AIPA. Always has been damn good.
Definitely not Pliny but Blind Pig is still an amazing IPA.
It's always tough getting your hands on one of these being that i live in So Cal and this isnt distributed much in my area. I've found a bar in Alhambra that gets this on tap from time to time. Other then that when a friend brings me one of these when they go up north i owe them dinner! lol
Nice and smooth
"the aromas are extremely floral, perfumey and piney. citrus and sweetness with a bitter clean finish on the palate."
"On tap at Teresa's in Wayne, PA."
"Grossly overrated, mediocre IPA at best. Tastes of latex gloves and rubber tennis balls, some notable citrus and pine notes but overall, nothing to write home about. The fact this beer is no longer seeing distro has just elevated the hype to whole new levels."
"A - Crystal clear, gold body. Bright, almost neon, white head with great retention and nice lace."
Bottle received in a trade.
"Consumed relatively fresh. I prefer this beer to Pliney, very underrated to me. Smooth and balanced, not overly malty like PTE. Very light and smooth IPA"
Poured into a snifter
"This brew pours a transparent deep straw color with a one-finger head that dissipates quickly and little lacing. The smell is of subtle grapefruit, pine and peaches. The flavor is juicy grapefruit, peaches and bitter citrus rind, supported by a malty, bready backbone. The mouthfeel is sticky and resiny with a slick finish. Overall, this is addictively good stuff that you dream about, much like other Russian River offerings."
Poured a clear yellow. The head had great retention and left a decent lacing.
"At the brewpub I had the tasty priveledge of drinking this citrus delight. Smelled and tasted like the storage rooms at tropicana juice company. Great clarity, great carbonation, great taste, less filling, where do I stop? This is what all breweries should strive to brew. Once you have one every other beer in the workd is at least a little disappointing. No joke. I am ruined. Until I can get back to Santa Rosa that is."
"Appearance: Poured a darker shade of gold, almost amber. Had a very small head that was gone within minutes."
On tap at the RR Brewpub in Santa Rosa.
"On tap, poured into pint glass"
"A mellow wave of C-Hop grapefruit and citrus rind flavors wade out of the glass, joined by light notes of cracker-y malts and wet pine cones. Whereas all these aromas seem to express themselves quite brutish and forcefully in Pliny, they seem to flow out naturally in its half-strength cousin.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀"
A - Pours a hazy golden copper with a foamy white head. Nice retention and stick all the way down.
Clear golden color with a great white head that last. Slight citrus malt scent. Slightly bitter somewhat citrus hips but with a big malt backbone. Medium body and carbonation. Pretty good but Pliny is better. Had them back to back.
On tap; poured into a pint glass.
510 ml bottle poured into a SN tulip
I've had in bottle and on tap. This is for the bottle poured into tulip glass.
Thanks to R and C for picking this up for me when they went to CA.
A - Pours a beautiful golden color with substantial white foamy head. There is a slight haze.
"I stopped by Russian River last weekend while I was out in the Sonoma valley for a wedding. During the 45 minute wait, I decided to get a Blind Pig and Pliny. "
Was fortunate enough to come across some Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder in a beer trade.
"A: Pours a golden, copper with a thin layer of bubbly foam atop. Carbonation levels look pretty tame. There's a bit of lacing as you drink, but overall it looks to be a bit thin."
"Pours a beautiful golden sunrise orange with a fluffy white head. The head dissipates leaving a generous amount of lacing on the glass. Smells of pine, floral and citrus flavors. The taste is very much the same with some malt flavors in the back end. This goes down very easy and it is very smooth. Not overly bitter, but some bitterness lingers. Overall, a very solid IPA."
"Blind pig is the IPA of IPAs. It is amazing the work Russian river does. I live in SoCal and it is actually harder to find this than Pliny. Every time I get my hands on this beer it never sits in my refrigerator more than two days, and I doubt that it sits anywhere longer than that."
510ml bottle dated 4/3/14 poured into a tulip
Update:
"Big fluffy white head. Slightly hazy, translucent brew: gold and orange straw that easily lets through light sources, shifting its appearance constantly. Lively and bubbly. Excellent head retention and excellent lacing."
"Bottle poured into an IPA glass. Bottled on 4/16, consumed on 4/24"
Bottled 11 days ago. 
My thanks to my friend JohnParadee for this bottle!
Poured from a 16 oz bottle into a DFH IPA glass. Acquired in a trade from kflah41.. thank you so much man!
Acquired from smanrob in a trade. A great trader!
"on tap at Interurban, Portland"
Still another wonderful acquisition from BigStein88. 
"Bottle from the brewery. Bottled 2-24-14 and poured on 3-4-14. Oooh fresh. Pours to my wine glass a mostly clear golden copper color with a very creamy one finger white head on top. Classic grapefruit and pine aroma, some mango and pineapple, more pine and grass. Flavor is sweet tropical fruits behind massive pine bitterness. Resinous mouthfeel, medium carbonation, and extremely smooth. I do see why this is so loved, and it is quite a fantastic IPA with a lot of heft despite the lowish ABV. Good stuff."
"Another ""How the heck have I not reviewed this beer yet"" review."
Had younger and elder on tap multiple times this weekend. I like Blind Pig more. 
The beer is a light clear golden amber color. 
Bottle dated 2/4/14;
Good Googly Moogly!!! Love this!
No finer beer on the planet than Russian Rivers' Blind Pig IPA. 
Just got back from San Francisco with several bottles of different RR brews.
"A: poured from a 510 mL bottle into a pint glass, golden amber colored with a large white head that lingers leaving good lacing, clear"
Poured 510 ml bottle dated 1/16/14 into New Belgium globe
a: hazy golden amber - like amber waves of grain. 2.5 finger solid white head with a bunch of bubbles on top
Bottled exactly 3 weeks ago :)
Poured a 2-week old bottle into a tulip shaped glass.
"Two weeks old, poured into my teku..."
Bottled 1/16/14
growler shipped to me by a friend from San Fran.
1/16/14 bottle date.
"A- Dark golden pour with an incredible lacing. The carbonation resembles champagne with their small, uniform, and consistent bubbles. "
"A; Slightly dark golden color, white head."
A- Crystal clear. Poured a quickly dissipating 1 finger head. Nice lacing. 
"The beer pours a clean, crisp golden color with orange tinges. It forms a head of eggshell white bubbles of a medium size, which sit nicely above the beer at about a half finger’s width. In body, the beer is clean and clear with just a touch of haze. On the nose, the beer smells of big orangey pine. Smooth caramel malt blends over the rich hop aroma, giving a sweet kick to the citrus nose. Touches of grapefruit and citrus rind also make their way into the nose to suggest the more bitter qualities of the beer. The smell is not overly pungent, but is nice and nuanced. On the tongue, the beer tastes nicely bitter with a smooth sweet backbone that brings rich balance to the beer. In terms of Pliny, I feel the bitters more in Blind Pig but I know there are less bitters overall than there were in Pliny… Citric acidity is also found in the taste, and is light and playful on the sides of the cheeks. In flavor, the beer begins as aspirin bitters and then opens into rich, bitter grapefruit and orange. Wisps of toast and caramel dance on the sides of the palate, but this beer is all about the bitters, which are strong yet balanced. The finish is of fresh orange juice with a touch of bitter aspirin and grass. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium with a gently prickly, higher carbonation and a crisp, snappy mouthfeel. It leaves the mouth dry with a light bitter resin and some saliva in the cheeks. Overall, Blind Pig is a great, classic IPA. It is all about the citric bitters, which I really enjoy. Terrific balance is seen here, similarly to Pliny, but in a way that seems to accentuate the bitters more. Head to head with Pliny, I think I liked Pliny more, this is a solid beer with great flavors, but doesn’t really wow me in any way. It drinks like a classic IPA, which it is."
Appearance: Lovely gold-yellow color
Pours a clear golden color. Smell is of citrus and floral and the taste does not disappoint. Balance balance balance. This has become my goto RR hoppy beer. Such a wonderful brew.
Appearance is a golden yellow color with a two finger white head.
"Blind pig, great lacing really impressive and a light bright gold colour. Smell has apricot, funky citrus, so much going on, a bit of rich stone fruit, florals and some tropical fruits. 4.5 t is a smooth dry fruitiness, some. interesting yeast character, hay, a light and crisp profile with minimal citrus juiciness, this has lots of dry earthy and funky fruit notes and hop charcter. Retains some lightness but a really interesting flavor for an ipa 4.5 Mod body and carbonation, has a bit of slickness, really good balance alround 4 excellent ipa, highly recommended."
"Appearance: Nice golden yellow color, good white head, leaves good lacing"
"The beer has a white two-inch foamy head that dissipates quickly and leaves a very white with lacing. The beer is an orange and golden amber that is clear and filtered. Even though the head quickly dissipates, the beer still has some creamy covering. The beer smell has citrus and orange hoppy notes. However, the smell has a bit of lightly roasted malt as its backbone and a hint of pepper as well. The beer taste is very different from the beer smell. The lightly roasted malt backbone is more prominent with a grapefruit hop taste as well as hints of pepper and other mineral taste. The beer has a medium body with clean smooth feel as well as a clean aftertaste feeling. The beer has biting carbonation. A pretty good and unique IPA that I would like to have again."
I was able to grab 4 bottles of this while visiting San Diego and this is the last one. All were bottled 090613. The first 2 we drank a week after bottling. Outstanding!
"Had this straight from the bottle 3 weeks after bottling. Pours orange/golden color with a thick white head. The smell was citrus and very earthy. Taste starts off very clean which turns to hoppy bitterness on the back end. Overall, I consider it a top-notch IPA. I'm not sure it's my favorite IPA, but one that I would definitely have consistently when available."
"This is my favorite IPA. I'm not saying it's the best, but personally, I love it."
"Pours orangey golden with a white head. Aroma is citrus and its rind, floral, grainy, and piney. Flavor is floral, citrus rind, toasted bread, interesting graininess, and pine. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, very nice IPA. While I definitely get why so many people love this beer, I only liked it, personally. Would drink again."
"A: Clear, save for the mess of sediment at the bottom if the bottle. Golden with a tinge of orange. Medium carbonation leaves a small persistent foam ring."
Pours clear golden with thick bubbly white head. Aroma is crisp hoppy floral citrus. Taste is crisp clean hops upfront with a touch of sweet malt and bitter orange peel on the follow through. Aftertaste is lingering bitter citrus and dank piny hops. Palate is clean and a little sticky. Overall very well balanced IPA.
A big thanks to Bob for saving this one for me!

"Bottle from my friend Jim. Thanks, Jim. Pours yellow orange with a beautiful one finger foamy head. A lot of bubbles coming up through the beer. Lots of retention and lacing. The aroma is incredibly intense. Unbelievable. Makes me wonder what I have been drinking all these years that called itself and IPA. I get some pine (Simcoe?) and citrus on the nose. Slight floral accent is there, too. The wonderful thing about this beer is it does not taste like so many hop bombs I have had lately. I would describe the bitterness as medium and just toward the low end for the style. Finish is long and smooth. No harshness, just lingering bitterness. A pleasantly light sweetness balances the bitterness perfectly. The texture of the beer is creamy like the head. Medium body and mouthfeel is lightly tingly. Unlike some beers this beer does not improve as it warms. It is best drank in the first 25 minutes. Overall, a terrific beer. I intended to knock this beer down, because I am sick of all the hype surrounding the brewery. I came away from this beer with incredible respect."
several beers into the RR flight here at the brew house. This beer has all the fine things a good ipa has and can only best be described as fantastic. It is slightly below the best IPA's I have ever had due to the nature of my love for specific hop flavor. do not miss this beer.
"Nice pale gold in color with a great amount of bubbly white head that persists. Lacing also fantastic. Aroma is of grapefruit and sweet/bitter grassy hops. Taste is really good. Subtle sweetness that reminds me of fresh cut St Augustine. The bite of the hops is slight, but well balanced. I'm surprised that this beer is so drinkable. I've killed a full tulip already. Mouthfeel is light, bubbly, and has a nice hop sting. Might have to get a growler of this beer instead of Pliny my next trip to RR."
"If Pliny is their double IPA then Blind Pig is their single/regular IPA. While true Russian River Brewing Company does brew a Russian River IPA as well, I'm of the opinion that Blind Pig was Vinnie's first, and therefore the precursor to Pliny The Elder."
"Pours a light golden with a thick, quickly dissipating white head. The aroma explodes with grass, grapefruit, and flower notes. This is the best smelling IPA I've ever had. The flavor is more subdued, but still amazing. Biscuity malt followed by strong hop bitterness redolent of grapefruit with hints of grassiness and floral notes. Incredibly drinkable. Finishes dry and bitter. Light bodied with effervescent carbonation. Overall, if this isn't the finest example of an IPA I've ever had, it is surely in the top two or three! I cannot give enough kudos to Russian River!"
"500mL and various tap pints. This is one of those IPAs that I have never enjoyed. No matter how fresh, this one and I do not match well. "
Poured a two fingers of head on a fairly clear straw colored body.
My first time trying Blind Pig
Beer pours crystal clear blond with a nice fluffy head. Looks crisp and clean. Highly effervescent.
A - Pours a crystal clear amber with a sudsy head that quickly diminishes. The lacing has some dynamic legs that succumb to gravity and work their way downward to the surface.

Pours an orangy color with a two finger head and nice carbonation. 
"Drunk at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, PA."
"This was a very great beer. Was recommended from a worker at Total Wine. Supposedly very rare. I was definitely pleased with my purchase and would buy it again. I prefer Pliny the Elder, but definitely a good choice nonetheless. Definitely recommend you try it if you ever get the chance."
Not hoppy enough and tastes flat. Don't understand the love here

"A: into a pint, solid gold beer, ivory head as big as you want it; messy head clings to sides of the glass, smearing foamy lace down the side"
"Even though this beer was over 1 month old, I thought it tasted fantastic. I am a huge fan of the West Coast-style IPA and this delivered and represented it to the letter. BIG hop cones notes coupled with a bright citrus bouquet make up the girth of this aromatic powerhouse. it was the flavor that I could sense the age. It just didn't have the the same intensity as the nose, but still was absolutely delicious with great drinkability. "
Clear orange beer. Nice one finger head. Great retention. Great lacing.

I've also had this beer 3x in the past, but 2x I made the mistake of drinking a couple Plinys beforehand so I couldn't really do a fair review. So now this is the first time I can sit down and write a fair review of Vinnie's first big hit."

"Thanks to BeerThirty for another CA IPA. Bottled 7 February 2013, tasted 28 March 2013. Had meant to drink this sooner, but illness got in the way."
"Bright golden body with a pillowy white head. Beer is nearly transparent as it is definitely well crafted. The scent is piney with some citrus rind and some grassiness. A hint of sweetness that balances it out. The taste is refined. The hops are in balance but certainly center stage. No strong malt notes or sweetness in the taste. You get light pine and some citrus rind. There is enough bitterness to let you know you're drinking an IPA. Well made beer, and certainly worth seeking out."
Bottled on date of 03/21/13
"Poured a seethru auburn-tinted brown with two-finger white head that died quick with lace patches and had a very hoppy nose; pine and citric hops along with grapefruit and touches of breadiness and caramel malt. Light to medium bodied and easy going down the hatch, the hops are dominant and have a great earthy, citrusy and grapefruit taste along with minimal fruit sweetness. Beer is balanced by sweet and dry malty backbones, and finishes not bitter but dry and crisp and makes you want to have another drink. Skirts the edge between overly hoppy/DIPA and just a right balance for an IPA between hops and malts and is an excellent brew."
Tasted side by side with pliny the elder at russian river yesterday

"The very first DIPA and it's my most favorite of the DIPAs, except for PtY when it's on tap. I like this better than PtE because it feels big, bitter and well balanced.

Picked this up in California during my California to San Antonio trip. This survived the travels in my car then the flight from San Antonio to Chicago ( I was fortunate enough to have one back in California on tap too)
"Tasted on January 18, 2013:"
Pours a clear straw yellow/orange with a two finger head. Smells of floral piney hops with a touch of sweetness. Taste is well balanced and hits upfront with the bite of the sweet piney hops and a touch of citrus lemon. There's a spice quality of something like lemon-grass that adds a small bite to the flavour. A touch of the nutty malt comes through on the end although incredibly covered by the hop notes. Mouthfeel is pretty stellar with its upfront bite and clean chewy character that keeps it drinkable.
"Appearance: Very clear, golden amber appearance, with 3/4 finger, off-white head."
Bottle dated 01-02-13
"A: super clear golden yellow, nice carbonation leaving a 1.5 finger head and small amount of lacing as you drink"

Poured into a Due South Brewing Co. snifter. Label says Bottled on 010213.
A gift from my sis-in-law who brought a bomber from San Fran to Nashville for Christmas (along w/ some Pliny too).
"Pours a clear golden with one finger white head. Head slowly vanishes leaving little lacing on glass. Aroma big with citrus fruit, pine and slight grass notes. Flavor is more grass and citrus, with a touch of funk. Slight maltiness and packed with hops. Light and refreshing with medium bitter finish."
"not sure why this one is so hyped up. was dying to try it, finally did, and was rather unimpressed as far as russian river goes. to me, pliny is just such a better beer, more hops, better feel, more alive. this one pales in comparison in almost every respect. same color but maybe a little less sediment and a little less carbonation than the pliny. less resinous nose, although the hops appear to be equally fresh and pungent. citrus notes and pine notes in equal proportion, although this isnt oily at all. bitter finish after a balanced american style pale ale. lighter biscuity malt doesnt overshadow the hops, but the flavors just arent as forward and assertive as the pliny. i know its a different beer entirely, and i shouldnt compare like this, but i couldnt help thinking the whole pint that this was the inferior little brother. good feel, crisp finish, plenty bitter, drinkable as hell, but just not a standout to me. especially since we all know what russian river is capable of. good ipa, not memorable for me. ill try it again in the future though."

I wonder if they will print this in the magazine?"

Had this really fresh and poured into a tulip; an early September batch.
"A- Pours an unfiltered hazy gold with a nice head that sticks around for a bit and then disappears. I'm torn to say if that might affect appearance, because of how it disappears all together. I will leave it at a 4, but just remember I might be somewhat closer to a 3.7 range. "

"This pours an amber tan color with tremendous white foam. The aroma is full on orange and orange marmalade. So fresh and vibrant. Eminently pleasing flavor. Makes me think of orange and grape blossoms with some grapefruit citrusy notes. All through the miracle of hops! Nice body on this, piney and hoppy, with a rounded bitterness and a dry finish. Delicious."

"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a medium orange amber with a moderate, fast dissipating head, leaving lacing. Hoppy aroma. Hops, citrus; hoppy finish. Somewhat muted, like a watered down Pliny the Elder. OK, but don't see the point. I'm not getting the same positive experience as other reviewers. Purchased from a rarely visited store, so maybe an old bottle. If I'm lucky enough to see this again, I'll revise the review."
"Over the top west coast ipa. Pale, American 2 row with dextrine malt simple flavor and body. Aroma strong clean citrus rind hops. Strong hop flavor, like distilled grapefruit essence. What it lacks in balance it makes up for in deliciousness and real "
"Well this was a real nice treat. I was out to dinner and saw this one the draft list. I made sure I ordered as many as I could handle in one sitting. The beer poured out as a nice golden color with a brilliant white head on top. The lacing is nice a sticky on this one. The smell of the beer is piney and full of citrusy hop aromas. It smells so refreshing. The taste of the beer is also very nice, hopped up like crazy with a clean malt backbone. The mouthfeel is very sharp and crisp with a strong carbonation to it. Overall this beer was very good, I'm glad I finally finished the trio from Russian River. All were excellent."

Real good crisp finish that has some tart bitterness. Very drinkable brew here, a standout . Great stuff; An exceptional IPA here."
"S - Earthy, grapefruity when it sits, some fruity notes right after pouring or swirling... Peaches possibly?"
Ran through a pretty good gaunlet of Pales last night. 
Poured from tap into pint at falling rock in denver. Pours a clear golden amber with nice foam head and good lacing. Smells of nice candy hops.

"Fresh Bottle poured into tulip. Nice copper salmon color with a very tight creamy inch thick cap that hangs on to the glass leaving wave length patterns as I sip down. Nose is pretty straight forward with nice citrus fruits and pine forest. Flavor is along the same lines with very nice lemon and mango notes, bitter hops and a nice blanket of bready malt to keep it all cohesive, very nice balance. Blind Pig is a quality IPA often overshadowed by it's siblings but worth seeking out for a nice citrusy bitter balanced brew."

Bomber bottled on 11/22/11. Thanks to dsgolovin for this.
"bottled 12.19.11, so just about two weeks old. pours a very bright dark gold/light amber color with a white head that leaves good lace. nose is tropical fruit (pineapple grapefruit?) and hints of flowers with a touch of sweet malt backbone. just wonderful. like cutting a pineapple in the middle of a citrus grove. taste is grapefruity and filled with pine, grass and all the proper hop notes. just enough sweetness to round it out, but finishing bitter and fairly dry. medium body that begs to be schwilled. wow. i've always opted for the other ""well known"" RR brews, and am kicking myself for sleeping on this one. fantastic."
I think I'd have to agree with quite a few others opinions that Blind Pig is a tastier and more enjoyable IPA than Pliny. Won't compare the two though I just set that up.
"500 ml bottle born on 11//22/2011 - consumed on 1/1/2012 (Happy New Year!). Pours a deep gold with very good head and lacing. Nose is sweet malt, lemon, and floral. Complex hop profile with lemons, grapefruit, pine, floral, and vanilla. The sweet malt that I noted in the nose is rather subdued in the taste. "

I wonder if it's a little past it's prime, but no matter, it is a very tasty beer. Nice honey gold with the underlying shimmery orange/red glow of a fine IPA. Citrus and floral notes. Taste follows nose with a good hoppy bite. This is my fifth RR offering. If I had ready access to this brewery, I'd probably be drinking it's output more than anything else."

"Poured into a standard pint glass. This pours a honey straw color with 1 1/2"" of beautiful white head. The smell is awesome. Lots of citrus heavy aromas. The taste is rich in tropical hops. Pineapple most notable here. RR makes some of the best beers on the planet. They have an uncanny ability to make great hop forward beers that actually have some balance, not just dumping a bucket of hops in and calling it an IPA. Wonderfully carbonated and light to medium body. If I lived in CA, this would be a regular for sure at 3.99$ a bottle."
"Pours a beautiful amber straw colour. The head is pillowy, but short, and as I drink the sides of my glass trace the path taken leaving that nice white lacing we all love so much."

"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clearish copper color with a finger of head. A great aroma of grapefruits/floral aromas along with the piney hops. The taste blasts you with the piney hops at the front, then the floral notes come through and it all balances nicely with the malts. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little less carbonation than I expected. Very smooth and refreshing."
"Thanks to McCafferty for the trade, I now have a lot of the Russian River brews marked off of my wants list."

"Bottled on 9/30/11, so about two weeks old. Parents brought this one back from San Francisco. Really excited about this one. "
"Had on-tap, served in a pint glass at Hops & Pie."
It's my second time having the pig. This time from a Growler I picked up at the Brewery. Good price.
"Aroma: Extremely bold. Hops, mostly grapefruit, some pine. Oily hops, I can tell already that the hops will be on my tongue about an hour after I'm done drinking this brew. Some sweet caramel malts make it past the hops, but barely."
"Poured from a draft into a pint glass at Toronado in San Diego, Calif. Color was caramel amber. Small amount of head. Minimal lacing on the top. Minimal film on the sides."

500mL bottle (bottled 8/4/11) poured into a tulip. Thanks again sleepyhead!
"We pop the top and pour an orangey-copper colored brew. It holds a brief one finger head of electrically active bubbles. This recedes quickly to form a film across the top of the liquid, and to leave spotty lacing around the glass. The beer holds a thin haze, with no sediment otherwise noted. Carbonation appears active. The nose meets with sweet and bitter grapefruit up front. This gives off vibes of being extraordinarily fresh and cooling. To cut this there is bittering rind and a clementine sweetness. With warmth a metallic yeast begins to seep out, and a bit of the alcohol becomes present. The malts throughout are standard and pale. As we sip we find, as in the nose, a sweet and bitter citric hop. This rides for the front of the tongue with grain, which seems to be there for only the balance, rather than as a powerhouse inclusive flavor. Bitterness takes over through the middle, but this quickly becomes more mild, with a simple malt to smooth things over. This makes way for the finish where, curiously, the sweetness returns. Now it is in the form of fresh, fruity orange. Again, clean malt helps the balance. The aftertaste breathes of fusel alcohols, bittering hops, and an earthy/mineral quality of grain and yeast. The body is medium, bordering on thin, while the carbonation is evenly medium. The mouth is treated to slick hop oils providing a basic astringency. There is decent slurp and smack to each sip. This abv is appropriate and the beer drinks easily."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass, bottle on date 8-4-2011. Thanks to rmaste6282 for sending me this one. "
"Bottle picked up at Bristol farms in Palm Desert, just felt like I should give this beer I've had so many times before a tick. My first time having it out of a bottle, hope it still delivers."
"poured from bottle into RR tulip. This was bottled 18 days before consumption. Pours a pale golden yellow with ever present lacing and a 1/4 inch head. The smell of hops is the first thing that hit me. A very enjoyable beer. The taste of piney hops with just a titch of malt sweetness. A little dry, but very enjoyable. I will continue to search out this beer and will trade for it often."
A: Pours a lovely golden orange color. A small white head laces the top and is nice and frothy. 
"500 ml bottle sent to me by smarcoly, thanks again for another tasty beer. Split with a friend and poured into two tulip glasses."
Thanks again to N. Ketchum for the opportunity to drink another tasty brew.
Bottled on 8/23/11. 
"Jumping into my second Russian River offering this week and I have to say I'm slightly impressed...okay, maybe a touch more than slightly. This pours rich with a beautiful white head that fills me with hope. It fades fast though, as does the nose, although I've been accused of having a busted sniffer so take that with a grain."
Bottled on 8/4/11 poured into a SA perfect pint glass

Served on-tap at the Khyber Pass Pub in Philadelphia.
"Another RR classic, finally put to rating."
"Tasted this at a beer festival at the Tustin Brewery in Tustin, CA. It was a fantastic festival and Blind Pig was tapped out very quickly. It possibly was my favorite beer that day. I prefer the milder IPAs and this hit the spot. Great color and effervescent head with just the right amount hops."
Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass. Excited about this one! Thanks to xhuskr for the trade. Bottled on August 4th 2011 we good to go!
500ml Bottle - thanks to zacs for this one
"Found in at Clems bottle house in a 500ml bottled just 10 days after the bottling date, how is the for fresh AB. Poured into a tulip glass since no pints available. Poured with minimal off white head that did not stick around and had little to no lacing during drinking. Smell provided great floral herby notes right from the outset that struck around nicely. The taste was another solid ipa from Russian River, not over powering but a great hop character with good malt balance. Think I may like this as much as some of my favorite west coast brews for a warm summer day. Mouthfeel was full but not viscus with a clean finish."
Poured from 500ml bottle into pint glass. Tasted side-by-side w/ PtE.
"Had a pint at the Monk's Tavern in Philadelphia. Fantastic nose of bug, citrusy, piney hops. Some tropical fruit and caramel malt as well. Nice appearance. Off-white head with good lacing. Flavor is similarly hoppy and delicious. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a fantastic IPA and one I would certainly enjoy having again."
Had this on tap at the Falling Rock Tap Room in Denver
6/22/11 - Served in a Duvel Tulip. Thanks Kyle2k10!
"pours a clear, golden hue, not a huge initial head, but excellent retention. as expected, the nose is crazy hop-foward - lots of pine, a bit of the citrus twang. "
Very good beer. It is bitter but very drinkable. Most of the reviews are spot on. Good beer but no Pliny.
"A: deep orange body, finger head, cool lacing"
"On tap at the Mayor, this is one of the classics in my opinion. Smells of piney aromatics, little citrus and hardly any malt. One of my favorite parts about this beer is the malt bill seems so simple. Vinnie lets the hops run the show. After drinking about half my glass my palate gets used to the bitterness, I am enjoying all of the hop complexity. Really loving the lacing as the glass continues to drain. A true classic IPA. Can't wait to drink another..."
Bottled 07/18/11. RR 'tion glass.
"500mL bottle, chilled and poured into a Duvel tulip "

"First off, I'm spoiled. I get this beer and pliny pretty much anytime I want and the oldest date I receive is brewed two weeks prior to me buying it. With that said, I decided to review this particular bottle 7/18/11"
500 mL bottle.
"This one was bottled 4 days ago. Nice! Pours a clear, pale, golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very hoppy with some lovely pine needle notes. A bit more of a malt aroma than I remember from past bottles I've had. Taste is Initially really clean hop flavor. Nice bitter pine flavor with some tasty citrus notes. Some nice grapefruit. Finishes with crisp bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with some crispiness. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is a wonderful trademark California IPA! It's always a good night when I get my hands on some Pliny and Blind Pig."
Growler purchased less than 48 hours ago at the brewery. Poured into Duvel tulip.

500ml bottle poured in to a Duvel Tulip
Pours a gold/orange with little head and left lacing the whole way down the glass.
Pours a amber gold into a New Belgium globe with a two finger soapy white head with some good retention and lacing. Looks nice and full.
Yellow complexions this bright and clear are usually reserved for pilsners and pale ales. IPAs tend to be more amber in tone but then again a Blind Pig doesn't see colour. And I like to think I don't view the world that way either. So I say this light body is good - it probably means unencumbered hoppiness and isn't that what we're here for anyhow? 
Look: Brownish orange in color with a 1 inch head and good retention and lace

A- Pours a golden orange with light head. Carbonation streaming from the bottom of glass.
"Blind Pig pours a lovely clear copper color, hues of golds and oranges with just a touch of light amber, a few bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass while a nice thick white head rises about 2 fingers high out of the glass that has great retention and leaves behind a great sticky network of lacing. The aroma is great, bright and vibrant floral hops, juicy grapefruit and tangerine with some nice pine and grassy flavors at the back end, just a touch of sweet pale cereal grain comes out. The flavors are just as nice, huge grapefruit presence on the tongue, light floral notes with a big burst of bitter earthy pine and grass flavors but the brightness is still there which is remarkable, a touch of sweet pale grain at the finish reminds you that there is some malt used in this beer but this is all about the hops. The body is great, medium carbonation, a touch higher than anticipated and moderately prickly with a full body and and great dry bitter finish."

Imbibed in a snifter from a few bottles I obtained from a west coast connection. Really nice color... Thin head that dissipated rather quickly into a hop oil slick laying happily on top. 
"Served an amber-orange color with a firmly sticky white cap at a snifter at Toronado. Lacing is nice, great look. "
The aroma of this beer is phenomenal. It has a really fresh hop smell that sets it apart from some of my other favorite IPAs like Bell's Two Hearted and Victory Hop Devil. Really well balanced with moderate bitterness that balances out and finishes loooong. It has a great full mouthfeel for an IPA and it's really pretty stellar. Lacing stays on the side of the glass sticks around for a long time.
From 500ml bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 5/2/11
"Poured into a ccb pint. Pours a golden amber with a 2 finger head. Very clear and crisp, lots of carbonation. Aromas of citrusy hops, smells like summer. Taste has a good balance of malts and hops bitter but not too bitter, just enough to make you want more. Very smooth and refreshing, this is a near perfect ipa! Blind pig flies under the radar due to pliny, but it really deserves more recognition!"

Pours a clear amber color with a nice one finger head which dissipates slightly after the pour but does hang on.
A: It pours a murky golden color with some yellow hues in the light. There is a gorgeous two finger white head that hangs on for a long time. Excellent retention that completely coats the sides of the glass.
Poured a gold with slight amber. Fluffy white head that faded and didn't retain any lacing.
"Had on draft at torando. Came out looking an orange amber without much head from a pint glass. Nose was typical of a solid ipa/borderline apa, piney hoppy bitter notes, citrus was mostly lemon and a nice bready note. Taste was very refreshing and easy drinking pretty much following the nose. The hops brought a slight floral character along with a touch of grapefruit and a pleasant forest note with a good malt backbone. Very well done i just find that pliny and blind pig are both very good beers i was just hoping for more complexity out of them. Blind pig to me really tasted similar to pliny with just a different malt bill."

"500ml bottle. Bottled on 3/2/11. Pours a clear copper with a one finger white head with good retention that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Aroma is huge resinous pine with a bit of grapefruit. A little bit of pineapple and some orange peel as well. A little bit of bready malt comes through in the aroma. Initial taste has a hint of sweetness going into strong pine hops with a bit of grapefruit. A little bit of orange as well. Finish is some of the bready malt with a strong, but not too strong bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Great beer. One of the best IPAs out there."

A-Excellent Looking from the tap at Reagle Beagle as I watched I. Thomas Jr. defeat the Wildcats.
"The appearance was a golden caramel color with a white frothy head. The head retention seemed better than most IPAs, but after a couple minutes it faded. The aroma is quite strong, but it's a fantastic blend of flowers, citrus like oranges and hints of pine. In terms of taste, this beer has it all and was very fresh! Perfect balance of toasted caramel malts giving it just the right amount of sweetness. The sweet caramel and hints of honey, along with the perfect amount of bitterness coming from the hops was just was like a symphony on the tongue and an overture for the nose. I'd say it's a medium-bodied ale, probably on the heavy end for IPAs, but I'll tell you what this ranks up there as probably my favorite IPA of all time. Thin creamy mouthfeel. Drinkable? Heck yea, pour me another!"
Many thanks to BA treehouse for sending this along in the n00b 3 BIF.
"i could almost go 5 on ""drinkability"" because you could definitely put back a few of these, especially given the relatively low 6.10 ABV. this is like PLINY'S older brother -- Blind Pig sort of laid the foundation that would bring forth the now west-coast-classic (d)ipa, pliny the elder. "

"Huge thanks to nickd717 for this one. Bottle is dated 2/14/11. It's an excellent beer to commemorate the end of the regular season for my Boilermakers. It pours a beautiful gold in color, very translucent and clear with a one finger frothy white head. It smells of dry piny hops with bitter grapefruit. It's very piny with a light malt finish. The flavor is riddled with pine cones with a slightly sweet and bitter grapefruit aftertaste. It's definitely a solid IPA. It drinks light and is pretty drinkable but it really gives you cotton mouth. Luckily this fades the longer you drink it. It eventually turns mouth watering. It's probably one of the most drinkable IPAs around. I'm definitely thankful for the tick."

"pop top on this one two months too late (i think). Can smell hop aroma but its not very pungent. It's like smelling fruit juice that are not fresh . Orange to golden orange in color, with half inch whittish head and minimal lacing which goes away quick. Citrusy in flavor, pineapple and other tropical fruits. Malty with sweetness. Bitter but not as hoppy as a double IPA like it's sister Pliny the Elder. Smooth and dry, very, very drinkable. all in all not the one of the best ipa's ive ever had but i've got to hold pliney responsibale for setting the standers so high for me on this one. with all that said maybee i should try one fresh not two and half months old."

"this beer pours a hazy slightly darker golden color. you can see tiny particles floating in the beer. there is a 2 finder white head when the beer is poured, that slowly recedes leaving lacing on the glass, and a small cap on the beer. The smell is slightly piney and resinous, with the main hop aroma being citrusy with a small hint of the malt. the taste is very citrusy and juicy upfront with a small amount of malt character to hold it together with the bitterness. the mouthfeel is good and dry, almost completely dry, except for the small amount of sweetness lent from the malt. this is a drinkable beer, that i would consume more often if it were locally available and reasonably priced."

Pours a translucent light orange color with a beige head showing moderate retention and lacing.
Pours a light orangish yellow. With a good amount of whit head with giant bubbles. Geat lacing. Smells of grapefruit and citrus. A bit of pine on the now as well... A solid mouthfeel and lot of hops on the tongue. Wow. I think this one is better than pliny! Very tasty and highly drinkable
"One of the best single IPAs out there and I can see the argument for the best single IPA, but there are plenty of others on par with this beer as a single. None IMO have as good of finish however and at only 6.1%, it packs more hop goodness in flavor than most 7%- 7.5% single IPAs out there so that's a testament to Vinnie as a MASTER brewer. Without a doubt especially when it comes to Hops. Rant over."

"Thanks to Augustgarage for this one- my second Russian River experience (Pliny was first). Bottled on 11-19-10, poured into my Dfh tulip glass on 1-15-11. Pours a yellow-orange color, very little foamy head that quickly dies, leaving very little glass lacing. Some hop aromatics on the nose, a little pine and grapefruit, but nothing overpowering or out of the ordinary here. On the first taste, the hops are present but seem subdued. With what I have read about RR, this one is sadly probably past its prime and has lost some of its luster. Still a very good ipa that I would love to drink again, and hopefully have a fresher bottle or find it on tap."
A= Basically golden yellow a little hazy in it maybe a little orange in color in this one as well.
Bottled 12-06-10 and kept in refrigeration until I bought it last week. Poured into a tulip. 
"Had this on tap at RR and brought a bottle back. It's not the freshest bottle (about 5 weeks old), so I'm basing my review on the tap and bottle. "
"Pours a nice copper with an initial 2 fingers of very white head, but quickly recedes leaving a layer that lingers forever."
"I had a Blind Pig a day after I had Pliny the Elder. This was another beer I held high expectations as I was told this beer gave off a close resemblance to Pliny the Elder although some claimed Blind Pig was better. The beer gave off a hazy golden and burnt-orange appearance, citrus and hoppy smell, and a smooth bitterness resembling PTE but less pine in taste. Definitely a dry hoppy beer and I think this beer slightly edges PTE by personal preference."
"Smell is very fruity and citrusy! Can smell hoppy aroma. It's like smelling fruit juice. Orange to golden orange in color, with half inch whittish head and minimal lacing which goes away quick. Citrusy in flavor, pineapple and other tropical fruits! Malty with sweetness. Bitter but not as hoppy as a double IPA like it's sister Pliny the Elder. Smooth and dry, very, very drinkable. Wish the store lets me take out two or more bottles when it's available. So delicious and highly recommended."
Reviewed from notes 1/9/2011
Appearance- Clear and golden with a nice off white head. Great lacing after sips. 
Serving Type - Bottle
A: Light gold with a finger of head. It's apparent from the cloudiness that this is an unfiltered brew. 
Bottle shared by alexsdad06. Poured hazy golden color with an average frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy sour citrus hop aroma. Medium to full body with a oily slick texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy bitter flavor with a moderate to heavy bittersweet finish of medium to long duration. Very good brew.
"Aromas of extremely pungent pine, fresh lemon, grapefruit, and faintly resinous hops. No malt at all; fairly clean."
Bottled 12/06/10- Stone IPA glass
A - Mostly clear golden in color with a one inch white head that has great retention and lacing.
From notes:
A - A rich-orange-yellow color that is gloriously hazy and raw looking. You can see sediment floating around in the glass. Head is bright white and laces spectacularly well. Everything about this beer is bright and beautiful looking. 
"On tap at Toronado in San Francisco. I'm so excited to finally try this that I don't care that I'll be at Russian River in a couple days, I need to have this now. Pours a bright orange colour with a finger of white head that lasts the whole pint. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of huge pine and citrus hops. I just want to smell this forever. Really nice kick of bitterness in the flavour, some malt balance as well. One of the best IPA's I've ever had."
"16.9oz bottle, red wine glass, bottled on 12/6/10."
"500mL bottle into Harpoon IPA imperial pint glass; poured cold, warmed as tasted; bottling date of 10/29/2010"
"This is a light colored beer with a creamy head. Poured on draft at a tap house. The smell is very citrisy and floral. The taste is a delightful blend of hops and malt. It is very hop foward but has a nice balance between bitterness and malt. The mouth feel is spot on for an IPA, just rich enough."
poured into a tulip glass
"Bottled on 11/19/10. Pours a golden honey color that would be clear without the tiny yeast flakes that seem to be stuck in suspension. The head is a decent size, nothing crazy for the style, settles into a light cap."
A-Pours a rusty orange with 1/2 inch of eggshell white head. Leaves beautiful rings of lacing.
"Pours a pale gold colour with a saffron tinge. Head is modest, with off-white hue, sinks to a thin film and leaves a few light trails of lace. Slow bead and light cloud in the body. Looks alright, nothing particularly special."
"Overall a very good beer, although it tasted much more citrusy than I expected, and much more than some other hoppy RR IPA's. "
Bottled on 11/22/2010. The second half of my friends birthday present.
"500 ml bottle dated 11/19/10 and consumed on December 12, 2010. Poured into an Irish pint glass. Thanks jenray for the trade and the chance to drink this beer! "
"having just tried my first PtE, what better to move onto than my first Blind Pig (again, props to portable for the kind trade). bottled 11-19-10."
"Pours a light amber color, with a small sticky head. Aroma is clean pine, citrus, flowers and a touch of cannabis. This tastes great; just a tiny bit too rough to get a perfect score. Mouthfeel is likewise nearly perfect, tilted a bit too much to the bitter side. The slight malt flavors help with this though. Very drinkable, I like this better than Pliny."
"Received this as an extra from KevSal, thanks!"
"bottled 10-22-10, drunk 12-8-10"
"Huge fluffy head, leaves globs of lacing! Nice cloudy orange/yellow color. Pine hop smells of course, followed by distinct apricot. Other citrus such as manderin oranges, and pineapple. This is more earthy than pliny. Tastes of very oily pine, apricots and bitter lingering hops. Oily mouthfeel, wile still being smooth to drink. Nice!"
"Mildly hazy light amber with thin white head, leaves some lacing."
On tap at Capone's Black Friday event poured into a pint glass by Matt Capone himself...
"On tap at Beachwood BBQ, Seal Beach. Deep golden pour with a fine off-white head that leaves a wonderful amount of lace on the glass. Nose and taste are citrusy, grapefruit hops with an elegant malt backbone. Finish is just the right amount of hop bitter without being too biting. An excellent IPA."
"500 mL bottle with a bottled on date of 090710 courtesy of bmwfan1987, thanks Curt! Pours a mostly clear, light gold color with a tight-bubbled off-white head. Pretty good retention and excellent lacing. As expected, a fine looking ale here."
"500 mL bottle poured into Stone shaker pint glass. Date says it was bottled on 10/22/2010, meaning this guy is 38 days old. Not ""super fresh"", but about as good as I'm going to do out here in Western PA without making a trek to California."
A - Poured a copper color with an off white head that leaves lacing behind
Enjoyed this on tap at the Capone's Black Friday event. What a wonderful event shared with cmurren25 and stakem as well as the other BAs in attendance. Here's the journey.
"Another brew that my thanks go out to Adam for cheers heaps mate,the brew pours a vibrant orange/pineapple hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head with heaps of lacing everywhere looks spot on,the smells are honeysuckle,citrus and pine needles,the mouthfeel for an IPA is super smooth,light medium bodied and super sessionable and leaves tastes of pineapple,lychee,passionfruit,light golden malts and finishes with a dry stonefruit bitterness,overall its a top brew that is really balanced out,very easy to knock back while still allowing the flavours to mingle on your palette and im so glad ive finally gotten a chance to sample it and look forwards to rest of their lineup."
"A - Radiating, opaque amber. The color is rich and full, the suspended sediment a perfect density, and the head -although brief - displays a well integrated structure and leaves behind some pretty good lacing."
Poured from a bottle dated 10/18/2010 gotten via trade with dabecassis. Thanks David.
"500ml bottle, dated 10/22/10, courtesy of jethrodium, into a Duvel tulip."
"Pours from the bottle with a thin white head which dissipates fairly quickly. This beer smells hoppy but not sweet. Citrus and pine notes. The taste is wonderful, all hops and citrus, I can tell there is some malt in there I'm just not sure exactly where it is. The hops are amped up in this one without much malt to balance them out. This is a wonderful hop bomb without the sugary sweetness that usually accompanies this level of hops. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but not at all unpleasant. This is a very drinkable beer and would be a good choice for a sessionable IPA."
A: Golden brown pour with a small white head. Small amount of lacing and minimal retention.
pours a clear amber color with a 1 finger head and good lacing..smell is full pine and citrus hops with a floral and grapefruit smell..malts in the background..taste is much the same its a ipa full of pine and grapefruit tastes it has a great tasty hop profile it rounded out with a touch of caramel malts..mouth feel is medium well carbonated lots of flavor..drink ability is high its so good so drinkable..could down several of these ..really liked this one
A-Pours a clear golden amber color with a finger's width head and nice lacing on the glass.

Bottle date 10/22/10
"a: pours a nice golden orange color with about a half inch of head that disappears steadily. Meaning that it is not as fast as some beers i have seen, but not a slow either. There is a lot of lace around the edge of the glass and atop of the beer"
"After playing football there are pretty much two acceptable types of beer. PBR, and lower alochol by volume IPA's. Fortunately, I had this Blind Pig around. The bottle date is 9/29/10, so it's just over a month old."
Thanks for the bottle jh1982!
Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a snifter glass.
Poured into a standard pint glass a light amber color with a decent head that left a web of lacing down the glass.
Big thanks to Ineedabeerhere for including this in the winnings for week 4 of the Sunday Night Football Squares LIF.
A-Pours a hazy orange with a nice off white head that laces the glass well.
Elegant copper/amber huge with a decent two finger creamy head that laced very well...
"Solid IPA. Nice pour, clear golden copper with a 2 finger dense off white head. Nice retention and lacing. Smell is citrus and pine, with the citrus being the dominant character. Touch of tropical fruit, but the nose leans more toward lemon and orange."
A pint served at the Russian River Brewery.
"This is the perfect session IPA. Pours a golden orange color with a soapy white head. Has an aroma of grapefruit and pine, with hints of peach and perhaps honey. Has a nice sweet start, then comes the bitter hit with a nice creamy finish. Some sweetness through the finish. Vinnie knows his pale ales."
"Poured out of a bottle. Good head with a lot of carbonation. smells great! citrus and hops fight jockey for position. amazing hops w/ citrus taste. mouthfeel is a little watery, but nothing to complain about. this is incredibly drinkable. i really wish i had two bottles. maybe not the best ipa ive ever had, but one of them. west coast what can you say. great beer"
"Above average across the board. That's a good thing. Bad side? That's exactlt what I thought as I was drinking it. Looks fine, good, nothing exciting. Smells like a solid WC IPA. Tastes good. Nothing distinctive. You get the picture."
Thanks alot to Sdpklz for this great brew! Brewed 09-07-10 and consuming 10-23-10
"Bottled on 9/7/10, drank on 10/22/10"
"Poured from a bottle into an imperial pint glass. Bottled 03/01/10, about 7 months old (against brewer's no-aging recommendation - but it's been refrigerated the entire time)."
"Appears a perfectly pale see through copper color. Thick slightly off white head, long lasting fine evenly spread detailed lacing. I love the spiel about the blind pig, I never caught the connection with the namesake of this white whale. Aromatics are amazing the highlight of this fine single IPA super grapefruit, floral aggressive West Coast hop additions. There's also a touch of vegetal/onion notes but not overbearing this stuff is nice. This stuff is fresh from a shipment from South Bay Drugs, bottled 9/29/10. It doesn't get much fresher, I just ordered the Pliny they just got in as well. Flavor is excellent bitter dry finish up front hints of cracker semi sweet malt tones wrapped with fresh bursting hops. The hop flavors provide herbal, dry grassy, citrus in this case grapefruit, and a touch of floral veggie notes. Super dry bitter finish this stuff is ideal for drinkability. Medium bodied slightly slick with hop oils, mild easy going carbonation with a bone dry finish. Drinkability overall is killer a beer I could buy a keg of and introduce mainstream beer drinkers to hops, but why waste this nectar on newbies. I earned this experience, not this best single IPA but it's definitely up there."
4th review on BA.
Poured from a 1pt. 9oz. bottle into a Playboy pint glass.
"500ml bottle (bottled 090710) as a trade extra (thanks Paul) poured into a 500ml Founders tulip glass. ""Don't save Blind Pig for a rainy day!"" warns the bottle; I didn't have to wait, I got it yesterday and when the heavens opened on my way home from dinner I knew there was but one option for me in the fridge."
Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a tulip. Thanks for Pretzelcity for including this in the Support Your Team BIF.
"On draft at the brewpub, Santa Rosa, CA."
"After Pliny, this beer flows like water in my household...Pours a straw colored gold in color. About half a inch of head develops on the pour. Smell is very citrusy and juicy. Wonderful. Taste is even more citrusy and juicy hops than appear in the nose. Light, bitter, but exploding with juciness. I love this. It's an overused expression, but, I could drink this all day long and never tired of it. I might even go out on a limb and say that I'm enjoying this more then the PtE."
"I go back and forth on Blind Pig, but there's no denying it's a fabulous beer. Dry as the day is long with a rich, complex hoppy nose, long in earthiness and fruit with pine and cotton candy. On the palate this is a bit aspirin-y, a nice, medium body and a finish that's almost crackling with resin. If I have any complaint it's that the dryness is almost a touch much on top of the resin, leading to a bit of an empty mid-palate. This is quibbling. I love it. Less than Pliny the Elder, and it's far superior to their standard IPA (""far"" being relative, that's a solid beer as well). If I could buy this for a buck or two less, or by the six pack for what I can get Ruination, say, I'd have this all the frickin' time."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a orange-ish hint and a white head. In the aroma, grapefruit and orange citrus and a mango like hint. In the taste, grapefruit and orange citrus, and big pine like hop presence. Almost like chewing on a hop and orange rinds. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel. with a semi dry grapefruit rind aftertaste. A smooth, big west coast IPA. Fantastic!"
"500ml bottle pored into a sampling glass, had at the fall VT BA meet up."
poured from the bottle to a sun king shaped pint glass a crisp clear sunlight orange with a nice white foamy head leaving a fair amount of lace.
Figured I was due for a revisit and frankly I'm not certain if I have ever had this on out of a bottle. Bottle on date is 090710. Or three days under a month old.

Poured from a 0.5 liter bottle into a tulip pint glass.
"Tasted from bottle obtained in a trade. Pours a hazy dull orange with a thick white head that leaves heavy lace. Nose is mango with resinous hops, and a hint of honey and caramel malt. Flavors are good tropical fruitiness with pineapple and mango, pine resin hops, and somewhat toasty malt. There is almost an acidity to this beer. The body is fairly light with average carbonation and a nice long pine finish. This is an outstanding IPA."
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.
Had on tap at the Russian River Brewery in a pint glass.
"Perfume, pineapple, citrus fruits (grapefruit) emanate from a clear, golden amber body. There are hop oils on the surface after the head fades, which it does relatively early."
"Bottled 9/7/10, drank 9/27/10 from a cold pint glass. Pours a beautiful amber ""que lindo es"" with a 1/4"" head. The aroma on this is absolutely amazing, like fresh-baked pineapple upside cake wafting from an open window on a hawaiian ranch. The taste at first is wonderful, just a flood of flavor with a feel of almost impossible balance of water and creaminess, facilitated by the beautiful bead on the bubbles. The lingering bitterness may be too much for some. But all good things at a price. Including tracking bottles of this down."
rather pale and clear copper color with a decent almost white head that retains and laces well.
"Pours a nice, light golden honey color with a decent white head that laces the glass."
Poured from a 500ml bottle (bottled 7/21/10) into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.
Had this on tap at the brewery as part of a recent road trip.
I was very anxious to sit down and enjoy this RR brew that I got in a trade for some Midwestern brews. I too had to take a few sips to see what I was really tasting. Nothing was overbearing neither in smell or taste but not that there was a lack of anything. This is just a drinkable brew that you can sit down and enjoy with some food. Definitely will have another when given the opportunity.
Poured from a growler into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.
Thanks to Ben for this beauty!
"had this on-tap at a RR event, right after Pliny the Elder, for what it's worth. served in tulip glass."
"A bubbly, amber brew with heavy, gooey lacing and high head retention. Head is super thick and sticks around for way longer than expected. Looks clean and composed without looking watered down or basic."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a fluted chalice. Vibrant and clear dark orange color, with an initial finger and a half of off white head. Some light carbonation visible through the beer. "
Poured from a 500ml bottle into a taster glass.
Poured into a snifter on 9/3/10
Very gold in color-I would expect a tad darker but thats ok. Nice fluffy white head. Very grassy and hoppy aroma. Big hop blast flavor wise-quite astringent from the heavy hops. Fresh cut grass like. Long lingering bite to it. Good body-the astringency might be a tad much in the long run. Great example of a US IPA for sure.
While in CA do as the Californians do... Stocked up on some Russian River brews on my first night in town. Big fan of PtE (but who isn't). The Pliny that I picked up from Whole Foods was only 4 days old where as the Blind Pig was bottled in late July.
"A: a thin layer of foam that leaves light lacing, opaque copper in appearance."
A: Pours clear golden body swirling with tons of lively carbonation. Creamy/soapy white head.

"Thanks to bauermj for sending this one my way! 16.9oz bottle into a Hopus tulip pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice frothy eggshell head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves very nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is aroma is a nice plethora of citrus hops with a bit of caramel malts. The taste is a wonderful balance of citrus hops and sweet malts that gives way to a subtle, but smoothly present citrus hop finish. The beer is very light, crisp, smooth and refreshing. This is certainly a beer that lives up to my expectations, a wonderful IPA."
Nice golden pour with some foamy white head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Aroma is very grassy with a little sweetness and some pine coming through as well.

"purchased from Lone Hill Liquors in Claremont, CA, and then poured into my SN pint glass"
"Pours an amber color with a fluffy white head and good retention. Nose gushes with hops, and the flavor doesn't disappoint. Tons of hops, bitterness and citrus. However, it's complimented by a good malt backboone. All in all, a delightful flavor profile that's quite tasty and refreshing."
Poured from a bottle into my pint glass. Pours a dark orange color with almost a finger of head that retains well and leaves nice lacing on the glass.
"Light orange with a hint of amber in color with a very slight haze. Respectable white head that reduced to a white cap. Big floral tropical aromas, papaya, mango and grapefruit. Buttery smooth feel that rides the carbonation. Taste is all hops. Lots of tropical flavors similar to the aromas, tropical and citrusy flavors that overwhelm any malt character. Finishes with a bitter pine hoppy ending. The intense hop flavor took a little edge off of the drinkability."
Enjoyed on 8/1/10
Review from notes taken on 6/13/10.
Thank you Scottfrie for this. Bottled on 6/07/10.
"Pours a nice cloudy orange with a big time head. Great lacing and retention. Big pine aroma, also bits of grapefruit. Flavor follows. Huge bitter pine hops off the bat. A hint of citrus and floral as well, but the pine takes over. A little bready, semi-sweet malt before the bitter pine takes over again on the big finish."
"Big thanks to billinlafayette for including this as an extra! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours a clear golden yellow-orange with a two finger off-white head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of malt, tropical fruit, and malt. The flavor is of bitter tropical fruit, smooth hop bite, with a big hop bite upon swallowing. It is medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this is a very nice IPA. Another one from Russian River that I wish it were available in my area. One of my favorite American IPA's I have had. Very nicely done Russian River..."
On tap at Russian River
"Ok, 'nother local up to the plate...Pours a nice clear amber, ok head that winnows itself down to a wisp of carbonation with some fine lace. Nose is loaded with hops and some other items, some sweet pear and maybe some vanilla..Pretty nice and very robust aromas. Flavor is like the nose - very robust and hoppy. This is a very ""Crisp"" tasting IPA. Flavors are forward yet not overpowering. Like biting into a pear flavored apple, if that makes any sense. Beautiful hop character to this. Evolves from one hop bite to another seamlessly. This is really good beer, but VERY hop forward, like many West Coast ales. Finish is long and bitter in a good way. Great beer, but at $4.29/pint+9 oz. it's not what you might call inexpensive...worth it though"
"Thanks to Eric and Doug for hooking me up with this as part of our trade. Crystal clear orange-yellow pour with a nice big head and great lacing. Really big west coast nose with tons of floral and citrus, especially oranges. The taste has hints of grapefruit and orange, along with a touch of bitter pine. Nice solid sweet malt backbone balances this one out nicely. Great crisp, dry finish makes this dangerously drinkable. It's not quite Pliny the Elder, but still a solid IPA from a great brewery."
Poured from a 500mL bottle into a Dogfish Head pint glass.
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on 12/11/09. Uh oh, its not terribly fresh. This could end badly."
"On tap at Venti's Cafe, served in an imperial pint glass."
A: Pours a hazy reddish/orange color. A two finger white head forms with good retention. Light lace is left behind.
Looks as nice as any amberish beer.

Thank you to Jodan for this extra!
"500 ml bottle dated 6/7/2010, poured into a snifter."
"500 mL bottle, dated 6/7/10, eh, fresh enough. Poured into a nonic."
"I was very excited to try this on tap at Monk's Café in Philly. Pours the standard IPA look, though this one might reside on the lighter side of things (as opposed to the amber side of the IPA spectrum). Hugely aromatic, very fresh grapefruit and vine aromas--hops rule here. Taste is equally dominated by the grapefruit citrus hops, giving it a crisp edge. Very clean and easy drink, smooth in the mouth. Feel is good, though not so much so as to distinguish this from other good IPAs. Great one here."
"A: 3 finger just off white head with good texture. Beer is a beautiful golden amber with good active carbonation, but the head lacks dexterity."
"Picked this up on my trip over to San Diego. Poured from a bottle marked 6-7-10 on 7-7-10. I've had it's big brother a couple times now (even though i have failed to find in so far on this trip), so i am excited to see how this stacks up."
500 ml bottle poured into my trusty Stone glass
HUGE thanks to glazeman for this one. Bottled on 6/7/10 - nice and fresh. 
A: poured a golden orange with yellow highlights which had good retantion with a 2 finger head that left great bubbly sticky lacing on the glass.
"Pours a nice gold color slightly hazy but not ""chunky."" Grows a nice 2 finger thick head, that has great retention, hanging on throughout the whole glass."
"A: Looks as good as an IPA can get. Nice apricoty cloudy color with a not so dense head. Beautiful color, makes me wish it was warmer outside."
"Been trying to wean myself onto pale ales. Not sure if you can wean onto something. Regardless, my first go was with Pliny the Elder, which was far too much for me. Tried some others, then tried the Blind Pig, which is like the little brother of Pliny the Elder. I've had this in the bottle and on-tap now, and I found the bottle to be a little better (less bitter, more floral)."
500ml bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Bottled on 4-8-10.
"Poured a pumpkin orange with a big off-white head. Nice gobs of lacing left behind. The smell was malty overall (and very light) which is a surprise, being that it is pretty freshly bottled. I do smell some small floral, citrus and pine notes though and they're pretty nice. The taste kept with the nose, I just felt that it was a little to mellow of an IPA. The mouth was a bit thin. Not bad, I'm curious to try it on tap."

"Appearance: Pours Golden orange with a big frothy white head, leaves plenty of lace."
On draft at city tap house. Great bar. 
Thanks to Flexabull for this long time want. I split this bottle with a college buddy who started to get into craft brews and liked IPA's so it was even more of a treat. 
Pint sized bottle purchased at Willow Park in Regina. Bottled on 04/16/10. Nice and fresh considering the distance it travelled.
Pours a hazy slightly orange golden color with a frothy white head that leaves chunks of lacing on the glass.

A: Hazy orange beer capped by a finger of microbubble foam. 
"Hazy orange amber, quite a lot of sediments. Medium-sized off-white head. "
Poured from a 500ml bottle - Beer is a nice copper to gold bright beer. Very nice color for an IPA. Bone white head

"Appearance: deep golden color, white head lingers on and on, with each sip lacing leaves a tiger stripe on the glass. Picturesque!"
"Clear golden pour with an almost ideal head, looks beautiful as it slowly reduces to a nice lacey skin with clumps of froth on the surface and around the rim. Noseful of hoppy goodness."
A - Cloudy golden amber in color. A fair amount of sediment floating throughout. Very nice creamy and white head. Average lacing. 
Thanks to arbitrator for throwing this extra in my box. 
"On tap at Toronado in SF, poured into a pint glass. Small head leaves some sticky, resinous, soapy lacing stuck to the side of the glass. Aroma is straight up pine and grapefruit. Taste follows suit, delicious hop bitterness, like Pliny toned down a notch. Any time Pliny is being used as a reference point, it's a damn good thing. Very easy to drink and totally delicious."
Special thanks go out to calinalu for sending this as an extra in a recent trade. I cracked this out at beerman207's place at a recent tasting. Review is from notes taken on 5/14/2010 and poured from the bottle to a pint glass.
A - Cloudy golden orange with a soapy two finger head that had good retention and left some great random looking lacing as it disappeared and throughout the course of the drink.
500ml bottle poured into my Russian River tulip...
A- Nice golden light amber color with 2+ fingers of white head that later died to less than 1 finger head and left great lacing all over my glass.
"Pours a golden-hued, dark sunset orange color with a bone-white head that crackles audibly and stays put for a good while. "
"Poured 500mL bottle into my 21oz snifter with a bottled on date of April 16, 2010 (3 weeks old!!!). I love the Russian River 500mL bottles because they fit perfectly into my snifters with enough room for the head to show itself off."
"Pours with a fluffy white head and slightly hazy amber color. Nice thick lacing envelops big citrus on the nose. Some faint grass/straw notes also on the nose with faint sweetness. Pretty bold hop character up front that fades on the back of the palate. some residual stickiness follows a slight fizzy feel. Excellent IPA that drinks pretty fast, especially when fresh."
"Bottle dated 4/16. Received as an extra, big thanks to SpdKilz for this one."
"So many times on tap v. bottle, I'll give it the tap review. Great yellow and amber appearance, very clear surprisingly. Aroma is of great dry hopping. "
"Pours a golden honey color with faint hues of orange. Some sediment. There is about two fingers of loose white head that fall to a 1/8"" with a nice amount of lacing."
"Bottled on 041610, so says the bottle. Pretty fresh so I am really excited to try this beer! "
Delicious. Low alcohol for an IPA at 6.1% but full of flavor. 
"Chilled bottle into a glass. It's tough to find this thing fresh anymore, so I was pleased as punch to see a 4/16/10 bottling date. "
"Had on-tap at Henry's in Portland, OR. Unfortunately, it was poured into a pint glass ;)"
Thanks to pastradul
Poured a 500 mL bottle (dated 03/01/2010) into an oversized red wine glass to capture the aroma.
Thanks chickencoop
Somehow I've never gotten to try this yet. Not sure how with all the Russian River stuff I've traded for. Finally got this thanks to RaulMatisse. Bottled on 01/13/10 so not too fresh but fresh enough.
"I have had this beer maybe 10 times, 3 bottles, 7 on tap. I have overall preferred this to Pliny the Elder. Generally the beer has a very bright pine and citrus nose, and more of the same on as the taste. It is usually a nice clear orange and very good drinkability. The latest batch seemed a bit harsh on the back of the tongue, a bit of a surprise to the usual smoothness and dryness in the finish. The smell is really the best feature. Beautiful. Although I'm starting to wonder if RR has changed some things in their beers in 2010, or if it's my palate that is changing."
"A: Light orange in color, with a slight haze. About a 1/4"" of thick, tight, white head with decent retention and lacing. "
Acquired thanks to ipa247.
"My first Russian River beer. I've been waiting a while for this. Bottle date is 3-1-10. Much thanks to rmjavanut for the great extra! Things start off good. Pours orange with a nice, rocky white head. Eventually reduces down to a cap and leaves some decent lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles and a little bit of sediment on the first pour, lots of it on the 2nd. The smell is excellent, very tropical and hoppy. Hops, citrus, pineapple, mango. Definitely reminds me of Sculpin, maybe even more potent. The taste doesn't quite live up to the nose but this is still a very good IPA. There is still some tropical-ness there but it seems to be mainly citrus and grapefruit. The balance of the hops and malts is perfect. A caramel/bread aftertaste starts to show towards the end. The mouthfeel is very good as well, light but creamy, no alcohol taste, great carbonation level, very easy drinking and enjoyable. This is what I expected and maybe a bit more. I have a PtE waiting for me, hopefully I can hold off till tomorrow..."
Reviewing from last months notes. Bottled on 1/13/10. Poured into a SA Perfect Pint glass. Thanks to Sideswipe for the trade
"Pours a nice amber color, with a nice, big white head. I remember drinking this beer years ago (early '90s) at the old Blind Pig brewery, although details from those days escape me. This one smells strongly of hops...beautiful floral/grassy/citrusy hops. More floral hoppiness on the palate, balanced nicely by the sweet malt presence. Not sure how similar this one is to the original, but it is certainly a worthy legacy."
"Copper-gold pour with a big, rocky, white head. Nice floral, citrus aroma with a great balance of caramel and biscuit malts. Dry, piny, grassy flavor with nice citrus notes and a well balanced biscuit and caramel malt profile. Creamy, medium body with very soft carbonation."
"Just over a month bottling, in a DFH snifter."
"A - Pours a cloudy ice tea color with a 1 inch white head that fades to a small cap. Lacing is excellent on this beer, and it left rings all the way down my glass."
From a bottle to a tulip.
Bottle to pint glass.
Another from shortysdude285. Poured into my mug a less than clear golden color. A very thick white soapy heading. Lacing sticks all around the glass.
"A- Clear orange copper color though with recognizable sediment. This sediment does not, however, make the beer hazy. Thick white head from the pour. Dissipates very slowly, and stays frothy and foamy. BEAUTIFUL lacing."
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. My friends in LA were generous enough to pick this up for me before driving over to meet me in Vegas.
Easter gift from my Sister visiting from San Diego..
Nice slightly hazy amber orange colored body with a white head with freakin sticky lacing.
"For all the IPAs i drink, this is only the second time I have had blind pig"
"Pours a hazy, golden-orange color, with a nice-sized, sticky white head. Aroma is great. Full of pine, pineapple and grapefruit. The taste is just as the nose would suggest. Great hop flavor in the form of mostly grapefruit and pineapple. There is a pleasant bitterness present. This is a great IPA that would be one of my go to beers if I had access to it."
"Received as an extra in a trade with scribe594. Great extra, thanks a lot. Split 3 ways and poured into pint a shaped pint glass. Really cool story on the side of the bottle, definitely take the time to read it. "
"With all the attention Elder and Younger get, it's easy to forget just how good this is. In fact, having recently been afforded the opportunity to try it, I think I like it about as much as I like the Elder. From notes, dutifully punched in on the iPhone:"
Tasted On tap at the brewpub on 6/30/09. 
Poured from a bottle of the 500ml variety into a lost abbey pint glass.
This beer kicks ass!!!
"A - Light amber/orange with a nice 1 finger head. Beautiful lacing, lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom."
Russian River Blind Pig into snifter 
Poured into a St Bernardus chalice. Bottled 1/13/10.
A - Orange/straw with a thick foamy white head. 
Big ups to plinytheyoungest for hooking me up with this & elder. Thanks Jeff! 
Thanks goes out to Brian for this great extra! Poured from a 500ml bottle into my Dogfish shaped pint glass. Poured a hazy light amber color with a thick two inch white foamy head. Very good head retention and it left excellent lacing on my glass. 
Another wonderful west coast IPA acquired from JesseTheHutt. Thanks so much!
"This is just a simple but classic West Coast IPA. There is a reason why Russian River has a cult following, when it comes to the style, they nail it and put out a style standard. Big hops on the front, smooth throughout, but still citrusy hops dominated like i like. This beer is so well made with the consistency from first sip to the end. I may be biased since i'm from sonoma county, but this beer is the goods."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a substantial amount of carbonation coming up from the bottom. Head is bubbly and thick and also leaves a ton of lacing on the glass. Only criticism is the color of the body, it's pretty light. "
"Had this on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, at their 3rd annual celebration of everything Russian River. Unassuming appearance, yellowish wheat color. Very mild white head. Smell was anything but reserved. Strong grassy hop smell, some slight fruity notes. taste was similar, not much malt body but tremendous hop bitterness. Biting finish. Great beer for the hop head. Excellent West Coast IPA."
On-tap at Falling Rock in Denver.
This handsome looking bottle was acquired in trade with my main SoCal man - Sideswipe. (Thanks John!)
"Light amber color with tiny suspended yeasties. Large, bubble laden head leaves great retention and sticky lace aplenty. ""Respect hops. Consume this IPA fresh."" Ok. "
"At my first sip I knew I was drinking something special. This is the beer that came before Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger. The hop character is similar, but less bitter, and the malt is a lot smoother than the elder. At 6% you can session the DIPA! Floral, citrus, and piney aromas destroy the nose as you let the bitterness scrape your taste buds clean and cling to your palate. This can step in Elder's place when he's not around."
"Thanks to bricktop for throwing one of these into our recent trade. It's been about 15 years since I've had one of these - well before the days of Russian River Brewing. It's nice to see the label is still pretty much the same, and Vinnie is still in charge of brewing it! I've tossed this bottle on my wall next to the old one..."
"Good Beer! I bought it at Whole Foods in Tustin, CA (moved to Blind Pig because we haven't been getting the same Pliny the Elder shipments around here). "
"Received in trade from htomsirveaux. Thanks! Bottled 10/31/09, poured into a Stone IPA glass."
Had on tap today at the Blue Dog Tavern in Chalfont.
"Poured from a 500ML bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on 1/13/10, drank on 2/15/10."
"Poured into a pint. Bottled on 9/15/09, so not super fresh."
Another tasty treat courtesy of cloudskipper.
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, I brought this bottle home from Santa Rosa. The pour yields a hazy golden amber, orange color with a one finger bone white head. The head fades to a tight ring around the beer, leaving bubbly oily lacing."
"A-hint of haze in this golden orange colored beer, some bubble action going on inside. the head is a nice looking eggshell white that lingers for about half a minute and leaves a thick lacing on the glass."
A: Lighter Orange/Redish/Pinkish
Bottled on Date 12.11.09
"So, I am sure many of you will disagree with me on this, but personally, I did not enjoy this beer. Though, I can understand why so many people enjoy it."
"Looks clear and hazy amber with two fingers of creamy white head. And might I add, a beautifully shaped bottle."
Found this at the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam. 
A nice drinker if you have better access than I do in Chicago.
"Pours a hazy yellow with a solid well formed head,peaks well and begins to pit leaving mountain like striations of foam and lace,this is one of the finest heads on a beer I have seen in years,as the head dissipates this beer tells you instantly its an IPA citrus floral west coast hops hit your nose,well balanced sweet acid and a solid west coast hop finish,man I could drink a ton of these,Fresh and on tap is all I could think of,but as for my bottle it was still an exceptional IPA"
Wanted to try this for a long time. Poured a clear golden straw hue with a fluffy white head that left some moderate lacing on the glass. Not alot of carbonation.
"Light copper color with a good head and decent lacing. It had a pleasant smell of piney hops with some interesting earthy notes in the background. The flavor was very complex for an IPA, and it took me a minute to pick out the toasty malt taste that I think really sets this beer apart. It of course has tons of citrus and pine tastes from American hops, and a pleasant amount of malt sweetness holding the bitterness up, but there is also a very nice amount of toasted malt flavor that seems to seamlessly mingle with all the other tastes. It made me keep coming back for another sip and was a much appreciated addition. Nice dry finish and on the lighter side of a medium bodied brew. Would make a great session IPA and paired quite well with my slightly spicy entrée. If only it was easier to come by."
Into a pint glass.
A- orange tinge with exceptional carbonation
Served in a nonic pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 
Bottled on 12/11/09
Bottled on 7-23-09. This might not be the freshest Blind Pig but I got it on a trade with a user from a car related site.
Got this bottle in a trade from nickd717. Thanks for getting me some great Russian River beers! Cracked this one for the first day of my last semester of law school. 
A - In between amber and orange in color. Nice lingering head with lacing down the glass. Lots of carbonation.
Poured from bottle to oversized snifter. Big thanks to Womencantsail for hooking this up. Thanks andrew.
"ontap, had 3 pints of this one night at toronado - helped make for a rough flight the following day"
"Pours a fogged gold amber with a creme head. Soapy, hoppy nose. Sharp floral and citrus tones. I got a lot on the flavor. Earth, smoke, citrus, floral, and soapy hops. Real thick earthy character mostly. Feel is low on carbonation and the liquid is fine. Pretty easy to drink and an overall earthy IPA."
Bottle provided by Exiled.
"A: Classic ""Hethcliff"" color in appearance, brilliant egg shell colored head and sick lacing on the pinty."
Poured on tap at Horse Brass Tavern in Portland:
My first brew from Russian River Brewing! Many thanks to Tolann for an awesome trade. Bustin this one open to celebrate finally finishing my Hagiography paper.
Appearance: Beautiful brownish orange pour. 2 inch head which supports the bottle cap without sinking. Beautiful lacing as the beer progresses.
"My first review from my Secret Santa 2009 haul from brentk56. Surprised by the pale golden color. This tells me this is going to be another hop centric beer. A large white head forms and has excellant retention. The head slowly settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Very hoppy aroma with hints of grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Nothing from the malt. The flavor is likewise one dimensional. Citrus hops do shine however in this hop display. Fresh citrus and pine flavors. I would of liked some malt to balance this out a little. The body is on the lighter side but has very good carbonation that gives this beer a nice texture. Nice hop flavors but I would like to taste a little malt in my IPAs. If someone is looking for a better American IPA, I would suggest a few Midwestern beers."
Ordered a bottle from Joey at South Bay Drugs in Cali. Very excited to partake of my first Russian River brew. 
Bottled on Date 10/30/2009. Drank 12/5/2009.
Had at Russian River on 11/27
On tap at Toronado SD - from notes
Thanks to Mauerhan for this one.
"The beer that started it all....for San Diego County. Originally brewed by Temecula Brewing this beer inspired Stone, Ballast, Alpine and all the others to start brewing. Thank you Vinnie!"
Poured In: Snifter Glass
"Bottle dated 091509, poured into a goblet. Beer is yellow and clear, light amber, head is white and tight, falls away leaving some lacing on the glass. Carbonation is low to moderate."
Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into two pint glasses. Extra special thanks to LarryG for sending this in our recent trade. Special thanks to pops for the assist.
Thanks to bret27 for sending this to me :) This review in its current state has also been modified following several other samplings of this brew. Thanks to my friend Dave for the additional bottles. 
Poured from 16.9oz. bottle with 10/30/09 bottled-on date... six days after I sampled this for the first time on tap at the brewpub.
Served from a 16.9oz. bottle (thanks to davidsk for the trade) into my new Blind Pig mason jar at around 45 degrees (11/17/09).
I picked this up at Whole Foods a few weeks ago.
"Bottled 10 days ago. Pours rich golden orange with a big fluffy white head. Good retention and an excess of lacing adorns the spent glass. Aromas waft into my nose in elegant waves of papaya, pineapple, pine, and mango. The flavor is equally tropical as the nose, but is actually a lot more floral and herbal. Despite the incredible nose, this is only moderately bitter, matched by the juicy fruit and flora, and not excessive on the palate or alcohol (which is reserved for the DIPA). Medium in body, with a lively prickly carbonation. Delicious, intense, yet approachable. A paragon of the style. I know of no better version of the India Pale Ale."
On tap at the brewery.
On tap at Toronado. 
I drank this from a bottle into a chalice.
A- Pours a golden amber with a small head that dissipates to a thin layer that sticks around. Nice lacing is revealed as well.
A - This beer poured a golden amber color that produced a fluffy white head that had great retention and laced the side of the glass very nicely
"As close to a perfect beer as I have found. Great balance between the bountiful hops in the mouth and the smoothness in the finish. The aroma is second to none, where you can pick up on so many different hints of citrus, fruit and hops. Again, for all the flavor you get when drinking, this remains a very drinkable IPA"
"16oz bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip. Didnt have a chance to try this on my trip out in SD, luckily a friend brought back some with him."
"A: Poured with a big, white, creamy head... dissipated to about 1/2-finger or so over time. Very good lacing, left in sheets on the sides of the glass. Body is a dark golden color, and clear."
thanks to tenderbranson for getting a draft of this for me at the drafting room- 10oz pour in a goblet.
"Picked up after recent trip to RR. Bottled on 9/15, drank today so just over a month old. Poured into tulip. Fluffy, white head, good retention and lacing, golden and pretty clear. Smell is strong of citric and pineapple hops, a weird deep spruce smell too (if that makes any sense). Very floral. Taste was good but not as bitter as I expected. Nice balance of citric hops, a piney bitterness on the back of my throat. Slightly dry and bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was nice, not too thin or thick. Very smooth. Overall a great beer. I would take a Pliney over this but this is nothing to complain about!"
Recieved this bottle courtesy of nickd717. Thanks a ton Nick for a major want of mine!
"taste- sweet hops, bitter, oily"
"I'm lucky enough to have pretty consistent access to this beer on tap, but a trip to the Bay Area allowed me to grab a bottle and bring it home with me."
"On tap at this brewery called Russian River? Pretty nice spot! Had right after some sub-par ipa called ""pliny the older?"""
"I had this on draft at the Toronado in a pint glass. I'm clearly going to be below the average rating on this review, but I'll admit that is mostly due to the fact that I'm not a tremendous lover of West Coast IPAs."
"recieved in a trade with jadamski1, thanks josh!"
On tap at Falling Rock
On tap at Russian River.
"A - Pale yellow gold, hazy... fluffy white head,decent lacing"
Got from a trade with route66pubs. Thanks for the tasty brews!
Nice full tight head. Hazy pale golden body.
"Reviewing the bottle, but I've also had this on tap many times at Russian River Brewing and Rose & Crown."
"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a nonic. Bottled 2/2/09. Bottle courtesy of OStrungT, this one's kicking off a string of west coast hop assaults. Thanks!"
"Received in trade from saulcharlesworth, thx."
Bottle sent to me courtesy of Bring as an extra. Thanks Barry!
"Big thanks to augustgarage for this one. Tonight's the Blind Pig/Pliny sequential comparison. The first part will be my blind pig review, the second part will be my thoughts after following with a pliny the elder."
"Poured into a tall tulip, this is one of the paler IPAs you'll see. Huge head that rose above the lip of the glass and hung on for dear life for the next half hour. "
Growler received in trade from Koopa. Thanks a ton for this one! Poured into a Portsmouth goblet.
"500ml bottle, nice to see from a US brewery."
"Had this out of the bottle on an IPA tasting night after having had it a few times on tap. I have to say that I prefer this version to that on tap, which surprised me, as I tend to think IPAs usually are just as good, if not better, on tap. Bottle was only 4 weeks old though, and that's a good sign."
Poured from a 1 Pint .9fl oz bottle into my pint glass
"Reviewed on CBS day at Capone's on 8/15/09,"
On tap at Russian River on 7/19/09. We had to revisit on a Sunday afternoon for all-day happy hour!
"A- Clear pale golden with cloudlike fluffy white head. Very sticky lacing. Head dissipates down to a foamy covering, but still leaves a decent lacing."
"There is nothing I can say to accurately describe this beers beauty. Pours a light orange with a tall, frothy, meringue like head that dissipated very slowly and stuck to the glass for as long as it could."
"L: Cloudy and hazy golden; pretty frothy, foamy head"
Poured from bottle to a beer flute. Bottled on 03 03 09. 
"Had this on-tap at Russian River as well. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It pours a straw color with no sediment. An off-white 1/2 inch head forms and reduces to a thin, full coverage lacing. Carbonation readily visible."
This historic brew was poured into a pint glass from the 500 ml bottle. This was the beginning of a long night for me and for documenting purposes this was followed by a PtE.
Big thanks to vasdef42 for this extra in the trade!!
Had this as part of a tasting session with a buddy a while back. Poured a gold color with thin white head that faded pretty quickly and left sparse lacing. Smelled of citrus hops. Tasted like pine hops and malt. Pretty darn smooth. I could easily drink a few more of these...
Served in a 16oz standard pint glass.
Bottled 500ML. Served in a pint glass. Bottled on: 04-16-09
"Slightly hazed, bright apricot colored with a thick and frothy head of off-white foam that lingers a long long time."
Picked up as part of a case from O'Shea Brewing in late May for $4.04 a bottle. Bottled on 3-3-09. Finally getting around to reviewing this after a number of pints.
"500 ml bottle, about three months old. "
Appearance - Golden yellow with a hint of amber. Poured the last bit of it hard to obtain some fluffy white head which quickly subsides and leaves decent lacing.
"Tasted many times, this is from a 3/26/09 bottling."
"Poured from a 500mL bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. Bottled on 4/16/09, making this sample a little over 3 months old. "
Consumed about six weeks after it was bottled.
"We went out for dinner last night after a long, but ultimately a great, day. I was very happy to see this on-tap."
Had this beer on tap at the brewery several times before I know what a awesome beer it is. 
500ml bottle purchased by my friend in San Francisco and brought back to GA. Bottle date is 6-08-09. Poured into a standard pint glass.
A- an almost transparent gold (tinge of amber) with a fluffy white head that goes down quickly and leaves minimal lacing. nothing too special.
Poured from a 1 pint .9oz. bottle into a pint glass
"A - pours perfect orange with a thick one finger head. Not much retention, but thick sheets of lace are left behind."
a - poured a three-fingers off-white and fluffy head into a snifter that left thick sheeting and coating throughout. the body was bright orange and bubbly.
"Pours an orangy golden amber with a nice 3/4"" head. Beautiful ribbons of lacing and wonderful head retention."
The pig came to me a slightly clouded amber with a slight head. 
"Appearance: Pours out a lightly hazed, faintly-hued, dull copper body with a wispy, white head."
On tap at Monks in Illadelphia.
Bottled on 6/08/09.
Big thanks to papollo to sending me this from his trip to Cali!
Picked one of these up the last time I was in San Francisco. Pours a dark yellow color with a nice tall head that has decent retention and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of US hops that have a citrus and pine character. The flavor is quite bitter and full of that characteristic US hop with citrus and pine. The hops hang around on the palate. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is pretty good. Nice beer.
"Editing review, due to obtaining a fresh bottle while in cali. Bottled 12/11/09"
A: The pour is a slightly hazed golden orange in color. A nice fluffy white head sites on top with excellent lacing.
"Pours a cloudy orange, not much visible carbonation. 2 inch thick fluffy white head, decent retention and left some good lacing during the drinking period."
"straw yellow with a thick head that leaves a thick trail of bubbles down the side. the nose on this beer is outstanding. Smells of grapefruit, very citrusy, some malt in the background, maybe some bready notes too. Taste is rather perfumey. very floral, quite bitter towards the end to balance it out a bit. strong residual bitterness on the tongue. some grapefruit in the taste as well. mouthfeel is nicely carbonated to help wisk away some of the floralness. beer is rather sticky in the finish which coats the tongue in bitterness. drinkability is relatively high."
A - Pours a golden yellow color and is very clear. Nice white head on a semi-agressive pour. Lots of lacing along with sides.
"Amazing clarity, amber color with lots of carbonation with a nice white head. With a crisp hop smell and a little sweet maltiness. First sip strong bitterness, second sip hops mellow a little more on the tongue, clean fresh, then a nice maltiness that blends wonderful with the bitterness."
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
"Got this in a half-liter bottle from the Bier Stein in Eugene. It always takes a back seat to Pliny, but this is one nice IPA. Pours out with a nice white bubbly head, and is crisp and clear golden-orange in color. Smells fantastic, with lots of floral aroma. The taste is also very floral and I get a hint of orange. No taste or hint of alcohol anywhere in the taste...seems as though more of the complexity in the taste comes out when it's colder and it loses it's complexity as it gets warmer. Otherwise very drinkable and nice for a hot day."
500ml bottle. Bottled on 3/26/09. Served in a shaker pint. Poured a pale gold with two fingers of white head. Citrus hop aroma. Light to medium bodied with medium amount of carbonation. Crisp hop bitterness up front. Dry hoppy finish with a good amount of mouth pucker. Very easy drinking beer.
A great extra from a recent trade. Thanks Dan!
"on-tap at deep ellum during the cantillon/de la senne event on april 24, 2009, week's end of the craft brewers conference."
"poured into a tulip glass with pretty active carbo, opaque golden color and significant lacing - looks amazing"
"I got this brew in a trade with danielcurtis81, Thanks Dan!"
"golden orange, slight haze, nice creamy white head and lacing. floral hop aromas mostly in the nose with some citrus, grassy, and tropical fruit notes as well. lightly sweet biscuity malts are dominated by a lemony hop bitterness that is neither harsh nor smooth. well carbonated leading to a frothy mouthfeel. almost light bodied. hoppy, bitter, drying finish comes out clean. could drink a lot of these. Enjoyed this even more than pliny the elder and wish it were available in my area."
"It's surprisingly muddy--cloudy-looking, as if unfiltered. I do not, however, see any floating sediment--not on the original pour (1/2 bottle), anyway. A thin yet solid layer of foam--mostly small bubbles--tops her off. It looks good, but the mud puddle presentation is unexpected."
Bottled 3/26/09
Lucky Baldwin's IPA Festival 6/13/09 - ON TAP
"Oh Russian River, how I adore thee."
this bottle is readily waiting consumption
"Bottle dated 020209, got as an extra, thanks! I was afraid since I have had fresher BP that this would pale in comparison, it kinda did. The hops weren't as lively and the citrus, although bright, wasn't quite what I remember it to be. This was still a great drink, the color was fantastic, aromas were very good lots of grapefruit. I'd be drinking this fresh if it were more available."
A - poured a cloudy golden-honey color with a long lived white head that laced quite well. Patches of bubbles all over the place! Good head retention.
"Pours a very clear, very light amber gold, with a huge and frothy head of yellow-white bubbles. Lacing is good, and the head retention is quite incredible. I'll have to chew through some suds to get to the beer, no doubt."
"This one pours a hazy pure copper color with an inch of frothy and clean white head. The bubbles leave thick, full rings down the sides of the glass. "
Not as good as the Pliny but a very good ipa. Surprisingly drinkable and not too high in alcohol. Finishes very dry and the hop flavor i pronounced without being overwhelming. Not as aromatic as the doubles but a very easy to drink beer and very sessionable. Comes in a 1/2 liter bottle; great size.
"The best IPA I have had in a while. I had this on-tap at Local 44 in West Philly, served in a pint glass"
Re-reviewing this with a much fresher bottle than my previous review(bottle over 6 months old that time). Poured from a 500ml bottle dated 3/26/09 this time.
"The color is a slightly hazy orange, the head was minimal in this pour. The aroma was that of a fresh orange with some slight sweet malt peaking through. The flavor was a little malt sweetness with some floral and citrus hops but not as strong orange as the aroma. A very well balanced IPA."
had on tap at Local 44 in West Philly
"500 ml bottle, dated to 3-26-09. Received via trade thanks to ironlung."
Thanks to Hopheadlouie for the trade! 500ml bottle into a dimpled Löwenbräu mug. (bottled 3.03.09)
A great yellow color with a fantastic sticky head and great lacing. 
"What a nice surpise to see two Russian River brews last night at our Charlotte Oktoberfest meeting. Pliny the Elder was the one I had my eyes on the whole time, but let me tell you . . . this one is just as good, if not even more drinkable. Nice piney hops that we just don't get on the east coast as much. Lots of flavor all the way, a must try."
blind pig
Big thanks to mlaroche to bringing this over from California.
"Another great hoppy beer from Russian River. Though not quite as good as the two Pliny's this did not disappoint at all. Poured to a hazy golden orange, with a strong citrus grapefruit hop nose and taste, a tingly, bitter mouthfeel, and a crisp long finish."
"UPDATE: I tried this beer again and I have to admit, I wasn't as blown away this time as I was before. It is a very good IPA, but really not nearly as special as I described and originally rated. My first score was a 4.85 and the original text is left untouched below."
"Appearance - Perfection in a glass. I'm not gonna give anything less than a 5 here, cause it doesn't deserve anything less. Golden sun color with a faint orange tint. Head was a beautiful creamy froth of about a finger length. Lacing is nothing short of amazing either. Sides are completely caked with white beer batter. Eye candy in every way."
"The appearence is a light cloudy orange with a slight white head receding into a thin halo around the edge. Foamy white lacing sticks to the edges. The nose is a mix of fruity and piney hops blended in nicely with a slight touch of maltiness. The taste is big citrus hops and bitter pine hops. This is far more bitter than i remember it being, almost to a chewy respect with the hops. Mouthfeel is overall pretty carbonated and oily from the hops. Drinkability is very high. I think I could down a couple more glasses of this."
Got this in a trade with Mauerhan...thanks Topher!
Mad thanks to fetus for sending me a much sought after brew!! Been waiting a year to get my hands on one of these fine swine beers!
"Hmmmm, unfortunately I am taking my first try of this well regarded brew from a bottle a little old for my taste. Pours a pure golden color, with a little bit of cloudy bits settling. The head is a nice two finger, overwhelming size, solid white. Nice lacing left after a few sips, this is a well built beer. Aroma has faded a bit, bit I pick up the piney, grassy hop aroma. The taste follows that piney/grassy hop profile, and has luckily held up well. Unfortunately, I there is not enough malt to balance it out, and if I am going to be overwhelmed by hops, I prefer the citrusy route. Very dry in your mouth, crisp, as well. A little less dry, and maybe earthy, and this would be a bit smoother drinking. Obviously a well built beer, but I prefer a different route on my IPA hop selection. Still, I would like to give it another whirl, with a little more fresh bottle."
Pint glass. I'm surprised this is my first rating of this beer. It's medium golden with a nice frothy white head. Retention is good and scattered lacing is left on my glass.
Pours a golden yellow-amber into a snifter with a small bubbly off-white head. Healthy amounts of sticky lacing around the glass as it drains.
Bottle received from tzanio in a recent trade. Thanks! Bottled on 3/3/09. 
bottle says 07/22/08
500 ml bottle received as extra in recent trade with Ghengis22 thanks James...bottled on 3-3-09 poured into duvel tulip
"Presents a big foam on the pour, a good deal of very large bubbles, settles down to the surface quickly leaving a thick, sticky lacing behind. Medium orange to autumnal yellow in color, more transparent at the rims, good brightness throughout. There's a toasty crispness to the nose, the white and pink grapefruit accents penetrate but not violently, retains some honeyed bread crust and cereal aspects, light guava, pineapple, nectarine fruit scents, the malty smoothness is sneaky and mostly before it all dissolves, mainly milk chocolate powder. Medium-bodied, a touch lighter than expected given the expressiveness of the nose, the carbonation more broad than fine, lifts things like an air balloon rather than hang glider. The grapefruit, tangerine, lemon citrus sweeter here and, by the same token, the malts more present and soothing. More grass and grain than bread or cereal, a measured rawness to it. A breeze of spring flowers comes through at the end. Admirable alternation between balanced integration and letting the dog off the leash in the park."
500 ml bottle. Thanks to torchednoodle for the trade!
Poured from bottle into Tulip.
"Draught at the brewery. Gold with a white head. Huge hoppy aroma of pine and grapefruit. Dry, lightly toasted pale malt with lots of bitter, piney hop flavor. A little lighter bodied and dryer than RRIPA, with a very dry and clean finish and lingering bitterness. A pretty big hop charge, but the profile isn't quite as interesting as RRIPA. Love the dry, clean malt profile though"
"My first ever Russian River beer..here goes. Slightly murky orange/brown beer..great off white frothy creamy heid. Nice fresh aromas of piney/spruce like hops..some lemon and honey in the back. Good juicy hops, freshly squeezed or so it feels. Fresh grassy, grapefruit, brown sugar, toasted. Really nice and fresh..you should have this for breakfast! Great palate too..very well done. Overall a great IPA"
"Picked up a pint of this from Wilbur's in Ft. Collins, about five dollars. Bottled on 3/3/09"
Look- nice light orange/gold little to no head some lace.
Thanks to alexd3891 for a bottle of this one. He is very generous and is truly a great BA.
Centennial hops... has to be. This one is awfully close to Bell's 2 Hearted or Ballast Point Big Eye IPA.
Appearance - clear gold with a billowy head.

"500ml Bottle thanks to CaryTheDude. A dull golden color body with a big soapy white head,light to medium carbonation and tuns of stricky lace. Aroma is hoppy, piny,floral and citrus rind,Very nice. Flavor is bitter with some pine up front, a very tasty caramel malt backbone,more citrus hops,a bit of resin,hints of peppercorn,orange peel,just plain juice and balanced,very very good, a nice bitter finish with a hoppy aftertaste, medium body without being sticky feeling at all. A very drinkable top shelf IPA for sure."
500mL bottle received in trade from desaparecido(thanks Edgar!) Poured into pint glass. Pours a deep golden straw color with an inch of soapy white head. Smell is citrus hops. Taste is citrus and pine upfront and biscuitlike maltiness in the end. Super dry mouthfeel drier than any IPA I've ever had. Great drinkability. My first beer from Russian River and I'm very impressed.
A- Hazy orange. Medium bubbly foamy white head. Some messy lacing. Looks great.
"Poured from a bottle into a large red wine glass. Bottled 03/25/09, about a month old."
"A=Golden with ample bright white head, dissipates quickly."
"Beer is straw colored and a bit hazy. Great lacing all the way down the glass. Ample carbonation fizzes its way to the 2 finger head which dies quickly. Nose is pure floral hops, it's pungeant and smells great. Taste is citrus upfront, with some lemon, and a bit bitter but the bitterness is never too powerful as the malts balance this puppy out nicely. Easy to drink and the right level of carbonation for the style. A great IPA."
"Acquired from fogdog courtesy of the 2009 Secret Bunny BIF, so a big ""Thank you"" goes out to him. Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into an imperial pint glass."
Bought this one from an online beer retailer along with numerous other Russian River beers that I have not tried before. Decided to break out a couple of bottles for some nice springlike BBQing.
Wow. Russian River's Blind Pig IPA pours a golden wheat straw color with a thick head the color of clouds ... clouds in heaven. Too much hyperbole? Dig that fresh aroma of hops.
"Appearance- Body is a light gold color with hints of a rich honey color. Continually effervesces. Head is a small, tight white affair with no retention but decent lacing."
"I have two main sources of beer: a large volume chain store, and a small volume specialty store. On a whim, I decided to go to the specialty store tonight... and what do I spy? A BLIND PIG AND A PLINY THE ELDER! I came home, changed my shorts, and am drinking the former as you read this."
"On tap at the Horse Brass, fresh keg:) since it only last about two days once it goes on-line."
500ml bottle poured into a standard pint glass (2 pours).
"Thanks again, raoulduke37!"
"Bottle into goblet. Pours orange/golden, huge fluffy white head, retention, clear, active, some lacing. SMELL is grapefruity hops up front, a prominent sweet malty influence balances the pungent hops. Very nice. TASTE is sharp piny and citrusy hop flavors backed and blending with caramel malty sweetness. They struggle for dominance and compliment each other, but in the end the hoppy bitterness takes over and lingers. FEEL mild fiz and tingle, pleasantly rich and full texture. Some warming and drying in the sharp bitter finish that lingers. OVERALL has an aggressive hoppy attitude and bold attributes that make it seem like an imperial/double amped up something or other, but is fairly mellow in abv. Often balanced it drops its pretentions and packs a solid west coast IPA punch."
Appearance: Poured with an off white frothy head that dissipated to a thin layer leaving some lacing. The beer is a yellow-orange golden color and is clear. 
"From a bottle dated 102208, making it about 6 months old. Appears to have been kept in a refrigerated section at the beer store in Denver."
The 500 ml bottle is very cool. The label is very cool 
"On-tap at Ortino's Northside. $5 for a 10 oz pour. Appeared a clear gold with a thick white head. The aroma is an intoxicating mix of pineapple, grapefruit, floral perfume and pine - amazing. I only wish the flavor could match that amazing smell. Yeah, it's pretty awesome, with a more herbal grapefruit taste and hint of biscuity malts, but the aroma is just top notch. The bitterness level is also pretty spot on. This is damn good IPA."
"This poured a slightly hazy light copper with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like orange and grapefruit hops, with pineapple and honey. It tasted surprisingly mellow, like orange and grapefruit, with some honey and a bit of cream and rose. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was super clean and tasty, with a fresh hops flavor reminiscent of HopSlam. Not overly bitter, and great body, so it was pretty easy to drink. There wasn't much complexity to it, but I think that's ok for an IPA. Just straightforward and delicious hops. This wasn't quite my absolute favorite IPA, but I can't really find a flaw with it. Well done."
"It's a good beer, but either I had a not-quite-up-to-par sample, or it's a bit too old (it was bottled 12-2008 and I'm drinking it 3-2009). I enjoy it, but not A or A+ material. "
"Part of a recent beer haul from Colorado. Supposedly some version of this is claimed to be the first ""West Coast IPA"" so I feel like I'm drinking a little part of history here. Nice and clear amber, good healthy long-lasting head and lacing. Lots of pine and floral hops in the nose. Grainy but light malts take a backseat, but do a decent job at supporting the main flavors of this beer. This is a really nice tasting ale for sure, but I think the best thing about it is that it's so damn drinkable and so flavorful with out being a double IPA and with out being too high in ABV. If I had more I would drink it right now. Russian River knows how to do an IPA. Sho nuff."
Bottled 11/19/08
On-tap at the Memphis Tap Room in Philadelphia...
Cheers to errantknight for throwing this in as an extra!
"Excellent look. More golden in color that other IPA's but the head, oh that head. Creamy in color and texture that looks like a topo map of the Rockies. Wow! Tons of sticky lacing."
Grabbed a pint bottle.. poured into a bomber.. bottled 020209. 6.10% Alc. on this bottle.
A- Nice big white head lay atop a mildly hazed golden colored beer. Head retention and lacing were minimal. 
"Was able to do a vertical - Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder, and Pliny the Younger:"
"like the elder review this is from notes,"
EDIT: Just realized this bottle is nearly four months old. I'll be re-reviewing once I get my hands on a fresher bottle.
Appearance: slightly cloudy golden yellowish / light orange color with a two finger head that slowly fades. Some light lacing develops during the session.
"A damn fine IPA, well crafted and delicious. Have a couple of concerns though, but nothing that would make this sucker any worse than an A rating...so in otherwords, this should be an ipa for many other breweries to aspire to. "
"Appearance: Blind Pig pours an especially pale orange color with minimal cloudiness. It's such a pale shade of orange that it almost borders on yellow. For an IPA, this is unquestionably one of the lighter looking beers I've seen. The color is topped off with a soft foamy white head that only allows for about one finger to appear. There is a normal amount of lacing which makes one wonder if this will be a run-of-the-mill beer with nothing new and exciting to add to the IPA family."
"Pours a bright peachy golden with two inches of nice thick, white, fluffy head. Great pour, very similar to PTE."
"Nearly three fingers of off white head turns rocky and leaves considerable lace as it slowly fades. This nose is very fragrant with oily citrus and even noticeable mellon with a backround spike of pickled pine. Body is a hazy orange amber wheat gold thing going on. On first sip I find this considerably thinner than I was expecting. Hops play more of a backround role on the initial flavor profile. Hop profile is of citrus rind and rustic soft pine. Bitter feel does develop more as you drink but it is more of a mouthfeel as each additional sip douses the bitter. Mouthfeel is only a soft bitter hue. This beer is nicely drinkable, it just lacks some of the attributes of other great IPA's."
"Be in the mood for bitter on this one. It just calls itself an IPA without any IBU rating, so otherwise you might not know. Which brings up the point that maybe this should be classified as something else, or that we need a new name for these really bitter American IPA's. I would guess it's a double IPA, but perhaps it didn't have the higher Original gravity. Anyways, it's a good beer, though I like their Pliney the Elder much better as that has more of the flavor of hops and not just mostly bitterness."
Poured a nice amber color. Sounded good when I poured it if that counts for anything. Excellent lacing. some slight cloudyness.
Got this in a trade with Gilgarp. Thanks again for the chance to try another BA legend.
"Pours very light golden in color. Lots of creamy, foamy white head."
"Poured from a 17oz brown bottle into a clear glass tumbler. Born-on date on label. Singel purchased from Skee Vue Liquors (Breckenridge, CO) for $4.69."
From notes:
"16.9 oz bottle, bottled 093008"
3/6/09 Pint at O'Briens.
Poured from the bottle with this hazy magic golden color that I totally did not expect. It was a pleasant surprise! A slightly gray head.
"Appearance- Pours a thin sudsy whte head with light lacing and poor retention, beer is a tawny gold."
Poured into a pint glass.
"A: Cloudy, golden color with minimal head and lace"
Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass.
"Ah the splendor of Russian River!! First introduced to Pliny the Elder at a great bar in Folsom CA, I was forced to ""settle"" for bottles of Blind Pig from New Seasons in Portland . . . if only all examples of settling were this good!"
"A: 375 ml with a bottling date of 07/09/08 served into a Sam Adams glass. Thanks to session1979 for sending this along as an extra! Beer is slightly hazy with a pale golden color and a 1+ finger head of off-white foam. Great retention that eventually settles to a thin, rocky surface layer. Fine & sticky lacing clings down the entire length of the glass as I drink. Little active carbonation noticeable."
The standard (for an IPA) medium gold color with medium white head which left moderate lacing.
Bottle courtesy of mashmaster... 
Obtained a bottle of this fantastic brew from at a local Whole Foods.
Had this via route66pubs - thanks for sending this!
Thanks to my man rhertan for bringing this back for me.
A: pours a clear gold with no head.
"Very interested to see how this compares to the fantastic Pliny's. Not expected it to live up, but hopefully be in the same family."
500 ml bottle poured into a pint glass. Bottle dated 12/5/08.
appearance: light orange with nice white head. citrus aroma.
"Pours a hazy light orange and a white, 1 finger head, okay retention and a beautiful sheet of lacing. Aroma is a good blend of tropical fruits-pineapple, grapefruit, sweet melon and more floral hops and a light pine and grass edge, only a hint of malt-light and biscuity. Wonderful, intoxicating, not overwhelmingly so-very inviting. "
On-tap at Beachwood BBQ. From notes:
Thanks to BrewerB for this trade another amazing beer!
My first experience with Blind Pig - thanks to ironlung for throwing this one in as an extra in a trade.
"One more pint from Hollingshead Deli, Anaheim. "
"Pours golden amber with just a little bit of haze. Thick and sticky pure white head. Aroma is full of clean citrus. Grapefruit and bubble gum. The flavor comes off as pine right down to the prickly bitter finish. Medium body, but drinks fairly light. Long bitter finish. I can surely see why the west coast guy sing Blind Pig's praises."
500 ML into a snifter/ bottled on 11-19-08 
"It's one of the hardest beers I've ever rated. Some things about it are great, but I'm afraid other things about it are not so great. I'm in the minority here, when I say this isn't one of the better West Coast IPA's. What's even more surprising, at least to me, is that I love Pliny the Elder from Russian River, but really have not warmed up to this at all."
Pretty fresh bottle bought from my local supplier. Poured into my RR pint glass.
Bottled on 7/23/08
"by way of psprings cause he felt bad letting this sit around... bottled 7/22/2008. in all fairness this is going on six months old. still, fantastic though not optimal. "
Thanks to pwoods for the opportunity to try this beer
"500 ml, dated 07-22-08. Moderately fresh I guess."
500mL bottle poured into New Belgium chalice
500mL bottle poured into a tulip.
Bottled on date: 7/22/08. Consumption date 2/4/09 - almost half a year which may impact experience. 
A slightly hazy orange with a small but sticky white head.
"Hazy light orange body. Bubbly ivory white head. Lace is abundant and web like. Aroma is outstanding. Everything that is good about hops with a little backdrop of sweet malt. It's fresh, grassy, piney, abundantly citrusy and fruity with pineapple and grapefruit nuances. Exquisite nose. The body of this beer is light and thin. Carbonation quite low. Bitterness quite high. The bitterness is actually pretty scathing for an IPA. Jagged and rough. Hop flavors are more in the background, with some lemon rind and grassiness coming to mind. Malt load could use a little boost to add a little more balance, a little more body and a little more flavor. This is decent. Although Smelling the beer was the climax of this experience. If/when I order more Russian River, I'll definitely be hitting up the Elder (and the Younger hopefully) before hitting this up again."
"Half liter, bottled on 072208. Courtesy of MASPuros."
Thanks to bring for the opportunity to try this one!
"This beer pours a very clear amber with a 1 fingered white head and lots of lacing. The smell is big of citrus hops, grapefruit to be exact. The tast is very smooth and has a nice blance of hops and malt, lots of citrus flavors. A nice mouthfeel with a good carbonation level. A decntly drinkable beer, I will search it out again."
500 mL bottle tried 10 Oct 2008.
"Received in trade from TexIndy, Thanks for the opportunity!"
From a 0.5L bottle purchased locally poured into an imperial pint glass. Resiny hops fill the nose with citrus and pine. A golden color with a small white head. Flavor is forward with the hops followed by smooth malt. Crisp lingering bitterness. Carbonation is low and the finish is dry making this beer very drinkable. I could drink this all day long.
"Growler. Pours a clear light orange with hardly any head. Aroma of citrus hops, crackery malt, and grassy hops. Flavor is bitter initially with citrusy notes in the finish. This is much better than the bottle version I had previously -- the malt base stands out better and the hops are not so bitter. Nice and supremely drinkable. I definitely joined this more the second time around."
Big thanks to t0rin0 for this one.
"Not being a IPA drinker, this was a nice mellow IPA. When poured, the color was a slightly hazy medium golden yellow with a orange hue. The smell of piney aroma filled the nose. The taste of priney resins and citrus, like grapefruit, orange and a hint of lime hit the taste buds. This IPA is one of the better ales that doesn't have that heavy bitterness or super tart feel in the mouth or on the palate. Just a nice pleasant, rich taste. Another great beer from Russian River Brewing!"
When brewing at home you always have an idea about how you want a batch to turn out. I now know that until I get close to reaching the level of this beer. I know I will never be happy! 
Mucho thanks to JWD for this bottle.
"500 ml bottle I got from Douglas14. Thanks a lot again, man. Served up in an imperial pint. "
"Received a bottle from bbothen in my first beer trade. 24oz. brown bottle with a Burnt Sienna label featuring the ""Blind Pig"" logo and text written in Comic Sans typeface."
Had this on tap many times and i'm finally ready to review this IPA. Served in a 15oz stemmed glass at Union Jacks.
"I got this growler at Big Z's beverage in Huntington, LI. Who has recently won best distributor on Long Island. I got an email from mark who says its a ""must try"". The color is a hazy amber color. Little to no head, with excellent lacing. The aroma is like of a piny forest of hops. The flavor is sweet, with a huge hop kick. Flavor not bitter. It has a long mouthfeel where the hops hang out on the back of your throat and it pleads for another sip. I could sit and finish the keg. This is my first experience with russian river brewing company. I cannot wait to try any and all of their beers. Keep up the good work!!!"
"I got this on the growler fill at Big Z - an excellent find in NY! Poured it into one of those Sam Adams bubble glasses, which do not hold a full pint. Maybe it's 13 oz. - I'm not sure."
"Bottle, thanks to swnicholson, full pour into a Weizen glass. "
"A- Very light yellowish orange. Very clear and took an agressive poor to get a couple of inches of head. Head did not stick around, but there was a thin film over the beer the entire time. "
My first sampling of this from a bottle. Poured into a pint glass. It's pretty fresh too.
I'm not surprised that Russian River has made this wonderful IPA. I was given a sample of this beer at Beachwood BBQ and not told what it was. 
"Picked this one up in LA about two weeks ago and brought it back home with me. Bottle date within 60 days of drinking. Poured into my Duvel tulip. Really nice looking IPA. Big white head, crisp clear light orange/gold, with tons of lacing. Smells of pine, grapefruit, lemon, and a hit of malty sweetness in the back. Flavor follows the nose, and this one is super delicious. It's nicely hopped, but the balance between the pale malts and hops is really remarkable. Very clean, crisp, on the lighter side of medium bodied. Super easy drinking. If this were readily available around me, it would be my go-to IPA. Alas, it is not, but I am really glad I tried it. Will try to get it again."
"This is a wonderful beer. I'd like to do a side by side comparison with its brother, Pliny the Elder. "
This bottle of Blind Pig was dated on 9/30/08 and drank 1/17/09. Many strident pleadings on the label to not age the beer and drink fresh.
"bottle courtesy of my favorite troll under the bridge, Patronwizard. Vic, talking to you reminds me to spend my donation in to the Special Olympics."
"Had this a few times now, I guess it's time to review it. Received in a few different trades thanks to MiScusi and swnicholson. Thanks!"
Bottle: Poured a clear golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus and floral hops are clearly dominating with some notes of bitter hops are also clearly identifiable. Taste is also dominated by a complex and well built hop profile which provide a very good and complex mix between some citrus and bitter notes. Malt profile is kept very low in the mix but can still be felt. Full body with great carbonation. Quite a handful though and not your typical session IPA.
"Had this while visiting San Diego last October. This poured a light amber color with a medium sized but full off-whiite head and very nice walls of lace. The aroma is strictly IBU's, the classic cat piss loveliness if you are so inclined. A modicum of low lying malt. The flavor tells you drink me! The piss and vinegar is still there but it is beautifully mellowed with a sweet melon and apple accent over a very mild malt base. This really becomes highly drinkable after the first few swallows. The bitter hops have their way and it's quite respectable. Great choice, try it quick!"
"Picked up a 500 ml. bottle of the Blind Pig to settle a few arguments I've had. Not having been overly impressed with the draft version, I thought I'd remove one last layer of contention by going the bottle route. At $4.19 for 500ml this is somewhat expensive by San Diego standards, as I could get a 22 oz. of Alesmith IPA for the same price for example And next time, believe me, I will. Oops, did I say that out loud? Bottled on 11/19/2008."
hazy golden color with very low carbonation. thin white foamy head which settles pretty quickly to a lace leaving a trail right down to the end of the glass.
"Bottled on 11/19/08, purchased online from South Bay Drugs"
pours a surprisingly vibrant and bright coppery lemon color with a immense frothy head. great retention and lacing.
Cool label reminds you repeatedly not to age this beer. Mine says bottled on 7/9/08. I bought it in December and drank it today (1/9/09). So it has been around for a little while but not too long.
"The beer was served in a Chimay chalice glass. Golden yellor color with not much head, but some lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma was full of fresh hops. The flavor matches the aroma. It is very hoppt. A perfect beer for hopheads. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, cleansing the palate with all the hop bitterness. This is very drinkable, but if your not a fan of hops, stay away from this beer and leave it for those of us that like over the top brews."
Served from a 500ml bottle
A: Poured a darkened lemon with amber and slightly charred copper highlights. Head was minimal. While the retention and lacing were not noticeable this was filled to the top of the pint glass and exuded a menacing and welcoming tone. 
This refreshingly hoppy beer did not disappoint. Not intensely hop ridden but still noticeable within the aftertaste. The hops finished off with a sweet and pleasantly strong aroma. With a clear golden appearance this beer is both easy to drink and quite satisfying as well.
Enjoyed this on tap at the RR Brewpub itself. 
A - Pours a clear and golden. Nice clear white head that stays during the drink.
On-tap at TJ's in Paoli; served in a pint
"More impressed with this beer, not sure if it was fresher from bottle than from the keg i reported a while back. couple people preferred this to the Pliny. Pliny I thought blew it away. more IBU's in this? seemed to have an edgier bitter finish. nice nose. not sure if the price on this is much less than pliny, alc is much less, maybe go for this when looking for a lower alc beer. 4.0 across the board"
500ml bottle poured in to a large chalice. Bottled on 09/05/08.
"I know Vinnie is not a big believer in ""aged"" IPA's, and generally I tend to agree with him. However, I recently came across this beer at my ""home town"" Market of Choice in West Linn, a store notorious for not rotating its stock in a timely manner. This particular bottle of Blind Pig was dated 7/29/08."
"I heard raves about Russian River and now I know why. Very nice for its style. Hoppy taste, almost like juniper berries, but still drinkible. Color and smell are both outstanding. I had to go to San Deigo to find it as none of the Vegas stores carry it."
"Very light amber-yellow colored pour with a big fluffy head that evaporates rapidly. Heavy citrus aroma, mainly grapefruit and a little malt. Very dry, much more so than Pliny the Elder. Nearly as good as that beer though, another huge winner from Russian River."
This is the first beer I ordered through the mail - from South Bay Drugs in Imperial Beach CA.
500 ml bottle poured into a tumbler. Consumed on Christmas Eve day.
Fresh bottle
"bottled 10/22/08, poured 12/28, .5L bottle. this has been showing up on tap quite a bit here in Philly over the past several months, and I've been totally impressed. In fact I'll take this over Elder (which has been on tap here with even more frequency) just about any day. As one beloved corporation would say this beer is all about drinkability (ok ok I'm sorry). I'm glad to finally be sitting down and putting some thought into this experience. Anyways, the pour grows into a finger high blanket of dense creamy head, which slowly erodes back into my pint glass, leaving behind a nice coat of sticky looking lace. hazy and golden..."
"Aroma: Huge, clear citrusy hop nose. Floral hop aromatics all over the place. Light sweet maltiness in the background but this bad boy is all about the hop."
"I poured from a 500 ml bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a golden yellow with a thick, lucious, white head. The head has nice staying power and leaves beutiful lacing. The aroma is of pine potpouri. Like any good IPA the taste is heavy on pine notes. The resin in this one coats your tongue and stays around for a while. There is a malty backbone that lets it have some balance. This pig is medium bodied with decent carbonation. It goes down very nice. Probably the best IPA I have had, it is a DIPA with a lower ABV."
A - Golden delicious with a white head that lingers and lacing as if it were Victorian curtains.
A- pours a really nice inch or so head yellow with a nice slight white head with lots of lacing
"This is how you do an IPA. Hell, there's more going on in this IPA than in most DIPAs on the market."
Poured chilled into my imperial pint glass. 
"Blind Pig, pours out beautifully. Cloudy lemon peel yellow body, with shades of orange highlights. Ample carbonation, head, and retention."
"I went to the local New Seasons market to buy Pliny the Elder and found the Blind Pig as an additional surprise. Hadn't seen this one in the stores here before, and gladly picked up a couple. "
Thanks to 0110x0110 via SS08 for this one. Been waitin a long time. Bottled on date of 090508 so this one is super fresh. 
A - pours with golden color with light head.
"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours clear gold with a nice white head. Floral hop aroma, some pine, and just a little grapefruit. Sharp hop taste up front, resin flavors dominating the citrus, with a caramel back. Overall, a great IPA with strong hop flavors but with a light body."
Some of these reviews mad e me laugh and some made me cry - but on with the beer. 
"Poured from a 500ml bottle (bottled on 7/23/08) into a pint glass. It was a hazy golden color with a tinge of orange and tons of tiny yeast bits floating around. It had a carb fountain in the center and great lacing. It had a finger and a half of white head that slowly, slowly dissipated into a thick foam that was constantly fed by the carb. The bottle strongly encourages you to drink fresh and not let age. I checked a couple places and this was the freshest I could find in Denver during my trip so hopefully still a good example."
"A very good, citrusy IPA of the west coast variety. I enjoyed it very much. Appearance was golden, with moderate head and good retention. Smell was fantastic, like raw hops. Man I love that smell. Taste was slightly piney, and a little grapefruit. Mouthfeel was moderate, not super heavy or light. Drinkability was very good, I could drink 6 of these quite easily."
My last bottle of Blind Pig. Thanks to Nanoslug for this one. 500ml bottle dated from July - I'd expect fresher to be even better. (I'll try to draw on my memory of the bottle I had a few months ago to supplement this review)
Much thanks to 0110x011 for this bottle! My first Blind Pig. I've been looking forward to this!
"A delicious IPA! Very pleasant citrus and floral aroma. A nice lingering aftertaste, with hints of grapefruit and fresh hops. This beer really has everything I'm looking for in an IPA. The drinkability is insanely high. Blind Pig is amazingly tasty and refreshing, and would be easily chuggable. Fresh hops with a wonderfully smooth feel. It would be a regular beer for me, if only it was available where I live."
"I missed this while at Russian River last year. I've had the opportunity to have this in the bottle, and on tap at three different locations."
Thanks to Azurelimits for this great extra.
"I truly and with full honesty think this beer deserves a perfect score. This India Pale Ale has everything a true hophead would ever want in a beer. My favorite by far, and I've had a lot of IPAs. "
"A: Sea foam froth, the color of wet straw, line of head around the edge, minimal carbonation visible in the beer - 4.25, S: Absolutely loaded with grapefruity and citrusy hops, though hops dominate the nose there is a nice solid malt build - 5.00, T: Heaps of hops from the beginning to the end of this beer, semi-dry and bitter, has elements of freshly cut grass and pine sap - 4.50, M: 4.00, D: An extremely solid representation of the style, hops play the main role and hence this is a beer every hophead should seek - 4.50"
"Pours a crystal clear light golden color, with a huge neverending fluffy white head."
lynx1245 brought some goodies down for us. Thanks Trevor!
Big thanks to Skourtis for the bottles of this fine nectar
I was able to try Blind Pig on tap at Capone's Black Friday on 11/28/2008. They served it to me in a Budweiser pint glass. It's probably going to be the only time these two breweries will ever be in a sentence together. It was the only thing they had and it was clean. That's good enough for me.
Got this growler at Capones.
First off I need to give props to Matt at capones for always having such and exeptional take out and on draft list..especially during the draft events. He does it up top notch. 
This is a damn good IPA. I am glad they bottle it now.
"Poured from a bottle into a tall glass, a clear golden color with a big active frothy head. Could be filtered."
Picked up a couple bottles of Blind Pig at Belmont Station a couple of weeks ago... shared one.. tonight.. this one is all mine.... poured into my Chimay goblet.
"A - slightly coudy, but clear golden color with creamy head"
I'm finally going to review this beer. I have been trying to steer away from it for reasons unknown.
"This is my first review in some months, time to try again."
500ml Bottle from Beverages4 less in Santee.
Thanks to gford217 for hooking me up with this tasty brew!
I brought this bottle of Blind Pig home with me from Denver back in October. I was there for the GABF and stopped off at the Argonaut to grab a few beers not available in Texas. Thank god for bubble wrap.
Thanks to gford217 for the LIF and trade!
500 ml bottle into a tulip glass. Thanks to brentk56 or this in the recent Secret Halloween BIF. 
500 ml bottle.
A- Translucent rusty copper color with a moderate fluffy off white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Effervescence is on the level of Alka Seltzer.
"Poured from bottle into a DFH snifter. Pours a clear, orange color with a small rocky white head. Soft carbonation and light lacing around the glass."
"Got this one as an ""I'm sorry"" beer from SmokingmeX. Stand up guy."
"Ah, the ol' Piggy pours a clear amber, topped with a frothyhead of ivory in the Bitburger pilsner glass. The rocky top certainly leaves thick ring laces on the way down."
"bottled on 22JUL08 meaning that this beer is about 4 months old, I don't know if there will be some distinct reduction in hops, I think it should be ok"
drank on 11.12.08 at home. got in a trade - thanks russpowell.
This was my appetizer before I went and had my Pliny the Elder. Both of these were available at the Falling Rock Tap House on tap.
"Bottle purchased at Liquor Max in Loveland, CO. Pours hazy orange with an average, white head, mostly lasting with good lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (grain, hay, straw), heavy hops (flowers, pine, citrus), average yeast (dough, sweat) with notes of apple, pear, and peach. Medium bodied, mineral texture, lively carbonation, and a bitter finish. Long duration, light sweetness, moderate acidity, and heavy bitterness."
Just got this today in a trade with bring. Thanks for the opportunity to try this! 500 ml bottled on 9/30/08.
"bottle brewed 6 weeks ago poured into a tulip glass has a nice orange ice tea color and a thick one finger white head that retained rather well and laced the glass nicely. aroma has juicy grapefruit hops, citrus peels, pine, orange zest, and underlying malts. perfumed and enticing. mouth feel is medium with biting carbonation and good coating. flavor is all about the hops, (pine, grapefruit, citrus), sweet enough to keep the bitterness down, and just enough caramel malt to keep the hops balanced. finish has a long duration of hops coating. very good and extremely fresh tasting."
From a 16.9 ounce bottle. About three weeks from bottling date. 
A: Clear light golden body and small white head.
The second and final bottle of Blind Pig from the small shipment of Cali selections I made while visiting Holiday Liquors in Escondido.
"My other RR IPA find at Beverage Warehouse last weekend. Bottled September 5, 2008. The bottle keeps telling me not to age it, so I figured I'd better drink it before I went out of town for a week. Fairly aggressive pour into a pint glass."
Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass. 11/03/08. Bottled on 090508.
Enjoyed on tap at Backcountry Pizza in Nederland. Pours an orangish brown with a silky beige head. Nice lacing. 
"500ml bottle received as an extra from Mauerhan (thanks Topher). Bottled on 072208 and served in my Ayinger Becker. Poured a translucent orange-gold with tiny bubbles in solution. 1.5 inch fluffy white head embedded with craters left behind strands of lacing as it receded. Nose was sweet grapefruit, piney hops and a light grainy quality in the back. Grapefruit sweetness is diminished in the mouth and hops bitterness is amplified. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a bitter/astringency that lingers between quaffs. Top notch IPA. Not my style per se, but I can really appreciate the quality of this brew."
Many thanks to brother BA mikesgroove for this gem. Consumed on 11/01/08.
A - Poured from a 500mL Bottle (That's 1 pint .9 Fluid oz). Has brew date of 09/05/08. Very enticing amber-ish color. Nice full head. - Starts to evaporate almost immediately though. Leaves lacing all the way down the glass - an intricate array of stalagmites and stalagtites (sp?). Carbonation continues throughout the entire drinking experience.

"A - Golden with orange tints, slightly hazy but much clearer than I was expecting, 2 fingers of foamy head the remains for a while and then settles into sticky lacing."
"Shipped with Pliney and other CA goods from Joey at Southbay! Poured on Halloween into a 20z Guinness pint with Velvet Underground Sister Ray playing in the background on a perfect Halloween Friday. The Belgium beer fest fell on Halloween a couple of years ago and Blind Pig would have been one hell of a costume, better than my Sponge Bob get up."
"A: Gold with fluffy, white head, good retention, excellent lacing. It just doesn't look better than this."
"After having the beer on tap six months ago, the beer brings back some serious memories. Opening with a crystal clear golden color, great head formation, and equalled retention. Soft but delicate hop flavor and aromatics give a juicy burst of grapefruit, orange zest, perfume, and fresh-cut grasses. Very fresh, inviting, and invigorating. Maltiness is very crisp, clean, and with a cracker-like, delicate caramel taste. Hoppy, but not unnecessarily bitter or bitey. Maltiness gives the beer structure without interfering with sweetness or mouthfeel. It is the opidome of the American IPA style! Sill, I really enjoyed it more on tap."
this is the end in some ways of a long circle of trading. The ending: many thanks to jhenry04 for the chance to try this beer! Your generosity is appreciated.
"This beer poured a cloudy orange color with a huge fluffy white head. It also has great lacing. The aroma is an initial hop pop in the old olfactory system. There are definite fruit (grapefruit), floral and slight caramel notes. The taste is initially very hoppy - bitter. There are grapefruit note and a slight hint of sweetness. It is a bit one-sided with hops...could use a bit more malt backbone for balance. There is a lingering bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. There is a residual slickness that coats the tongue. Overall, this is an excellent hoppy brew. Definitely works to satisfy a lupulin urge."
Nice big head with excellent retention with a cloudy orange color. 
"Ahh, my first foray into Russian River beers, thanks to BGThang. And it won't be my last (thanks yet again...)!"
A: Pours an orange/amber with vibrant straw-colored highlights. Multi-finger soapy off-white head leaves sheets of white lacing peeling down the glass.
"A: A clear yellow/golden brew. Nice, full bodied and frothy head - very thick and lasts a while. Leaves great lacing."
Who wears a boy tie anymore? Pours a mostly cloudy orange color with a more light tan hue through out. A good fizzy white head which settles down after some time. Good retention and lacing.
Thanks to Midaszero for the extra.
A: Nice clear golden hue with a rather fluffy white head
Big thanks to 0110x011 for this one in my LNBA BIF box!
"500 ml brown bottle, bottled on 7-9-08"
A: Gold with a small white head and great lacing.
A-An almost glowing golden color...nice lacing on the glass.
A big thanks goes to ducksfan for this one.
"Picked up at Holiday Wine Market in Escondido (San Diego), CA. Super friggin' excited to try after having a love affair with Russian River's Pliny the Elder and Damnation."
Pours a nice orangey color with nice head that quickly dissipates. Nice lacing that lasts throughout the glass. Nice piney/citrus hop flavor and smell but not overly bitter. This is a beer that I could drink alot of and hopefully one day will be able to easily.
"This will be the second beer I have tried from Russian River, Supplication being the first, and Pliny soon to be the third. Many many thanks to my big sister, Christian for tracking it down during her stay in San Diego. Poured in to a snifter so as to hopefully rouse some of the aroma. Beer was served just above room temperature, chilled is a good way of putting it. Appearance is a cool gold, and heading is about one finger. The head quickly fades in to a thin white lacing with good retention. Oily hops come to mind first in the aroma, then come citrus fruits such as pineapple and tangerine. Mild earth smells also show themselves to an extent. Taste is composed of grassy hop resins, bit of tobacco, cream and orange jump in at times. Mouthfeel is intense in its bitterness. It leaves the tongue feeling a little numb. Malt presence could possibly be lifted a bit to balance the hops, but overall this is still hardly a problem. Blind Pig strikes me a being a session IPA for people who really bitter, hoppy brews, I wish I had a few more bottles. Final thoughts: This is a very solid India Pale. I wasn't exactly blown away, but that is fine. Instead, I am left feeling very satisfied and refreshed. I can imagine this being a regular in my fridge if only it were available in my state...maybe one day. Cheers"
Shout out to mattolesh for sending me another quality brew from Russian River.
"I dig the label....""Don't age me!"""
"Served in a nonic pint. Rarely available in these parts (Philly)...so every drop is to be savored, its that good. "
Sampled from a 500ml bottle purchased at City Beer Store in SF.
on tap @ monk's in philly
this beer pours a fairly cloudy yellow with hints of orange. the head is very minimal with a few bubbles clinging to the glass.
I poured this one from a 16.9oz (500ml) brown bottle into an imperial pint glass.
Rec'd bottle courtesy of slayer3604. Thanks for the opportunity and for being a good trader!
Poured this 16.9 oz. brown bottle into a Stone Levitation glass. Bottled on 072208. The pale golden body was hazier on the second half of the pour. The head was a creamy off-white. A film of foam remained throughout but left minimal lacing. 
"I'm not a hophead by any means, but this beer is hop heaven."
"Presentation: 500 ml bottle, orange label with a pig in dark glasses and a cane. Several warnings to drink this beer fresh - this was bottled on 07/22/08. ABV clearly marked at 6.1"
"Sampled from bottle- pours a cloudy light orange, minimal soapy head. Nose- sweet candied fruit, light piney perfume. Taste- soapy juicy grapefruit rinds, light biscuity malts. Medium bodied hop delivery vehicle. Oily hops leave a dry finish with some orange aftertaste. Very good IPA"
"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle, bottled on 07/22/08 into a pint glass."
"A ~ Bottled 07-08-08. 500 ml Into an unmarked mason jar. This beer pours a hazy, clouded golden color with a firm, foamy head. Towers of tiny bubbles build through the glass & settle at the bottom of the head, supporting the remaining crown of foam. Broken patches of sticky lace line the jar. This beer is ""purdy as a pig."""
"Paid $3.99 for a 16.9 oz bottle from Monument Liquor in Concord, CA. Poured into a pint glass."
Thanks to Kevin and his crappy fantasy baseball team for this beauty.
A: coppery/amber color.. good lacing from a medium white head
"Even though this has likely been around longer (assuming this is pretty close to the original homebrew recipe), I can't help but compare this to the Odell IPA I'm so familiar with. Honestly, they're VERY similar, which is actually a great thing. I personally think the Odell IPA is the best one in the country and this brew is nearly identical. Perhaps great minds think alike?"
Tried this on tap @ hollingsheads in Orange back in early August. I'd never herd of it but the tap handle looked cool and it said ipa. I speak that language! I loved the stuff. Kenny always has something worth checking out. So get down there if your in the area! This Review is from a bottle i got at Coit Liquor on Union St. in the city.
"Pours a cloudy light orange, with a quarter inch of fluffy white head. Smells strongly of citrus and pine. Taste is very bitter, with a moderate amount of grapefruit and other citrus. Just a little bit two-dimensional with the flavor--it was a bit weak, and the bitterness overpowered the citrus part of it. Carbonation is just right, and the lightness makes it a very drinkable beer. Overall, an impressive IPA, but the flavor could have been a notch more complex."
Thanks go out to pwoods for the opportunity to try this. 500ml bottle with a born on date of 07-22-08. Neat bottle with a humorous blind pig on the bottle - go figure!
"Thanks to brdc for sending this my way. It's not to often that I get to pour a Russian River beer into my Russian River shaker glass so I dusted it off just for this. Appears a lightly cloudy, golden yellow color with a healthy two fingers of white foam. Smells of hops - pine, citrus(mainly lemon), and sweet malt. Just like the nose, the taste lets you know there's hops in here. Bitter hops prevail with notes of pine needles, lemon, grapefruit, lime and orange peel followed by a nice mildly toasted caramel malt backbone. Slightly oily on the tongue with medium carbonation and body. Wow, this went down rather quickly. I prefer a little more balance in an IPA (Two Hearted is my standard), but this was really great and I'll certainly seek it out again."
"Got this bottle along with a bunch of other RR stuff in a trade with Jhenry04, thanks Jason."
"Thanks to BradLikesBrew for this one! Hope you enjoyed the Surly, man!"
"Poured into a pint glass, nice golden color and good foamy head. "
Bottle purchased from City Beer Store.
Poured from a .5L bottle to a pint glass the liquid is light gold with good carbonation. The head is white close to 2 fingers and leaves little lace.

Thanks to Mikesgroove for this bottle! An extra in a recent trade.
Thanks mikesgroove...
"Got this one in a trade, thanks Oxymoron! Poured this into my pint glass..."
A great West Coast style IPA. This beer lives up to the hype.
"A- Bright orange, oily looking, mostly clear in the body with very sticky lace and a decent 1/4"" head consisting of both micro-bubbles and looser, patchy bubbles. A beautiful beer; that's for sure."
Bottled on July 22 2008
Many thanks to paulthebeerguru for the opportunity to consider this one.
"I think this is absolutely one of the best IPAs around, with definite hop dominance, but plenty of malt character, flavour, range, and depth to back this up and keep it very interesting."
"Really what can I say about this beer that has not been said already. A load of hops in the aroma, the smell of pine is definitely persistent. Lovely copper color. Then to the taste, wow lots of hops, yet not overpowering. Smooth finish for being as hoppy as it is. I was expecting to be punched by the hops, but I was just pushed in the face a little bit. Nice smooth mouth feel. This is a surprisingly drinkable IPA for the amount of hop kick it exudes. Loved the beer and can't wait to go and have another one."
500ml bottle: Acquired from HopHead84 as an extra in a recent trade. Thanks Shane!
Pours a hazy orange amber with a solid white head and nice lacing.
"This is a truly great IPA! Upon pouring into my pint class whiffs of sweet bitter hops had my salivary glands a pumping. She pours clean and golden but with some small particulates floating about. Nose is off the hook, everything a like in an IPA Piney, tart, fruity and tangy - yummy. Flavor follows nose - spot on! Hops provide a blasting bitterness which is tempered with sweetness. This is very drinkable beer that just rolls over the tongue, drink after drink...I need some more please!"
"A: Two full fingers of foamy head; great retention, strong lacing on the glass, beautiful golden color"
"Big thanks go out to mikesgroove for providing this. It arrived yesterday, and since the bottle tells me not to age it, down it goes!"
"Pours a beautiful honey color, bright off white head, that fades fairly quickly. Smell is an amazing cornucopia of hops with grapefruit & pine notes both present. Taste is a bit of a let down compared to the amazing aroma. I know it's an ipa, and as such a healthy dose of hops is expected, but a bit more balance would've been more enjoyable. Mouthfeel is great, not too sticky, not too watery. A really good ipa. Here in the NW we're a bit spoiled, so maybe i'm biased. But still, a great beer that i would enjoy having again."
"500 ml bottle from the first delivery to Colorado (bottled 072208). Two finger of oranged yellow head over a hazed and particulated straw liquid (orange tint). Smells like a hop pellet. Grassy, oranges, lemon, with minimal lemon pith."
Thank you MMAJYK for the brew.
Got this from raiser in the New Trader BIF Redux!!
"Pours a straw colored gold in color. About half a inch of head develops on the pour. Smell is very citrusy and juicy. Wonderful. Taste is even more citrusy and juicy hops than appear in the nose. Light, bitter, but exploding with juciness. I love this. It's an overused expression, but, I could drink this all day long and never tire of it. I might even go out on a limb and say that I'm enjoying this more then the PtE. Would love to have this around regularly. "

"poured from bottle into pint glass. deep golden color with a nice white head. i was instantly hit by an intense mix of serious hops, lemon citrus and pine scents. WOW this beer smells intense. "
"Poured a nice golden color with a respectable white head that fell to a film. Smell is off the charts. Resiny, piney hop oil, floral tangerine and slightly grassy. Wow! Taste is no disappointment either! Hops take the drivers seat, citrus and pine play well together and are followed by a grassy, earthy, white bread. Mouthfeel is slick and soapy. Full bodied hop-tastic!"
"Now listening to: Curtis Mayfield - If There's A Hell Below, We're All Going To Go"
"WOW! Best IPA I have ever had. Went to Libations for the first time and had to pick this up. $5 can't beat it. Poured into a pint glass and was not disappointed. The color was a beautiful golden honey with a perfect 3/4 inch white head. Carbonation slowly spewing from a geyser at the bottom of the glass. The smell was amazing, strong notes of citrus with a small amount of wood (pine). Taste was GREAT, Strong citrus( grapefruit and tangerine) with a bitterness that beautifully lingers."
"Pours a deep orange with good clarity, especially creamy foam on the surface. Slight haze of micro sediment, and some upward streams of lazy bubbles. "
500ml bottle poored into a pint glass. Thanks for sending this one Rick!
a: Hazy orange body with a thin white head.
"Bought this 500ml bottle from Lone Hill Liquors. Poured a bright golden amber color with a thin light head. Hops galore on the nose, with hints of fresh pine & citrus. A perfect balance of malt and hops, very well structured. It had a smooth, dry mouthfeel with even carbonation and left a lingering bitterness on the palate. This is a superb, very drinkable I.P.A. and makes me wish I lived closer to the Russian River."
Thanks to fiveo2270 for this one brought straight back from the Brewery!!
Thanks to bitterbill for this one!
Poured into my new Sam Adams glass. I can see the bubbles from the etched circle at the bottom of the glass. It's working! It's working!
Pours light orange/tangerine color with a noce bubbly 1 finger head. 
Poured from a 500mL bottle (dated 7-22-08) into a pint glass.
"Nice yellow color, much lighter than the Pliny I had earlier. Smells good, some of that west coast. Very hoppy flavor and only slightly bitter. Probably too easy to drink. I think Russian River will have no problem selling beer in Colorado. I will buy it all."
Big thanks to brewCzar for the chance to try this!
Had this beer on-tap at Hollingshead...this is what I thought:
Pour produced a very light haze and a medium golden color. Inch and a half white colored head retained a few minutes. Average amount of meandering carbonation. Lacing is big sticky clumps.
Bottle date 7/8/08
Thanks to mikesgroove for this fantastic brew.
Cheers to jerz for this brew in a trade. Pours with a thin head. Fairly light in color for an IPA. Huge nose of pine hops. Tastes mostly of pine but with a bit of citrus. Mouthfeel is smooth & this is a drinkable big hoppy beer. Kind of tastes like the Elder minus the roids. Recommended & worth seeking.
Thanks goes out to cstrack for this brew.
Poured from a 500ml bottle into a New Belium tulip.
"I bought this beer at the SOMA Whole Foods in San Francisco, after picking up a Pliny the Elder last week, and am currently kicking myself for not trying Russian River beers sooner."

"On draught at Belmont Station, served in a pint glass, Blind Pig is a clear yellow with a medium sized, creamy white head that leaves very nice lace. On the paler side for an IPA, which I really like sometimes. "
Bottle from BrewerB in a trade - thanks! Poured the whole thing into a 22 oz. Terrapin snifter.
Russian River- Blind Pig
"A: snifter. nice amber color, more orange than yellow. pure white head with outstanding retention, and nice hanging lacing."
Found this on tap at Hollingshead's Delicatessen - The appearance was very cloudy but the bartender just changed the keg and I got the first pour. Talk about FRESH this beer was like I died and gone to Heaven. Big fruity burst of Peaches and melon. The mouthfeel was very silky and thick like a beer milkshake! The drinkabilty was off the chart. I had a roastbeef and blu cheese sandwich that went pretty well with this tasy IPA.
A - Golden orange with a thick frothy off-white head. Good retention and lacing.

500mL bottle (care of swnicholson- thanks!!) poured into my sam adams glass. Bottle very clearly displays bottled on 070808. Props to russian river for displaying the date so clearly- there's no searching the bottle for a tiny stamped on date that's always illegible (think victory).
"poured into an imperial pint glass. amber color, fluffy off white head, tons of lacing."

Big thanks to Joey for getting this one across to me so quickly. I have been itching to try this one for a while and finally a bottle is made and I can get my hands on it. Very nice 500ml bottle is served up chilled and poured into a tall pilsner glass. Consumed on 08/04/2008.
Presented in a 500ml bottle purchased at Lone Hill Liquor in Glendora for the paltry sum of $4.99. Poured into a mug.

Bottle courtesy of thequeue poured into a snifter.
Pours a straw golden color with a nice off white head that fades into a foamy top. 
"500ml bottle from Texas poured into Ports 7th Ann Real ale glass. Poured a golden color with tons of hazy particles of hop floating around. The head was thick white and very fluffy with great lacing. Smell is grapefruit citrus, some pine, and malt aroma. Taste is very strong fresh cut grass and pine with a dry peppery malt taste and grapefruit rind bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium body with a creamy carbonation level. The hops and mouthfeel makes this an IPA you can get addicted to. Diffently a border line double IPA with the amount of hops and high IBU taste but not with the big malt content and alcohol alot of doubles have. AS an american IPA for sure the hoppiest out there with great balance and flavor to boot."
"Pours a honey gold in color, slight haze, with a decent sized, fairly bright white fluffy head that slowly recedes leaving some lacing behind. Aroma is a nice sweet citrus aroma of grapefruit, tangerines and mangoes. A softer sweetness of cotton candy accentuates this and a strong grassiness in the aroma as well. Taste follows with a good amount of lemon, grapefruit, and citrusy hops as well as a large dose of grassiness that cresendoes towards a good sized bitterness that is also slightly peppery. Mouthfeel is light to medium, prickly hops and carbonation on the tongue up front transisition to a peppery bite at the back and a drying finish. Very drinkable ipa, could session this one without much trouble. Really enjoyed the decent amount of pure bitterness. Thanks Scott for the opportunity."
500ml bottle
"Bottle, thanks Dr. Bill! Light golden color with a wispy foam that lasts well. Very nice nose, which is dominated by very bright woodsy hops, with other light notes of resin and lemon from the hops. Flavor hoppiness and bitterness is very bold and impressive, and lingers in the finish very well. The hops are raw, pure, well utilized and again, they linger well after the swallow. Flavor hops are similar to the nose and can best be described as very woodsy. A minor critique, it doesn't have a lot of body, but the finish makes up for it. Overall, really nice IPA."
"Last night provided me with possibly the worst beer experience yet. However, I hope get that sour taste out of my mouth with one of the highest regarded IPA's around, now in bottles! Lots of anti-aging propaganda on the label, so I plan to drink it five days after I purchased it from Old Town Liqour in Temecula. On to the beer:"
"Many thanks to thimbledrome for this freshly bottled RR Blind Pig hand delivered from the source. It was bottled on 9th of July, 2008. Pours a very clear copper with nice puffy white head that slowly falls with nice lacing. The pig smells like piney hops and lot of them. A little grapefruit peaks through as well. "
Thanks to JDV and pintsized for sharing.
I bought this from South Bay Drugs & Liquors. Thanks Joey!
Bottles on 7-8-08.
"First off...let me just say I really wanted to like ""the Pig."" But, despite its catchy name and highly reputable maker (Russian River Brewing Company), it left much to be desired. Too hoppy for my simple palate. Kinda overpowered my other senses."
a: beautiful inch of frothy white head sits atop a golden amber body with light movement and light lace
"Aroma includes prominent hop notes - grapefruity/orange/citrus with some grassy notes. Very small amount of pineapple quickly dissipated. Moderate to mid-low level of malty sweetness. Citrus/orange like hops lingered on throughout. Clean fermentation, no signs of esters. Slight increase in the malt level might help the score."
"Bought in a bottle which reads Bottled on 070808. That's pretty damn fresh! Love the label, DO NOT AGE! Only wish I was drinking it out of a mason jar..."
On draft at O'Brien's
"Fresh on tap today at O'Brien's Pub, served in a pint glass. A bright yellow-orange gold with just a lick of white foam head."
"On tap at the Liar's Club. A very well made IPA. Supposedly was the granddaddy to the Plineys, Elder and Youngers. Personally I like the grandkids better. This was a good beer but lighter in body then the others with not a totally right balance of hops. Was good and drinkable, just not as good as some others. golden color, not much head, very citrusy hops."
On tap at O'Briens. Hazy gold color with a thick white head. Aroma of grapefruit and pine at first with some lemon and resin as it warms up. Very hoppy and smooth with a nice dry finish. Extremely refreshing. I could drink this beer all day. An amazing West Coast IPA.
On tap at the Russian River Brewpub in Santa Rosa CA (from notes)
"Appearance&gt; Small head, not a lot of retention, lively, clear... hard to read the rest of my notes, sorry..."
Thanks to Jwolfie70 for this splendid. A thousand blessings on all his endeavors.
"From growler shipped to me (6 days old when opened): Golden in color with a touch of amber. This still poured a great 3/4"" head that dissipated slowly. The nose was filled with grapefruit, Rouquefort cheese and a touch of anise. In the mouth it had medium density, a smooth texture and was wonderfully balanced. The hops are very well balanced by some malt that leads to a beer with a bitterness/dryness but also a touch of sweetness. The malt is more noticable than the ""Pliny the Elder"" and keeps this beer a touch sweeter. Overall, this is a really well made beer with terrific balance that is easy to drink."

"On tap as a guest at EJ Phair in Concord, CA. "
Had as part of a heavenly beer sampler at the brewery.
"On tap at the Toronado in San Francisco. Wasp-colored yellow with watery lacing. Reserved hop odor, some cold grapefruit. Astringent grapefruit bitterness, very bitter and dry. Citrusy and mildly one-dimensional, though the malt is enough to support the hops, which is always good. Some sweet lemon. Medium bodied. Overall, its an aggresive beer, but a little bit of a one trick pony. Despite not having anything amazing to say about this beer, however, I have to admit i drank it swiftly and with gusto. So high marks for drinkability."
growler poured into a pint glass.
"Russian River is one of the hottest breweries in the country. They are known for pushing the envelope when it comes to beer styles. Especially, IPA's and belgian wild ales."
Sought out (along with other RR offerings) at GABF due to the well deserved reputation and ratings from this brewery.
Served on draft at the Toronado. Light amber body with a thin white head. The aroma is all wicked strong grapefruit. The flavor is much the same; big grapefruit flavor with backing malt and good bitterness. Medium body that seems more alcoholic than it is. All around a classic big west coast IPA.
"This is a pretty unassuming beer; no fancy tap handle, not a lot of hype surrounding it, no extreme ABV. Nonetheless, the more I drink it, the more impressed I am. The nose is fresh and fragrant, full of pine and grapefruit. The taste mirrors the nose, with an exceptionally rich, fresh, piney hop flavor. An underlying caramel sweetness is present, coming through right before the finish, giving it balance. The aftertaste is long, leaving a slight oily bitterness, but without any astringency. Quite possibly the best IPA around."
"Pours an orange color with a frothy white head that builds up in my new Sam Adams glass (thanks franksnbeans). Lacing is left along the side of the glass the entire time. Smell is of herbs, earthy grass, pine and citrus. Smells like a christmas tree with grapefruit ornaments. Taste is light sweetness of the citrus followed by a moderate bitter finish. Mouthfeeling is crisp and a little oily with some lively carbonation."
"Pours a clear burned orange with lively carbonation and big creamy head that dies into sheets of lacing. Holy moley the smell! Smells like a bag of the world finest reefer! Or big juicy piney hops! Taste is nothing but the finest hops, so juicy, so piney, so delicious! A little malty balance to make this a masterpiece. Medium in the mouth with good carbonation and an awesome bitter hop finish. Sessionable? I wish I had this on demand to session. Honestly the best IPA I've had to date."
A- This beer had a huge 2 finger head right off the tap which seemed to get bigger as I drank it and left tons of lacing. It was a light orange color.
"Had on tap at Toronado in San Francisco. Pours golden with some orange highlights- somehat lighter in color than many ipas. Healthy white head that sticks around some. Nice piney hoppiness in the nose with a hint of orange. You can smell the bitterness and tell this is going to be good. Small amount of dry malt in the background. Wow! Super hoppy beer, with lots of sticky resin. Big pine taste with some lesser citrus notes, especially orange, for balance. Much hoppier than most other ipas I've had and absolutely delicious. Long, lingering bitterness. I wouldn't exactly call this balanced, but it does have some malt backbone for support. Its just that the hop attack is so relentless that the malt gets a little overwhelmed. Who cares, its great. Mouthfeel is perfect as well. Good body, perfect level of carbonation, and ends with a spicy creaminess. Love this beer, but it definitely burns the tastebuds out a bit. Use in moderation. I'd buy this in a second if it was bottled and in my area."
1/2 liter stein at Hollingshead's Deli in Orange this afternoon after a long morning
"On-tap at Hollingshead's Delicatessen, in Orange, CA, always wanted to try this one, here's my chance,"
Sampled during Stone's 11th Anniversary event.
"Thanks you Taliskar for the latest growler, which by itself is a work of art replicating a Russian River bottle. Big foamy head on dark grapefruit body. Floral hops, very pleasant aroma. After 7 days, we drunk this and hardly changed from room temperature and very much liked its smoothness and taste.Understated carbonation. Just as good cool or room temp."
"East coast guy gets to visit Russian River, wow, how lucky am I? Poured into a nonic pint glass at the brewery. "

"Visited in July, and this was the first RR beer I tasted. Excellent, and in fact so good it was difficult to bother trying all the other beers...but somehow I managed. :o)"
"On tap at Toronado, SF, CA"
From a review I wrote while enjoying this brew at the RR brewpub in Santa Rosa two weeks ago.
On tap at the IPA fest at Lucky Baldwin's in Pasadena.
"Had a pint of this at the brewpub while I picking up a Growler of Pliny . Aroma of citrus hops and a nice dark golden color and a small pub style head and thin lacing. Mouthfeel was delightful and very crisp and refreshing. Flavor was of various citrus and fruits such as orange and apricot. Good long bitter and dry finish. A very good IPA, ranking up there with the very best. A hopheads delight."
"Maybe the ultimate IPA. Huge nose, just exploding with flowery hops. The smell is maybe the highlight of the beer. Light pale body with light pale malts. The coolest thing is, dispite all the hops (more than you'd a thought fit into a pint), it isn't intensely bitter at all. Major drinkability, very delicate flavors that were artisically brewed with the perfect touch and balance. It's simultaneously every hop lover's wet dream, and not too intimidating for anyone. "
On tap at the brewpub. 
On-tap at the Toronado.
Thanks to Flexabull for the trade.
A big thank you to Talisker.
"On tap at the Toronado. What more can you say? Its the grandpappy of IPAs. Pours a nice, somewhat hazy orange with a surprisingly light, thin head. Big piney and grapefruit hops waft from the glass, so you know what youre in for. The hops take over your first sip and really show no mercy to the malt in the background. A bit unbalanced. This is straight up, O.G. West Coast IPA style. Lots of grapefruit and pinestraw. Good body with a clean, crisp and pretty dry finish. IPAs have come a long way since Vinnie first brewed this in the mid-90s, but this still holds court with the better ones of today. Cheers to a legend."
A- Light golden yellow body with a thin lacing that covers about half of the top.
On tap at the brewery.
"I had this one on tap at RR on Saturday and actually preferred it to the Russian River IPA and Pliny the Elder. Drank from a pint. Appearance is similar to their other IPA's, hazy yellow amber with some gold and some darker reddish hues. No head thanks to the Neanderthal behind the bar. Smells of cascade and a bouquet of floral and piney hops. Taste was excellent. A wonderfully rich combination of bitter pine, fruity hop, and some mouth-watering candy sweetness. It was similar to Pliny but had a rich backbone of fruity syrup that made it stand out. Mouthfeel and drinkability were excellent as with all RR beers. This was definitely one of the best IPA's I've tried lately."
"It pours a slightly hazy orange amber, bright and seemingly backlit. A finger of meringue white head swells and settles in a cycle that runs apace. Swells of lacing wave along the inside of the glass. "
"Damn i love this brew. It's my favorite IPA. Had it on tap at Hollingshead. Actually, it was served in a pig ie a mason jar which had the RR Blind Pig logo on it... pretty cool. Apparently a 'blind pig' was slang for some brew during the prohibition era. Something like that and i'm sure i'm not doing the description justice."
"I had the beer at the brewery. I'm from the bay area, but live in San Diego. The brew pub was a cool place and the food was good too. I had a few beers and blind pig was the my third favorite behind Perdition and Damnation. Blind Pig was an easy beer to drink. I thought it was smooth and full of flavor.Though I am new at being a beer nerd, my taste is more for a seasoned vet. I never enjoyed y yellow macro brews but still drank the more popular dark beers everyone had. Russian River is by far my favorite brewery and they don't have a beer I don't dislike. Blind Pig was not as strong as the other beers I had but I think I drank it faster than the others that I liked more than it."
On tap at RR Brewing Co.
"An amber pour with hints of pink and yellow. Fluffly head, good lacing."
"Pours a deep golden orange color with a thick off-white head that recedes into a sticky lace. Spicy hops dominate the nose with strong aromas of fresh pine and even a bit of lemon grass. Hops are, of course, also the key players in the taste with notes of fresh pine, juicy citrus, and grapefruit rind. Definitely on the bitter side, but there is some sweet malt to help provide some balance. A must-try for the hop-heads."
"Light amber, white head. Aroma is all hops, this is a very hoppy IPA, pine, citrus, etc. Tastes like a strong IPA, big hops out front, followed by some bitterness, with the malt in the background. Nice light crisp texture, very drinkable. This beer exists in the no-man's land between IPA and double IPA. Well put together in all respects."
"Thanks to froggyfrog for the opportunity to taste this as he received from the Russian River home bottled mega-trade back in February. Although advised against reviewing it as it is ""less than ideal"" I am taking it upon my self to review anyway as I have nothing negative to say. If this beer is only improved by getting it more fresh than it is certainly a must."
"Had on tap at the Russian River brewpub. Clear blond color. The smell is strong with hops, intense pine needle aroma."
"On tap at Toronado. Tasted side-by-side a pint of the Elder. My first impression is shock that this IPA has considerably more about juniper/pine than the 2xIPA from the same brewer. This beers aroma is intense, painful even. My tongue is freaking out as if I were about to dip it into a vat of citric acid. The juniper in this aroma is just plain ferocious. Inhaling Blind Pig is like having a bully grind your face into a juniper bush on the playground. My eyes are starting to water. Taste is more about sensation then flavor. It stings, it burns, it pricks, it bites, it kicks, and it growls. Beyond that and the thick pine oils I can taste pineapple and apricot but thats about it (I dont mind one but. This rocks). Finish is light, dry, and citric. Body is on the lighter side of medium. Appearance is similar to Plinny the Elder, just a tad lighter shade of golden amber leaning toward yellow with a thinner, shorter lived white head. Outstanding IPA, not for the faint of heart or hops. Just damned adventurous."
"I didn't know what to expect from the brewery behind Pliny the Elder, but this was a nice surprise! Turns out this brew got its start at a Temecula micro, but recently got picked up (saved?) by Russian River. Appearance was lovely, very nice amber hue. Smell was also lovely, obviously hoppy. Taste was delicious! It reminded me of a lighter Ruination, not as balanced as Pliny, but lots of great in your face hop character. Insanely drinkable at 6%, this is a must try from one of my favorite breweries."
"I had this beer on tap at Russian River in Santa Rosa. It poured a light copper almost gold very clear, with a light white head. I was pleasantly surprised how light in color this beer was. Big hop nose, grapefruit pine a little floral hop. You cant really detect the malt in the aroma. Taste has a lot of the grapefruit rind. The pine and hop flower, I caught in the aroma were present as well. This beer really presents all of the hop characters well. It has a light sweetness that lingers throughout. Slick mouth feel Good drinkability. The great brewers seem to be able to deliver a hoppy beer that is still palatable."
Appearance: Arrives at the bar with a hazy light amber color and a fluffy white head that leaves great lacing
I had this beer at O'Brien's a few days after the release party. I wish I could have been there.
"Hand filled 22 oz bomber using counter pressure filler. The beer pours a nice orange color with copper highlites. Clarity is awesome. A light slightly off-white head sits over top, with a very nice cascade of bubbles keeping things solid over top. Aroma on this one is great. Very solid chunky candied grapefruity sweet hop with a moderate caramel and light spun sugar sweetness in there. Everything about it is sweet. Flavor is nice as well. Hop flavors are dominant, with the same sweet grapefruity citrus, with a light touch of pepperyness over a soild sweet caramel malt base. A few moments after swallowing the beer, a very clean bitterness hangs on the side of my tougue. This one is very much like a baby brother to the PtY. It has all the flavors and aromas of the big boy, but just to a lesser degree. Very tasty and very well balanced between sweet malt, hop flavor, and hop bitterness. The feel is a solid moderate with a very solid carbonation of fine bubbles to keep it from being too thick. As far as I'm concerned, this is another home run. All the flavors play very well with each other, the nose is really full and enticing. This 22 oz bottle is not going to last very long and is going to get me one step closer to planning that trip to California. Awesome."
"Received from RedwoodGeorge as part of his recent 'Home Bottling Project'. I continue to be amazed at the professionalism of the labels and caps on this series of beers. Not to mention the flawless re-bottling effort itself. Since this Blind Pig is celebrating his 2 month anniversary today, I though that I'd 'Swig A Pig' before the hops lose any of their brilliance."
Many thanks to RedwoodGeorge for this one.
"22oz bottle obtained via trade with RedwoodGeorge. Thanks for the opportunity... Brewed 1/21/2006, hand-bottled via counter-pressure system 1/27/06."
A: a very light golden honey color with tons of CO2 bubbles. A small head leaves a little lacing
"The Bling Pig IPA is lovingly poured into my tulip glass with a brilliant clear golden orange color with a half inch of bubbly white head atop the brew. Aromas of fresh hops reach out and smack me across the face. Hefty handfuls of cirtic, grapefruity hop oils are married with an equally blissful and intense green piney aroma. Sweet crystalline, caramel backdrop as well, but the hops are everything here. Sweet fresh cone goodness and pure lupulin love. "
"The third offering in a continuum of Russian River IPAs bottled unofficially by BA RedwoodGeorge from a 5 gallon keg into 22 oz. bombers, the beer came out paler than the two bigger Plinys but had a little more carbonation, and a bigger head. The aroma was much milder than I had anticipated, with a floral-citric hop smell vaguely reminiscent of Mangos. The taste was citric, sugary, and a little soapy. Body was light and airy, and the hops faded quickly after each sip. Like the rest of Russian River IPAs, this was lighter in body than the strength on the label suggested. Unlike the bigger beers, the lightness of the body had a slightly detrimental effect on the single IPA, where more character is usually better than less. An easy to drink beer, that left me wishing it was a little less simple."
"George's Unauthorized Home Bottling Project, Brewed 1/21/06 Bottled 1/27/06 Thanks for all the trouble George."
"damn, george, this is gonna be a great m-f- week!"
Sampled thanks to RedwoodGeorge and his most Excellent trade!
"This beer poured a lightish amber, head retention was good and lacing was good as well. aroma was of piney hops, subtle but there. Taste was very piney, a real grabber, hop head delight, say what you will, just plain hoppy and aggressive. A very drinkable and enjoyable IPA. Another testament to Vinnies skills as a brewer. Good stuff"
On tap at the Toronado and also at the Russian River brewpub 2 days apart while on vacation. 
Presentation: I recently had the distinct pleasure to sample copious Pints of this over several days on draft at Russian River Brewing Company. In short this was so good that I decided to grab a Brewery filled Growler (expertly filled to the brim by Matt on Monday) to bring home. After spending the night in the fridge it was time to crack this puppy and ravage it. The Review is for the Growler.
On tap at Toronado.
"11/13/05- Purchased at the Russian River Brewery in Santa Rosa, CA."
"On tap at the brewpub in Santa Rosa in an imperial pint glass. Pours a rather unspectacular, clear copper/amber body, with a thin white head, little lacing. Huge pine, citrus aromas in the nose. Spicy, fruity and floral. Amazing taste - just a superb IPA. A huge amount of bitterness in the finish. Moderate bodied and full of flavour. A great beer."
"Clear and golden hued,...lush, enormous white head, ...beautiful...a lace-leaver..."
"presented in a snifter glass, good yellow/orange color with fine white head. Left modest lace. "
"A darker orange than the regular IPA at RR this is a recipe that Vinnie revived from one of his first brewpub jaunts at Blind Pig. The aromas are complex. Spicy/piney hops and a lovely complex maltiness that really holdss all of the hoppiness together and makes this brew stick like glue. The taste is hoppy and spicy with some lovely bready notes, and some great piney spiciness from the hops is there as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit fuller than that of the regular IPA and the drinkability is damn good as well. This and the regular RR IPA are twins and they are 4.5 twins as well. Damn good job on these two IPA's Vinnie, damn good job..."
This arrived as a somewhat murky yellow and orange with a small head. It left a good amount of lace behind.
"Another fine masterpiece from RRBC, this is a resurrection of Vinnie's original IPA recipe from the Blind Pig Brewery."
Bottle shared by Sylvain.
I've heard great things...now I've tasted them. 
Pours a deep golden with whitish frothy two finger head. Aroma is slightly tropical but heavier to pine and grass. Flavour starts with a hint of sweetness then moves to earthy pine and grass notes. Hop bite up front is assertive but not off putting. Finishes with an earthy chewy dryness.
"This review is one of two fresh hop ale reviews - the other being Yellow Dog Brewery’s Alpha Dog 2106 release. I made these reviews as a challenge by an acquaintance who said that Alpha Dog was a way better beer than Driftwood’s Sartori Harvest. As I have not had the privilege to try either until now, I figured a good head to head taste off was in order (pun intended). See here (https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/35919/193023/?ba=JonCorbett#review) for my review of Alpha Dog. "
Got on a CANBIF trade! Thx westcoastbeergeek! Served at 4deg C in a draught glass
Package: 650 ml bottle.
"I don't love fresh hop beers in general, but I love this one. Very perfumy nose, which is usually a turnoff for me, but it works in this beer. Clean, not overly bitter flavor and just a nice beer through and through."
Nice hoppy IPA Great job guys!
"grassy, wet, hoppy, slight citrus but alllll muted to result in amazing drinking. "
Bottle from Kump. Thanks for sending me this long-time want. Served in a Cantillon tulip.
"Had the chance to taste the 2013 release but unfortunately missed out on the 2014. And now, finally sipping this great 2015 as I write these words. Bottled September 15, today is October 2nd. Can't get much better than a 2 week old wet-hopped IPA made by the brewery that makes my favourite regular production IPA, the Fat Tug."

From notes
2013 growler:
Bottled on Friday and drank the following Tuesday. (09/20/2013 and 09/24/2013 respectively)
"Quite a lot of floral notes this year. Exceptionally good. Light on the nose and in the mouth. Those fresh hops are really shining through with minimal bitterness,, which I must say is a bit unusual. Very, very balanced. I imagine in a week or two and this will be a completely different beer so do try now. Definitely better than last year and would highly recommend a try. Nice job! Please release more :)"
"650 mL btl served at 7C in a tulip. Just a little experiment to see how it developed. I know it is a fresh, wet, single source hop IPA that is meant to be had fresh; but frankly I was unimpressed with this year's offering on the day of release and it got better during the ensuing days/weeks. Hence the tasting now."
A: A golden copper clear IPA with bubbly and foamy head that initally was 2 fingers and slowly settles leaving lacing along the glass and plenty of variable bubbles. 
"So, Rutager tricked my buddy into giving him my address here in Holland so he could send me this surprise. Thanks heaps man! Living where I do, surprises like this are few and far between. Very much appreciated."
Been looking forward to trying this one for a while. Thanks to Rutager for the bottle.
"2012 Vintage, 650 ml bomber poured into an imperial pint glass."
"Pours a slightly hazy light amber. Nice creamy off white head. Aroma is a fine citrus IPA, with sweet grapefruit and some pineapple. Bit of biscuit malt in the back. Puckering bitterness hits right away, but very pleasant citrus hops (pineapple and grapefruit again) and a great balance. Mouthfeel is a bit puckering, but overall it's a nice balance leaving you want another sip. "
thanks to rutager for this
Thanks to DaftCaskBC for giving me this one. Poured into straight pint glass. Poured a slightly hazy (this is an unfiltered beer) golden amber color with about an inch of off-white head that had good retention and lacing.
many a thanks goes out to DaftCaskBC for a taste of some canadian pride!

Thanks to H1N1 for sending me a fresh bottle of this! 
Pours a clear amber/copper color with a white three finger head that has good retention and leaves nice sticky lacing.
"Great IPA from Driftwood. I wish they did this year-round, but I guess this would sort of defeat the purpose."
"A- Pours a clear light amber with a finger of beautiful white head. Head recedes, leaving a light layer of foam. Lots of carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of my glass. "
"22 oz bottle, ritzkiss shared this one with me."
Bottle: Poured a lightly hazy bright light orangey with a medium size head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of floral hops with light citrus and bitter finish is quite enjoyable. Taste is also a nice mix between some floral hops with some nice clean citrus notes with a medium bitter finish and light sweet malt backbone. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no appearance of alcohol thought it can be felt at the end of the glass. Nothing extraordinary but well done nonetheless.
"I agree , this is a great IPA with a fantastic frsh hop nose and lovely thick mouthfeel with real balance in the main body. These guys are showing why they can compete with the best In BC by making an IPA as good as Central City or Phillips. They need to create a regular IPA that is available all year round"
Bomber shared by Ritzkiss - thanks Eric!
"First time reviewer, greetings."
"22oz fresh from Victoria, pours a gorgeous burnished orange with copper and amber hints, 2 fingers of sticky off white foam with great retention and lacing down the glass."
"Wet Centennial hops from the Sartori Cedar Ranch hop farm, south of Chilliwack, BC. 66 IBU."
"Another winner from Driftwood, not sure if this will be a one time brew or become a seasonal fall release. What I do know is that I will need to buy quite a bit of it either way."
Headed back for 1 more fight before making the trip back to FL.
Holy mackerel. Massive hops without destroying my tongue.
Appearance: Amber with very light haziness.
"Light hop haze with huge citrusy, fruity aroma. Very tasty IPA. Get some malt base with massive hop flavors. A tiny bit drier than expected, but overall a very fine IPA."
"In my unprofessional opinion the Acerbic is the epitome of what an American IPA should be. The Nose, Mouthfeel, Taste, Color, Head Retention and Mouthfeel are perfect."
"Acerbic is my go to when visiting Broomtail. It has been a super consistent great tasting IPA. It has a nice dark gold almost amber color. Darker than most IPA's I've had but the body is well balanced and mouthfeel is just right when the hops hit your nostrils and tongue. If you like a hearty hoppy IPA, this unique beer performs a good balancing act. The only ""negative"" is you have to be careful about how easily these go down."
Aroma: The beer has a very mild to strong presence of hops aroma.
The best IPA I have ever had. The hop profile is perfectly crafted to leave your palate with an amazing taste but does not overwhelm you. Each sip beckons your for another. The mouthfeel is smooth and clean. The definition of a craft IPA.
Had this at the brewery. Pours nice filtered amber color with a small head. Had a nice malt backbone and not much hop bitterness. A definite English style IPA. Good but just another IPA. Nothing special about this.
"My favorite IPA. Drinkable, huge aroma and flavor, but almost no juicy haze."
"Had on tap. It tastes good, don't get me wrong, but it falls short for me as an ipa. Not nearly enough hop character in the taste or in the body. Good amount of malt and sweet finish than usual. Again tasty, but rated as an ipa it isn't complete enough"
On tap at the brewery.
Drinking a cellar temp growler poured into a snifter. The beer pours a clear goldenrod color with a fizzy bleached white head of 2 cm and fades to a wispy surface layer after the beer pours.
Don't know if it lived up to the hype but good IPA
"Poured from a growler into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, dark golden-orange coloring, with a foamy, clingy, light, white head. Aromas of rich pine pitch and wet grass, with pepper spice, herbal notes, and subtle citrus highlights. Flavors are very hoppy bitter and green forward, rich in dried grass and pine pitch. There is a subtle citrus blend of grapefruit and orange providing a backbone to the dank and herbal hoppy overtones. Smooth, midbodied, with a solid bitter and dry edge. The aftertaste is more herbal and grassy hops, lingering on past the smooth, dry, bitter finish. Great beer!"
"cloudy, orange golden in color. Pineapple, pine, grapefruit juice and pith. Super flavorful for a less than 6% ipa. Nice bitterness level, not overly sweet. Really well balanced."
"I think this is my favorite NEBCO beer. Yes I've had Fuzzy baby Ducks but it was over a year ago and so I can't make the comparison. Plus, I was somewhat of a noob back then anyway. I live about 20 minutes from NEBCO and lately I've been there once a week. I've had all the standards and recently most of the Fat 10-er series. Locust Reign and Coriolis have been my favorites until now. "
Robust mosaic hop notes in the nose; mild bitter finish; round flavorful beer that is eminently quaffable.
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery. 
Actually liked this a tad better than G-bot. Easy drinking with mosaic hops. Also picked up a 32 ounce growler of this. I would get this again in a heartbeat.
"Pours slightly dark and hazy with a one finger head. Smells of peppery hop and apricot. Taste is bitter, not not overly and a citrus dry finish and a spicy mouth feel. Fades into bready toasty malts. Balance while remaining hoppy. Delicious IPA."
L-The beer pours a slightly hazy gold. The head is a full fluffy white inch. Lacing is copious.
"deleted my previous rating to finally give this beer a full review. poured fresh from growler into a proper NEBCO snifter. pours a hazy golden orange with a good bubbly head that dissipates quickly. carbonation seen floating from sides of glass, bubbles from the carbonation eventually create a new thin head on the beer that lasts almost the entire 16oz. smell is everything you'd want from MOSAIC through and through: grassy, fruity, citrusy, and ""herbally"" dank. taste mirrors the smell exactly but more intense: grassy and fruity notes up front, then the fruitiness turns into citrus while the grass note still lingers, and finally the weedy dankness finishes it off. no alcohol taste whatsoever, but wouldnt expect that at this low of an ABV. mouth feel is clean, didn't feel any coating whatsoever. the carbonation made it a very crisp clean beer. definitely my favorite single hop beer ever tasted up until this date."
This IPA is more on the u toe side rather then your big hop bomb. The nose has a nice hoppy smell. It has a very enjoyable taste with only a slight bitter finish. Overall a perfect IPA for your everyday.
"Growler from the brewery, the pour displays a cloudy yellow gold color with a foamy 1 finger white head that was full of bubbles, fading on the quick side but leaving excellent foamy lacing and rings as it went down."
Had back in 2013 at the Ordinary but then again in March 2015 fresh at the brewery itself. Really great sour and dank IPA here. Not too heavy on the body but very heavy on the hops. My favorite combo.
Like I need to write a review for people to go out and get this. 
"One of my favorite uses of mosaic hops, which is not one of my favorites. It's got an amazingly complex nose that blends earthy grassy notes and subtle fruits. It's crisp yet full and the balance is incredible. This is one of NEBCO's most underrated beers."
Fresh growler from the source. Super fruit juicy hops. Ridiculously rich and tasty for 5.8 percent. Wow.
Just a great beer. Took a trip to NEBC in December to get a growler. The freshness kept for a few weeks. Just awesome crispness and hops and citrus flavor. Hard to beat NEBC.
"Wonderful citrus IPA from our friends at NEBCo. Big orange and lemon notes in the nose. The orange really comes through in the flavor especially. There's also a substantial pine component that comes off not quite like a cleaning solution but approaching that. It's a bitter brew but highly drinkable because the ABV is on the session side of things and the mouthfeel is crisp and ebullient. Another beer from New England that would smash in the package store. Alas this one is draft only, so drink it when you see it!"
Another excellent beer by the boys at NEBCo creating some excellent stuff down there. Easy drinking but bursting with flavor. Possibly the best mosaic IPA I've had to date. PLEASE CAN IT!!!
"Of all the NEBCO offerings I've had (Elm City, 668, Fuzzy Baby Ducks, Gandhi Bot, Sea Hag) this one is by far my favorite. I find it to be well balanced. Not boozy not too bitter."
From the tap:
A: slight haze; copper colored; 1 finger pillowy white head that receded slowly; thick lacing;
"Appearance is a dark orange color with a one finger head. Aroma isn't too strong consisting of sweet fruitiness and citrus hops. The first taste showcases the hop presence of this beer with pungent grapefruit followed by bready malts on the back end. The taste is great but what really elevates this beer is the smoothness. Considering the strong presence of grapefruit there is very little astringency or bitterness, which allows the bursting hop flavor to be the focus."
Thanks to CTJman for getting this growler down south in superb condition.
"Growler pouted into snifter. Pours a beautiful yellow gold. The nose you get from the Mosaic hops is just stupid. Tastes amazing, very sessionable, light and fruity with a real crisp hop bitterness. Kill me now. This is a nuclear weapon for the Beast Coast beer game."
Growler purchased at the brewery 20 minutes ago.
"Poured into a pint glass at Pies & Pints in Middlebury, Connecticut this IPA has a very clear, pale golden appearance with a big white, snowy froth on top and a carpet of lace as you empty the glass. The aroma is somewhat delicate but brings a really nice citrus-pine, very solid and alluring. The flavor is an awesome blend of rye malt and citrus-pine. There's a little bit of light lemon sweetness blended terrifically with the hop bitterness while presenting a bit of grainy malt backbone. The body is medium to light with a fairly mild feel and modest carbonation. Highly drinkable. Great!"
"A- Pale amber body with good transparency. A slight haze, but not cloudy. Big frothy off-white head that leaves a lot of lacing."
"Ive had on tap at the brewery, on-tap at the Lumberyard in Georgetown, CT, and from Grolwer purchased at the Brewery...this review is from the growler...one week old."
First had: on tap at NEBCO
Poured from a 64 oz. growler into my Hill Farmstead stemware.

"A-Pours a cloudy coppery hue. Nice, fluffed head. Head maintains its height and leaves loads of lacing."
Poured from growler into my brand new ghandi bot glass! Shared with my neighbor who was not worthy. 
Poured from a growler into a brand new Gandhi-Bot glass.
64oz growler into Duvel tulip. 
Served on tap at Prime 16 in New Haven CT. Shaker pint glass.
"Look: Light copper color, white fluffy head, a little too hazy"
"64oz growler straight from NebCo. Pours a hazy burnt orange color with less than a half inch of head. Some lacing. Aroma is uber fruity. Pineapple, orange, mango,grape and some floral hop notes as well. The taste is some more of the tropical fruits along with some floral hops. Some breadiness but this one is hop forward. Floral hop bitterness at the finish. Medium bodied with a mouthfeel on the lighter side. Very drinkable IPA that doesn't skimp on the hop flavor. Reminds me a lot of Founders All Day IPA. Overall, perfect warm weather all day drinker."
"Super excited to try this. Poured into a tulip glass. This beer has a very nice head with some nice lacing, the colour is a murky orange. Smell is of some tropical fruit and maybe even a bit of lime. The taste is orange, pineapple, mango (lime in there as well). No real hoppy bitterness to this. Mosaic is certianly one sweet hop, absolutely no bitterness to the finish at all. Another NebCo hit!"
"Pours a very hazy orange body with dark golden hues beneath the dense, pure white head which is very slow to dissolve leaving a sticky ring of lacing around the glass."
Pour from a 64 oz growler (filled today) into a 668 tulip glass.

"Copper color, 1/2"" white head. Aroma hit the hoppy grapefruit smells."
Type: 64-oz. growler
"Growler from Alpine. Orange color, good head, yes. Aroma of hops and hops and then hops? Pine, citrus, etc. flavor was damn hoppy with only the slightest hint of what I'm guessing are summit hops (onion). Great IPA, super hoppy, glad I got to try it."
"Drove down to Alpine on a heavenly sunny day, but Raul was greeted with extremely dearth results: Nelson is tapped and all IPA bottles are sold out. Wowieee! But Raul is not one to fret, so he jumped his ass on a limited O'Briens IPA."
64oz growler thanks to airfoil. Served in HF tulip.
"Pours a crystal clear, deep golden color with a rapidly dissipating off-white head that gets perpetually fed by carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Sweet grapefruit nose is so inviting. Full body that enters the mouth so smoothly you'd think it was nitrogen. Lovely citrus through and through without overpowering. This IPA has nice balance."
A- Pours a crystal clear copper color with a nice white head. Head has pretty solid retention and leaves some nice spotty lacing.

522nd review on BA
Growler shared by drabmuh. Thanks Matt!
Big thanks to drabmuh for sharing this one; I enjoyed it quite a bit.
Growler graciously provided by mnbearsfan. Thanks Matt!
"A - Golden orange, fluffy white head with pretty solid retention, sticky lacing. Looks fantastic. It even pours nice, it looks like it's going to be stagnant, then a wave of bubbles blows up and produces this fantastic head. "
"64oz. growler shared by Dr. Abmuh, thanks!"
"Growler obtained in a trade with MrHirschybar, shared at a local tasting with some other gentlemen and one gentlelady."
On tap at O'Brien's
Draft pour into a shaker pint glass at the Alpine pub.
"Chilled growler into a glass. Thanks, Brian."
poured a golden orange with yellow highlights that had a finger of head and left good sticky lacing on the glass. The nose was signature alpine consisting of great pine and floral hop notes alongside some citrus grapefruit but with a good sweet malt presence on this one. like the nose the hops and pine flavors worked together but the citrus grapefruit added accents and the malts helped on the balancing act and wasn't as fruity as other alpine hop bomb offerings. the brew was medium body with a good amount of carbonation which had a citric bitter and nice slight dry finish. it drank really good and went great with their beer battered onion rings.
On-tap at the Stone Bistro on 6/29. Review from notes.
"What a wonderful, wonderful IPA. I was really blown away by how good this one really was. A huge thanks goes out to my kind friend for finally getting me this one, I had waiting what seemed like a lifetime to land it. Served cold and poured into a pint glass, this one was enjoyed on Memorial Day 5/31/2010."
"A - An almost clear, pretty color of gold. Near white head, about an inch, slowly leaves to disk. Lots of cling lace abounds."
Generously shared by Dyan yesterday. Probably would have appreciated this a bit more if I hadn't had the Bad Boy first. In any event...
Thanks to Smokepot23 for the growler of this treat!
On-tap at Toronado SD
On tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad.
"Thanks to Alex by way of ArthurPendragon! Served into a FoBAB tasting glass. I'm had this a couple of times before (at the brewery, uber-fresh), but I'm finally getting around to a proper review."
Thanks to ArthurPendragon for sending me this growler! Served in a Surly pint glass. Shared with friends for the pre-NotLA tasting party.
Served on cask via hand pump @ O'Briens Pub (San Diego) on 11/13/09. Served in a pint glass. 
Had this at O'Briens at the tail end of SDBW. Stunning from the cask.
Another pit stop I had to take while in SD. Served at 50 degrees into an Alpine pint glass.
"Got a growler of this from Alpine in mid August 2009, finally sitting down to review from my notes. Pours a beautiful orange-apricot color with a white head and a nose that overwhelms the nostrils with citrus and tropical fruits. While the taste isn't over-the-top hoppy, they're just right and showcase the tropical flavors of the nose. The mouthfeel is just about right, and the smell/flavor combo lead to unparalleled drinkability--one of the best IPA's I had on a long trip."
Sampled on tap at the Toronado in San Diego.
On tap at San Diego Brewing Co. (as a guest tap) on 7/11/09.
"Chris was kind enough to send me a handbottle which was tasty enough to make me get a whole growler. Thanks to doubleo on RB for the growler, which is why I'm re-reviewing."
Appearance: Bright amber in color with absolutely brilliant clarity. Pours with a tall eggshell-colored head that leaves sheets of lace behind as it (quickly) disappears from my glass. Awesome.
"Appearance is orange with a 3 finger head. The head lingers for a very, very long time, and the lacing is beautiful. The aroma is very crisp. Orange pith, pineapple, and tons of grapefruit with some floral notes and pine resin. Flavor is very citrusy, that citrus being mainly grapefruit. No alcohol is noticeable in the flavor. Very little sweetness. Very dry. The finish is citrus bitterness and lingers for an extended period of time. Light bodied with good carbonation. The drinkability is insane on this one."
"Tap at, wait for it... O'Brien's. Pours clear gold with a short, off-white head. Crisp aroma of grapefruit, pine, pepper, and perfume. Creamy, yet light mouthfeel. Hops and resin up front, but not overwhelming. More of a pink grapefruit sweetness in terms of citrus mixed well with the biscuit maltiness. Bitter and clean finish. Loved it."
Tasted from Growler.
"Pours into my 25cl tulip glass with an almost two-finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is brilliantly clear and is a concentrated copper tinged, rich amber color that shows a perfect, rich copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma is a mix of dank hop character (which is dominant) and fruity, tropical fruit accented citrus notes. Aromas of essential ""hemp"" oil, light pine tar, and a zesty-green herbal note are lightly balanced by notes of lychee, apricot, candied ruby-red grapefruit, and a touch of vibrant orange blossom. This really is quite the dank hop character, it remains quite smooth, but really captures the essence of sticking your nose into a dime bag quite well (that skunky herbal note is alive and well here)."
A-deep copper with an off white head that retains well and leaves spotty lace.
On tap @ ... O'Brien's!
Growler picked up 4 days ago.
Picked up a growler at the source for a camping trip.
"on tap @ Stone Brewing Company Bistro in Escondido, CA"
On tap at O'Brien's Pub 14th Anniversary Barrel-Aged beer night 1/15.
Pint at O'Briens for around four dollars on Tuesday at about 3pm before the barrel aged festivities started
"Poured at Churchills in San Marcos into an English pint glass. Poured a golden copper color with a finger size white head. The aroma was a mix of citrus, pine, and slight sweet malt scent. Taste was well balanced between grapefruit pine hoppiness and a well formed malt biscuit body. Mouthfeel was medium body with good carbonation and mild alcohol feel. This is a great drinking IPA thats well balanced between hop, bitterness, and malt body."
"Look- pours golden orange, cloudy from tons of tiny floaties; billowing foamy 2 finger head that recedes slowly; ample lacing"
Can. White head. Golden orange color.
taken from notes on draft at Chucks
Can from ABV. Canned 01 March 2018
"The Hop Shop that forms a line for extraterrestrial home brewers pours a laser beam yellow, whatever the hell that means. Brunch orange juice cocktail perhaps? It's yellowy orange and beautiful with a wispy white foam that leaves a fine film of bubbles wherever it has made contact."
16 oz can
"World class. This is in the same conversation as green, Julius and trilliums IPAs. Big notes of tropical fruit. Medium mouthfeel. Full haze. World class IPA"
"Being a big fan of Chuck's Hop Shop, I've wanted to get my hands on one of these for a while. Luckily, I had a friend visit from Seattle, that works there. My can was well over a month old, but was still juicy and hoppy. I'd love to try one that was fresher, I'm sure it would be even better."
"Really hazy yellow color with creamy, off-white head. Aroma is really hoppy with nice pineapple and mango juice but also some dank and grassy notes. Taste has tons of hops, dank, grassy, chives, hop resin, medium bitterness. Medium body with a really smooth mouthfeel. Awesome IPA, up there with the New England juice bombs."
"Looks like orange juice, smells like pineapple, tastes delicious. I'm guessing the base for Peach Punch you in the eye."
On tap at N.W.I.P.A yesterday.
"Straw colored, very thick and cloudy. Foamy, white head with serious retention and lacing. The aroma is tropical fruit, peaches, bread malt, and some herbal notes. The flavor is the same, with a bit of hops bite in the aftertaste, which is pine and grapefruit. Very juicy and resinous. A fine ale."
This is another perfect 5 from Oregon. 
"Block 15 can do no wrong, especially when it comes to IPAs. Intergalactic Hop Shop is one of their NE-style IPAs, and while I can't compare it to the OG NE IPAs, it is one of the best examples of the style being made over here. Grab it if you can find it."
"L: Poured into a Pint Defiance tulip. Canned on 1/6/15. Finger width white head, body is a hazy peach orange hue. It looks like a glass of fruit juice. Amazing!"
"Poured from a crowler into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very hazy gold/orange amber with a two finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of citrus hops, orange family citrus, pineapple, tropical fruit, light bready and caramel malt. Juicy. Flavor follows, with fruit forward citrus hops, mixed ripe tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange and tangerine, hints of pine and dankness with a sturdy lightly caramel malt. Interesting lingering, lightly resinous hop bitterness that is not really as astringent as its intensity would warrant. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A really full flavored and complex IPA, with so many competing flavors that it should be a mess, but still tastes great. The malt has little overt flavor, with a mild caramel, but supports this hop onslaught wonderfully. Really satisfying hoppy but not tongue buckling finish. Very nicely done. Upon announcement, this raised a lot of excitement in Seattle and the cans sold extremely quickly. I missed the cans, but was able to get this crowler from Chuck's CD. Glad I made it although hopefully this will be made again. We live in the golden age of IPAs, it's hard to believe so many excellent ones are coming out now."
"This one was a bit of an eye-opener for me. Tremendously juicy, negligibly bitter, super-easy, and enjoyable, drinking. If it's a NE-style IPA, I can now understand their appeal. Maybe not for every day and every occasion, according to my tastes, but it would certainly fit the bill a good deal of the time."
"On tap in shaker pint at Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, VT."
"Definitely one of the better Lawson's bottles that I've had. Not quite at the same level as Double and Triple Sunshine, but I'd say its right at the same level as SoS, but quite different."
This was an awesome beer. I 1st had it on tap at the Lawson's event (was the best beer I had there) and again last night when opened of the my bottles from the event. Definately in the same tier as SOS and the rest of the bigger IPAs! Well done!
"A bit more bitter than say... Double Sunshine, but great hop flavor. And a lovely mouthfeel. I think it's not so much that it's more bitter, as it has less of the citrusy complimentary flavor."
they cant all be home runs. This is a solid double to left....
Poured from bomber into an Alchemist becher.
A-golden amber color with a nice white head and good lacing
Draft in a pint glass at Mad Taco in Waitsfield.
Wow! Now Hopcelotta hops!
GF Had on tap at Prohibition Pig.
650ml bottle. Poured into a Lawson's snifter 10/6/2014.
"Huge that's to mark for the hookup, enjoyed from a Lawson's snifter."
"Had on tap at the Mad Taco in Waitsfield. Sean Lawson brews some of the best IPAs on the planet, and this one is no different. A ton of hop flavor with little bitterness. Very drinkable. Just outstanding!!"
"It pours a hazy yellow almost lemonade color with a frothy white head that a good lacing to the glass. The smell is lemon, grapefruit combination, taste is sweet to start than a mild hop bite comes through. Overall this is a well done drink and that is easy to enjoy."
Hazy pale yellow with a thick white foam dome leaving peaks of lace.
Appearance - Pours bright yellow with big light fluffy white head that dissipates to about a one inch cap and stays. Spotty lacing all around the glass.
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a small foamy head. Head retention is mild. Lacing is good. Very nice citrus aroma. Mainly orange. Mild piney resin. Somewhat juicy. Taste does still have some juicy orange, but it is definitely off at the end. A little more bitterness. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Still a good beer."
Round 2 with Parish! This was bottled on 11/2/17.
A very fresh keg on tap.
"Appearance: light yellow and super hazy – so hazy as to be opaque. I cannot see an object through the beer, even though the diameter of my glass is only 3 inches wide. The head swells to a ¼-finger bright white head that fades quickly to near nothing. Definitely “northeast” by appearance."
"Simply put, I would've rated it 6/5 if there was the option!"
"Poured from a 12 oz, 1 month old bottle. Appearance is fairly bright orange in color and slightly hazy with two finger thick head. Smell is fairly earthy hops, slightly dank, and some sweet malt (held up well after a month). Taste is even more dank but nicely balanced with a lot of juice. Hop flavors are mostly orange and earthy with moderate and smooth bitterness. It is slightly sweet with a little heat. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with just enough carbonation and a smooth finish. Overall this is an excellent ipa that has great balance between the orange juice and dank hop flavors. I cannot believe how dank it is after a month."
I am rating this beer high. It's that good to me. If you run across this one go ahead and grab the 4 pack you will be glad
"This doesn't have the big fruit thing going on that Ghost does, but is more floral and dank in my opinion. It isn't very bitter or piney at all, and the hop flavor abounds! One of the best beers I have ever had. Parish always kills it with their hoppy beers."
"Pours a hazy, translucent orange-gold color. Head size and retention aren't particularly good."
Bottled 10/21/16 - poured into a tulip
"Poured from bottle into tulip, minimal 1/3 finger head, ok lacing. Turbid hazy yellowish orange in the glass, some particles in suspension. Smell, well it is epic, a blast of orange and pine/pineapple and some malt banging around in there. Taste is mango, some citrus more in line with grapefruit, and a piney bitter finish. Mouthfeel is pretty good and has a somewhat dry finish. Nice beer, but given the chance I would spend my money on Envie"
L: Slighty hazy orange. Finger and a half of head nice lacing till the end. 
"Placed right there between Ghost in the Machine and Envie. The 6.5% is hidden very well behind the citrus flavors that are present. A very smooth, drinkable beer!"
Bottled 7-8-16 opened 8-4-16
Opus Vert holds its own with a blast of grapefruit juiciness and bitter hopiness that puts it close if not a world class beer. I had this in the same session with Trillium's Melcher Street and Treehouse's Bright. All three were amazingly solid beers.
12 fl. oz. bottle
"The best IPA in the southern US. Stunning. First beer ive had in a while that lived up to the hype. Better than Sip of Sunshine . Worth driving 8 hours round trip for. Light, hoppy orange juice in a bottle. Wow"
Finally able to review this. Aroma is sweet and fruity. Look is golden. Taste is so crisp. No hop bitterness left on the tongue. Almost refreshingly light. Great beer
Pours a medium gold color with moderate haze. 1 finger cream colored head with decent retention. Recedes to a ring of foam around the edge. Medium amount of sticky lacing left behind.
Really nice beer by Parish. Very tropical fruit forward in both nose and taste. Sweet up front with nice bitter finish. Not over powering and very easy to drink. Well done.
"Pours a clear golden honey with a finger thick white head. Smells of citrus/tangerine, bready, pungent floral, herbal and spicy hops. Tastes of sweet grapefruit, pineapple and orange, medium heavy malt backbone, balanced hop spiciness, no flavor is too dominant. Medium heavy body leaves a grapefruit aftertaste and nice meaty hop resin with an herbal edge. Nice lacing down the glass. A divine IPA."
"L: gold, clean and clear. 1.5"" white head. "
"A juicy well balanced and very well done IPA from Parish. Given the success of Ghost in the Machine and Envie, I expected nothing less. Nice citrus and tropical fruit flavors that also incorporate subtle piney and earthy hops. Can't wait for this to be re-released."
"In the mindset of true west-coast IPA, Parish brewers rein in the bitterness, the dryness and the attitude to create an India pale ale that doesn't back down- rife with the earthy and pungent tones, the hops present themselves naked on the palate."
"Really solid. Appearance is clean, unlike Ghost in the Machine. A fair amount of juicy notes. Tasty as hell. Light and very crushable. Probably not on the same level as Ghost, but damn good. This brewery is absolutely killing it in my opinion."
L: Burnt orange and honeycomb hues with a very slight haziness and minimal white head
12oz bottle poured into a teku glass. Bottled on 05/10/14.
"Pours a transparent golden with a thin white head. Smells of citrus, pine, pineapple, and mango. Tastes tropical fruit up front, slight pine on the finish. Unexpectedly creamy, with the light color and clarity. Everything you could ask for in an IPA."
"From bottle to glass. Bottled 5/13, enjoyed 5/15. Thanks, Alejandra."
Great middle ground beer between Ghost in the Machine and Envie. The 6.5% is hidden very well behind the citrus flavors that are present. It is like drinking a piece of summer in each and every sip.
"On tap at Parish. Pours clean golden orange with fluffy white head, great retention and coating lace. Dank weedy hop aroma, tropical fruit. Taste follows the aroma, weedy earthy piney hop profile, some citrus but not at juicy levels. Just enough light malt to balance. Semi dry finish with nice bitterness, medium creamy mouthfeel. Excellent brew, very well done and a great addition to their lineup."
"Exceptional brew, very fruity on the smell, crisp, and clean. Not hazy on the color very clear. I'd say it is more like ghost sister than a daughter. Another amazing hoppy brew from parish."
"Perfect addition to parish's IPA/APA line up, Parish has a lot of talent with hop heavy brews and this is no exception. Envie and opus vert are both extremely good beers on there own, but when compared with ghost in the machine it becomes clear that these three are like rungs on a ladder. Each has a similar flavor profile with the next adding a new level of hop intensity. Great idea, great beers, once again parish knocks it out the park."
Poured into snifter from 12 oz bottle dated 5/13/16
"Bottled on 5/13 (yesterday) poured into a Parish tulip. Much clearer appearance compared to Ghost and Envie. Classic West Coast. Spicy floral and citrus aroma. Taste follows aroma, very nice super drinkable. Don't see an ABV on the bottle but this is a dangerous one. Mouthfeel is fantastic!! Almost creamy. As a matter of fact this beer reminds me of a creamy Sculpin. Very very good beer."
Hazy NEIPA. A bit more pine and bitterness with a less pillowy mouthfeel than the very best NEIPAs but this is still an excellent beer which I would gladly drink any time - and an argument could be made that the pine/bitterness makes this even better than a straight-up OJ NEIPA.
"awesome that my buddy was able to send a crowler of this out to me fresh from the brewery. its a beer i have been wanting to try since i first heard about it, and we cracked into it with much enthusiasm. it is plenty hazy, thats for sure, murky and thick, not particularly bright, but with gorgeous carbonation rising into a tall white head that holds well and leaves frothy lacing as it drinks down. the aroma is awesome, leafy vegetal and fresh, loaded with hops, almost at a max out point, really saturated and intense, heavily dry hopped and not at all unfamiliar to me. citra dominated, at least to me, in the aroma, lemon curd and zest, with some heftier hops in here too, simcoe perhaps, grapefruity with a pine aromatic, notes of confectioners sugar, white wheat earthiness grounding, mouthwatering but not so unique as i thought it would be for all of its acclaim. this is definitely citra driven, but i get more bitterness than i usually do from citra alone, i like that in an ipa like this, its needed, the juiciness is there, fresh and insanely dry hoppy, but the bitter side is welcomed here. fresh spruce, tangerine, oats and wheat for sure in the mash, oily too. i like how creamy this is in the feel, it supports the hops nicely and makes me think the haze is more of a natural thing than something contrived here, i like this kind of grain base in such a dry hopped beer, its needed. in the end, this was awesome, we all really liked it, but i wanted it to be more different than it is. this tastes like a whole lot of others right now, which i guess was a bit of a let down for me, it was memorable for quality but not for its flavor in any way, if that makes sense. better then most of the field in this category of ipa..."
"Let me just say, i almost cried when i had this beer. Its so delicious, so interesting, and has such a great hoopy taste. I would buy this en masse if i could, but its only sold at the pub. 10/10 flavor"
"Definitely has that NE haze. The aromas and flavors of mango, pineapple and faint passion fruit deliver on that expected juice bomb character. Seemed slightly green still, bet this would be better with another week or so on it."
"From a Crowler (12/18/16) poured into a tulip. Opened during a tasting of 4 different IPAs. This was the second to be tasted. Certainly looks the part of a hazy NEIPA, and smells of one, too. It pours a light amber color with a very deep haze. Decent head retention. The tropical aromas are there, but there's also a noticeable smell of malt/wheat bread. The taste is where this beer loses me compared to other NEIPAs - I'm guessing it's the yeast strain, but it picks up some of the fruity esters I would associate with a Kolsch. There's very little bitterness here... it's almost like a sparkling fruit juice or shandy, but with the faintest hint of pine to remind you it may be an IPA. The body is great - medium with good carbonation. Virtually zero dryness on the finish."
"I have been lucky enough to have had each of the releases, from the original to last week (yes the wait in lines is worth it). It may be me but each batch seems to get better. Hopefully with the expansion Mass Riot will be on year round or at least in a rotation with the Vermont Riot."
"32 oz. crowler. Very hazy orange. Smells of citrus, tropical fruits, and garlic hops. Doesn't smell sweet, but you can smell the oat additions. Tastes very much of oats as well. It's the dominant grain flavor. Orange hops with a strong garlic bite in the back end. Medium body. The oats give it some heft without sweetness. Almost has the body of a double IPA. Impressive."
A: Hazy pale orange in color
Wow.
Poured from a crowler.
"On tap at Prison City Pub and Brewery in Auburn, NY."
"Revisiting this beer based on tasting notes, and I can't say that Paste Magazine's recent blind test (https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/247-of-the-best-american-ipas-blind-tasted-and-ran.html?p=4) does it any sort of disservice. Hazy orange, with a borderline pink hue. This is basically the beer version of Sunny-D. Big papaya, citrus, and pineapple aromas on the nose, followed by a massive punch of the same flavors on the body. Medium-bodied and satisfyingly drinkable. This is honestly the best beer that Upstate NY makes, and I'm proud to say that it's local. I hope that the folks at Prison City bring this one out year-round."
"Appearance: Pours a cloudy honey color with the bubble show forming the full three fingers; excellent retention, with copious clumps of lace"
Appearance - The beer poured a hazy yellow color with a white head.
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Hazy golden color. Aroma is fruity, hoppy and floral with a sweet background. Taste is balanced, citrusy and grainy with bitter citrus rind and grapefruit flavor."
Canned 4/11/18. I’m very happy to finally get my hands on some cans of Party Wave from the brewery without having to wait in a line. Kudos to Kane for really making their brewey experience smooth and effecient (worth noting I didn’t go on a release day). 
Decanted from a 16 oz (355 ml) can into a Kane snifter; canned on 04/11/18 and purchased at the brewery.
A very tasty lpa from Kane
On tap at Morris Tap And Grill in Randolph. Pours a golden effervescent hue with moderate frothing. Assertive aroma replete with hints of citrus and grapefruit. Similar overall flavor profile.
"I have that my buddy Dave for this, I love Kane! It has been almost 2 years since my last Kane, and he hooked me up. This is a much well worth it IPA. Is it an NE IPA, no, but it is still great. Well worth your time!!!"
"As an avid IPA drinker this is my favorite beer so it's tough to grasp that this is a limited release. On draft super fresh at Maloney's in Matawan. Pale yellow, hazy. Tropical taste, almost cotton candy-like. Hops are present but don't dominate. Some alcohol bite but very subtle. Kane needs to put this one in their regular rotation. Could drink this all day. Even the buzz feels perfect."
"Canned on 4/7. Thanks for hooking up Jason! Hazy and flat orange color with a nice head that left nice lacing on the glass. Tropical and citrus fruit smells, a hint of bubble gum. Hoppy upfront followed by malt and then some nice citrus fruit and dry finish. My favorite Kane IPA offering to date. Had this one for the first time back in Feb and it's just as good as I remember. Shared a couple of these with friends to try to spread the good word on Kane!"
holy shit is this refreshing! dialed in citrus and hella tasty! I'll party with that all night!
"Seems like every local brewery is is pumping out this type of IPA lately. Super hazy with a nice head and lacing. The smell is pulpy mango and maybe pineapple and orange. Mosaic seems to be most prominent hop. The taste follows and finishes with some herbal hops, slightly sweet malt, and a hint of alcohol heat. yb"
16 oz. can poured at 48° into a Kane teku. Canned 8 days ago.
On tap at the brewery.
A cloudy opaque orange color. Solid lacing but not much of a head on the pour. Smells like grapefruit and other citrus. Slightly dry and a lighter mouthfeel. All around a fantastic IPA. A little juice bomb perfect for the drier winter weather.
"Hazy light orange, big white head and tons of lacing. Fruity hoppy aromatics. Notes of juicy citrus salad, peach, mango and wet pine needles. Super juicy, tons of fruity aromatics, soft on the feel, low on the bitterness and crushable. This is an amazing IPA."
Just poured from a 16oz can to a tulip glass. This thing in a NJ juice bomb. I can compare this to almost anything that they are making up at the New England breweries..... fantastic
A column of dark sunburst down shrouded by lighter a lighter yellow-tangerine where the sun penetrates. Head is white a frothy. Retention is half a session in length with waterfall lacing. 
"From a can received today, Fedexed overnight. Moderate pour yields a 1 inch (very thick) head with sticky lacing. Nose of tropical fruit, citrus, and slight pine. Taste follows very nicely, nice enough to change rating from 4.25 to 4.50 on the taste from a draft pour Thanksgiving weekend. Very nice feel and overall a very nice job on this canning."
"This is one great beer. Not good, great. I don't live far from Treehouse so I drink their beer regularly, this is right up there with all of their offerings. Time to stop sleeping on the folks at Kane!"
Growler purchased at brewery on 11/26/16
"As a huge fan of Kane's brews I expected this to be good but it blew me away. I think Kane's IPA's have always been very - very good but it is their dark beer's that separate them from the crowd. Well, this might be my favorite IPA from them which is saying a lot as I love Head High n Over Head but IMO this one is even better. So drinkable and smooth, full of flavor from start to finish, just a wonderful beer. Another home run from Kane, well done."
"Have had this on draft and from a growler a few times before, but had to write a full review now as the first canned batch really upped the ante!"
"I had this on draught at the brewery. Poured into goblet. It pours a pretty, hazy golden-amber color with one finger of milk-white head and lacing with excellent retention. It has a pleasant aroma of both tropical fruit, citrus, pine needles, and floral hops. It's very well-balance with some sweet tropical fruit on the tip of the tongue and a nice blast of galaxy and citra hops. There is also sufficient malt and wheat in the base to tie the fruit and hops together. When I drank it it didn't feel like 7.2% but I did begin to feel it after I finished the glass. It is pleasantly carbonated. Overall, it's an excellent American IPA: well balanced, tasty, and fun to drink. I wouldn't expect less from Kane!"
COD 092217 Nose is pleasant. Perhaps better fresher.
Pours a beautiful orange yellow but very little head. 
"Hazy lemon drop/orange juice color with a furry, creamy, thick head of 2 fingers. Lots of lace behind. "
"Bought a 4-pack at the Congress Street brewery location. This beer has a very thick, dark orange appearance with a medium head that does dissipate with some patchy lacing. Aromas include some thick citrus hops with orangepeel and lemon. The taste follows the nose but is more vocal than the aromas. Tastes like carbonated, lightly boozy, orange juice. The mouthfeel is really good. Not too refreshing, but nothing overpowering; good carbonated body. Overall, this was fantastic, especially with its appearance and mouthfeel."
Nelson all over.
"Fresh 16oz can, served in a snifter glass. Pour is hazy, opaque golden-yellow body, slight orange hue, one finger white head, lots of retention, plenty of lacing. Smell is rich and vintage Nelson. Big juicy and spicy tropical fruit aromas, grapefruit and a bit of floral notes. The Nelson is well-expressed here, which is no surprise. Flavour is pure Nelson hop, nice mild caramel backbone, no alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and soft, as with all other NE IPAs. Yet another well-done hoppy offering from Trillium, and it follows the NE IPA MO to a dot. The Nelson character reminds me a lot of the old school Alpine Nelson."
Hazy orange gold beer. Smells like grapefruit and orange with a little mango accented with some pithy hop bitterness. Lightly sweet up front with grapefruit and mango and a bitter pithy hop finish. Fantastic beer.
16oz. can into a Surly teku. 
"Hot legs on this beer. Poured into a tulip, it has a cantolope ripe glow. Dry qualities on the finish help reign this beer in. White wine from Nelson are there for sure. Trillium yeast compliments this well."
"Pours a hazy yellow, with fine, white foam."
"There was a resiny quality to both the aroma and especially the taste that, while not terrible, was a little off-putting for me. Very nice light fruit, esp. towards pineapple. Also had a pineapple juice look to it as well. The fruits were nice in this. Smooth feel. But not pleased with the resin."
A - Pours a cloudy orange with a two finger fizzy white head.
"Sharing with Brian. Very good IPA, full of citrus and fruity flavour. Crushable beverage. Hazy orange look. Clean aroma. Above average smooth mouthfeel."
Poured from a 16 ounce can into a Dogfish Head IPA glass.
"Pours like a beautiful glass of Orange Juice. Hazy golden in color with a rich head and thick lacing. Big notes of lemon, orange zest, hops, floral, and some sweetness like honey. The taste is just out of this world, my first east coast IPA and this juice bomb is all that it is supposed to be and more. Ultra smooth goodness, loads of orange, lemon, grapefruit, sweetness from floral/honey, some minor bitterness and a ultra clean finish. This is a very light to medium IPA with more flavor than I can describe, one of my top beers to date, awesome."
"Canned 6/30. A nice pale orange, hazy and opaque. Got a sizable head when poured that faded after a couple minutes but it did leave some lacing on the glass. Very citrus forward smell, sweet and also tart, passion fruit, guava. Taste is a little restrained in respect to what was on the nose, not as citrusy but still juicy. There is some astringency but it is short lasting. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. All things considered this is a delicious and well made beer, just a bit down on the list in terms of what Trillium has to offer. Not going to stop from me enjoying the remaining 3 I have! Thanks for hooking me up, Shawn!"
"had this out of a growler poured at the brewery yesterday. light orange haze when poured. Sweet citrus smell. taste has a lot of orange overtones. carbonation was a little weak and the feel was a little flat, which was my only negative on this brew from Trillium. Love these guys."
"Nice pale ale, pale orange yellow color, little head. Not a strong nose, light aroma, light body, but highly/over carbonated - hoppy, Nelson is up front all the way."
"This one pours the classically ugly and murky orange that is typical for the style. There's a small head, and a good bit of lacing."
"16 oz can, dated 2/27/17, poured into a teku"
"Next stop on the single hop ""Street"" series by Trillium? Nelson Sauvin. Its the hop that's born and bred in the U.S. but departs from the typical grapefruit and orange flavor with piney bitterness, but falls more in line with a winey, lemony, tropical taste for a little added zing."
Churchkey during CBC 2017.
Revisit: 17 Nov 17
"Trillium always manages to get the most pure flavors of hops into their beers and this is no exception. The unique grape, melons and herb flavors of the New Zealand Nelson Sauvin hops are spot on in this beer."
"Citrus, pineapple , stone fruit on the nose "
"Pours a hazy and opaque light orange with two fingers of off-white head sticking to the top. The last few ounces of the beer release some dark particulate that aid in turning this beer from light orange to a regular orange. Head retention is good with a few patches of lacing strewn out like islands in the Pacific. Orange, tangerine, lemon zest all ooze and drip from the nose to form a smooth, sweet, and citrusy hop aroma. Flavor profile opens up a blast of citrus hops immediately and never falters as the beer finishes with a citrusy, tangy flavor. Flavor notes are orange, tangerine, lemon zest, and papaya, with a slight grain malt to it. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a filling, tiny particulate edge to it. Overall, a flavorful blast of hops that drinks with quality hop notes that are discernible and not muddled together in a shot gun blast of flavors. The lack of any delay in the hop flavors hitting the palate combined with the non-bitter, exquisitely citrus and tasty finish makes this one helluva beer to sip or gulp. "
L: Super Hazy yellowish-orange with a good amount of white head that goes away pretty quick.
"Typical hazy orange pour. Aroma is overripe apricot, orange and some white wine notes. Smooth pillowed mouth feel. Great malt/hop balance in this one, bitterness lingers like dank hoppy goodness. Very good above average IPA."
a: super hazy orange and burnt caramel. large 3 finger off-white head
Dense awesome hop juice. This is just great stuff. I'm to the point where I can't call out anything bad about these NE hop beers. Cheers to trillium they did it again
"She crept into my room wearing a burnt apron; had to wonder what the hell she was cooking. Her frays were tattered, semi-cloudy from residual burn, emitting vaporous vineyard notes in her wake. She was easily a Double D; too much for me to take in, in fact, I gawked at the sight of her existence. Original tan; her orange glow gave off a melon hue yet to be replicated by the artist's touch. Exchanging glances, like the give and pull of ballet dancers, we tip-toed around the beauty of our scent. She smells like a bed of tropical fruit wrapped in subtle notes of eucalyptus mint. When she breathes the midnight air, I get doses of four-leaf clover and scallion. Some would call this harsh, yet I call it heavenly in its brilliance. As I beckon her love to come into me, I taste an orange grove, and white grapes ready to fall off the vine. Pulling her in slowly, I understand the magnitude of this creation. It's pillowy, it's chewy, it's bitter, it's everything. She finishes more raw than I ever expected, but it's perfect. Magic, in fact. We parted ways, yet we promised each other that we would meet again. This is what I call LARRRGE. She agreed."
Poured into Trillium tulip glass
"Canned on 01/09/2017, enjoyed on 01/29/2017."
"Effing great beer man!!! Had this at Publick House in Brookline, one of the best beer bars in the Universe! I don't know if I could tell this from all of Trillium's other great IPAs but it was pretty fucking good!"
L - Hazy light orange with a finger of white head
points subtracted because i think im allergic to Nelson Sauvin hops but a really tasty beer.
"this is my new favorite Street beer (regular streets, obviously DDHed Streets are a whole other ball game). pours a very murky (but not the murkiest) golden yellow, head wasnt very big but lasted the entire glass. smell was big on the white wine and some fresh cut grass that Nelson should always bring. taste was huge white wine, lots of grass, some candied fruit, and a semi-sweet malt on the back end to bring it all around to that typical Trillium juice. the feel was actually a tad better than I remember street beers being, but I did get it fresh on tap and drank in 2 hours later as opposed to a can so that may have something to do with it. KILLER beer, I was waiting for months for them to do a Nelson variant of this. cant wait for the DDH version."
"On-tap 12/31/2016 at the brewery in Canton, MA, served in a tulip glass."
"big thanks to rowmark for yet another fresh trill hookup, very much appreciated! either trillium has been a little hit or miss with some of my faviaries lately or my palate has changed and I had been feeling like I was losing just a hint of my love for this amazing NE hop giant, but stillings street reaffirms my passion for the suds these folks brew. "
Nelson Sauvin hop is clearly the star of the show in taste and aroma
Can poured into a snifter
Gray-hued orange juice appearance with two fingers of airy white head that are fairly quick to dissipate.
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"From a growler..Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is big peach, with tangerine, white grape and light cracker. Medium-heavy bodied, slightly bitter and super juicy, with moderate carbonation. This is in the upper tier of Trillium IPAs. Delicious, I could drink this all afternoon. Stands out even in Trillium's excellent lineup of IPAs."
"Pours a super hazy and vibrant orange with a finger of white head. Aroma starts with cantaloupe and citrus with occasional hints of white grape and some tropical fruits. Taste mirrors the aroma: tons of cantaloupe, nice tropical fruit notes, more white grape, a subtle malt character, and a fairly balanced finish that just leans slightly bitter. The grape notes become more prominent as the beer warms a bit. Medium body with moderate carbonation, very creamy. Overall I really dig this beer. The flavors keep me coming back for more, super drinkable."
"As always, thanks a whole lot Kevin."
Hazy orange with white head. 
Appearance is a hazy yellow. 
16 oz can was poured into a Spiegelau glass. 
"Cans from the source. Hazy orange body with a half inch of foamy head. The aroma is a Nelson hop (perhaps my favorite hop varietal) bomb. Juicy, dank, resinous. Lovely flavor following the aroma. Medium bodied with pungent hops and an earthy resinous feel on the palate. Lingering cracker with perhaps a note of cracked pepper. Absolutely delicious."
"Hints of green onion, pineapple, and green grape. Different. Still tasty. Sweetened up nicely. Little dry too on the finish. Lighter profile than comparable street series beers."
"Hazy orange with fizzy short lived head and spotty lacing. Grapefruit and pineapple on the nose, and fruity pineapple grapefruit flavor with nice dry bitter finish. Awesome full mouth feel."
"On draft at Trillium's taproom, and out of a pounder can:"
"Dank. Grapefruit zest, orange and white grapes. Resinous. Pithy. Typical creamy Trillium mouthfeel. Balanced bitter and sweetness. Dry finish. Pretty good."
"Excited, Nelson heavy IPA from Trillium, canned 5 days ago, 8/25/16!"
"16oz. can served in my Spiegelau IPA glass. 8/25/16 printed on the bottom of the can, as well as the word 'CLEARANCE.' Pours a hazy, dull orange with a tight, one inch, bright white head that settles into a consistent, soapy slick. Slashes and swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting. The nose on this beer is incredible - a burst of grapefruit off the pour, followed by pith and herbal/floral notes. Taste follows nose - incredible balance to the flavor profile with just a hint of biscuit at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a pleasant, even carbonation and just a trace of acidity. Not my favorite from these guys, but the bar is pretty high."
Poured from a 4 day old can into teku. The appearance is the nice hazy orange you would expect from a Trillium beer. Excellent citrus flavor coming through and a nice mouth feel to pair. I'm a big fan of Nelson hops so it was nice to see them introducing this to the Street series. If you love juicy hazy IPAs this is definitely something you should try.
"Orange hazy poured from a can dated 8/25/16. Citrus smell, not strong. Mild bitter, lemon, citrus rind taste. Good finish with good carb. Liked this one a lot. A bit different from usual trillium, in a good way. I'll get this one again next time it comes around. Great IPA."
"Pours chalky unfiltered orange with a short one finger head. Smells of sweet sticky fruits and berry, some light booziness. Taste is hopped up with a distinctly different citrus than a lot of the other Trillium. This Nelson is more 'cereal' malt, and 'berry' than tropical. Still delicious and enjoyable. Smooth, present but subtle bitter. Nice contribution to the family of 'Street' IPAs."
"L - pours a brick of a turbid yellow color. Yeasty, brownish, and flat. Make of that what you may, but it's my kind of color. Fluffy head that retains itself well. As it slowly settles, legs desperately grab onto the glass. "
"A - Hazy tan orange, thin creamy lacing ring."
16 oz. can dated 08/25/16
"Canned on 8/25/16; drank on 8/27/16 in a tall tumbler glass; as a huge fan of Trillium, the Street series and Nelson hops, I was really looking forward to trying this beer; the aroma did not come through for me as much as other Trillium beers using Nelson but excellent in every other way; the malt formula for the Street series continues to support a variety of hops and is almost perfect IMO"
"Pours golden with pillowy white head. Hint of mango and pineapple in the aroma. Some white grape as well. It's incredibly soft. Has some nice sweet white grape and mango, but is met with some citrus, earthy bitterness. For me, this is in the no mans land between drinkability and intensity. I wish this were a little bit more one or the other, but it's where it's at and that's a fine beer."
"Pretty good representation of the hop. Hazy pour. Super dank. Great aroma, little bit more complexity than their other pales and ipas. Little heavy on the mouthfeel. Very little bitterness. Gets a little better as it opens up a bit. One of my favorites from these guys."
"A: Ample hop aromas of citrus and tropical fruit, coupled with white grape."
"Pours a very hazy orange with a white head. Smells of oranges, tropical fruits, and hops. Tastes of sweet papaya, mango, orange zest, grapefruit, hops, light malt, and other fruits. Medium creamy body with medium carbonation. Overall an incredible NEIPA."
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. Pours a hazy and cloudy golden yellow body with a slight orange hue. One finger white head, plenty of retention, bits of lacing on the opposite side of the glass as I drink. Smell is pineapple juice, grapefruit and citrus, a bit of sweet caramel though not too much, a little wheat germ. Flavour has a bit less of the pineapple juice quality but a more balanced light caramel with grapefruit and citrus hop aromatics, light resinous bitterness that isn't too distracting from the aforementioned hop aromatics. Not too sweet either. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, dangerously drinkable with a lighter-medium bitterness to it. Super tasty IPA."
"Just visited San Diego and picked up a 4 pack of this from their brewery. Drove it back today 9.5 hours back to Chico and cracked this one as a night cap. Smells phenomenal. Rain pouring out my window while I sip on this one with some nice background music. Also looks to be a Garage Project collab which is awesome. Super juicy, tons of citrus, but not overbearingly sweet. Poured completely hazy same color as a ripe persimmon. Glad I picked these up, cheers!"
"Received 2 cans from the great ScottO to try out. In that same package was a bottle of Citra from Kern. The Citra was a little over a week or 2 old, and in all honesty, I did not look at the relative age of the Blam Blam, but it blew Citra out of the water hands down. A brighter pour, great citrus nose, which is echoed in the flavor. A little bitter on the end, but it is an IPA. Fantastic beer."
"Probably one the best of IPAs I've had from Modern Times. They had me at Nelson, that blessed hop. Turbid haziness in a creamsicle color, the only thing wanting being a bit more foam. Obvious Nelson on the nose, a fine mix of light dank notes with mango, similar on the palate. Could perhaps be a bit fluffier in the finish (since this is the style they're obviously shooting for), but hard to quibble much with Nelson bombs like this."
"Poured on tap a HAZY orange under a half-inch thick white head which fades to a thin cap and leaves spotty lace. Aroma is pungent orange and tangerine citrus fruit, juicy and herbal dankness. Flavor is more focused on grapefruit pith along with tangerine/orange notes and tropical. Medium body and carbonation. Finishes soft, cloud-like, dry and somewhat bitter. Delightful."
"This is a pale gold/orange that looks like white grapefruit juice with a splash of OJ. There is a nice white head that left only a few globs of lacing on the glass. The aroma is mainly grapefruit pith bitterness, mango, orange with some floral notes. The taste is mainly bitter with grapefruit pith as the main component. The orange and and mango sweetness comes through in the aftertaste and blends nicely with the bitterness for a good finish. This is a really nice and delicious hazy IPA."
"L - Thick orange shake, thick head"
16oz can poured into speiglau - 11/16/16. Can#10749
look is like orange juice. pretty bright looking. just like doppleganger or green from treehouse.
"Blam blam pours a golden orange haze for days color, with a finger of bright Whit head. The aroma is of peaches,orange sherbet,grape fruit juice. It smells like pure juice, it smells amazing. The taste follows the nose completely with a nice dank bitterness on the finish, what an awesome take on a new England ipa"
"Draught pour at Davis Beer Shoppe into a shaker pint. Pours hazy bronze yellow with finger of white high density head that left some lacing. Nose is mucho fruit, nice mix of grapefruit citrus balanced by mango and apricot, and perhaps some peach. Taste followed the nose, very juicy and a fair bit of astringency with minimal bitterness. Mouthfeel had just enough body, very smooth and easy drinking, carbonation medium, the softest mouthfeel I've had in a MT beer. I'd say it's the most NE style beer I've had from them. I enjoyed it immensely, and I'll gladly have again but not sure I'd want more than one."
A 200ml pour on draft at Mikkeller Bangkok into a mini stemmed Mikkeller tasting glass.
"Draft poured into tulip glass on tap at Mikkeller Bangkok. Cloudy, golden color. Frothy, sticky head with mixture of small and large carbonation bubbles. Prominent tropical mango smell, very pleasant. Mixture of juicy fruits in taste, a combination of grapefruit, citrus and kiwi. Nice depth and mixture of flavors brought about by the Amarillo, Denalli and Nelson hops. Mouthfeel is not too sticky, but not too light- fine balance. Slight tinge of bitter, dry finish. A lush, fruity and juicy IPA that I really enjoyed."
"NE style IPA using Nelson and Amarillo hops. A turbid creamsicle milkshake, topical fruit flavors dominate...mango, kiwi, orange with a nice nelson bite. If you are looking for a dry WC IPA look elsewhere! Can't believe MT nailed this profile so well so fast. Hope they keep making more of these!"
"16 oz can, purchased a few hours ago from the source in Beacon, NY....11/6/18 caning date."
Decanted from a 32 oz crowler into a conical pint glass; canned on 07/14/2018.
"Drank on tap at Hudson Valley Brewery, Beacon, NY"
"Wow! Like a Ninja Turtle on DMT, this one is unique! Sour and hoppy all together! It's like a SI model moonlighting as your uber driver - I like that!"
"Nice sour IPA looks that leaves good spotty lacing, but the star of the show is the nose: smells of tangerine, grapefruit, peppery spices, tea leaf, orange peel, chamomile, toasted grains, yeast, floral notes and light cinnamon and/or potpourri that somehow works as a nice sour IPA. I’m not normally a fan of intense spices nor the extra floral notes mixed with potpourri like chamomile, but this works with the sour/tart IPA citrus notes. Crazy combo that somehow works well."
Is it me or is there an underlying hint of nutmeg to the tropical fruits. Delicious. Thanks Steve!
"This one pours a very hazy yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
chamomile and tropical--fruits--lychee on the nose.......Flavors move from cinnamon (none actually in there!) to key lime to lychee and tropical fruits...slightly sweet (more like fruity) and moderately sour...
Here we go again... Canned 2/22/18; reviewed 2/26/18.
"Another winner from Kane, NJ's best brewery IMO. Head High is a wonderful beer and this continues that. So juicy with citrus notes while also being well balanced and smooth. Excellent beer."
"Thanks to The Terminator, SadMachine, for this 500ML bottle. "
Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle
Recently offered in 16.9 oz bottles. WHOO HOO! Poured into Aslin Teku glass.
"Beautiful peach colored hazy hue with a thick head and great lacing. Aromas are strong, fruity and pungent. Notes of ripe peaches, dank, citrus pulp, citrus rinds and light pine. Medium body, creamy, coating, soft and dry on the finish with a nice lingering bitterness on the palate. This is as good as an IPA can get. It was a bit green, as I drank it 3 days old, for my liking so I'll revisit the flavor score after it sits a bit."
"Pours a very cloudy, dark golden yellow color with pineapple colored edges and a two finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Good retention, slowly settling with streaks of soapy lacing left clinging to the glass on its way down."
"Growler from Joe Canals. Pours thick and creamy into my pint glass. Big, fluffy head. Smells nice, hoppy citrus. The taste is where it really stands out. Big, super hoppy citrus bomb of an IPA. Rich, creamy, juicy. This is the perfect hoppy IPA. I love Kane and, since they don't bottle sixers or four packs, I'm happy to make them a regular growler fill. cheers!"
A- Absolutely gorgeous hazy glowing orange color with a plume of tight white head that leaves tons of lacing!
growler from the brewery poured into tulip - thanks Wiid!
"Peach golden color with a thick white head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Notes of fresh squeezed lemon and lime, citrus zest, grapefruit, tangerine, touch of black peppercorn and a candied herbal sweetness. Carbonation seems spot on refreshing, crushable, light medium body, slightly dry and soft on the palate. This is a fantastic, zippy and even slightly tart, juicy, hop bomb of an IPA. Blew me away."
L: Hazy and cloudy peach/golden orange body replete with a fluffy white head and ample lacing
"Cloudy, hazy pale orange body with a fluffy bone-white head. Aroma is oranges, limes, dank grass, hints of tropical fruits, fruity candy. Big orange and lime flavor up front, with a wave of big juicy tropical hops from the middle to the finish. Feel is slightly creamy, well carbonation with a lingering stickiness. Really solid fruited IPA."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a taster glass.
32 oz. growler poured into a Hill Farmstead wine glass.
"I glanced at the label maybe 75 times before I realized it was a play on “Stoner,” because I am an idiot. It's also their one-year anniversary beer, and the description made it sound like it was if Bell's Wedding Ale was an IPA:"
2-liter growler I picked up on Sunday and consumed within a couple of hours. Poured into a matching Tired Hands oversized wine glass the brew appears a clouded golden color with a frothy white topping. Some spotty strings of lace stick to the glass and the brew overall shows decent retaining powers.
"1L, Filled 6/4/13, drank 6/6/13"
"I don't always review. But when I do, it's at the behest of my Dr. friend. Courtesy of his incredible self. Unmarked growler of heaven. Served in my Tired Hands wine glass."
On tap at First Anniversary party.
Growler filled yesterday at Tired Hands' 1st Anniversary party. Poured into a tulip glass.
Graciously shared by Derek (Rifugium) and his wife last night.
"some how my previous review from the first release was gone, so I will post my notes from the recent in its place."
"I have never reviewed a beer as a 5.0 but this beer honestly deserves it. This may well be the tastiest brew I have had out of over 2,000 beers. "
First had: on tap at TH
"Not much smell, but the look is bar none awesome. Nice lace on the glass, just the right head and a deep rich amber. However, I drink beer for the taste not the look. Yes taste is a 4 and I would like to try this on draft, but it could use a little more malt backbone."
Only downside: available only in NM and CO
"Nice copper color beer. Not much head but good lacing. Better hop aroma. And good hoppy taste. Mouthfeel is a good balance of hops that’s not too bitter. Overall it’s a very good IPA and I’m glad I got a 4 pack to take home, based on BA ratings. Canned 09/06/18"
1 pint can:
"I picked up a four pack of tall boys for a camping trip to Guadalupe Mountains national park earlier this week. This is a big, aggressive brew with high bitterness and a heavy citrus and herbal hop lean. The finish is juicy and puckers the lips a bit. I would definitely take this camping again if given the chance."
"Elevated is a beautiful looking beer. The brightly polished copper color is familiar and inviting, and the foamy eggshell white pillow above is comforting. The patches and rings of lace are the impressive marks of a professional."
"The beer to bring back from a trip to northern New Mexico. I pour most of the 16 oz can into a chilled tall mug, see a nice yellow-orange body with enough head to keep track of the sips. Hoppy, of course, strongly so. I detect lemon, grass and a bit of sweetness at the end. The taste and bitterness linger. Should be the first beer of a session before you move on to lesser brews, just make the four pack last."
"August 19th, 2015 - Cumbre's Get Elevated IPA is a solidly median IPA, neither good nor bad, but with a hop profile that is boring on its own but fits a meal very nicely. The aroma is generically hoppy and reminds me of old school pale ales, neither sweet nor grapefruity. The flavor is flattish but the palate is fine. Nice and buoyant, it has a sharp hop profile that lasts a long way through the aftertaste, but is both a little direct and metallic."
"Can at Brixens, Albuquerque, NM"
"Pours clear copper with a medium white head. Aroma brings out fresh piney hop character and a dry biscuity malt backing. Flavor is clean, with tons of piney hops, citrus, and biscuity malt. Piney and dry, with a wonderfully oily palate. Sharp dry and bitter finish."
"16 ounce can received in a BIF. Dated 2/28/18, poured into tulip. "
"Poured from the can into pint glass in Grants, NM! Good New Mexico IPA. Not quite getting the ""outstanding"" but would like to have again."
LOOKS: A very orang-ey amber in the sunlight with a large white foam that lasts. Mild lacing down the glass.
"I live in Albuquerque where this is brewer and it's on tap everywhere, to the point where it's hard to get a different brand IPA on tap. And I can't understand why. It's completely over-hyped. The super hop oil taste is interesting, but it has kind of a burnt afte-taste that's off putting. I guess if you like beer over-cooked, it is great. I think people think of New Mexico and extreme flavors, like the chiles here, but it's gets very old after a few tastes. There are much better IPA's out there. And La Cumbre has much better offerings, such as its stellar Red Ryeot. This one though, don't believe the hype."
"Poured a deep orange color into a tulip glass. Lots of citrus on the nose, but grapefruit really stood out. This was intense! From front to back layers of fruit, hops, pine and malts. Bitter, hoppy, fantastic."
"Pours an orange-amber. Bright, fruity aromas, primarily grapefruit. Taste starts off with a solid citrus tang, followed by pine and a sour-bready aftertaste. Notes range from orange and grapefruit to caramel and biscuit. I really liked the combination of flavors, though nothing knocked me off my feet. But in New Mexico, where it's all over the place, it's my go-to."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2017. This had a great blend of dank and citrus, very bitter and clean and crisp. It could use a bit more depth, but it was very nearly top tier."
"This beer award winning IPA is a real treat. Discovered upon during New Mexico travels, available throughout the state in can and draft. It's worth seeking out for sure. At 100 IBUs, this IPA is perfect for fans of this type. "
"Picked up a single from Kings Beer and Wine 10-21-17 for $2.99. Canned on 10-12-17, best by 1-10-18."
"While Pliny may be the benchmark, this beer, at exactly the same IBUs and nearly the same malt and hop profile, is fantastic. Very close to Pliny and just so freakin’ good. And it comes in a can. And you can actually find it."
"Dark gold and hazy in color. Nice lingering head that laces well. Abundant scents of pineapple, orange-peel, and a hint of biscuit. Outstanding, deep flavors of grapefruit, pomegranate, pineapple, wet pine, old road and honeysuckle on the front palate, with a great, balanced finish of malty goodness. Love the taste of this beer. Has a medium feel, overall one of my favorites."
on tap from the Craft Beer Quik Stop
"Pours a clear orange with a white head. Smells of malt, caramel, hops, and some citrus. Tastes of very fresh and mildly bitter hops, sweet caramel malts, and citrus zest. Medium in body and carbonation. Overall a very fresh and delicious IPA from a new brewery for me."
"Deep gold with thick head and sticky lacing. Notes of hops, pine, citrus, grapefruit. The taste follows the nose, this sucker is a hop bomb, full on flavor with a bite of pine and dryness. A very very good IPA, blended with some citrus and min sweetness, this is a hoppy good beer."
This is the best IPA I've tried. Only recently discovered IPAs and loving the hoppy citrus flavour packed in abundance in the Elevated IPA
"I think this is a good DIPA. World-class seems to be a little high though. Maybe it's because it's a New Mexico beer and hasn't been criticized enough. That being said, this blows anything I've had from Wyoming out of the water. So being that it's New Mexico is pretty remote for most of us, I wouldn't pass this up if you're in the state. Pours a deep gold, almost maroon. A tiny bit of lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel malts and orange. Taste is the same. Feel is lightly carbonated. Overall good to very good."
"16oz can. 7/4/17 can date. Appearance: Deep golden orange, mostly clear with a light haze, and a moderate thick foam head and decent lacing. Aroma: Dank, resinous, grassy hop aroma dominates, with a touch of grapefruit pulp and toasted malt. Taste: Bready, caramel maltiness with a touch of toast turns spicy and grassy resin and a strong bitter finish with some grapefruit. Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied for the style, with a moderate carbonation. Finish: Dry, sticky resinous bitterness remains on the tongue long after the swallow. Touch of toasted malt comes back retronasally. Overall: Well made take on a true traditional American IPA. Has the resinous grapefruit character against a strong malt base that brings the body and balance of a traditional AIPA as opposed to West Coast"
Thanks to Wasatch for this one!
Always excited to try the flagship IPA of a town's flagship brewery (I'm writing this review so I get to choose what is what) 
Acquired via trade from Wasatch so a big “Thank You” goes out to him. Poured from a 16oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.
I had a can of this at La Boca in Santa Fe. It poured a slightly hazy orangish with white head that left a nice ring lace down the glass. The scent had hints of citrus. The taste leaned slightly bitter with bitter grapefruit start then a mild finish. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it was a great beer.
"I poured this into a nonic pint glass. I didn’t see any date anywhere, but my trader did say this is two weeks old. The appearance has a nice hazy golden color with a nice one finger white foamy head that ends up dieing after a minute. The lacing is extremely slight and stringy clinging right to the sides of the glass. The smell is dank nasty - whoah, I love it for the most part, where did this awesome stuff come from (New Mexico, haha, I love it uh....Heady and Pliny uh...I think you have a contender), There’s a nice allocation of spicy and bitter hops to slightly overcome the sweet maltiness that ends up trying to come out. The taste is mainly bitter but in a good way, as there’s nothing really telling me there’s any sweetness to it no matter how much I let it warm. The aftertaste is pure bitter and dank nasty (nasty in a spectacular way). The finish is somewhat dry. On the palate, it sits about a medium in body with a decent carbonation that goes well for the AIPA style that is fairly harsh but still adds enough to compensate for a decent harshness. Overall, in my opinion, this is an awesome AIPA that I would love to welcome again. However, because of where I live, I’m only able to get this through trade, no worries, I would love to have this again and possibly see if I could put this with its respected food."
"Steady head that was very slow to dissipate. Beautiful amber, brown color. Aroma of intense pine needles, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, alcohol, malt, grass. Palate follows with deep, intense bitter hop that only grows as you pay attention to it, candied pineapple, mango, yellow apple, lemon, lime, white flower, very complex with thick, decadent almost syrupy body. Pros complex, intense, boozy but not very noticeable. Cons not super refreshing because of intensity, thick tongue coating texture, 100IBU can be a con to some. 95/100"
"Never expected to find a near perfect (IMO) IPA driving around New Mexico. The fresher the find, the better the hops, "
"Pretty in the glass with great lacing. Orange marmalade smell promises a decent amount of sweetness. Great resinous hop bite cuts through a quite sweet, honey malt tastes. The flavors melding are great - really potent hopes tempered in the perfect ways to bring out citrus zest and juice. Plesant linger. Really great ipa"
Canned on 01/23/2017. Enjoyed on 03/31/2017.
"Nose: floral with a touch of citrus that comes through at the end of a good long waft. Makes me feel like I should be drinking it in the queen of England's garden without a cloud in the sky and it's 78 out...for some reason, the beach is involved as well. "
"La Cumbre brings the hops with this one. Maltiness paired with a little bitter and a lot of floral hops, awesome nose and some meat to the body, a little darker than I prefer but still well worth the purchase."
Poured from a 1 pint can.
"16oz can into a pint glass. best by 10/31/16, so just under the wire here. surprise addition to a haul bought back to pa by b-i-l Brian and nephew josh. thanks guys!"
A friend brought this back for me after a trip to New Mexico. A very kind gesture I must say.
Review 9/16/17 on a can dated 7/4/17 (BB 10/4/17):
A - nice golden Amber clear colored beer with a white head that sticks reasonably well and leaves okay lacing
"Enjoyed at Cowgirl Taproot at the bar, Santa Fe, NM"
On tap at the brewery. Deep golden color with decent head and light lacing. Aroma is nicely hoppy with mostly citrus and subtle pine. The pine is a bit stronger in the flavor. Nicely balanced with a good astringent bitterness in the finish. I brought a 4-pack home to CT for my friends to try. Also sent some Tree House beers back to La Cumbre for them to try
"Pours a clear, dark amber with a noticeable chill haze. The creamy and dense white head leaves sheets of lace behind."
"L: deep gold color, lacing head"
Poured a clear golden color with a good two fingers worth of foamy white head. The nose is all hops with a good combination of pine and citrus. The taste follows the nose as its a punch of hops in the face. You taste the pine but the bitterness is cut down a bit by the citrus fruit flavor that follows closely behind. The feel is medium and well carbonated. This is a wonderful IPA. The hops are definitely the star and you know the IBU's are 100 unlike other I've had that make such a claim. I wish this beer was available where I lived.
"Poured from a 16oz can it poured a clear golden sunset color with a 2 finger white head nice lacing streaks , smel was all citrus . orange and grapefruit, some tangerine , taste follows nose nice fruity hops on the front with a caramel malt finish, mouth feel was smooth and sweet with nice fruity hops. really liked this one"
Canned 3 weeks ago. Served at 40-42 degrees. Poured into Tulip Pint La Cumbre glass.

Revisit: 3 Nov 18
"Canned on 5/2/16; picked up a couple of 4 packs on our cross country trip from Tucson AZ to Maple Shade NJ. Purchased at Sprout's Farmers Market in Albuquerque, NM. Poured into a tulip glass"
"Pours a nice clear gold. You can smell the aroma from a few feet away. Huge grapefruit, resin, spice, pine, and some malt. The taste is even better. Assertive spice, resin, citrus, and bitterness. A piney, malty, and bitter aftertaste lingers for some time. A hugely flavorful IPA. Bitter but still balanced with plenty of bready goodness. A standout beer."
I had this IPA at a nice Italian restaurant in Albuquerque. It was delicious.
Great beer with great taste.
"fresh fresh fresh canNed on 4/4, thanks shoelesssclownratmanguy. at first I found elevated to be a but syrupy, but enjoying it now. had it before. at first thought this was a bad batch. it is hard to tell, my tastes evolve over time. when I first had this beer I had never had any trillium or tree house, that stuff changes your opinion on the ipa style in general, but this still holds as a great beer. definitely on the danker and denser side of the spectrum but nice flavoring without unnecessary bitterness."
Poured from a 16 oz can with a born on date of 3/2/16 and best by date of 5/31/16; into a pub glass.
Deep gold to pale amber in color and clear. A quarter inch of head settling to almost nothing with good lacing as it goes down.
"Magnificent, hoppy brew! yes sir, I will take another."
"Mostly-clear dark, syrupy orange-amber color with a thick finger of white head that quickly dissipates but leaves fairly heavy lacing. Big aroma of pine with a mix of orange, pineapple and mango behind. Fruity and hoppy up front, with a wonderful aftertaste of a little tropical fruit and lingering bitterness. Medium-to-heavy bodied with a prickly, oily mouthfeel. Excellent beer."
"Damn, this smells like I've got my face in a big pile of hops. Big spicy pine and with underlying apricot. I guess it helps that it was canned yesterday. It's big, dank, and resinous, but still dry and drinkable. I want another. Go find yourself some."
"Pours a deep golden Amber color. Aroma is citrus, pine and some maltiness. Flavor pine and resin with a balanced malty backbone. Overall this is nice, has a little bitterness to it but still nice overall,"
"Pours honey gold color smell is of a light citrus pineapple, taste is hoppy but not overpowering, slight bitterness, mouthful is light kinda crisp overall solid IPA alcohol is hidden well could almost be session"
"Pours a honey orange clear color, head is 1/4th of an inch and off white. Lacing and head retention are very good. "
16 oz can. Pours clear copper gold with a big bubbly white head that retains well and laces the glass some.
"Pours dark golden, with two finger head. Head doesn't linger. Smells aggressively hoppy. Taste starts almost sweet, then bitter hops kicks in. The taste lingers well. Feel is smooth, not overly carbonated. Very drinkable."
"I acknowledge and accept that this will get flagged but... @TheStoutLord, what the hell is a southern style IPA?"
"Bought 2, pint cans at bottle shop in Denver."
"L: Crystal clear copper color. Good looking white head, poured into a tulip. Some bubbles, implies moderate carbonation. "
Poured a darker yellowish gold color into my tulip glass. The nose is slightly muted from the blend of hops and the resin from them also. Seems a little heavy towards the west coast style IPA from what I expected. More malty than hoppy in the nose I guess. The taste follows the nose lots of malt flavor and some hoppy flavors follow this. The mouth feel is smooth. This is a little to much of a west coast style IPA for my palate but that is what it is. Just not my favorite style.
Heard lots of good things about El Cumbre and this IPA in particular. I'll put in my own two cents:
2-4
"Beautiful dark copper color. Nice two finger head after an aggressive pour. So-so lacing. Big huge citrus and piney aromas. Flavor has a lot of orange peel with a bit of bitterness and just a hint of sweetness. Medium bodied with minimal carbonation, somewhat of an oily mouthfeel. This is one of the better IPAs available, glad that La Cumbre is now in distribution to the Front Range."
"Crystal clear, golden/ orange color. Tiny head barely sticking around to the sides of the glass. Some alcohol legs. "
L: A very nice copper orange color that pours a frothy white head that slowly dissipates. Nice white fingers of lacing around the glass.
"Very big tasting IPA. Poured from a can into a pint glass., clear yellow gold. Very fragrant with a nice citrus smell. Taste is a old citrus with grapefruit, orange and tangerine flavors. A crisp feel with a bit of a spicy aftertaste. Very nice."
Poured into a tulip
"this is one of my very favorite beers. I only wish I could get it more often. to bad I live in WNY. if you can get some of this, get it!!"
"On tap at brewery. Don't be surprised by the faint nose, big hops follow. Deep golden color, soft creamy head, some streaky lacing. Silky smooth, almost syrupy body. Hops linger...for a while. Big hoppy IPA."
"Super clear copper colored brew with a white head that leaves moderate lacing. The aroma is weed, grapefruit and vanilla with a bit of earthiness. The taste is amazing. Malty sweet with grapefruit, tons of hops and the faint taste of vanilla in the background. Amazing beer and one I am glad to have been able to try."
Cheers to Dustin for this can
Dark amber pour with medium head. 
"16oz can, somewhat sloppily printed on the bottom edge of the can is two lines of text — "
"Substantial orange color here, off white head. Aroma was dank simcoe, citra, warrior, who knows, but thats what it came off as. "
This is a great beer. I would give the slight edge to this over project dank. Not overly bitter but there is a decent hop presence. Worth trying at least once.
"Excellent beer. Taste has a strong malt presence; lots of caramel and biscuit, yet the hops stand up to it, along with the malt flavors there are plenty of fruity notes, no bitterness. Very impressive ipa"
L: Pleasing golden honeycomb and slight rust hues with a minimal half inch or so of head
"First review here, so bare with me! "
"Purchased from jubilation in ABQ. Hop profile reminds me of Modern Times Blazing World, but the bitterness is a bit higher. Overall, a very tasty beer! This one is up there in terms of quality with some of the best IPAs out there."
Oh what an rosy Amber with a fastly fading 1/4 inch of foam but once you taste there is greatness. It is the blast of hops without muddle of flavors just clear clean refreshment to crisp finish. Greatness in a can!
Got on tap at the la cumbre it was served a dark golden color with a 1.5 finger white head.it is very hoppy beer that has good bitterness to it. Pine and citrus hops stand out in the taste. Well worth having. A top rated IPA
16 oz can. Really like the graphics and coloring on the can. Straw orange amber color with very slight haze. . Piney sweet malt aromas. Moderate finish for the style. Slightly bitter yet refreshing and citrusy with a slight dryness at the end. Can it be all of that in one taste? The answer would be hell yes with a Chinese acrobat balancing all of these characteristics on a tiny chair. Someone wrote solid IPA. Solid? I would say solid if they handed me one because this beer is outstanding.
Great dry hop smell and clean refreshing taste. Not very much malt characteristics in this beer which it what I love in IPA's. I wish this came to my neck of the woods!
I found these in a Telluride liquor store cooler. The canning date is 09/08/15. I've been wanting to try this beer for a while and was ecstatic with my find. 
Recent convert to IPA's after having a La Cumbre Elevated and a Bosque Brewery Scale Tipper! The best New Mexico has to offer.
16 oz can poured into tulip. No canning date 
16oz can. Date of 7/24
"16oz can poured into a tulip, canned 7/6/15"
"16 oz can. Bright orange amber with very slight haze, finger white head dissipates with a little lace. Big aroma of dark fruit and pine. The taste punches you in the mouth with lots of piney hops and sweet malt, but the hops win turning into an earthy grassy finish. Hops/bite linger maybe a little too long. Medium slick mouthfeel, high carbonation. Overall very good DIPA if looking for big piney hops."
Probably the best thing in New Mexico. My only complaint is that I only bought a four pack while I was there. Just a great fruity and hoppy IPA. Super fresh and minimal hoppy dryness and bitterness.
Wow! Just wow! That good! Get some!
"This is hard to review objectively, since this IPA has ruined me for most other IPAs out there - at least ones that are carbonated to this level. Part of the bite that people attribute to being ""too hoppy"" is due to that aggressive carbonation. But it's a great, big, west-coast style IPA done by a brewery that can do almost no wrong (ok, that state fair cream ale, bleh...but probably the style of beer that is the problem for me). Heady. Dank, awesome, and refreshing. Can have one easily. Two, I start seeing things. Three, meet your best friend, a unicorn."
"Bite, pine and too much malt. That's what you're going to get here. This could have passed as a world class IPA ten years ago, but this is nothing special or worth seeking out today."
"This beer poured great and had excellent clarity. For a 100 IBU beer, however, it did not have the aroma and flavor that I was looking for. Not sure if this can was a little dated, or if this is just more a malt forward IPA, which is not my forte, but the bitterness was still great."
"Another from ONovoMexicano's NBS BIF #2 Box 'O Goodies! Good, crisp, clean, solid example of the style. Would be in regular rotation were it local to me. Worth trying if you see it."
Thank you gatheredwaters for this
"From a 16 oz can (""Danked"" on June 18, 2015) to a shaker pint glass. Reviewed from notes dated June 20, 2015."
"Deep copper hue with an off white head that builds thick and laces great. Citrus rinds, dank, piney slightly earthy and peppery and the taste follows almost exactly with building bitterness after each sip. Medium body, coating and dry finish. Overall a really solid IPA."
Poured into snifter glass from can. No date on can. 
On tap at the brewery and again out of a can back at the hotel room. 
Top notch IPA. One of the best out there. One of the few IPAs in Albuquerque that continue to leave a lasting impression.
"Let me flesh out my initial rating, had this on draft & can. My first taste this was less than a week old"
"APPEARANCE: Bright, brilliant orange with no haze to speak of. The head is close to perfectly white and very foamy. Retention is strong as the half-inch takes about three minutes to eventually fall down to a bubble-thin cap. The lacing is gorgeous, covering most of the back side of the glass with just a few small, circular “windows”. Mouthwatering appearance."
Something REALLY rubs me wrong about the aroma. The taste and texture quickly make up for that. Well done IPA!
Great all around NM IPA
"Malt forward IPA with hints of citrus and a pine like dry finish, not bad."
"16,oz can poured into nonic pint "
"A: Cloudy, copper in color with a thin, white head"
"Dank, resiny with citrus and orange. Good stuff."
Look: About a finger of white head after pour. Dissipates rather quickly. Decent lacing on the sides of the glass. Dark gold body.
Finally! Can from Tin Bucket.
"The dankest of dank IPAs. This is a potent beer with all the flavor and aroma one expects from an IPA, plus its ABV can knock you out after a couple/few. It is very delicious. I like to have one after a ""session"" beer, like Rudie from SKA. I cannot say enough great things about this beer from La Cumbre. It is totally worth seeking out."
"What is there left that could be said about this beer? I've had it hundreds of times, I absolutely love it. It's hop and malt profile go together perfectly. Citrus, pine, and floral notes dominate the nose, and it's the perfect amount of bitterness. One of the best beers in NM (and anywhere) and its GABF gold medal is well-earned."
Really solid IPA here... super hoppy and dank
The best IPA I have had in a very long time
Can. I can't find a date on it. Pours a sightly hazy light orange color with decent head. Aroma is peach and pine. Flavor is fairly bitter with a strong orange and grapefruit character. This beer is fantastic. I'd love to try this on draft or super fresh in cans.
Drinks like I can can have 8. Feels very sessionable!
"Burnt amber/orange body. Off-white sticky head. This has a great smell. Pineapple, sharp hops, some light pine and juicy fruit. What a great hop taste. Of course, the taste and smell are similar. Heady Topper is spectacularly balance. Elevated leans more on the bitter/hoppy side...zingy taste. Hop bite, with a great taste. The feel is well-suited for this IPA. Not too light or too heavy, but a more full IPA. A double IPA could fit into this body. The carbonation is substantial and fits well in the mouth."
Great tropical smell amazing taste one of my favorite ipas.
"I actually liked this beer more than I expected to, given that I'm not a big IPA guy. This one looks intimidating from the outside, with a slightly higher alcohol content and 100 IBU's, but it doesn't just beat you into submission with hops. There's a good flavor here and I can see why this is their biggest seller. If I could get more of this brewery's stuff in my area, I'd try other beers from them too."
"This got me hooked on IPAs. All others prior were too strong, too flat, too citrus-y, too pine-y... too overpowering and unbalanced. Some are just plain boring. This one is just right."
"Up and comer here, and the name of the game is: BIG. This one smells and tastes big, almost too big at times, the bitterness a bit much, the strong citrus and pine notes just huge. It totally works, it was just a bit of a chore by the end of the can. That said, for American hop heads, this'll be right up your alley."
Hoppy goodness from La Cumbre. Delicious without being too bitter; every bit as good as if not better than Heady. Looking forward to trying Project Dank.
I've only had a few but they were a most memorable experience.
16oz can that's about a month old. Thanks to BeerMeBro720 for this one!
Can brought back by David and shared tonight at the Christmas Party. 
"Tall cans from trade. Thanks. Pours clear golden orange with a creamy yet fluffy half inch white head on top. Big hop aroma wafting out of the can and my glass with definite strong pine notes, citrus and grapefruit, grass, quite classic smelling IPA but with extra big aromatics. Flavor is dry bitter pine up front, fades into lightly sweet grapefruit and mango notes, some buscuity malts, finishing dry on the palate. Medium bodied at first but surprisingly light on the tongue, resinous, plus carbonation. This is really good, but the taste doesn’t quite live up to the awesome aroma."
"16 oz tallboy can. Sticker on the 4 pack ""Canned 10/24/2014"""
Very good IPA. Possibly the best beer in NM.
"a really solid can of ipa here, from a brewery that is new to me. this one is more of the classic simcoe centennial type hop profile with huge pine and is very bitter and woody. the malt base is nice too, sturdy enough for enormous hop dosing, while adding a fresh baked character to it. the hops are bitter all the way through, almost vegetal at the mid point they are so fresh, and then more of a pine sap thing in the finish where the sweetness of the malt flashes back with the honey sweetness of the hop oils. i love this combination. the size is just right, and the mouthfeel is right on, with a big frothy body but a cleaner finish and carbonation that keeps it moving but doesnt rush. i think i liked the full nelson and the project dank a little more even than this one, but what a solid beer, and this brewery is making a series statement with its hoppy beers. wow."
First impression: Low C (2.87) / AVERAGE
"Out of the can, poured into a Zwanze 2014 glass 9/20/2014."
Healthy gold/amber color. 
"Really awesome on first sniff and sip, but doesn't keep up at the same level through the glass. Still solid 4.25-4.5."
Type: 16-oz. can
Appearance- Golden amber with a one finger head produced. 
"This beer totally surprised me, and I was expecting good. I'm not exactly sure how fresh the cans were, but they were fresh enough. I'd safely call this Heady-lite. As close as I've had in a while with just a little less of a great finish. (which the finish could have been freshness related)."
"I'm not one to write many reviews, but this beer justified an exception. With being a huge IPA/DIPA fan and reading all of the reviews, I had high hopes for this beer. I generally compare every IPA that I run across to Surly Furious, as that for me, is my #1 IPA. "
Huge thanks to Darrell for the hookup!
"16 oz. tall boy can proudly stamped with the New Mexico flag. Pours copper, and fairly clear. A beige two finger high head has average retention and leaves a couple of rings of suds on the glass."
"MASSIVE thanks to my buddy Chico for bringing this all the way back from ABQ to MA and now I am consuming it in Chicago, Illinois on a road trip of my own. I sampled this with him once a few days ago."
Cans shared by stillmatic2232. Thanks man!
"The last of a 4-pack picked up at the brewery during a road trip. Had never heard of La Cumbre prior to getting there, this was a really nice find while in Albuquerque. This can is probably about 2 weeks old."
Can into Heady stemless wine glass.
"L - Darker amber, with caramel tones"
"Hmmm. How to describe this beer. It is reminiscent of Heady with it's dankness, smell, and flavor profile. Yet, it's much more drinkable. Has a lighter body to it and leaves you wanting more. Citrus, pine, and I wanna say a Simcoe hop bomb."
1794th Review on BA
"Canned on 4-27-14. Slightly hazy golden-amber with faint carbonation streams rising toward a steadily dissipating but sticky slightly-off-white head of foam, about 3/4"" thick at its height. Aromas of peach, mango, tangerine, pine, and candied grapefruit rind. Bold grapefruit zest taste upfront, with mango, peach, and very slight malt sweetness afterward. Finishes with a sugared grapefruit zest and pine flavor. Dry (finishes at 1.013, according to the tap list at the brewery taproom), with slight alcohol slickness. Drying effect on the palate afterward. Just an outstanding example of a West Coast-influenced American IPA. For me, it ranks among Pliny the Elder and Wipeout IPA as one of my absolute favorite takes on the style. Proud this brewery is my local."
"Pours a slightly hazy, bright golden orange color with a one finger white foam head that quickly settles into a lasting ring. Decent retention with some spotty lacing left behind. "
A- Beautiful looking clean copper with a dense near white head of about 2 fingers. Terrific staying power and excellent retention. Maybe the best looking filtered IPA I have seen in a while.
One of the best IPA's in USA.
"Golden orange body with a thick, chunky, white head. A very powerful, juicy citrus hop aroma; orange, lemon, pine. An immense bitterness with a solid, delicious undercurrent of biscuit-like malt flavors. Medium bodied; a bit coarse on the tongue; big, dry finish."
Canned 3/22/14 at 45 degrees into standard pint glass
The beer comes in a slightly hazy light orange amber color. 
"A: golden/copper color, great head and lacing. A lot of bubbles. Looks incredibly enticing."
thanks to BA buyyourfreedom for this one! 16oz. can poured into a NEBCO DIPA snifter
La Cumbre Elevated IPA
"Thanks Mario, for giving me this beer from a brewery I have never heard of. Wow, that's how this story begins...Pours a hazy golden color with a small white head. Scent is packed with hoppy aromas, tropical and citrus fruit aromas. Tons of heavy hop aromas. Fresh hop leaves and fresh fruit...very little malt. Taste is just as it smells. The hop profile on this beer is ridiculous... so damn tasty. Drinkability is very high. Mouthfeel is near perfect. Overall, this is a beer that fights amongst the best of the best west coast IPAs...and no bruises on this one. Amazing IPA."
From 02/11/14 notes. Another big thanks to BeerLaywer85 for sharing another want; thanks Ross! 16 oz. can into my Bell's tulip.
16oz can with no date. After having some world class IPAs was interested to try this highly rated one. Pours a golden with decent bubbles and a sticky coating white head leaving clouds along the entire length of the glass. Smells of hop resin with some sweet citrus and a bit of orange peel. Goes down very smooth with a creamy feel that isn't too bitter or sweet. well balanced - would be a regular buyer if i could get more
Poured out of a can into a stemless Alchemist glass.
A- Murky orange/yellow/golden hue. Lots of head with this can. Retention is medium. Thin layer of head hangs on throughout. 
Thanks to Gunch52 for the hookup on this!
Thanks to hopmaneric for this one as an extra
"I can get this beer on tap any day of the week, but I swear I love it better from the can."
"Pours a hazy sandy old/yellow with a whit head and solid lacing. Aroma is grapefruit, clementine, rind, toasted bread, and piney. Flavor follow suit. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, glad I finally got to try this as this a great beer. Deserves the hype and definitely in the same league as the great IPA's that I have tried."
A - Pours a fairly clear golden orange with half a finger of near white head. Good lacing decent retention.
Can opened on 10.8.13
Served from a pint can into a Woodcock Brothers pint glass.

16 oz can into snifter. 
A - golden amber color. No head. 
"Pours a light amber color with a nice finger and a half of head. The smell is deep and dank. Lots of citrus and grassy notes on the nose. The taste follows the nose. Nice bitterness upfront with a residual malt backbone. Citrusy, a bit grassy, light pine and spice. Nice, balanced and not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp, with a bit of oiliness. Nice carbonation. Overall this is a tasty IPA. Reminiscent of a lighter version of Double Jack."
Sampled March 2011
Thanks to Eric for this one! Canned less than a month ago (!!)
"Appearance: Nice clear, light orange color. Definitely light malts in this one. Big fluffy white head with solid retention. "
"Pale orange, almost a sickly yellow. One finger head, solid lacing, quickly fades to a thin white line. Nearly opaque and pulpy."
Bottle: Poured a hazy amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of floral hops with nice light citrus undertones and grassy notes is quite a treat. Taste is also dominated by citrus notes with some strong floral notes with light resin and grassy notes. Malt backbone is present though quite dry and doesn’t interfere with the hops flavours. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed and approaching HT level of goodness.
"Surprisingly long head retention and lace production for a non draft product. Predominant aroma component is pine, but there is a healthy amount of caramel and mustiness. Flavor is exemplary for a well hopped IPA: resinous and spicy with a healthy caramel support. A very strong bitter finish. Mouthfeel leans toward the soft side. The only minor negative is that it is a bit boozy. Hat tip to Chuk."
"Pours amber with a two finger white head and nice lacing. Powerful hop aroma, lots of pine resin and tropical fruit. Bitter pine resin and grapefruit flavors hit the tongue first followed by sweet malty tropical fruit. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall this is one of the best IPAs I've ever had, bar none!"
Big thanks to the surprise can Evan!
"Canned 7-13-13. Medium copper color, slightly hazed, carrying a one finger thick head of off-white foam that has excellent retention. The aroma is all hops, with pungent layers of bright citrus mixed with touches of fresh cut grass. Fresh and inviting. "
"Pours a hazy yellow orange with a steady fizzy white head, good lace throughout. I really like this beer. Its less aggressive than many of the tasty ipa’s coming out these days, but the nose and flavor are still right where I want them to be. Lots of citrus, floral, light tropical notes. Very nice balance that leans on the hoppy side but as I said, not as aggressive and has a nice soft carbonation."
No freshness date.
"Got some tropical, pine,citrus notes but barely. Big malt flavor for a single iPA. Lots of bitterness and great mouthfeel. Was expecting much more than this. Probably an old can. Will definitely give it another shot with a fresh can if possible just to make sure. Too bad."
"I love this beer as apparently a lot of others do as well. Incredible aroma. My preference is out of the can. On tap, they move through the stuff so fast that Im not sure it always ages as much as it should. Get those tall boys. In addition to the awesome beer, you get one of the coolest cans (art wise) I have ever seen. Totally unique."

"Picked this up at the brewery, canned 5/21/13.."
"Appearance: Coming out of the can, the liquid lays out in a clear amber; the head builds to two fingers and leaves some lacing here and there"
Poured can into tulip glass (took first drink straight from the can)
"Clear, medium orange pour, white finger of head, splotchy lace. Tropical fruit storm, sticky sweetness, pineapple, citrus, light crisp malts. Medium bitterness taste, deep tropical and citrus fruits, grapefruit, pine, crackers. Crisp, light refreshing body, clean finish, slick linger. Baby, I'm Elevated to a higher hop power."

La Cumbre Brewing Co. - Elevated IPA
"With the stellar WORLD CLASS ratings, I'm always looking for a ""sleeper"" IPA, so Elevated seemed to fit that bill based on the reviews. The distribution of Elevated is more limited than one might imagine with such favorable ratings, so courtesy of BeerandBoards, Elevated IPA was expertly packed with some other local faves. "
"16 oz can, canned 7 weeks ago."
16 oz. can. Canned 3 weeks ago.
16 oz can shipped from New Mexico poured into a FSW barrelworks Teku. Thanks to Beerandboards for this!
"Pours a slightly murky classic golden color with a small, pure white head. Nice bouquet consisting of citrus, grass, and a little pine. Mouthfeel is wet, yet cottony. Very smooth. Very nice, unobtrusive, yet hop-heavy, but still well-balanced IPA. Very drinkable for a 7.2 IPA. Thanks to my hookup in Texas for sending me this one!"
"Can at home. Pours a hazy copper with heavy lacing. Aroma is top notch - strong grapefruit with some dankness and floral notes. Taste is biting hops with just enough sweet malt balance. Bitter finish, full mouthfeel. Nearly flawless example of the style."
"16 oz can, received as an extra from GHB - Thanks Majin!"
Canned on 1/24/13
Pours a medium amber in the tall glass. Plenty of foam and a lively carbonation on the tongue. A hint of oil in the mouthfeel. 
473ml (16 oz) can sent a little while back by Mr. woodyChANdler. Poured to a Breakside pint glass & served with dinner (New York steak & Caesar salad).
"Thanks to GHB for sending this one. The beer poured out as a really nice orange color with a thin white head that kinda faded quickly. The retention is thin along with a light lacing too. The smell of the beer is really nice. There is a strong hoppy nose along with a subtle sweetness too. The taste of the beer is also hoppy, big citrus and pine note, very nice stuff. The mouthfeel is oily and gently carbonated, medium bodied. Overall this beer is quite nice, much bigger and more flavorful than most typical IPA's out there. I enjoyed this one a lot."
This beer was canned on the 17th according to my source that got it from the La Cumbre
16oz can from Beerandboards (thanks!). No canning date. Served in a Dogfish Head snifter.

Can poured into a Kuhnhenn tulip
"Smell, the aroma hops are working on this one. Mango, pineapple, a little pear as well. 100 IBU's, this is smooth. Aroma hop upon taking a sip they are there as well when breathing in. There is an inrush on the front of the tongue, it then spreads out to side of the, then it dissipates very quickly, with a small bitterness left over. Medium-Dark Gold in colour, little head retention, low malt... This is the way an IPA should be. In finished, I was blown away by balance, everything works together swimmingly."
"16oz can, no date"
"Okay, IPA mavens and hopheads take notice. Elevated IPA is easily one of the best IPAs out there. It's a light copper filtered overly hopped pine, citrus, and onion dreamboat. The nose drifts up your nose, encompasses your sinuses, and grabs hold of your olfactory nerves. Taste from the first sip is hops in all their glory with a very slight malt backbone. I've been drinking IPAs for years, and this is surely one of the hoppiest I've had outside DIPAs. Get it fresh you'll be very pleased. Thanks to Beerjobber.com for this lovely!"

"16oz can with an apparent can date of 12/3/12? Thanks a lot to GHB for sending this my way. Orange color, great head, sticky lacing. Smells like pine, pungent, dank, stanky good. Flavor is bitter, citrus, lemon, a hint of malt. Overall, very solid hop bomb and is really right up my alley as far as IPA's go. I might even say this is west coast style but I'm not sure, I'm no expert."
Thanks to EgadBananas for the hoppy hookup!
Canned on 11/8/12
16oz. can into a perfect pint glass.
Clear orange colored ale with a small white colored head.
"Poured out a very dark orange, like the kind you see after a night of hard partying. Good pine aromas, replete with funky nelson and citrus smells. Whatever you're looking for smell wise in a good ipa, this one is likely to satisfy those desires. "
"Poured into a can shaped Baxter glass, enjoyed some from the can before pouring."
"Had this on 2012-11-18 in Lititz, PA from a 3-week old can, on 2012-11-22 in Pittsburgh, PA and again on 2012-11-30 with a fresh can from a new batch. Had this third one at home from my favorite glass (a more controlled environment) so I made some revisions to my initial review."

Reviewing the Elevated IPA from the La Cumbre Brewing Company out of New Mexico.
"The man, woodychandler, provides the hook up with this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has an orange/brownish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, tropical fruits. Taste is also very hoppy, bitter, lots of fruits, a touch of malts, tasty. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a quality beer worth seeking out."
Tall pint can poured into a snifter.
"This IPA, due to its hops, is one of the most distinctive I have tasted, with a prominent grapefruity nose and taste that on first sip promised to be off-putting, but proved to be most appealing upon further tasting. Its full flavor -- not too dry -- and medium-full body balanced the dominant hops, resulting in a rich and satisfying, yet thirst-quenching brew, that was very pleasurable in all respects. However, do not drink this directly from the can; instead pour into a glass, to avoid the metallic taste of this ale's inappropriately chosen container. "
"The lovely & talented GHB first sent me a growler of this brew, which was downright divine. Hearing my praise, he then proceeded to box up & send me a short month's worth of Elevated. 16 oz. tallboy cans - I hope this is as good out of metal as it was out of glass. "
Big light tan head takes it's time to settle into a nice lacing with a small bisquity mound in the middle of the glass above a slight cloudy copper honey colored beer.

"A1 - Light yellow/orange, not too pale, not too dark. Great color for an IPA. Creamy head, dense."
Can generously shared by Chris (largadeer). This has been on my wants since it was growler-only. Served in a taster glass.
16oz can courtesy of DonFrap for giving me one of his extras. Thanks man! Poured into Founders snifter.
Wildnoodle was one of many people who stepped up and either traded or simply sent me beer to further The CANQuest (TM). I am told that this is another one of those beers to be CANsumed as soon as possible to enjoy maximum freshness. Who would I be to buck the prime directive?
Got a couple fresh 4 packs from GHB. Thanks!

Review #600! 
"Pours a brillant copper color with a big, fluffy head. Dare I say it almost looks like a Yuengling lager??"
A- Pours a light golden orange color with a very slight haze. A nice white head that that has good retention and leaves some nice layered lacing. 
"Received a 64oz Growler of this in a trade w/ amcmaho1. Poured from the Marble Brewery Growler w/ hops in Yellow into a 0,47l New Belgium Oversized Snifter Glass. Filled @ the Brewery 2/4/12."
"On-tap at the brewery. Copper colored, perfect layer of sticky white foam on top. Unbelievably juicy and vibrant hops - pine needles, orange oil, mango, and grapefruit. Clean and dry, bitterness is ultra-smooth. The stuff goes down in gulps. IPAs don't get any better than this. This was hands down my favorite beer on a two week roadtrip to California if that tells you anything. Damn delicious stuff."
Big thanks to Mark and Gloria for the generous growler share! Multiple pours into a Coronado snifter:
I've had this brew many times but seeing as how it took GOLD at GABF yesterday I figured it was time to review. Poured from a growler into a Bruery snifter. 
Tapped into a pint glass. My 300th beer rating. Woot!
Gold/amber color with a small white head.
"Picked up a fresh growler today, having had this beer many many times before, I figured it was time I review it."
"The flagship brew of La Cumbre Brewing is worthy of its status and name. From the tap, the beer is lighter in color than most IPAs with a touch of golden amongst the amber waves. A half inch of foam floated above. Grapefruit grabs the nostrils and doesn't let go. Pine aromas join the sensory assault. It is clear that hops are going to be the major player here. Modest at first on the palate, but it quickly evolves into a hoppy affair. Juniper pine braces the palate as the citrus, mainly grapefruit, moves in, mixes in, and slithers down. The mouth is left with the pleasure of a hoppy beer, but without the oiliness of some IPAs. The brewers have spent some time crafting this one and the fruit of their labors are a tippler's delight."
"I cannot remember this beer extremely well because it was late in the night on new years eve, but I do remember several things."
A: Yellow/Gold/Lt Orange hue. Clear w/ a little chill haze. Pours a nice 1 - 1.5 finger head and thick. Stays through the entire glass with a nice lacing.
he head faded so fast here it wasn't even funny. There was a moment with a 1/2 finger of head. Some light foam remains. Slightly hazy amber/copper color.
"On tap at La Cumbre, 2.11.11, poured into nonic pint glass, $4.25."
"32oz crowler, filled on 8.31.18, poured into a Corridor Bicycle pint glass."
"Crowler from the brewery, poured into a snifter. This checks all the boxes for a NE IPA. Low bitterness, creamy mouthfeel, orange yellow color. Nose and taste are orange, and apricot candy with maybe a little bit of tart fruit at the end."
"Sample from the brewery. This beer's soft, opaque, matte orange color screams NEIPA, while a cloudlike head that just won't quit gives Cosmic Juice Box appearance points lacking from many of its less accomplished peers. Meanwhile, deep orange notes, whispers of apricot, prominent pine, lemon candy, and waves of passion fruit make this one worth an extra sniff or two. Some solvent-y alcohol also shows up as the drink warms in the glass. Although full-bodied, Corridor has made an IPA with balance and bitterness, which enhances its drinkability. Lots of citrus, a bit of resin, toasted sourdough, and a semi-dry finish distinguish the flavor. Well executed and extremely likeable."
"Crowler from a friend. I thought this was super nice. The aroma is stellar, huge dry hop fruity ness, very juicy. The body is on the heavier side, a touch sweet for my taste, but nice hop flavor. Solid effort"
"Tasted in a snifter from draft at Corridor Brewery & Provisions on December 8, 2017. Thick hazy IPA brewed with Citra, Mosaic, and double dry hopped with tons of Galaxy. Recommended."
Crowler filled 9/23/17; drank 9/24/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"Poured from a crowler less than a day old off the draft line. The appearance is muddled orange, like an unfiltered mango or peach juice. Made with galaxy, citra, and mosaic hops, but really a showcase for the galaxy--pineapple, passion fruit, and mango on the nose, tangerine added on the palate. A bit of bittering hop character throughout the experience, so not a total juice bomb, but it's better off for that added complexity."
"Another home run from Corridor! It has their expected soft, pillowy mouth feel without feeling un-carbed. Very juicy, with citrus and tropical fruit flavors exploding out of the glass."
Hazy opaque orange with a thin layer of foam and spotty lace. 
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.
Canned 10/29/18. It’s getting more difficult to discern all of these NEIPAs from one another. They’re all amazingly delicious. But massive hop character can obscure flavor so they all end up tasting like super juicy tropical fruit.
Canned two weeks ago.
"16 oz. can. Hazy orange. Smells of orange and, since I just read the description and it says peach, I smell peach juice. The vaguest hint of toasted malt that I remember from the regular version. Tastes of orange and that same sweet peach flavor. Both flavors push well into the back end, though some toasted malt and a slight grapefruit bitterness come through. Medium body with low carbonation. I remember the regular version being quite different from other Trillium IPAs. This is not different, though complaining would be unfair, as it is still very good."
"Dated 5/14/18 on the bottom of the can, 9 days since brewing."
Lovely.
"Pours a cloudy yellow gold with thick head and lacing. Nose is very sweet, citrus, malt, hops, floral. Flavors match the nose, very nice peach notes with some orange, floral jumping in with a malt finish. Slight bitterness also, this is a fantastic IPA, very balanced and loaded with flavor, ultra smooth."
Amazingly great brew and if I was dying and had to narrow it down to my top 10 beers this would be one of them.
16oz can dated 10/31/17.
"Had this on tap at the Canton brewery. The beer had a murky orange appearance with no head and minimal lacing. The aromas were very interesting to me; almost like a mix of orangepeel with a hint of vanilla. This vanilla-like flavoring could be sensed in the taste a little bit, but it definitely was a strong orange citrus flavor. Lightly carbonated in general. Overall, really fascinating smell and taste."
"good, solid IPA. I expect a little better from Trillium. It is different, which I usually am a big fan of but it’s not doing it for me, only in terms of being a top 250, which was my expectation."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass shared with a few friends. Pours like orange juice, with a half inch sticky white head that leaves some nice lace."
"Good, not great Trillium. I liked it a lot more on tap than when I had a can. Still its a great beer next to what I grew up with but not on par with other trillium"

Kind of plain. Good mouthfeel and haze. Subdued grassy bitterness. Not objectionable just not eye opening
16oz can poured into a tulip glass
Cloudy like all Trillium brews. Muddy gold color. Tiny head which leaves rim bubbles and a few spots for lace. 
On tap at canton.
"One of my favorite Trillium IPAs and I've tried dozens of them. Really terrific balance in the flavor profile. A bit more bitter than other Trillium IPAs, but not like a west coast IPA."
"Pours merky deep orange. Nice two finger white head that fades slowly fades quickly. Nice lacing. Aroma tropical fruits. Taste pears, orange, grassy notes. Excellent IPA"
"L - pours a dark, cloudy toasted orange. You can get lost looking into this beer, much like a fire. "
It's a fluffy cloud of nuances. Herbaceous and earthy. Resinous and bright.
"On-tap 4/1/2017 at the brewery in Canton, MA, served in a tulip glass."
"16 oz can. Cloudy yellow-orange, thin white head has decent retention and soapy lacing. Sweet citrusy aroma. Big grapefruit flavor, dank pine and herbal bitterness. Grapefruit peel dry finish. Thin to medium soft feel. I like the bite in this one to offset some of the juice."
Wonderful aromatic combination of passion fruit and green onion. I know that sounds weird but passion fruit & mango on the front end with green onion finish.
"Pours a chalky, hazy unfiltered orange with a one finger head. Smells of dank citrus, mango and orange. Flavor matches the nose with punchy dankness, hoppy citrusiness, juicy, bitter and smooth. Really taken back by this one. This is a class beer from Trillium."
"Gnarly looking, but the nose comes screaming out of the can the moment you crack it. Fantastic body and mouthfeel. Citrus and malts in abundance. Pretty much no hop backbone (if that's something you care about). It definitely fits the style. Drink fresh."
great beer and the dry part is definitely there. very smooth with a nice dry kick i had it room temp so hopefully i get a chance to drink it colder.
"Poured from a tallboy into a shaker pint, the beer is an opaque, orange-yellow coloring, like a glass of orangina, with a low profile, thin, clingy, white head. Aromas of bright citrus forward, heavy on orange, grapefruit, and lime, with solid grassy and spiced hops characteristics. Flavors are juicy forward, heavy on orange, mango, and grapefruit, with a solid dose of wet grass, pepper spice, and mossy hops to provide a dose of dank bitterness. The juiciness also comes with an accompanying acidity, sharpening the otherwise full body. Juicy citrus aftertaste, lingering on past the slick, slightly dry finish. Easy drinker and extremely juicy."
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"Had on tap. Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is pine, resin, and light grapefruit with a decent malt backbone. Slightly bitter and medium bodied. Really reminded me of Tree House's Sap. Really enjoyable and good usage of the dry hopping."
Super fresh purchased at the brewery. 
16 oz. can dated 10/17/16
"Pours a hazy dark orange in color with a bit less than a finger of white head that settles to a thin film. Aroma is very inviting; I get pineapple, grapefruit, and light alcohol notes. There is more peach and stone fruit notes upfront in the taste. Grapefruit and pineapple are joined by subtle pine notes that linger into the moderately bitter finish. Some light melon notes appear in the finish. Good mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation. Overall this is a super tasty beer and I find it to be greater than the sum of its parts. I'll have to swing by tomorrow and pick up another few cans because this is a winner."
"A- Darker golden body, slightly hazy, one finger white head, nice retention, a slight bit of lacing."
"Golden yellow in color. Turbid. Horned melon, citrus pith, some pine, and lime. Dank. Perfect level of sweetness. Bitterness hangs around. Creamy mouthfeel. Really solid."
32 oz growlette was poured into a pint glass. 
Super heady aroma of sweet peaches. Very smooth IPA with juicy fruit.
Expect a classic big west coast IPA with a tremendous nose in this very good Trillium brew.
Growler
Poured from a 32 ounce growler into an enlarged snifter. This was filled at the brewery an hour ago.
The beer comes in a slightly clear amber orange.

Growler poured into a snifter
Another standout IPA from Trillium. No surprise there.
"Changed the hop combination to citra, centennial, and columbus for this one. The citra hops really come through, this is incredible. Mouth feel isn't quite as nice as some on of their other IPAs, but this is still top notch none the less. One of my new favorites, wish I had picked up another growler."
Growler with tag said 9.3% 
"Nice resinous bite, good grapefruit and caramel with a bit of biscuit. Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation, nice resinous and leafy bite on the backend. Another solid IPA from Fat Head's."
"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a stemless wine glass. Lovely appearance: slightly hazy, light amber in color, three-finger white head, lots of pretty lacing. Big blast of hoppy aroma upon opening the bottle. Poured cold, the hops dominated the aroma and flavor profiles. Lots of dank, juicy pine and citrus, lots of zesty and resiny bitterness. Once it starts to warm a bit, the balance becomes apparent. Good malt structure that provides a little sweetness while allowing the hops to shine. Clean finish, well-hidden ABV. Great beer with food, too."
Found at a reputable beer store in Cleveland but should have checked the date. This was from early October so I don't feel this was the best. Overall pretty okay. Definitely need to try one of these fresh.
On draft in pint glass. darker color than expected. head lasted a while. smell is straight bitter hops. Taste is NE style IPA without any citrus. Great beer that i will watch for in future
"This one was bottled 10/4, so it's about six weeks old."
12 oz bottle poured into a shaped IPA glass.
10/10/17 bottled on date. 
"Hop Stalker pours a perfect, and I mean perfect, clean and clear pale yellow to light orange color with a foamy white head. It coats the surface once it falls and could only be ranked a touch higher if it laced just a bit more."
"It’s nearly impossible to find a better wet hop beer where I am (about 25 miles away from the brewery). It’s unrivaled, by any wet hopped ale in distro in Ohio. Maybe even the entire US. "
"Amber with a thin head, the beer smells and tastes... fresh. Everything about the beer is fresh. The nose and taste go together: mild grassiness, a bit of sweet, with a background of bitter hop punch. It also packs a dank punch, to which I am partial. The end is raw and rough, with just that green bitterness on the palate."
Big thanks to maximumu13 for sending me this one! Reviewed from (very) long-standing notes. Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Cigar City Brewing pint glass.
I got this IPA in a beer trade and I loved it. The IBU 80 is just right and it is delicious. It goes down quick.
"Acquired from CapCollector16, so a big “Thank You” goes out to him. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass."
Hop Juju is my favorite Fat Head's brew but Hop Stalker is not too far behind. Freshness of hops is just unbelievable. Consuming it a little over a month from the date on the bottle but it tastes like it was brewed just yesterday! Thank God I got the whole case of it!
L - crystal gold fading orange. Has a boozey color that's almost vinous. 
"Optics are as expected. Aroma is very delicate, packed with alluring tropical & flowery hop notes. Flavor is a tad non-descript and a letdown after that fantastic aroma, but still good. It's definitely a less harsh ipa, and has more tropical & citrus notes. Ends with a decent stab of grapefruit bitterness. Another very solid IPA from fat head's but lacks the robustness & depth of their best ones."
"12 oz bottle. Pours clean medium gold, thin white head fades leaving just a little soapy lacing. Sweet light malt and grass, citrus aroma. Tropical fruity taste, fress grass n pine bitterness, grapefruit peel as well. Very nice combo of flavors, fresh n crisp with bitter dry finish. Medium slick feel. One of the better fresh hop IPAs I've had so far."
A true ipa masterpiece much like head hunter. Fatheads gets nowhere near the acclimation they deserve for these beers but I'm fine with that. I love that I have IMO some of the best ipas in the country (even better than the majority of new england) on the shelves of supermarkets near me.
"Dank, grassy hop aroma. The flavor is well-balanced between moderate bitterness and juicy hop flavor. There's a unique pretzel bread-like malt character and the ABV is hidden quite well. Would gladly have this in my fridge on a regular basis and I'm glad it doesn't exhibit the plastic-like taste that some fresh hop beers have."
"Description: Golden, clear appearance with no real head to speak of. The aroma is dank and fruity with hints of peach, mandarin orange and grapefruit. A little bit of grassy, earthiness, too. The dankness is more pronounced on the taste and is the first thing that hits you. It kind of resonates throughout the palate into a more bitter finish. The fruit flavors were not there as much. Feel is medium carbonation and medium body: about what you'd expect from an IPA."
"A solid beer. The nose and palate are not as dank as I would anticipate. It's an outstanding IPA very much in the vein of Head Hunter and Hop Juju, but it seems to carry more of those characteristics than true wet-hop quality. The nose and palate are predominately piney hop with a strong bittering component (and a faint citrus background). A good IPA, but not a standout for a style (lags distantly behind, for example, Founders Harvest and Columbus Yakima Fresh)."
"Appearance: Pours fairly clear, with the amber liquid capped by an inch of foam; spotty lacing here and there"
Drinking out of the bottle purchased two days ago. Super strong aroma of hopscan citrus. Very nice bitterness and excellent feel . Definitely taste fresh .
"Taking full advantage of the the fresh hop harvest season, the Fat Head's brewers pluck the hops straight from the field and thrown into the brewing process without being dried or packaged for longterm storage first."
Clear amber with a light beige head dying to a thin bubbly film.
"This brewer does it again. Super hoppy, a bit of an aftertaste, but smooth. I have liked everything I have tried from these folks. Stick with their ""standard"" IPA generally, but try this for a slight chance of pace."
A - Pours a clear golden orange color with a small head that settles quickly and leaves a bit of lacing.
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/8/2015. Pours slightly hazy orange/amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with good retention, that reduces to small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of bright/dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Large amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pine, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and minimal hop astringency after the finish. Good amount of dryness from bitterness that builds up after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding fresh hop IPA. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. The resinous quality does build up as you finish the glass, but never really gets to the point where it becomes unbearable. A highly enjoyable offering."
Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. Bottle date was 10/2/15 and was consumed in early November. Super fresh beer.
Hop Stalker is another reason why Fat Heads is rapidly climbing to one of my favorite brewers!!! This is a solid 80 ibu ipa that hop head should revel in. The beer poured a copper clear with white head that did not leave much lace. The scent was a bouquet of hoppiness. The taste was very even but bitter enough to ensure you know you're drinking a ipa. The hops lent to more pine and bitter citrus. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall.....OH YEAH!
hands down the best fresh hop IPA I have ever had! Fat Head's has the fresh hop on lock- a must try
Big thanks to SomethingClever for this
12 oz. bottle. Hazy deep orange. Medium white head. Smell is pine and grassy hops. Some caramel malts. Taste is grassy and almost immediately bitter. A little bit of sweet citrus behind it. Malty in the middle and bitterness takes over in the finish. Medium heavy. Flavorful but a bit too heavy for my tastes.
"Poured from a bottle into a Goose Island tulip. The pour is a light amber orange, fairly clear, and some floaties are evident (always a good sign with an IPA). A rather rough pour produces about a finger of fine white foam. The nose is fresh and citrus-like, but not as potent or in-your-face as Head Hunter. It's more delicate."
I don't really get into the whole description deal. But this is a golden orange clear pouring IPA. Small head with a very earthy smell. Taste of pine with a perfect bitter touch and clean finish. Solid brew!
"Nice wet hopped ipa, clean and crisp with a backend bitter bite. Solid Brew"
"Look - Nice golden color, fairly clear in appearance, good amount of carbonation "
12oz bottle dated 10/7/15 poured into a Teku glass
"10/07/15, thanks to rudzud for sharing."
"Received in a trade., shared with JLindros."
Fantasia hop smell. Too bitter for my taste
Yea all 5s.....It's that good DANK as hell!!! Pitty any non hop heads on this one!!!!!
"Bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Vibrant gold on the pour and settles as a beautiful copper in the glass. Looks like a brand new penny with 2 fingers of sticky, white foam on top. Great clarity and carbonation. Huge aroma - one of those you can smell while you're pouring it. Dank, sticky pine, hops, juicy tropical fruit, and more hops. Relatively light weight compared to some other IPA's of this abv. The mouthfeel is lively and smooth, but not overly creamy. Sweet malts, pine, and tropical fruit up front on the taste. Those hops creep in as it warms on the palate, and damn they are delicious. Finishes smooth and you're left with a hugely bitter aftertaste. Damn there are some hops in this thing."
"Somehow I missed this one last year. This year it's in bottles. Yum, it's real good."
L - clear and yellow. look of a good IPA
"I have no option but to rate this beer straight 5's across the board. THIS is what a fresh hop beer should taste like. so dank and demanding, but so easy to drink. if I could drink this year round, I would have little use for most other brews. out of the park fat man"
Pours a foggy orange-gold. Huge egg shell/off-white head. Great retention and significant lacing. 
12 ounce bottle served in a pint glass.
"Enjoyed on tap at the Pint Room October 17, 2015."
Super fresh 12oz bottle that was just bottled on 10/6 poured into a tulip glass:
Picked up up tonight based on some reviews and comments on the forums. I'm already almost dressed to see I bought a bottle when cans exist. Why do breweries offer cans and then the horrible low quality CRAP that are bottles? Really sucks since I know this won't be as fresh or good but what can you do? 
Wow
Bottled 10/02/15
Pours a clear light amber color. Has a nice citrusy hoppy aroma. Flavor is really clean. Great citrus flavor and light resin hops. Has a pretty smooth finish. A really nice IPA from these guys again
"Poured from a 16oz. ""tallboy"" can into a standard pint glass."
Can't say anything other than if you like big citrusy IPAs this one is good.
"The front of the CAN clearly delineates the name as “Hop Stalker Fresh Hop IPA” and the reverse of the CAN says that it originated from their Middleburg Heights, OH location. I have submitted updates, but I am going to post this review under every potential entry until this CAN be unscrewed."
1 PINT can
"Poured a cloudy orange, with a finger and a half of thick, white head. slow stream of bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass."
If this beer were a man or woman I would suck them off.
"Pours a luscious gold color and produces plenty of sticky lacing. Aromas are dank as described as well as piney, grassy, earthy, peppery and dandelion like flavors . . . Aromas and flavors are similar. Feel is crisp and sticky."
"Lively, fresh hop aroma. Taste is crisp and hoppy. Sweet grapefruit. Very good fresh hop IPA."
"Phenomenal beer. I love a hoppy, bitter beer, but I also like the mouthfeel of a good DIPA. This one has a thicker mouth feel than a typical IPA, but not that of a good DIPA. The flavor is amazing though. Very complex. Citrusy, resinous, bitter, with a sweet malt after taste. Just the right amount of bite and carbonation. I like to let it linger on my palate. Hoping fatheads continues this limited release beer. It's an all time favorite of mine."
"Not a very tasty IPA. Had hints of that home-brew taste. It smelled great,but the taste was a big let down"
"The color is a medium orange with some brightness and complete clarity. The head is a creamy one, eggshell white if not a shade darker. Retention is pretty good, and it leaves a foamy layer within a few minutes after settling while it drops down a sturdy ring and strong patching to follow."
Picked up the can for 4 bucks at D's Six packs. Into a pint glass.
"Fruit juice, lots of grapefruit bitterness and a dry, biscuit malt backbone. The level of sweetness is spot on."
"16 oz. can Courtesy of SomethingClever, Dank You beer brother! "

Pounder into a pint glass.
"Had this on fresh 2014-11-10 in Columbia, PA from a 16 oz can. Again on 2016-11-24 in Pittsburgh from a 12oz bottle. "
Aroma: Strong citrus hop notes up front. Abundant lemon and melon notes. Clean fermentation character. Dank and grassy character appears as the beer opens up. Flowery and honey-like sweetness appears as well.
Pours a goldy hazy orangish beauty. Great pine and citrus smell. Big hop punch when on the tastebuds. A sweetness immediately followed by a strong bitterness that lingers. Not an IPA for the faint of heart. Great though. I really like it.
"Can from Joe. Thanks big guy! Pours very slightly hazy golden with a big fluffy white head that sticks around a while and sticks all over the glass. Amazing aroma of citrus grapefruit, mangos, pine, grass, and definite sweet caramel malts in there but the hops are what shine in the nose. Flavor is pineapple, grapefruit, citrus zest, hint of bitter dry pine, grass, yum. Not as dry and bitter as Head Hunter and with a bit more vegetal raw hop flavor and juiciness. Light bodied and easy going with medium plus carbonation. This is good, but what do you expect from these guys when they get their hands on some hops?"
"Medium orange and a touch toward golden in color with a small white head that fades to a cap and leaves great lacing. Smell is pure hop forward and promises a hop wallop. Mango, orange, papaya, melon, and grapefruit fill the nose. This beer means business and on first sip you can tell its hopped to the max. There is an initial slight sweetness from the malt that gives way completely to a resinous hop experience. Dank hops consume the palate in a wave of grapefruit and mango flavor battling pine and canibous for attention. Fruity hop flavors win out by the smallest of margins. Creamy feel with a perfect level of carbonation and a medium body. This beer is so hop forward it's finish is dictated by it as well, hop resins consume the palate on finish. This beer left the presence of hop oils and resins in my mouth for quite some time. If you like hop forward beers look no further. Me, I like a bit more balance but this is very good at what it does."
"Nice fresh hop aroma, but taste is a little oxidized."
Crisp and fruitfully fresh.
16 oz can poured into snifter
A - Poured copper with a nice inch head that had nice retention. 
Thanks NW2285!

Poured from 1 pint aluminum can into a goblet.
"Tasting at Fat Heads Tap House on 10/15/2014, CLE Beer Week release of Hop Stalker."
Another stellar release! Fat Heads continues to impress. Consistently a pleaser to the taste buds.
Bright copper color on the pour it's head is cream colored forms thick bands of lacing evenly as it settles out a bit. 
On tap at Fat Heads in North Olmsted OH
"On-tap at Fat Head's in N. Olmsted, Ohio"
Drinking on tap at the facility right now. Beautiful pour with a great head. Great smell. Mosaic hop bomb! If this was from New England it would be top 250. Easily.
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Red Session. Aroma is sweet and fruity with dextrin malt notes and slightly sweaty and dank hops. Taste has sweet vanilla notes and juicy hops with medium bitterness."
Pours hazy orange with a pillowy head.
16 oz. can dated 4/28/18 purchased at brewery and poured into Belgian ale glass.
"Pours a very dense, hazy orange juice color. I have never seen a beer with this lever of haze / turbidity. It seems to glow. Nose is very, very faint grapefruit. Very flavorful for 6.6% abv. Lots of citrus flavors here - grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, subtle peach and mango. Excellent carbonation lens to a creamy mouth feel. Overall this beer is a very flavorful IPA, could easily drink a few of these in one session, but for $20 a 4-pack this is a bit on the expensive side."
"Enjoyed on-tap at the brewery on 10/7/17. Review copied from notes. Poured into an 8oz glass, Mosaic Punch is a turbid orange color with a fluffy white head. Juicy tropical hop aromas of pineapple and grapefruit. Beautifully complex hop profile, the mosaic hop truly proves its name by giving up notes of peach, mango and orange. Slightly dry finish. What a delightful beer. Kane just keeps getting better and better."
"I had this on draught at a restaurant. 16 oz. pour served in a shaker glass. It pours a turbid, brown-gold color with a finger of fluffy, bright white head and lacing that coated the glass for the entire pour. It's a tropical fruit bomb with fragrant mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, pine needles, and light floral hops. The taste is out of this world! It opens with lemon peel and sweet pineapple, mango, and a hint of vanilla, then closes with dank Mosaic, Citra, and Galaxy hops, and lightly-astringent pepper. Every flavor is unique but they blend seamlessly. The mouth feel is equally impressive: silky and creamy with pleasant carbonation. The 6.6% ABV seems just right: it provides substance without being distracting. Overall, this ale is a tour de force. It's hard to imagine how to improve it."
Bright hazy yellow. A little bit of head lingers throughout. Huge nose on this. Massive tropical fruit. Taste follows suit. Berries in there as well. A bit of bitterness. Feel is right where it should be. A nice chew. My only complaint is that this beer just completely falls off on the back end. I guess that could be seen as a good thing. Makes you go back for more. But I just wish it had a bit more on the finish to round it out a bit better. But this is really great stuff.
Pours hazy golden. Orange and tangerine on the nose. It's got good creamy galaxy citrus character with only a little bit of the bite that comes from raw vegetal galaxy.
"Great color, lovely head. Smells like sweet, creamy Galaxy. Flavor hits the same notes with smooth, fluffy layers of Galaxy; sweet citrus, a little grapefruit, and something I'd describe as a vanilla biscuit/cookie. This beer is a thing of beauty."
"Typical hazy Trillium body. A hint more golden in hue. Smell is melon, tropical fruit, and citrus. Tropical fruit forward flavor with passion fruit and mango. Backing bitterness for balance. Little astringent on the finish."
L - goddamn they are really ripping through these things since starting the Permutation series. Can crack revealed the most appetizing head layer I've seen in some time. Juicy and frothy and full. Galaxy-tinted pineapple haze. 
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Canton, MA"
Canned 11 days ago.
"This one pours a very hazy but bright orange color, with a small but long lasting fluffy head, and lots of lacing."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a stemmed tulip glass.
"Poured into a snifter. Bright yellow hazy/turbid color with a medium sized white head that left great lacing in the glass. Tropical aroma with pineapple, berries, and a soft earthy resin note. The taste was as I anticipated from the nose, with bright tropical fruit and a dank undercurrent. Really soft feel with low bitterness and a slight astringency on the finish. The can was 3 days old, so this may not be an issue in a few days. Overall another outstanding beer."
16 oz. canned on 05/30/18
"This IPA has a nutty start w a crisper finish than a lot of IPAs, also it gets me drunk so yeah...drink up princess!"
"Golden, and cloudy in a crisp sort of way. Moderately carbonated, with two fingers of off-white head. "
"The feel and look of this one are world class. Juicy, watery, round mouthfeel and transitions from cloudy gold to glassy gold in the mug. Taste is simple IPA but very well done orange peel and lemon with some malt background. A+ stuff from Alpine. BTW, Alpine is a nice hilly community in San Diego for those that don't know. I'm impressed that that small community that has so few stores and looks like the Wild West with one old school Western street can produce this!"
Loved it when I first had it but the last few times I just felt it was boring. Surely a classic but not keeping my interest. 
"pours with a yellow/golden color; the smell is very citrusy, hops and pine. Taste is wonderful balance of the hops, citrus (grapefruit; tropical fruit); some malts and a bit of hops bitterness at the end. The feel is crisp and clean. Awesome beer."
"Pours a hazed copper color with a compact, frothy cap. Simcoe fruitiness mingles with cookie dough malts in the nose. Citrusy, peach, melon hops abound in the taste. A solid, clean pale malt ballast keeps things in check. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation. Tons of floral, fruity hops in the everlasting finish."
Clean citrusy and piney amber ipa. This west coast ale has a certain bitterness. It's crisp and drinkable but the mouthfeel could be improved. Some herbal notes. I was hoping for something a bit more complex
"This is currently one of my favorite California IPAs. From the first pour, the smell wafts up and darn near makes me salivate thinking about the first sip. For an IPA this is crisp and clean, really nicely hopped, with hints of citrus and pine. The malt which I tend to dislike, is nicely covered by complex flavor. The lacing on the glass, and the finish which lingers perfectly without change makes this a great beer. I have done several blind tastings flights of California IPAs, and it is almost shocking how the Duet makes the following IPAs taste flat and boring (or how I imagine dishwater would taste). At 7% it is right at my sweet spot."
"DATE: May 6, 2018... OCCASION: a good weekend comes to a close... GLASSWARE: Maudite snifter... pours a golden body, clear as crystal with reasonable effervescence, and a soapy white head half a finger wide... a promising, clean-looking ale... I like the idea of paring two hops, and in this case, the simcoe's fruity pine and the amarillo's flowery citrus wed in a 50/50 bliss... the first sip is vibrant, lively, and abuzz at the teeth, while its weight anchors the experience as a nice nightcap should... surprisingly, as aromatic as the scent was, the finish is medium-bodied and suggestive of malty strength... if possible, dry, while also leaving a bitter finish better than its 45 IBUs would suggest... orange, lemon, pineapple, lavender, light spiciness, and an effective bitterness that encourages the next sip... a bit of toasted bread balances the profile, and at 7% ABV, strong but pleasant draw... seems like each Alpine offering is as good or better as the last... this one came courtesy of a break pack mix twelve, and lucky me... I would recommend this one and seek it out again, despite the proliferation of iPAs in this golden age of beer..."
"On tap at Albertsons. Wow. I can see why this rates so highly. Bitter citrus, but not too bitter. Nice orange copper body, minimal head. Silky slippery body, piney citrus nose and flavor. Classic west coast IPA."
"A: A slightly hazy yellow color, with a light white head. "
The best beer ever purchased at Safeway. 
Amber golden color with a thick thin head with decent retention and leaving some laces.
"I was a tiny bit disappointed in this, particularly for the price point ($2.99 for single bottle at Total Wine). Hazy pale in the glass with cream/white foamy head. Smell was piney hops, though not quite as hoppy as I expected in the taste. Somewhat one dimensional IPA. Unique hops flavor profile, but definitely piney and (good) bitter. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite the star west coast offering I expected."
L — Pours a filtered pale orange body with a one-finger white head produced with moderate pour. Some retention and lacing. Lots of visible carb 
"Just a great IPA, so glad to get it in Florida a month or two within shelf-life date."
Single bottle smuggled back to Canada from Trader Joe’s in San Diego - tried 4 oz on tap at taproom in Alpine. Pours a clear slightly orange golden with 1 finger white head. Aroma of citrus/orange with pine in back - some bready malt. Tastes of smooth citrus with piney bitterness. Mouthfeel has a slight coating bitterness but remarkably creamy finish. Absolutely great.
"Pours clear golden honey. Enticing citrus and piney aroma. Taste is absolutely magnificent citrus and hops with easy, medium feel and easy lingering bitterness. One of my favorite regular IPAs, absolutely love it."
best all around IPA i've had its just good
"Pours semi-cloudy gold in color with decent head and lacing. Nose is full on hops, citrus, and some pine. Flavor is very good, nice burst of sweet hops with a slight pine bitterness but evened out with the citrus. A very fine IPA, very clean and refreshing."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, Best before 15/Nov/2017."
"Pours a slightly hazy gold with a white head. Smells of pine, citrus, hops, and some malt. Tastes of bitter hops, light sweet malt, grapefruit and orange zest, and pine. Medium resinous body with medium carbonation. Overall a very good standard IPA."
"Decent head from tap with a golden hue and almost see through look. Nice tropical fruit scent from this brew. I'm loving this beer so far. The flavor is like unsweetened grapefruit with a slight malt base. This has that ""close to cat wiz flavor"" with the fruity and bitter aspects combining for a deep flavor with the malt. I said close, but it actually holds together well and is quite tasty. Well carbonated. Good beer."
"My, does this seem overrated. It's perfectly fine IPA, but I'm not sure what others see to make this stand that much above the rest. Also, paying a premium price for this makes it even worse. "
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a IPA glass.
"Cedar, Pine and Grapefruit"
"Tall 22oz long neck 22oz dated best by 28AUG17. Served in a pint glass. Beer pours medium gold brass, not quite clear, with a nice thick white head. Aroma is both piny and floral. Assertive pine sap bitterness on the tongue, with a very neutral malt backbone. Balanced and surprisingly well described on the label as a ""single"" IPA, when considering both the name ""Duet"" and the 7.0% ABV. In addition to the great balance of flavor, fine carbonation gives it a really good mouthfeel. Just a hint of oily hop resin in the aftertaste."
Citrusy and not too piney or malt forward. Very well done IPA!
"Pours a beautiful hazy slightly orange golden with a short white head, not very frothy, not a whole lot of retention or lacing. This beer gives off a clean and bright citrusy, juicy aroma full of ripe orange, some grapefruit and lemon, tangerine and even mango. Not a lot of pine or dankness here. The pine comes into the taste considerably, in combination with the citrus and tropicals and moderately high bitterness. The piney aspect of the taste combines with a somewhat resinous aspect of the mouthfeel in an otherwise light-medium body. A long, dry and bitter finish follows."
"so I found an older bottle of this at my local shop (6 months past 'best of' date), so I plan on re-rating when I find a newer brew. either way this is a solid beer. clear, golden look with a really unique taste. look forward to trying this again soon."
"This was poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was a hazy semi-burnt slightly transparent copper color. Messy lacing weaves around the glass. The smell had a sweet to bitter blend of dried citrus, dried floral, dried bitter pine with an ever so slight touch of caramel malts. The taste was basically the same with a nice slick bitter piney aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation hits well enough as an AIPA, with an ample amount of bitter harshness sticking to my tongue. Overall, aha, I found the good Alpine beer."
"Serving: 12 oz bottle (""best by 16 SEP 17""), poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
"L: Slightly hazy, translucent orange with a tight white head. Excellent retention and lacing."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus, some resin. Taste is citrus, malts, a bit of resin, surprisingly mild bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good beer, but it didn't meet my expectations."
"One of the best, most freshest tasting IPA I've had. Simply delicious. How anyone could rate this under a 4.0 is beyond my comprehension. Awesome brew"
Most solid west-coast style IPA =======
Bottle best by 06JUL17. DFH Tulip.
Bought On-Line
"Pours a hazy gold color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of citrus hops, spicy hops, resin, alcohol, hint of pine, earthiness, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with a high carbonation level and noticeable bitterness. Tastes of spicy hops, piney hops, hint of citrus hops, strong resin, slight alcohol, slights sweet malt, and earthiness. Overall, good aroma, body, blend, and complexity, but average appearance and too carbonated."
clear copper medium head. 
"L- Pours a rather clear copper color with an ivory, foamy head. Only a slight haze, but I bet it's good since it's an Alpine."
"Gold to copper in color with good head. Smells of tangerines, tropical fruit and some earthy pine notes. Taste follows nose but pine is a bit more predominant with a touch of sour apple, malt is bready and carmel/toasty and a touch of diacetyl. Good medium with velvety carbonation. Good beer overall but malt flavors slighty clash with the hops."
"Seems a bit dated by the smell and taste but the best by date is May 2017. I hate breweries that don't bottle date. Glad I only picked up a single. I know I'm getting Alpine beers brewed by Green Flash, but this brewery seems WAY overrated."
"Best by August 2016, so I may not be completely fair on this here. "
12oz bottle. Pours a slightly hazed golden with a foamy head and sticky lace. 
"Look: Dark orange, clear. Well carbonated with a small to medium sized head."
"Clear and light golden in color with a head that stays around. No lacing. Smell is a blend of hops and tropical fruit. Taste is hopforward, dank and resiny. Less carbonation than one might assume. Solid brew."
"Poured from a bottle into a La Fin du Monde tulip. The pour is pale gold, fairly clear, and sports about 2 fingers of fine white foam with good retention. The nose gives lemon zest, orange rind, a little bit of sweet toasted malt."
Great amber appearance. Very pleasance fruity hoppy aroma. They did a great job of blending the fruit taste with the hoppyness of the IPA. I think they have done a very nice job.
Pours a hazy amber with a two finger white head that dissipates quickly. Moderate lacing. Slight piney fruity aroma. Crisp nicely bitter hops jump out with a sweet malt follow-up. then more hops on the tail end. Balanced taste but more to the hop side. Moderate body and carbonation.
"Pours a five+ finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Pine hop nose, flavor follows with piney hops balanced with caramel hops. $3.15 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Pours a brassy and amber looking color, semi clear, and with a modest bubbly cap; it soon disapates and leaves a thin ring and lacing."
This is undoubtedly one of the best IPAs I have had. My SO liked it as well.
Tastie.
Drinking this right now to celebrate New Beer Sunday. Being 40 minutes from Treehouse I worry about trying other IPA's as I have grown to learn they usually leave me wishing I'd just had a TH offering.
"Had a sixer at home and now on tap at Friday's. Prefer smell on tap everything else better from bottle. Well balanced IPA, nice hoppy residue that is there to stay but also a good bit of the fruity aroma to make it enjoyable along the palate."
Poured from bottle to pint glass. First beer I have tried from Alpine. Solid copper color with unimpressive head. Smelt crisp if that is possible. Also tasted crisp not overly hoppy. A solid IPA but not what I was expecting. High drinkibility as it had more of a pilsner than IPA feel. Just OK
"Great balance of juicy and floral, spicy hops. It's a classic West Coast IPA, clean, dry, and light bodied. I also get a bit of melon and cracked pepper and maybe a hint of toasty malt in the aftertaste."
12oz bottle from Noble Grains NYC on the UES
"Pours an orange/light honey/golden syrup colour. Moderate carbonation. No lacing, not much head either."
A - pours a caramel brown with a finger of off white head. 
"Excellent bitter but balanced IPA. Stands up really well to drinking multiple times--not all that flashy in any one way, but so well made it never gets boring."
BALANCED. Medium/light bodied IPA with hints of mango and pineapple on the nose. Wouldn't call this a citrus forward beer though because it is balanced well with the hops and malty flavors. I have had more exciting pale ales but none this put together. Master craftsmanship.
"One of the freshest IPA's I've ever had. Tastes exactly how hops smell, delicious!"
"L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a golden yellow color and a slightly hazy consistency. There was an inch of foamy, fairly long-lasting head. Very good lacing."
"Bottle into a snifter. Medium golden in color with 1 finger of white, bubbly foam. Nose is a little weak, but notes of sweet fruit, moderate hops, and a good balance of malt. Taste is lots of sweet fruit - pineapple, watermelon, mango, citrus, and orange. Very tasty. Very little hop bitterness. Good malt balance on the back end."
"Six-pack purchased cold at Woodman's, Kenosha, WI. So, if you're buying this in the Midwest and worried about effects of travel, fear not. The hops are strong with this one."
"Golden yellow in color with an orange hue and a light haze. Poured with a short, bright, creamy white foam with good retention. Medium high, ripe pineapple and tropical fruit aromas with medium malt aromas and a light bready note at the end. Medium bodied with a rich, creamy feel and soft, medium light carbonation. Pleasant boozy warmth from the middle to the end. Medium high ripe pineapple and tropical fruit flavors up front followed by light spicy hop flavors and medium hop bitterness through the middle. Medium malty flavor beneath. Finished semi-dryly with a light bready maly flavor that quickly transitions to a mellow bitter hoppy aftertaste. Smooth, flavorful, mellow, very easy drinking ipa."
1 PT. 6 FL. OZ. bottle
Very solid beer. Classic IPA aroma's and flavors. Would drink a 6 pack of this any day. Although it would prefer Hoppy Birthday. Beautiful spotty lacing though.
"My first ale from Alpine and their most popular, 4300 ratings and 834 reviews. I can't add much. Had with habanero salsa. I might try their APAs."
Nice light golden color with white cap which diminishes rather quickly as does the lacing.
"On tap: poured into a shaker pint, color is gold, head was bright white, not much lingering."
"Pours a light clear Amber. Smells of light floral and citrus. Taste of citrus. Grapefruit, light orange and lemon. Sight bit of pine that leads to a floral after taste. Nice bitter bite but it is not overdone and is balanced. Finishes crisp and clean. Light mouthfeel. Excellent IPA"
1 pt 6 ounce bottle poured to wine glass	
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Best by date is 7/28/16 for what it's worth.
"On tap at the Office in Summit. I was really looking forward to trying this beer after having read the great reviews about it, and it didn't disappoint. A smooth, well-balanced, easily drinkable IPA bursting with strong nuances of hops, pines, grapefruit, citrus, and lemon zest. Recommended highly."
"12oz bottle, best by 08 SEP 16"
A: [3.75] Beer is a nice apricot color. It forms a full finger of white head with medium bubbles. The bottle lists the ABV (7.0%) it has a best by date (07/28/2016).
"I found this to be a favorite west coast IPA. Up there with Stone, Green Flash, etc. Try 24. "
"Fruity, piney, quite malty, creamy and overall balanced. I don't ride the ipa D wagon as I prefer apa's or dipa's but this I would buy again."
I Have not been reviewing beers foe awhile. This is an outstanding IPA. Very delicious.
"I'm not super into West Coast IPAs, but there is something about this one that is special."
A-Kept this on in the bottle...hotel beers!
"maybe it was the timing, weather, date, time , location or ambiance, whatever..but a very well made smooth IPA.... I still prefer another comparable brand (SN)... but this is (was?) well done. Duet is now one of the few brewed bottles that reside in the bars refrigerator!!! Well done"
Pours do you see golden in color with a very light beige head standing at about 2 inches. The nose is a little more paint and then I was expecting with a bit of citrus rind on the smell. Flavor is pure west coast IPA with tons of juicy citrus. The flavor profile is crisp and orange with a hint of citrus rind. Very flavorful IPA with very little malt to get in the way.
"Aroma is fruity and mellow. Orange, apricot, and a hint of cannabis. Taste follows suit: bright and fruity with a nice bitter bite. Malts are pretty subdued, just a hint of cracker. Bitterness and a little heat make a pleasing aftertaste. This is not as citrus-focused as your average west coast IPA, but is a wonderful diversion."
Look: It pours golden with slight haze. It has a moderate off white head with visible lace. 
Great west coast ipa piney taste but not over powering. Would drink again
Pours a clear crisp orange color with a thin white head. Head dissipates rather quickly leaving some small white foam spots. 
Amazing brew. 
"Comes out with some orange and mild amber color notes, white head 1/2"". Really good notes of tropical fruit, sage, pine consistently given from Amarillo hops and Simcoe to a lesser extent. "
"Just another great beer by Alpine Beer Company. Don't expect the hop explosion that Pure Hoppiness brings, obviously. Balanced and more than drinkable, this is going into my rotation."
"Pours a clear golden orange with a thin off-white head. Aromas of mango, peach, and some evergreen. Taste begins dry with a hint of apricot, followed by some mango, then a hint of water cracker, and a huge finale of grapefruit rind, pine and a hint of tobacco. Mouthfeel is excellent. Overall an outstanding beer."
Second Alpine beer. Here's hoping that it's as good as Hoppy Birthday. Here goes:
"Big West Coast IPA flavor, this one has hops all the way through. Smell, taste and the bitter mouthfeel. Loving hops is a must with this brew. Taste lingers long after sip. A must for IPA lovers, this is a strong but solid west coast IPA."
"Pours a clear pale gold with medium head and some residual lacing. Nose is very light compared to expectations. Just a little citrus fruit and pine, but not what you would expect given the scores others have given. Taste has a little more to it. Initial light fruit sweetness followed by a rush of bitterness and pine. Not entirely well balanced. Overall, I liked the beer, but I'm seriously wondering what beer I'm drinking compared to the beer that's got a 4.3 average score here."
"Pours a clear, yet fairly dark golden color with a small head. "
"Had this on 2016-04-31 in Lancaster, PA at The Fridge on-tap"
Nice refreshing hop-forward West Coast IPA.
Top notch IPA. Exceptional smooth weather on draft or from a bomber. Very drinkable IPA. Pine and citrus flavors with just the right amount of bitterness.
"Pours a slightly hazy standard amber in color with a lightly tanned 2 inch thick head. lacing is present, but not plentiful. "
"Excellent ipa. Hoppy and yet still balanced. I'm very happy with all the diffrent hop flavors in this. Piney, citrus, and fruit flavors and aromas. Overall a very good representation of a west coast ipa."
"Wow. Great stuff. Pop the cap and you smell the hops. So fruity, a little pine for bitterness. So easy to drink. Went way too fast. Will seek out more and look for it a little fresher."
"Pours clear, orange-yellow in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is pine and big tropical fruit, mango, orange, and lemon. Light toasted malt and cracker give the beer balance. Slightly bitter, but nicely balanced. Real treat of an IPA. I could do several of these."
"Gangbuster IPA. Gorgeous hop filled pure aroma, and a wonderful flavor that's reminiscent of Lagunitas a little sumpin sumpin ale. Phenomenal."
Clean and smooth. Not a lot of bitterness color a bright gold.
Beautiful bottle shape with an great label. Poured into a nonic pint glass.
"This is a very satisfying IPA. Poured 12 oz bottle into standard pint glass. Golden amber color, clear, with vibrant floral and citrus aromas hitting me before the first sip. The caramel malt is also in the smell. Orange, grapefruit, apricot, and tropical fruit come thru in the taste, balance well with the malt to smooth out the hoppy bitterness, so we'll done. Juicy mouthfeel, with a bit of hops bite in the finish. Recommended."
"Smells amazingly refreshing. Smooth, tasty, fruity hoppy balance"
"A - typical crystal clear amber, golden beer with nice white head that leaves good lacing"
"Honey amber in color; thick, sticky, white head; thick, foamy rings of lacing down the glass. Heady floral and strawberry aroma. Bold hop bitterness with a mild cereal grain malt backbone. Medium-heavy body; slightly coarse and ticklish on the palate; gentle sweetness yet finishes dry."
"Medium bodied. The malt is very much in the backbone of it's flavor profile. The hops are incredibly fresh, with a citrus sweetness to smooth out the dead on bitterness the hops bring fourth."
A much more balanced IPA from alpine. More tobacco/pepper/dank fruit than stylistic west coast bite.
"Golden hue, small head, light lace. Light and earthy scents, hops, pine, grass and malt. Picking up simcoe over the amarillo, providing a nice juicy, floral and tropical fruity taste. Pineapple, orange peel, grass, candied malt, slight tobacco undertones. Not too complex, but the finish is what made this one for me. Very light bodied and easy to drink. Smooth, soft carbonation, extremely clean finish with light lingering bitterness."
This is one exceptional IPA. The 2 hop varieties showcased really work well together but are not overpowering like so many other IPAs these days. This beer achieves that rare balance of highlighting the hops without just being a bitter hop bomb. In other words you can drink more than one and not completely wreck your palate. Definitely one of my new faves. Highly recommended.
Great light golden color although a little cloudy. Very good floral hop flavor.
"This is a very competant IPA. I was expecting more, but was not blown away. Don't get me wrong, I liked this beer, but it is not going on one of my ""best of"" lists anytime soon. There are too many good IPA's that do something great, and this beer does not have that special something."
"This is an IPA I'll spend a few extra dollars to get. While (in my area) this is similarly priced to Sculpin, and while I think I prefer Sculpin to this over all, I would happily get this again. Hop profile is strong and juicy. Some have said that there's nothing that stands out about this beer, but I would argue that the quality of brewing in this beer stands out."
bottle dated best by aug 16/16
Freshness date:8/24/16
A: crystal clear; deep gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a thin collar; nice lacing;
"Poured on draught into a pint glass. Extremely drinkable and moderately juicy ipa with a nice hop profile. Notes of grapefruit, pine and pineapple. Nothing crazy but delicious."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a thin smear of white head across the top. It still leaves some small dribs and drabs of lacing. The aroma has good floral, citrus, and pine hops qualities, as does the taste. The taste is a little light but it still offers all the flavors of the aroma. The body is lighter but not thin with just a slight carbonation tingle."
"L- Clean golden body, fluffy white head with good retention. Leaves a thin crown throughout the entire beer."
"Clear copper body, inch head"
Amazing.
"Golden milky color. Strong hoppy smell. Good carbonation. Strong hoppy bitterness, a little bit of woodsy pine, but not overpowering. Well balanced, hint of fruit in the taste. Very very drinkable."
"22 oz bottle poured into a stemmed, tulip style glass. "
"Jeez, everything is tasting good for me today. I guess I'm lucky. Some days it is not this good."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head, nice lacing and lively carbonation. Aroma is of citrusy hops, ripe fruit and bready malt. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Herbal hops, bready malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and dry. Great IPA."
"Alpine Beer Company ""Duet"""
"Appearance: light golden bronze, you can see pretty well through it when held up to light."
"The pour looked nice, with a pale golden colored body, sporting some chill haze, and topped off by a one finger thick head. The aroma was that of clean, West Coast hops, evoking grapefruit and hay. The taste was very clean as well, with the citric hop acids dominating up front, followed by some pineapple and melon in the finish. There was sweetness from the malts to put up a losing fight against the hops. The body was creamy and delicate, and the mouthfeel was exquisite. This is an outstanding example of why this style appeals to so many. What's not to love?"
This beer is a DIPA in an IPA's title. Very sweet and thick. That being said...
"Bottle shared at tasting. Pale golden pour with a thin white head. Smells of malt sugars, caramel and grapefruit. Well balanced taste, high carbonation, with notes of grapefruit and a grapefruit heavy aftertaste."
"Crisp and clear with nice lively carbonation. This was the Alpine Beer rather than the green flash version. Amarillo and simcoe lovely! Prickly pear juice and nice dry finish. Floral notes are there but the juicy bitter taste is strong and pungent. Extremely well crafted and just as good as I remember on draft at the brewery. No alcohol at all. Pine on the finish, mango peach and pear with a little lemon zest on the tongue. Great stuff. Now I realize why when it hit Indiana a few weeks ago, it was sold out in a few days"
"12 oz bottle best buy July 13 2016 into a tulip. Pours slight orange color with feint haze and generous fluffy head. Smell is big bold hops, pine, grapefruit, peach. Taste is more on the piney end here with some 'pithy' citrus flavor that wraps up rather clean with slight bitter finish. Mouth is smooth, in fact the carbonation is slightly underwhelming, making this feel a bit heavier than the abv."
"Clear golden color with white head. Aroma has earthy, piney hops with some grapefruit. Taste starts with piney hops and citrus fruits, quite balanced. Finishes bitter with grapefruit flavor. Body and carbonation are medium. Really well made, classic west coat style IPA."
"A friend recommended this and I am so happy he did. What's great beer. I am partial to VT brews, but absolutely love this. Can't wait to try their double!"
My 5000th beer on BA
"12 oz bottle, best by 09 JUN 16."
Dark orange with white legs. 3.75
"pours a clear orange with standard sudsy, soapy head"
"Have been looking forward to trying this brew for years. Just recently became available in my area, after Green Flash buyout. Does not let down, great smell & taste, more piney than most west-coast IPAs. Worth the $54 / case."
"APPEARANCE: Slightly hazy amber/orange with 2 fingers of foamy white head that lingers a good while. Slight medium bubbles streaming up the glass. Thick lacing down the pint glass, nice!"
"Pours a light orange with nice head and retention. I get a lot of fresh cut grass, peach, resinous hops. Good, but not great. Nelson is better. Clean, crisp, dry finish."
"6oz from a bottle. This is a very nice, lower malt ipa with some great flavor, huge hop aroma and good overall hop character, low bitterness. However it is kind of sweet, and i dont like that, so not a huge fan"
Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass bottled on 2/10/16. Pours a very attractive dark yellow with a 3 finger sticky white head that leaves little spots of lace behind.
"A - Very light in color American IPA, small head of microbubbles. Completely transparent."
"Pours a lovely clear straw yellow with a nice fluffy white thumb's worth of head that lasts a few minutes before breaking and leaving a few islands of foam. Smell is amazing. Citrus and floral, and just really enjoyable. The taste carries through the nose, the Amarillo and Simcoe hops doing their job and delivering a nice citrus bitterness along with a nice floral essence. A nice maltiness gives this beer the one two punch that makes it worthy of its rave reviews. Feel is nice and light with a bit of a slickness to it, carbonation is medium."
"Mikkeller - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Alpine does no wrong with their IPA's.
L: Straw gold color with a frothy white head and some nice lacing on the glass.
"Definitely not the same since Green Flash. Very mediocre IPA. Has a generic IPA feel to it. The aroma isn't great, mild at best. It's a real shame. This was one of my favorite IPAs in the past. I keep hoping that GF will get it together and do this beer justice, but no, just no. Won't buy another GF Alpine beer. A real shame"
"Sampled on 2/22/16 from pint glass. Poured from 12 oz bottle stamped ""best by 28 Jul 16"". Aroma: initial aromas of moderate malt and light continental hops. Aroma reveals floral and hop resin notes which took the fore and malt aroma became subdued, which is appropriate to style. Light malty/hopy/estery fruity notes. Appearance: brilliantly clear. Copper color. Good head retention with 1/4"" just off white head with rockey bubbles. Flavor: hop forward balance with moderately high bitterness - good for style. Malt flavors moderate - grainy and toasty. Heavy hop flavors - herbal and especially pronounced mid-palate. Finish is super dry. Aftertaste of light grainy malts. Clean American ale yeast profile. Mouthfeel: medium body. Moderate carbonation. Little to no alcohol warmth. No creaminess. Moderate hop astringency - not to style, but enjoyable. Overall: interesting herbal IPA! Not like many other IPA's I've had. Very easy to drink - easy to get yourself into trouble! Malt-hop balance is enjoyable and malts prop up hops well, fully supporting hop flavors. Would like more hop aromas - perhaps increase dry hopping or late hop additions. Would like to see hop astringency reduced - possibly substitute bittering hop varieties. 41/50."
"12 oz bottle with ""Best By"" dating of 28 July 16"
"BBD 7/13/16. Clear copper pour. Normal head volume, world class retention and outstanding lacing."
"Don't know why I do it to myself, but I keep going back to GF brewed Alpine each time I see a new fresh batch. I keep hoping the Alpine IPAs I know and love show up. And each time I get so disappointed. Half of me didn't want to review this swill out of respect for a killer brewery--but hey: if you put your name on crap, that's on you."
Pours a copper color with a finger of head. The nose has both hoppy and malty notes. The body is solid and the flavor is rather malty. There is also a healthy dose of tropical fruits. The hoppiness on the finish is definitely there and presents itself well.
"12oz bottle, brewed and bottled by Alpine(not green flash). Best by 6/9/16"
12 oz bottle poured into an IPA glass. Best by July 2016. 
Pours from the bomber a perfectly clear orange-gold with a dense and creamy white head with lots of nice lacing left behind.
A: Poured from the bottle into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is slightly hazy golden-orangey with only a wisp of whitish film on top.
"Poured into IPA glass. It pours a hazy golden yellow with a thick, frothy two-finger milk white head and extensive lacing. It smells of pine needles, grapefruit, and floral hops, with a whiff of orange. The orange really comes through in the taste, followed by grapefruit, pine, and more malt than I expected. It finishes pretty bitter and dank. This ale is medium-bodied and moderately carbonated, and with an ABV of only 7% it is very drinkable. Overall, it is an excellent IPA. I really like the orange presence. I would definitely drink Duet again."
"Poured from 12oz bottle to nonic. Golden color. I've never used this term for an IPA, but I can't get it out of my mind--- sweat finish. But that's in a good way."
A - Hazy Orange/Amber. Foam holds well. Fast-rising bubbles.
Pours a golden straw color with a short wispy white head that settles into a ring. No lacing. I like the lighter color for IPAs.
"pours with minimal head into snifter glass. clear pour. no haze whatsoever. nice looking brew! smells good w some pine, light fruit. maybe some floral scents. not overpowering. taste is very clean w mid palate floral giving way to some nice peach mango. followed by some sweet malt that does not take away from the hops. bitterness ends. dry finish. overall this beer is great. not overpowering but each sip leaves me wanting more. everything ive had from alpine is world class."
1 pint 6 oz bottle best by May 23 2016.
look - pretty clear golden color with slight head and a slight skim on top with slight lacing.
"When I see any beer rated at 96 I expect to get my socks blown off. Although a good IPA, this is not one of my favorites. I found the body to be a little light and just not enough hopiness to meet my taste preference."
"Had on draft at McMenamin's 23rd Ave Bottle Shop. Happy to see on draft as I have been wanting to try this beer for a long time, it's readily available in bottles but for me IPAs are always a must on draft."
"12 oz. bottle, best by date July 04, 2016. My third beer from Alpine Beer Company, acquired a single bottle at the local bottle shop."
"12oz bottle into tulip... Pours light gold / orange, with a thin, white head that leaves no lace. Smell is citrusy / lemony and slightly piney. Taste is clean and snappy - light cracker malt with orange rind, tangerine and lightly resinous hops. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but enhances drinkability - doesn't seem like a 7% beer. Overall, a delicious beer - epitome of a west coast IPA."
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip:
"Good IPA featuring Simcoe and Amarillo hops brings lots of citrus and fruit, edged with earthy pine. Clean and sharp, with a decent malt backbone, medium-light feel and ample carbonation."
"Very good, hops moderately bitter and present, but balanced by malt. Lacking something. Wholefoods, Oak, Jan 2016"
L: golden color with a thick lacing white head 
Pours very clear copper color good white head sticks around for a bit really good lacing.
"A very good, easily obtainable (at least here in Colorado) India Pale Ale. I'd agree wholeheartedly with the descriptor: 'the perfect amount of malt hidden behind the hoppy goodness.' Just a really balanced beer that drinks lighter than 7.0 percent."
"Pours a golden tangerine color. Great body on this beer. Two of my favorite hops, Simcoe and Amarillo. Very expensive but worth it. One of my favorites."
12 oz bottle poured into a Stella Chalice. Best by 04 Jul 16 on bottle. 
"Had on tap at Throx brew market in Winchester. Outstanding lacing grabbed the glass, aroma strong on pineapple was strong, excellent. Taste is slightly more muted than aroma and the pine comes out more. Some bitter, lingers slightly but not unpleasant. Overall outstanding."
pours a golden amber with a solid head.
"Crystal clear, a little on the amber side of pale, off-white head drops fairly quickly. Aroma is strong and pleasant, taste dominated by smooth floral/pine with a hint of dry maltiness. Body/feel is right at where it should be for a 7 ABV, easy to grab a second."
GF bottled
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Orangey-amber with a couple fingers of foam. Streaky, mottled lacing. Aroma is both fruity/citrusy and dank/piney, with an emphasis on the former. Grapefruit and tangerine rind. A bit of fresh pine needles. Very aromatic and pleasant. Simcoe and Amarillo really work well together, and I'd imagine this would smell otherworldly when super-fresh."
Appearance - Pours a clear yellow with medium head. 
"Had on tap a few separate times, but this review is from the bottle; 6 pack, from what I assume has to be Green Flash. Color, medium straw with a relatively small head, yet lively carbonation, much more clear than I remember. Smells of fresh, dank hops; citrus, mango, pineapple, slight onion, papaya. Very slight malt presence. Taste is as follows. Hoppiness is all flavor/aroma and comes across smoothly (as I've noticed with all Alpine offerings). Crackery malt rings clearly in the background; almost feels disconnected from the hops in a good way. Maybe they treat the water differently from other SD breweries? Feels infinitely drinkable, super refreshing."
"Poured into a standard IPA glass. Great looking beer. About a finger of head with some really nice lacing. Beer is well carbonated and bubbles for a long time after pouring. Best by label says June 2016 but unsure how old it is. Smell is good, not great. Some bitter hoppiness, some citrus/tropical fruits, decent sweetness. Taste is similar. A good tasting IPA but maybe not up to expectation. Obviously fresher would be better but this is still a solid brew. Mouthfeel is light and prickly, doesn't coat the tongue too much and makes it easily drinkable. Overall something I would drink again but not sure if 17+ for a 6 pack is worth it. Cheers!"
Green Flash bottle.
"Green Flash made, best by 12 May 2016. Seriously, can we get a bottling date??"
Look- crystal clear bright ipa
"A - Hazy orange transparent body, with off white head and some lacing."
"This accidentally became my 1,000th beer after I had it on tap and realized what number I was up to. Fortunately, it was not a bad one to celebrate with. Much like some of Alpine's other hoppy offerings, Duet has the classic look and feel of a west coast style IPA. Strong bitterness balanced by medium-range alcohol content and a sticky mouthfeel."
"Pours a golden-copper body, somewhat thin in appearance, with active bubbles and a great white sudsy head. "
Serving type: 12 oz into a shaker pint
Freshly hoppy without overly bitter. Yum
A: Pours a golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that slowly fades down to a ring of lace around the glass
"Poured into an IPA glass. Clear dark-golden color with a frothy white head. Good retention. Aromas of pine, earth, orange and grapefruit. I tasted the Simcoe notes first- earthy and piney- followed by floral and cirtus tones. A big malt backbone but not sweet. Well-balanced and thoroughly enjoyable. Clean finish."
"Pour is a mix of copper and banana glow in a glass. Nothing special; nothing unique. It's on par. The head is minimal, and it offers sparse lacing during your enjoyment. It smells of compost, rustic wood engravings, citrus, and dying grapefruit. Taste is pretty good, as the reflex from the nose offers a quaint balance belied by the notorious Alpine malt backbone. GF or not, they got this characteristic down to a science. Hoppy Birthday and Nelson feature the same baseline flavor profile. The feel is acidic, crisp, and it lingers for the proper duration. A very nice IPA."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Clear yellow color with a thin head and nice lacing. Very citrusy smell. The taste is citrus fruit, especially grapefruit. Pleasant bitterness and piney after taste. This is Avery good IPA. Goes well with pizza!"
"Pours a very attractive, crystal clear, pale gold. Soft, white, bubbly but sparse head with minimal retention and lacing. Smell is phenomenal. Citrus and pine, dankness, little bit of biscuity cracker, and just a touch of onion. The taste is crisp and bright, perhaps a little more mellow than the smell, but very balanced and delicious. Pine and grass, some bitter citrus, very clean with just the right amount of bitterness in the aftertaste. Some sweetness to balance things out. Incredibly satisfying and easy to drink. Feel is medium and resiny with just the right amount of carbonation. Really love this beer, and one that I’m never disappointed to go back to. Able to standout even in a world where IPA are being pushed in extreme directions. One of my favorites."
A-a clear light orange color with a fingers worth of white head that leaves a layer of lacing around the top
A - Pours a clear golden orange color with a thick finger of white head.
"Exceptionally clear light bronze color with three fingers of lasting white head. Grapefruit, orange and pine on the nose. Bitter up front in the taste, and lighter on the backside, with grapefruit rind lingering in the aftertaste. Not much malt to speak of. Light bodied. Not bad, but unlike some of their others, I don't find Duet worth the high price point."
"This is the Green Flash bottled and brewed version, best by June 2016"
12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic pint
"A: Hazy, golden orange in color with a thin head that dissipated fairly rapidly."
This is yet another great offering from these guys. I wish these beers would be cheaper. Can't beat the beer tho. Great bitterness and hop joy with citrus and floral tastes being most prominent. Has that alpine smoothness.
"L - Golden yellow with clarity, 1 finger of head, and some sticky lace left on the glass"
"Pours a nice golden/orange with frothy off white head. Aroma of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, pine, melon, mango, floral & herbal. Flavor matches the aroma with a slightly sweet malty backbone which includes bisquit and cracker. Not extremely bitter for a west coast IPA, somewhat juicy, and the Amarillo hops definitely stand out. I hate to call an IPA ""balanced"", because the style is just the opposite of balance, but FOR and IPA, this is vary well balanced. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, slightly sweet, but finishes somewhat dry. That may also be contradictory. Overall a very drinkable IPA. I would drink this again for sure."
Served in a snifter at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth. 
22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass
Had on tap at Lake and Irving. L: Pours copper gold with a light haze under a 1” clingy cream colored foam cap that persists through the entire drink. 
"Duet is a crystal-clear deep gold beer with a large (albeit brief-lived) slightly pebbly ivory head that leaves good bands and caverns of lacing. The aroma is medium-big: a very nice blend of grapefruit, sweet/spicy florals and more subdued citrus and pine notes, with a hint of alcohol riding atop everything. Up front, the palate is bitter pineapple with hints of citrus; by mid-palate, the citrus notes have attained a greater presence and a slight IPA soapiness has emerged. Bitterness builds to a style-moderate level; a significant bready malt character provides some balance. The finish is dry and clean, showing just a flash of cedar, followed by the onset of a moderate grassy bitterness that lingers for a few minutes. Mouthfeel is biggish for the light-medium body, and the texture is slightly creamy and nicely peppery from the well-expressed carbonation. This is a solid IPA. (22 oz bottle, 153 days before best-by)"
A - Clear gold body with a huge white head left thick tight rings.
"Had this over the summer on tap along with Nelson, but didn't review. This time from a bottle."
"This is a solid offering from Alpine Brewing out of California. Very drinkable!! Beautiful color and head/lacing as well as aroma but the taste doesn't deliver the same flavor that you get in the scent. Lots of pine and heavy citrus (mango & oranges). I had to try this beer because I've tasted their session Hoppy Birthday and it quickly became my favorites in the IPA category. This one falls in comparison to their others in my personal opinions, while this brew is just not as unique or exciting. This beer is a typical West Coast IPA, and don't get me wrong it's a very enjoyable beer but just doesn't sit at the same level as Hopoy Birthday and Nelson which are both much more one of a kind flavor."
Bomber poured into pilsener
A 22 ounce bomber poured into shaker pint glass.
Semi-clear amber with a creamy white film rounding up at the edges leaving some fluid spots of lace.
Typical west coast IPA. Plenty of bitterness but not much flavor profile. Wish it tasted like it smells. Nice to see this in distribution out east but would rather drink some of the better local brews.
"Appearance - Pours crystal clear and bright, golden orange in color with an off-white, half finger width head. Fair retention, leaving a mostly barren surface and a thin ring around the edge. Not much for lacing, save a spot or two around the glass. "
"Pours a clear golden orange color. Pour from Green Flash bomber had two fingers of foamy head, of which a thin layer lingers producing lots of lacing. Dank smell with some tropical fruit aroma. Very nice flavor, with smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is an enjoyable IPA that I would recommend."
"Smell is heavy citrus - orange, hint of tropical fruit (mango and pineapple), and dankness."
Poured into a snifter/tulip/wine hybrid glass from a 750 ml bottle (March 2016 drink by)
"Green Flash bottle dated ""Best By April 20, 2016"". "
Had on draft at high 5's. Delicious ipa. Pours very clear has a nice sized head. The smell is a little week on it. Flavor is very crisp and juicy.But is lacking some of the hop depth/ bite.
L: pours a light amber. An off-white head that lasts a while. 
"Best by April 07, 2016."
"22 oz. bottle poured into Founders snifter. Best by date April 20, 2016"
"Juicy and creamy. Bronze/golden brown. Healthy constant head, lacing out the ears covering the glass. Subtle plush hop nose with underlying bitterness. Super tasty, full bodied. Crisp and refreshing. Very good beer."
2015-11-28
A: Pours a clear medium golden honey in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation and moderate golden yellow + orange highlights with a hint of amber highlights. The beer has a two finger tall foamy white head that reduces to a mottled medium thick film covering the entire surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.
Huge and tropical. Amazing for a single IPA.
P: Hazy golden poor with a pure white head that turns into a great lace up and down the glass sand on the top of the beer.
had it during thanksgiving break of 2015 that was purchased from the River Forest Whole Foods. The hops profiles are very potent and somewhat too overpowering for the occasional ipa consumer.
"A golden amber with lively head. The nearly ever lasting froth is great. Stone fruit aromas with a subtle dankness. Clean and crisp in design, but a with an aroma/flavor first tech is rewarding in its richness. Quite quaffable."
"Amarillo and simcoe, what could possibly go wrong. The answer is nothing. This is a great beer. Brilliant clarity, really attractive to look at the bright gold nectar in your glass. Floral at first, then the pine resin kicks in big time. Quite bitter actually, but its appropriate for a beer of this construction."
Alpine just knows how to make juicy IPAs. This one had lots of nice piney qualities balanced well with floral notes from the hops. I really liked the overal hop profile and felt the bitterness was held in check very well.
"Pours a slightly hazy medium orange with a thin, white head. A slight bitter hop smell. The taste is definition of balance between hop and malt. Extremely smooth offering and wonderful mouthfeel. Flowery taste resonates."
"Duet harmoniously entwines golden and orange tones, their highlights spill out and diffuse across the table. Though of only modest foaminess the lacing expands like a marching army, conquering all corners of the glass. The patterns imprinted are intricate enough to pass for some kind of abstract modern art.

"A California classic. An outastanding IPA. When someone wants to know what a ""west coast ipa"" tastes like, this one is a perfect example of the style."
"Pours a clear amber color with a finger width foamy head. Retention is mild. Lacing is good. Has a great, fresh, citrus resin aroma. Big juicy citrus taste with a nice piney resin at the end. Moderately astringent aftertaste. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Again, a great beer from Alpine. My second"
Pours hazy yellow a brilliant kiss form orange. Pours out like light you can see it in my photo. Thin white head that wants to hang on. Nose is explosive with tropical. Crisp honey dew melon. Herbal hop that has a woody backing. Orange blossom honey.
Very good but won't be buying another $7 bomber…Would love to see in reasonably priced 6 packs though. 
ALPINE DUET DIPA 11/19/15
Very nice surprise finding this on tap at Tapwerks!
Very few beers stand out such as this one does. Loved every sip.
"Big pine notes, grapefruit pith, resin, and tangerine in aroma. Floral hops lend sweetness."
I liked this one a lot more than Pure Hoppiness.
"22oz bomber purchased at the Albertson’s in Kennewick, WA, for $7.99. This is the first time I’ve come across beers from the California Alpine. According to the label it is best by March 17, 2016. Hmm. Just noticed it’s in a Green Flash bottle. I guess they want everyone to know they bought Alpine."
"Was expecting this to be fairly good and it exceeded expectations. Once again, the feel on this beer is like a DIPA which I love. (Same as Nelson) This had a bright nose with floral and some juicy hop aromas. The taste was very good with sharp bitter hop flavors perfectly blended with the malt profile. Overall, very well done. If this was priced more favorably I would buy it all the time."
Not a bad beer for me but not as outstanding as it's rating. I would have another but I will not seek it out like I did to get it in the first place. I'm still interested in trying more from Alpine.
A symphony of hops! The Amarillo and Simcoe work so well together and the aroma is so incredibly light and floral. So easily drinkable it's difficult to take your time with it. I am happy that Alpine has finally come to Chicago!
great beer got lucky and at my local the guy was putting on the shelf
"Looked clear and darker orange with a nice white head that left spotty lacing on the glass. It smells like citrus, mango and pine with a sweet malt aroma. The taste is the same as the smell with the taste of orange and mango most prominent. The malty sweetness gives way to a nice bitterness that intensifies after the beer is swallowed. The bitterness is pine and grapefruit pith. This is a really nice, balanced beer that I cannot wait to be distributed widely now that Green Flash is involved."
Outstanding IPA that I was stunned to find at my local MA beer store. The partnership with Green Flash bearing fruit! Nice aroma of citrus and pine accompanies the copper hued body with a thick head. Tropical fruit notes balanced by a strong bitterness that ends crisp and dry. Nothing too juicy but definitely an IPA that that's worth seeking out.
GF bottling (grumble). Hopefully a re-review if ever GF gets their stuff down.
"This beer pours and almost clear orange-honey with a very nice head. The grapefruit aroma hits me first, along with other citrus peel, followed by a small hint of pineapple, and then a grassy aroma. The flavor leans more heavily toward this grassy earthy flavor first, with the refreshing citrus more apparent on the back end. The mouthfeel is thick but not syrupy, infact there is a pleasantly small amount of astringency right on the end that dried out the swallow. Overall a really solid west coast style IPA, maybe not as dry as I would prefer, but very good. "
22oz bottle poured into a globe.
"very happy to finally see this in northern California. picked up a bottle at nugget in Vacaville. pours a slightly hazy orange with a decent head for the style. decent hop aroma, but overall very clean and enticing brew. "
"Appearance: Slightly hazy gold, good head."
Served in an Ohio State shaker pint glass.
"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden amber color with off-white head. Citrus, pine, and some light floral notes on the nose; follows onto the palate. Medium bodied, smooth. Finishes with a piney citrusy note."
"Duet is a highly drinkable and well-balanced American IPA. Great clarity and rustiy orange hue set the nose and palate up for crisp, floral, and citrusy experience. The malt dances nicely with its Amarillo and Simcoe hop profile. I need to discover the story behind the label."
"Wasn't really impressed with this. Hop aroma was weak, got some pine and grassy notes, no citrus or fruit though (it was a fresh keg), and the taste was very bitter. It wasn't overpoweringly bitter, but i was not as pleasant to drink as nelson. I guess i had high standards for this beer, it's still better than most IPA's out there though."
"L - copper, not much haze, thin head laces the glass"
From a bomber distributed by green flash. Into a chilled pint glass the look started hazy then cleared. Smell somewhat citrusy but not that hoppy. Taste was really clean and highly drinkable. An above average IPA for sure.
Bottle BB 3/2016:
"22oz bomber poured into 2 12oz snifters. Pours a straw-honey yellow, with a half-finger of white head, leaving some lacing - just the faintest touch of haze. Nose is equal parts light citrus (orange peel, grapefruit) and hops. On the palate, the grapefruit disappears and is replaced with mandarin orange. There's a pervasive hoppy dryness too, that lends an almost tangy note to the citrus, yielding notes of kumquat. The mouthfeel is very dry, and of intermediate thickness. Overall, and outstanding IPA. In true fashion of a child of the modern beer renaissance, I find it hard not to rate those IPAs highest which taste most like they should be DIPAs. This beer however, finds a more nuanced middle ground, and stands, for me, as an excellent example of why the balanced complexity of more restrained IPAs can easily match their bigger DIPA cousins."
L - poured into trillium tulip as a dull orange with a medium white head. 
Bomber with Green Flash label across the neck. Best by 4/7/16. Poured into a nonic. 
"Nice clear orange/amber color, one-inch fluffy head that quickly faded to a quarter inch, minimal lacing. Great big fruity and flowery aroma. Big tropical and citrus flavors, lots of mango! Medium bodied, kinda slick oily moiuthfeel, very nice. Overall, quite tasty, I'll be drinking this one again."
"First had on draft into pint tumbler. This IPA was overly sweet and rather disappointing, in view of the build-up for this and the rest of its beers upon Alpine's arrival in Mississippi."
Bottle from colonial spirits.
"Bought a bomber earlier this week that was enjoy by dated 4/something/16. It was a GF bottle, poured a fairly clear, dark yellow/light orange color with a huge foamy head. The smell of the hops was a thing of beauty from the bottle, yet the taste I found to be rather muted and unexciting comparatively. Mouthfeel was a bit thin. Not sure of the ins and outs of the GF/Alpine thing but everything I have had from either thus far have been very hit or miss. Not overly impressed."
From 9/18/15: On tap at Good Beer in NYC
Look: Really nice looking hazy yellow-orange with a white head.
i got this one at the same time as pure hoppiness. another outstanding beer from these guys. one of the best ipa's from California i've had. great taste.
Poured from 22oz bomber into a dimpled mug.
22 oz bottle. Pours slightly hazy golden orange with a medium frothy white head that retains well and laces the glass.
Bomber into a pint glass 
"Not my thing. Not hating on Alpine or Green Flash here, as I've only tried the Green Flash version. Aroma is aiiiiite. Taste is extremely bitter and unbalanced. Definitely did not do it for me. Second time I've DP'd this. Both different batches I would assume, based on their enjoy by dates."
22oz Bomber
Bottle into pint glass. Big fluffy tan head and a light golden brown orange color. Smells like citrus and hops. Tastes much the same but pine and bitterness dominate. Good but I'm not a huge fan of piney hop bombs. This may not be fresh. Would like to try on draft. Just above average to me.
Alpine Duet 
Appearance: Slightly hazy light-amber color with a generous-sized white head that slowly faded. A good looking IPA.
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bottle on October 18, 2015. Bottle labeled best by 17 Mar 16."
22 oz.bottle:
Appearance: pours a deep copper orange color. a two finger or so tan head forms and sticks around for a while. leaves behind a strong and frothy lacing along the entire height of the glass. good strong clarity and good brightness.
"Look - To be honest, I'm not sure looks can be rated really. Seriously, unless its a stout that looks like an IPA or a session beer that's as dark as a Porter...who am I or anyone for that matter to say what any beer should look like as long as its in the ball park of what it says it is. After all, there are black IPA's. However, I give this beer a 3 because for one, I poured the entire beer pretty aggressively before I saw any head and when head finally appeared, it was about maybe a nickel thick which faded as quick as it appeared (within about 5 seconds)."
"Poured into a Southern Tier Pumking glass from a 32oz growler. The color is a cloudy orangish brown. I get some hoppiness and a little pine on the nose, the taste is pretty balanced I think between the hop and malt. Overall a good beer, but some people are saying theirs is clear and mine is cloudy which makes me think mines not as good as it is supposed to be."
22 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass
"A good try at IPA but after drinking stone enjoy by.... carton boat and other big beers, the hops here seem very muted and not as pronounced. I was expecting a bigger punch, and for 11.00 a bottle I was let down."
"Orangish copper pour with a lacy white head. Not that much in the aroma. A little bit of citrus. Lots of lime flavors, plain mouthfeel. A very alright IPA."
"On-tap at The Twisted Elm Tavern, Elmwood Park, NJ"
Green Flash sourced bottle (brewed by Green Flash?)
Pours a nice clear golden color. Has a light hoppy aroma with a citrusy backbone. Flavor is mild citrus hops that quickly smooths to a lightly sweet finish. Leaves a very light bitter citrus hop aftertaste. A little bit light overall for my liking but still very good
"A- Pours a clear and bright medium golden in color. The body of the beer almost glows in the glass. A decent sized, two finger head forms and retains very well, lacing very well as well. Lots of carbonation that is continuously rising."
22oz bomber poured into tulip glass:
"Best by 3/17/16. 22oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours golden with a subtle haze; fluffy eggshell white head that sticks around leaving great retention and sticky lacing. The aromas are very nice. Floral with strong tropical notes. Lots of ripe melon with hints of pineapple. Sticky grapefruit in the mix as well. Malts are there, but the hops shine. The flavors follow the nose. Lots of hop flavor, but it's not that bitter. Pretty juicy. Watermelon is there. Regular melon as well. More grapefruit. A touch of fresh grass and pine needles. Solid malts backbone, but the hops once again still shine. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Clean and not aggressive. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Very creamy and fluffy. Smooth and easy drinking."
L: a brownish orange with a decent amount of white head
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a chalice.
Finally get to try this beer and its worth the wait. Nice orange/amber in color with a quickly fading white head. Grapefruit and tropical fruit scents and taste. Bitter but smooth on the tongue. Pricey but something Ill still buy from time to time. Love it.
"The beer comes in a peach to orange color. The aroma is tropical fruits and light malt. The taste follows with tropical fruits, light malt, and low bitterness. It's a balanced IPA with a good hop profile."
Looks like the acquisition of Alpine by Green Flash is going to be good for distro. And business. First time finding this beauty in Wisconsin. Love the hop bill—Simcoe and Amarillo are two of my favorites. Gorgeous beer with an inviting aroma and awesome flavor. I will be looking for more of this beer.
Citrus flavor
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, honey-gold coloring with a tall, chunky, foamy, clingy, off-white head. Aromas of rich pine tassel and moss, with a tart and sweet grapefruit note cutting through. Smells almost candy sweet. Great aromatics. Flavors are citrus forward, heavy on grapefruit, orange rind, and lemon zest, with a backbone of piney, grassy, bitter and resinous hops notes. Smooth and slick in mouth, but light, with a citrus and sugary sweet blend for the aftertaste. The finish is smooth, light, and slightly dry, with a good pine and grapefruit linger afterwards. Very easy to drink, and amazingly balanced and tasty."
"Spent some time searching for this in Southern CA last month and ended up walking into a bottle shop in central Illinois to see it sitting on the shelf, go figure. Still a little mixed emotions about the Green Flash acquisition, but I'm glad to be able to try this. Best by 3-17-16. Lots of pine and citrus with a sweet caramel malty back and moderately bitter finish. Very tasty and I hope that I'm able to get my hands on Alpine stuff more often now. Prost!"
"L: medium body white fluffy head, light tinge of golden orange, hazy"
"Drinking this beer to celebrate becoming a Champion on Beer Advocate, and this is a champion of a beer. A beautiful golden amber color, thick tan head, intensely hoppy smelling, powerful, delicious bitterness."
"Pint bottle. Pours clear bright orange-copper, two finger fluffy head in a few minutes, scattered lace. Mild aroma of flower, pine, ripe plum. Taste is caramel malty sweet up front, met by floral and grassy bitterness, a little pine and grapefruit as well. Finishes dry, flowery bitterness lasts awhile. Clean medium mouthfeel, semi-slick. Excellent IPA, love those Amarillo hops."
"Terrific light cream colored head and lacing, copper color and crystal clear. "
A very good drinkable IPA that's hoppy yet smooth. Subtle citrus notes on the finish.
"Clear copper in color; floral, spicy hops on the nose; taste features a prominent sweet malt base with floral, spicy, slightly resinous hop notes; great medium body; bitterness doesn't really linger."
"An absolutely delicious beer with a beautiful smell. Very floral and full of life through its single and Amarillo hops, with a light, crisp finish. Very very good!"
"Pours into an impy nonic a clear a clear honey-like color with a tight formed half finger frothy white head atop.Tangerine,overripe pineapple,and leafy hops over top of a sugary malt base.Great hop complexity on the palate,tangerine,orange,pineapple,and slight grassiness,a sugary slightly doughy malt base is there thru the finish.A great hop complexity to this IPA,as good as advertised."
Bomber > Tulip Glass
Fresh bottle served in a tulip glass.
Appearance - light copper in color. Smell - hoppy citrus smell. Perhaps rinds. Taste - citrus rind on intake but on breathing out it is like Two Hearted. Nice. Overall - this is good. I'd drink again.
"Had on draft at the Golden Gate Taproom, in San Francisco"
"out of a growler served in pint glass, look was a lighter amber poured a great head with lasting power, great lacing throughout, smell of floral and faint citrus, taste was balanced hops were approachable with a 40+ IBU, feel was absolutely clean and fresh, all this for a very balanced and approachable IPA, good for the person trying the style."
"22 ounce bottle, embossed with the Green Flash logo."
A: This poured a clear light gold with a little white head.
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Poured from a Green Flash embossed bottle. Pours a medium coppery amber with a thin white head that dissipates to patches leaving light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, piney and citrus hops with a light dankness, grapefruit and a hint of light stone fruit.Flavor is citrus and piney hops, mildly dank, orange and grapefruit citrus, light tropical fruit, subdued but sturdy caramel malt. Finishes with lingering, lightly resinous grapefruit and piney hop bitterness. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A very nicely balanced, hoppy IPA with an emphasis on the herbal flavors of the hops as well as good assertive bitterness. Pleasant mixed fruit flavors from the hop combination. A quite nice IPA. I'm not a big fan of Green Flash's hop flavors usually, but they did a nice job on this one. I've never tried the Alpine brewed version, but this is great. Matches surprisingly well to its brewery description: balanced with malt concealed behind the hoppy goodness."
Pours two fingers of head on a clear straw body.
"Raw hop power all the way, just like every Alpine I've had so far. It actually tastes like a hop pellet was simply dropped into the beer at the last minute."
Another bottle from Alpine distributed to NorCal. Best by date: 17 MAR 16F15280.
Poured from bottle and what a huge hit of hops this is. West coast all the way. Grapefruit all the way accompanied by guess what pine. Is it better than all the other west coast up as I'll let you be the judge.
"Poured from bottle with a photo of Alpine Church underneath the Alpine beer co logo. Clear orange with white head of about a finger tip deep giving off the aromas of Pine, and citrus along with floral and hops in the air. Lacing is sticky. Love the taste of this west coast IPA that feels your mouth with a great hoppy flavor, piney. Amazing taste! Thank you Alpine beer co for never disappointing!"
"Gold to light copper with a finger of white surrounding the rim and the vast majority of the top. Excellent clarity. Moderate lacing. I'm really reaching to smell much other than a light piney hop aroma. The taste is very original with a fantastic blend of floral and piney hops. The mouth is sticky, chewy, and I'm left with a light hop burn."
"This beer pours a lovely orange amber color with a nice bright white head that leaves good lacing. Smell is sweet malt, peach, lemon, grapefruit, pine and dankness. Taste is the same. Feel is medium and a little bitter. Overall this is a fantastic IPA, would love to find more."
"On tap at Oak & Oar OKC. Pours a hazy orange with a healthy finger of white head. The aroma is citrus, some tropical and a bit of malt. Taste is similar to the nose. There's some orange and a bit of grapefruit. There's quite a lot of bitterness on the back end. Medium mouth and it's fairly dry. This is a solid IPA."
"A huge wave of tropical fruits, grapefruit, bright orange citrus, sweet mandarins and whole pine cones explode out of the bottle the moment the yoke holding the magnanimous amount of flavors purgatoriously sealed in the glass chamber is released. Notes of peppery earthy notes follow suit, accentuated by some grainy notes from the malt -- there's a nice mellow hint of caramel which kind of ties all the free-roaming secondary characteristics together."
A - Off white head with somewhat of an orange tint. Frothy. 
"A: Orange, amber color with a nice creamy fluffy white head, lots of lacing, not much head retention, cloudy, some carbonation."
On tap at BC's Pizza & Beer 
Original west coast ipa color
"So I walk into my local pub and the barkeep who knows my preferences asks if I want a duet. I haven't had a chance to look at the board listing for 40 taps, but I trust Shane and say ok. Taken by surprise. Resinous with hops is a good description. Exceptional feel with good balance. Wish they would keep it on regular."
"Not an overehelming amount of hops on this one, more of a medicinal flavor with a bit of astringent kick. Most of the bitterness comes on the back end but it is pretty well balanced. Very slick oily mouthfeel, quite resinous."
Pours slightly hazy but nice golden color. Beautiful floral aroma with nice head and creamy lace. Smooth first witch is full of hop flavor but no rough bitterness. A clean crisp back finish. Love this beer and it's been around. Just discovered it. Highly recommend.
"Pours a clear copper orange color w a 2 finger head and nice lacing. Smells fruity w citrus hops. Nice balance of mango, grapefruit and slight malty finish. Smooth. Very tasty and easy drinking."
9/5/15 DE
"Very good, I would seek this out again. It has a malt taste that I have not encountered before. Well done."
"Howler fill at Keyport Liquor in Superior Wisconsin. Nice golden colour finger of head with some sporadic lacing. Loads of citrus, bubble gum, sweet cedar and earthy pine. Same as the nose, loads of bitter citrus rind, earthy cedar and a lingering bitterness. A tasty IPA, solid rendition and super stoked to have had the chance to try it."
"Had this on draft at beer 30 in San Marco. Jax,FL"
A really good IPA! Has a great hoppiness but is really smooth. Reminds me of the Sip of Sunshine.
"This pours with a hazy golden golden body that is topped with a creamy white head that keeps gripping down the glass. Some of the unfiltered IPAs are a bit off-putting, but I seem to like this one. The nose is a wave of fresh hops presented by cut grass and grapefruit. Strong peppery hop flavors rush through the flavor profile with just the right mix of citrus and pine balanced with a sticky sweetness as the beer warms. The feel is lively and right on the style. I'm glad to see Alpine beers in Maryland and can't wait to try more of their offerings."
"Pours a cloudy golden to dark orange color, with a thin white head. There is a lot of carbonation and quite a bit of lacing. The odor is tropical fruits, orange, apricot, lemon, pineapple, grapefruit, floral, slight honey, slightly resin, slightly grassy. The taste is citrus, grapefruit, malty, herbal, pineapple, bread like, slightly herbal, bitter through out."
"Appearance: orange in color with a 1"" head that slowly fades."
Poured from a growler into the SN/DFH IPA glass
"On tap into a pint glass at Wild Tomato in Sister Bay, WI."
Look: Appears crystal golden and transparent. 
Nice and tropical smell and initial flavor but finishes very bitter and lingering. Body is quite thin and watery as well for a 7%.
Perfect balance of citrus and piney hop aroma and flavors. In my top 3 for IPA's fantastic brew
"On tap at Engine 15 in JAX, Florida."
Had yesterday at a beer fest (was on cask). Never had this on cask before and thought it was absolutely fantastic.
"Poured into a pint jar at LD's Beer Run, Jackson, MS"
"On draft at Lost Dog Cafe, Arlington VA. Post Green Flash."
Very close to p erfect. Little sweet and it wasn't to bitter. Smells like fresh hops and tastes like it to. Really soft mouthfeel and nice taste that stays. Really good.
"On tap at Yard House (Oxnard,CA)"
"has the feel of a DIPA but not the punch. hops are a little soft, almost nuanced. just drank a hoppy birthday which as a punch to the face so that could be the reason. will have to see how green flash handles after a few batches as this first out of the gate doesn't live up to the hype."
"An excellent west coast IPA that ""hides"" its ABV content very well - drinks lighter than it is, like a graceful, stealthy Stone beer. Had it on tap at Fire & Hops in Santa Fe, NM. Up there in the top 10% of IPAs available on the market, just didn't have any extra 'character' that made it notable for me. Still a really good beer."
Had this on tap in a 16 at Flying Saucer Austin
"Wow. I mean, wow. Astonishing aroma. Huge flavor. Ruined my palate for any other beer that's not an imperial."
on tap at the Red Cow into a pint glass
4-23
Mostly piney ipa. Well balanced
"WOW! Had this on tap at Avenue Pub in NOLA. Was excited to try some Alpine offerings, but this one took the cake. Probably the best aroma that I have ever noticed on a beer before. I could sniff on that all day. Taste was very smooth and balanced. Piney, slight malt. Loved it!"
"On tap at Petrol in Houston, served in a standard 16 oz. pint glass. I was really excited to finally try an Alpine offering but was let down. The IPA seemed pretty standard to me and did not pack the hop punch that I would have expected from such hype. Will try again when available to confirm my thoughts."
Wasn't bitter enough for an ipa
"Great, well balanced IPA with smooth finish and wonderful aroma and flavor profile. Awesome!"
Maltier than what you expect from a West coast ipa. Still good and balanced.
"Had this on tap at Streetcar Bistro in Portland, OR on June 26. I was a bit disappointed and underwhelmed given all the high ratings. I was super excited to try this, but my opinion may have been affected by the fact that I had this back to back with Hoppy Birthday, which I absolutely loved. Compared to HB or any of a number of the top hop-forward IPAs out there, it comes up short. But standing on its own, it's still a very solid overall offering from Alpine."
"Um, this was a pleasant surprise. LOVED this beer."
A classic malty IPA.
"With all the IPAs available on the market, Duet is a solid offering. Is it mind blowing? No, but it is definitely worth drinking."
Appearance: Crystal clear yellow off white head. Great lacing.
"On tap, poured into a pub glass."
"Finally, Alpine shows up in Cleveland. Been waiting patiently for them."
"22 oz. bomber. No bottled on/enjoy by date. Pouring into a perfect pint glass yields a yellowish, fairly clear beer, with two fingers of foamy head. The nose presents a faint pineapple, barely perceptible pine aroma. Not hops bursting out like I would expect"
Clear amber with one finger of long lasting white head. Very fine bubble lacing.
"On tap at the Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, VT."
Nice carbonation and beautiful look. Incredible citrus nose. Oranges. Big time. Grapefruit a galore on the tongue. Nice malts for an IPA but not too much. The hops are incredible - very smooth almost honey like with an easy citrus back end. Just like a juicy sweet grapefruit - not too bitter. 
Overall this was a pretty good IPA. Not the best one I have ever had. Had a very nice color though. Draft
A solid west coast IPA without the lingering signature of the west coast bitter hops finish.
"This is an awesome IPA. Top 5, easy."
"On tap. Lightly hazy amber, thin sheet halfway down the glass. Smell is floral, citrus peel. Taste: resiny and orange throughout, bit rindy, substantial sugary pale backing, a little stone fruit. Body has heft with fluffy feel into lingering hoppy drying finish. Very nice"
Extremely hoppy. Floral and minty tasting. A little too hoppy to enjoy.
"First taste of the fabled Alpine (I'm on the East Coast). What a delicious, clean tasting IPA. Love the Simcoe/Amarillo hop combination which supplied a slightly greater citrus experience than pine (assuming more Amarillo), and a super-clean, dry finish. Overall outstanding beer, and experience."
Great beer! Nice citrus accent.
A completely solid and very well made ipa. To find something worth complaining about in this beer would be a sure sign of snobbery. I like it a lot . . . Glad it's now available to me. Nothing really exceptional stands out in the taste department that makes me want to buy it every time I see it but it is very well crafted.
Served in a 12oz. goblet at Shakespeare's Pub in Kalamazoo. 
"32 oz growler purchased at Trenton Road Take Out in Levittown, PA."
Had this at the Iron Abbey yesterday.
A - Pours a clear orange with a one-finger creamy white. The head fades fast leaving a light sticky lacing.
"Enjoyed from a growler- tasted a bit like Pliny Light. Beautiful hop presence up front, sort of falls off the table after initial hop bite. Clean and dangerously drinkable."
Delicious but does not match up well against Hoppy Birthday or Nelson
"Sorry, but it is just not all that. Nice, smooth drinking beer. Not much aroma."
This beer is all about the mouth feel and the finish that just keeps going and going think energizer bunny! Just had it on tap at Hopyard in Pleasanton Ca terrific spot and throughly enjoying it! Cheers!
"Refreshingly light but packed (and I mean packed) with hop flavor. Bitterness is there but hides with the malts behind the massive hops flavor and aroma. Fruity, floral, danky, cat pissy goodness. Lots of pineapple and citrus dipped herbs and flowers. Tastes like the sticky hop cones are still floating in the beer. This was shipped to me from across the country, but must be super fresh. I'm a believer in the west coast IPAs and this is no exception. Cant wait to see this stuff in Ohio."
"Phinally in Philly!!! On tap at TRIA Tap Room. A lot smoother than the Hoppy Birthday. Much more balanced and less bitter. A great IPA, but I like hops and high IBU, so I went back to the Hoppy Birthday."
"Yup, Yep. Yum yum bubbles"
"I was wildly underwhelmed by Alpine's first offering to make it on tap to the Pittsburgh area. Don't get me wrong- it was fine and drinkable, but it didn't blow my mind like I wanted it to. I'm going to give this a second shot when it gets a wider east coast release in the fall."
Growler poured into a tulip glass
Tasted draft at Capone's near Philly and then in San Diego (Not even close - you have to have this on the west coast). Best single IPA I've ever tasted. Seriously - Epic.
Big flavored IPA for being so light bodied. Well balanced
Growler fill @ Market District 
Had on tap in Portland. Not my jam at all--malty and abrasive
thanks Tim for sharing this with me -enjoyed from the crowler chilled in an IPA glass.
"maybe an old keg or something, but this was just average"
Poured from 22 oz bomber dated best by 5/12/2016 into snifter. 
"An easy to enjoy and appreciate IPA from Alpine. Pretty dry and bitter on finish, and yes, a bit more tropical fruit in the mouth would be nice, but this is a very solid IPA from the folks at Alpine. Glad to see this on a fairly regular basis around town now (in Eugene and PDX)."
super smooth almost dangerous.. very smooth WC style IPA
"It's good if you like light hops. Those looking for bold hop goodness...this isn't your beer. Very good for what it is, but not a 98 in my book."
A: Pours a clear golden yellow with two fingers of white head that fades into a frothy ring with good lacing.
"Two fingers worth of lush creamy orange creamsicle colored frothy head... Really good retention... The color is a rich warm copper... A moderate bit of carbonation some of which clings to the glass and some of which rises sporadically throughout... An outstanding hop forward nose... Fresh whole cone hops... Floral with a touch of earthiness... Slightly pungent... Minimal malt base... The aroma was a perfect indicator of what was to materialize on the palate... A hop lovers dream... The Simcoe presence is undeniable and delectable... The malt base is subtle but adds a slight it of depth... The mouthfeel is outstanding... Medium bodied... Sleek... Well balanced... Even and consistent... Limited carbonation... Rather sophisticated, especially for the style... I've wanted to try this beer for ages and finally had the opportunity.... It didn't disappoint in any category... Quite the opposite, it exceeded my lofty hopes... Hides the ABV well... Near perfect in all categories... I really wish this one were available with regularity in my area..."
"I typically hate when people like to point out when a beer doesn't live up to the hype, but in this instance I think it's appropriate to say. My first experience with Duet was in trade, and I wondered if it's banality was a freshness issue. However, subsequent FRESH tastings have yielded similar results. "
"I've been on a hop kick, which is not usual for me. In the last month I've been able to land a bunch of rare IPA / DIPA stuff for Upstate New York, and a lot of the standards have been really fresh. This Duet is freakin great for a single IPA. I'm just gonna give you some comparable ales that I've had in the last four weeks in MY rank order. I don't differentiate between single versus imperial ( Pliny at 8% is hardly a giant)"
"This beer is heavenly! Top five ipas I've ever had and possibly the best smelling one yet. Pure melons. Taste is melon, orange rind, tropical fruits and a nice dose of Piney bitterness. It has a dankness to its finish that's just amazing. Top top ipa and a must try for sure.... have recently had the green flash brewed version and it is still very good but not the same beer as the alpine version. Can't change my rating because the first time on had this beer it was life changing."
Only had on tap but truly one of the best IPA's yet. Clean. Crisp. Well balanced. Very well balanced. Great combination of hops and not over powered by malt. My favorite beer at the moment and currently looking for bottles if anyone wants to trade!
"Had Alpine Duet on tap at Croxley's Ales in Smithtown, NY last night and it poured clear gold color with a small off white head that faded kind of quickly for an IPA and left minimal spotty lacing. "
thumbs up all the way up to the sky
"Alpine brews are new to my town, and I was anxious to try them. Of the three I tried at the release party, this was favorite. A quite nice IPA, and one I'll enjoy again."
My lord Alpine is knocking it out of the park with their IPA's .. can't wait to go to San Diego to visit them ..
Served On-Tap
One of my favorite IPAs… This one knocks it out of the park every time!!!!
I was looking forward to having this beer as well as other Alpine Beers on tap while visiting California. Had this beer in Los Angeles and was surprised how much it dissapointed me in the aroma and taste department. The floral and grassy notes were too flowery in a Sauvingon Blanc kind of way and irritatingly grassy. The taste was more astringent than bitter to my palette. I thought that maybe it was a bad keg or wasn't fresh so I had it again at Toronado and it was exactly the same. I guess I'm missing something about this IPA because I'm one of the few that doesn't particularly like it.
"A - copper/amber clear ale like all west coast IPAs, 1 inch white fluffy head with sticky ringed lacing on the glass."
Yay for Green Flash brewing Alpine and getting it out here. Let's jump into it.
"incredible ipa, thanks to falling rock for somehow having these beers on tap! this is just insane, and incredibly highly anticipated by me for years, what a pleasant surprise to happen on these! this was the best of the three in my book, and by a mile, one of the best beers i have had this year, certainly on the hoppy side. paler than the others, but also the only one of the three with any haze to it. holds a half inch of white foam for an entire pint. the nose is great, i sweat i smelled nelson hops in here, but it must be some new expression of amarillo i am not familiar with, because this seems so much more southern hemisphere, tropical, and alive than anything coming from california. maybe some wheat malt in here too for body, it has a just short of creamy texture to it, very soft on the palate, but briskly carbonated as well, just how i like my ipa. the flavor is insane, the hops are awesome, and i could never guess simcoe and amarillo if i was quizzed on it, suggesting i either dont know as much as i give myself credit for knowing, or that this is done with some magic, some technique and process or even quality of ingredient that is entirely new to me, im hopping the latter, but am fine with either, as this beer makes everything seem okay. minimal bitterness to the finish, but there is something weird and uncommon in here too, and that is a crazy sweetness in the middle. sort of confectioners sugary, but almost like coconut in the raw, or even pineapple juice for a second, just a strange sweet that lingers long, but it tastes fantastic, and doesnt hurt this for me in the least, makes it even more distinct frankly. overall a world class ipa without a doubt, and really the only one of the three i had that is worthy of all this hype. hoppy birthday was good, but this one takes the cake (good pun!)"
On tap at the Saratoga City Tavern 3/31/15. As close as perfect as you can get to the West Coast style IPA. I can't wait for this to get regular NY distro.
"Delicious, we'll balanced ipa. One of my all time favorites"
"One of my favorite IPA's- this one show cases all of the classic characteristics of a well-crafted IPA, and is so refreshing that despite the ABV, I would consider this one of my favorite session-ish beers."
Sweet tasting and rather simple. Expectations were not met and I think this beer is overrated.
"Pours a light golden color with white head and lace. Light aroma of west coast hops. Flavor very nice and mellow of citrus, pine and melon. Bitterness is mild, balancing and agreeable. A nice IPA that drinks more like a simple pale."
"Nice medium amber color. Nice mixture of hop notes. Starts grapefruit but ends with a nice lime and citrus note. Light sweet malt taste. Aroma is very good and hoppy with two hop notes. Overall, fantastic IPA."
"A quintacential West Coast IPA. Perfect harmony between pine resin, citrus pith, green dankness, and robust honey malt."
"650ml bottle from the Alpine Pub. Served in a teku glass 3/13/2015. I had originally rated this a 4.00 years ago, but I figured I needed to revisit this beer with a proper review."
Review from Notes. 
"Had this last night on tap as a guest beer at the Amherst Brewing Company. I walked in and ordered it immediately. Awesome beer! Incredibly nuanced, juicy, and flavorful."
"On tap at Sunset Cantina, right across the street from BU."
"Green Flash Version. From the Duets I've had in the past, the hop element did not shine through as much. Plenty of Amarillo (in the nose), light pine (in the nose). Taste, faint pine, almost muted, but heavily bitter. I was a bit taken back by the bitterness on this one. I love bitter, but balanced, I didn't find the balance in this one."
On tap at Gingerman NYC poured into a snifter. 
Amazing IPA. Can't wait for the green flash stores to carry this...
not gonna lie this is a delicious beer great citrusy hops . I may not like how the brewer behaves but this is really tasty
Not bad for IPA not a fan of IPA. Give me a stout or a lager.
"This is easily a 9/10. The aroma is amazing, very west coast IPA. Tropical juiciness hits your pallet at first taste and stays! Crushable for sure. If ever in Western MA go to Moes in Lee, MA."
"This beer pours nicely, and it comes off sweeter, oranger in appearance, and way more floral than Nelson. A good ipa but Nelson reigns supreme over this one."
Pored from a 12 oz bottle into the modified tulip glass.
"A pint glass from Hooley's La Mesa. Restaurant pour, so I had to let it sit a bit. Deep gold with really no head, but I didn't get to control the pour, so... Aroma suggested some floral and maybe tropical, but really only a suggestion. A bit concerning considering Alpine's reputation. Concern gave way to delight upon sipping. The floral exploded, the tropical crept in underneath. A baguette malt (more than biscuit but not bready) balanced this beautifully. Um, this is seriously top 5 IPA. I am a shameless hop head, but this really sets a high bar for standard IPA (not DIPA or IIPA)."
Growler. consumed from a spiegelau ipa glass within 1 hr of pour. 
Bitter not smooth not a top 25 IPA
"A: clear, very little head, khaki large bubbles. golden amber in color."
"We knock the top off of a bomber, pouring equally into our Great Lakes pint glasses. It shows up a shiny sunflower yellow coloring, and holds a slowly-dissipating one and a half finger tall head the color of eggshells. Lacing is chunky, spreading out in a honeycomb pattern. No haze or sediment is noted, and carbonation appears to be immensely active. The first thing to hit you in the nose, and it hits hard, is the big evergreen pine quality of the Simcoe hops. Fruity citrics of the Amarillos seep through some cracks as it warms, blending with notes of pale, pilsner, and softer amber grain, biscuity sweetness of raw barley, honey sugars, tonic water, strawberry jam, spiced booziness, plastic wrap, pear fruitiness, tangerine peel zestiness, mild bubblegum juiciness, papier-mâché glue, milk thistle, coiny yeastiness, pickle brine, and fruity herbal and chamomile tea leaves. As advertised, you taste a big west-coast IPA, comprised of bitterly sticky and sappy piney hoppiness, dried pine cones, green acorns, softer balancing hoppiness of citrics and dryer herbals, ethanol bite, lactic acidity, pale and pils grain, astringent detergent soapiness, mineral and clay water, toasted pumpkin seeds, black pepper, mossy musk, and gentle but syrupy fruitiness of pineapple. The aftertaste retains this bitterness for a while, blending dusty biscuity grain with lingering, stalking piney hop bitters. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium to high. Each sip gives nice slurp and smack, with lighter cream and froth. The mouth is left seriously dried of tannins, with a bit of an accompanying puck. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks seriously, and it drinks well."
"Poured a cloudy orange body with two finger head and left lace patches down the glass. Citric, herbal hop aroma with some sweet malts in the aroma and the beer's taste profile is the same as a light, clean body that has citric, earthy hops that balance with sweet notes (malts and possible sweet fruit flavors) for a mild but very enjoyable IPA that hides the ABV."
dont trade for it. if u live on the east coast. just grab a lunch
on draft in a tulip glass
"On tap at The Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY."
"On tap. Another long awaited ""Want"" cut into the bedpost. Pours a slightly hazy, dark orange color with a soft head. Mild lacing. Aroma is deep and resiny. West Coast all up in this nose. Amarill and Simcoe pull zero punches. Pine, grass, grapefruit, and some other fruit/hop elements. Malt? We don't need no malt here. The flavor hits my tongue and detonates. Heavy bursts of that pine and fruit I found in the nose. Earth hops. Some tropical fruits as well. A barely-noticeable sweet and neutral malt cloak. This feels and tastes like a big Double IPA. 7% feels and tastes like 10% but without the added alcohol. A West Coast uppercut of bitterness floors my palate. Lingering, long, formiddable bitterness. Has a fuller body. Is beer was quite a good time. Alpine in Massachusetts is a good thing for this dude."
Gold to amber color. Clear. Good ring lace. Little head. 
By far the worst Alpine beer that I've tried.
"Average. Unlike their other offerings, this one leaves a lot to be desired. The hops don't jump out like the other beers."
Definitely glad to have this on the East Coast
Somehow not as flavorful as Hoppy Birthday which was the winner for me
"22oz bottle poured into tulip at #bottlecherwednesdays with Vito at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Crazy tall off-white head head, on a clear golden beer. Aroma is as advertised: grapefruit, mango, pineapple goodness from the hops plus a little caramel malt hint. Taste is in line with the smell with some earthy tones and nice bready underpinnings. High carbonation, medium bodied, thin texture, dry bitter finish."
"Pours a bubbly dark gold. Tropical, dank aroma of tangerine, lime, and even pineapple. Taste is spot on. I normally like Simcoe but find it a bit too heavy by itself, whereas Amarillo is not my preferred hop -- but they pull them both together, in harmony, with the optimal amount of malt. Feels a little light...then again, that could make it easy to down a couple of these."
"Very drinkable, well balanced, suoer smooth. Follows the classic west coast IPA mold but does it uncommonly well."
"Pours clear light gold with a thin white head. Not many bubbles or lacing. Smell is mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. Taste follows the nose. Bright fruity notes with some pine and just the right amount of bitterness. Maybe a little oniony too. Sweet malts complement the fruity hops really well. Really clean finish. Mouthfeel is spot on. Really easy drinking and super low IBU for an IPA. Overall one of my favorites, edged out just a bit by Nelson. Just a really great, clean IPA."
"Nice balanced IPA, but nothing outstanding here."
Exceptional beer! Sipping it straight out of my growler! Wow... Today is going to be a good day!
"Bottle from Steve, thank you very much!"
Really good. I just had this after pure hoppiness. I like pure hoppiness better. i also like blind pig better.
"Clear amber, laced white foam. Effervescent grapefruit, passion fruit, a little guava. Lighter body but burst of fruit. Very refreshing"
High expectations of Alpine again. A solid beer but I don't get the hype.
"A nice IPA, a little too malty for me, and overall not especially exciting... Not even close to the magnitude of Nelson!"
"Thanks to BungleTrpg for including as an extra in a recent trade. I have only had Nelson, previously, from Alpine. Psyched to try Duet as Simcoe and Amarillo are two of my favorite hops to use in homebrewing (disclosure: I'm a terrible home brewer). "
Very good IPA a smooth pour with bitter hop aroma. Solid drinking and pretty good finish.
"Originally reviewed on Jan. 5, 2013"
Bomber into an IPA glass at fridge temp. I've attempted to put the hype out of my head.

A: Crystal clear light orange in appearance 
On tap into pint glass.
"Long on the malt, balanced on the hop. A good palate cleanser. Not a staple."
"This is my 1000th beer. Had it on tap at Coin Op in San Diego. Nice and hoppy, but not overly. Good bitterness. Really balanced with the hops. Great hop nose. Glad this was my 1000th check in. Alpine is one of the best small breweries out there."
Very good IPA that falls just short of being amazing. Great representation of the style.
"Light herbs and floral hops on the nose I sense a bit of chives, tangerines, caramel, grapefruit, watermelon and bitter lemon rinds. The front is floral with an herbaceous hops. The middle palate is caramel before it ends with a grapefruit bitterness and resiny pine. The feel is almost sessionable as it holds almost no astringency."
"Poured into a nonic pint glass, the beer produces a creamy, foamy white head. A golden body with blonde hues radiates below with an occasional gas bubble. This beer has good clarity. 4.25"
First time rating this beer after drinking it since it's release. A trendsetter and a beer others attempt to emulate.
Delicious!
"A: Pours more of a gold color but when resting in the glass it is gold with a slight orange hue, leaves a frothy head that takes awhile to vanish, leaves some nice lacing on the glass as well "
"Poured this 22 oz, undated bottle into a Spiegelau glass. The body was crystal clear and copper in color. The head was white and foamy, it left speckles of lace."
"just an incredible beer. Perfection and balance define the palate. Has the right amount of hops, right amount of malt, and it has a silky smooth drink down the palate. There's a bit on the front palate and the concentration of flavor is so appealing and long Not sure what else you can ask from a west coast IPA."
"Bright sun yellow with a slight orange hue about it, an inviting IPA for sure."

A- deep golden with a slight haze. 1 finger white head that settles in quickly. Great legs on the lacing.
Received this one from BA mohaghandi as an extra in a recent trade. Enjoyed out of a 22 oz brown bomber with no dating that I can find on the bottle to indicate when it was bottled or by when it should be enjoyed. Poured into the Speigelau IPA-specific glass.
Growler. Pours a clear copper with a one finger white head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. Aroma is dank with a bit of pine as well as a hint of orange and some caramel. The taste is dry and dank. There's a bit of pine as well as a hint of grapefruit and some caramel. The finish is dry with quite a bit of bitterness. Medium body. Medium-low carbonation.
"A: 4.5 Clear, golden yellow with a pretty large, off white head"
"Mmmmm this is one tasty, clean IPA. Good combination of floral and citrus goodness with a hint of dank Hoppyness. "
"Tried this at the bottle share that sprung up at the Swamp Head Bottle Drop. Pours light yellowish gold with a fluffy white head on top. Aroma of huge pineapple, grapefruit, other citrus notes, lemon peel, sweet honey from the malts. Awesome. The flavor is even better. Huge pineapple sweetness up front followed by bitter pine and grapefruit, some grass, and big lingering citrus notes throughout the palate. Super light bodied, easy going, and medium plus carbonation. I wish I could have this every day."
Served on-tap at Ale Arsenal in a DFH IPA glass. 
"A - clear golden-amber with 2"" of thick white head. Leaves 1/4inch and sticky lacing. "
A - crystal clear middle amber that pours with a frothy 1.5 finger head. Bubbles float up throughout the glass and maintain a thin white film. Perfect looking IPA.

A BIG thank you to Rish in Californa for this beast of a beer.
Poured 22oz bottle in New Belgium globe
Thanks to Orthodoxkardia for this one.
"Appearance - Pours a golden orange with a slight and I mean slight haze. About a half inch off-white, fluffy head sat atop the beer."
"In true ""west-coast"" style, Alpine's duet claims a true taste of the vernacular with a dry caramel backbone that's completely dominated by grassy and fruity bitterness."
My thanks to my amazing friend JohnParadee for this bottle.
"Bottle in a trade with saru96. This is my first Alpine beer, and I've been anticipating this day for some time. Since this isn't a high-gravity beer, I think I'll drink this solo. Get it? Cause Duet... Here we go. Poured from bomber into a standard snifter."

Believe the hype! This mutha is fo RE-al.
"Full, four-finger head on top of clear orange brew. Head has great retention and lacing, decent legs too. "
"The color is a golden California sunset. Extraordinary nose: All sticky weed, grapefruit and a strange, almost Brett-like, hint of eraser. The lightest and most delicate IPA I've ever had. It's utterly refreshing and shockingly not the least bit bitter. This beer is in a whole other realm from your typical swill IPA that dominates American shelves. It's smooth and sophisticated where others are uncouth, bitter bores. Imagine grapefruit without a hint of bitterness; a fresh, warm loaf of sourdough just out of the oven and a fragrant lemon orchard in a glass. Phenomenal."
"Pours a clear bright gold. Nice bubbly head. Smell is amazing. Vibrant tropical fruit. Lots of citrus, all hops. Great. The taste is fruity, only slightly bitter. Grapefruit, citrus, bitter rind. Their is a lemon flavor that is dominating the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, decent carbonation. This is a very juicy ipa, with a lot of lemon flavor. Very nice and smooth."
"The beer comes in a very familiar IPA color. Golden orange, a bit hazy, a small white head with a good amount of lacing."
Received Duet and Nelson recently and after trying both I was very impressed with Duet. Quickly became one of my favorite beers and has been seeking out more already. Appearance is a lighter golden clean beer. Smell was very fruity and citrusy. Little bits of mango and pineapple come through as well as some grapefruit but the big smell is orange. Taste was similar to the smell. Lots of orange citrus flavor shines. Tasted like someone dropped an orange in my glass. Mouthfeel was smooth and perfectly carbonated. Very good drinkable beer that had me asking for another bomber.
Thanks to MaltMilkshake for the bottle. 22oz. bomber poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass.
MANY thanks to TasterMike for this one! 22 oz bottle into a pint glass.
Thanks to eyebereej for this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from bomber into a Russian River pint glass.
"What an outstanding IPA and beer in general. The hoppy bitterness is elegant rather than harsh. It pours a bright golden orange. Smells a lot like citrus, a little fruity almost, and like some grade A hop goodness."
22 oz bomber poured into a Speigelau tulip
Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. 
"22oz courtesy of peteinSD. Then many other tap pints. Pours a clear light amber/orange with a super rocky, tan head that leaves lacing all over the place. Aroma is outstanding: dank West coast IPA with butterscotch, pineapple, orange juice, orange blossom, mango, lavender/hibiscus. Lots of floral hops. Taste is nicely balanced: super bitterness in the back of the tongue is put in check by butter and tropical fruits up front. Almost soapy, flower pedal, piney/sappy hops all over the place with lots of caramel and butterscotch to balance. This is world-class IPA without a doubt. One of my favorites. When it is fresh, it is unbeatable."
Beer pours clear amber with not a lot of head. The color would allude to a good amount of maltiness. Very nice. 
Really? One of the premier IPA brewers in the country and no bottle date? Mega-fail. This is somewhat fresh as far as I know.
Beautiful light golden and coppery ale that looks perfectly alive with carbonation. One finger head of smooth white foam that fades relatively quickly.
"I have drunk a lot of IPA's and even had Pliny the Elder which is considered a top of the line IPA. This IPA was among the best I've ever had; I can honestly say it may be the best. I was traveling in CA and stopped at Stearn's Liquor mart and picked up a bottle of this. This is one of the smoothest IPA's I've ever had, yet bitter and a outstanding IPA... if you ever get a chance to get a hold of this IPA I'd advise you to buy it. Only issue with it is that I live in Kentucky and this stuff is made in CA... I need to find a way to get a hold of this stuff here locally."
Bottle thanks to ScottO! 
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Founders pint glass. Got it at the brewery, not more than a week old."
"After enjoying Alpine's Nelson so much, I was overjoyed to be able to finally try this one. It pours a hazy orange color with some goldenrod highlights around the shimmering edges. The cloudy, white head settles nicely and sits on top of the brew looking chunky and fat, leaving behind some good clumps of lacing on the glass. Very nice unfiltered look; great for an IPA."
"650ml bottle 7,0% Abv. "
"A - pours a cloudy light gold straw color with a nice finger of near white head, good lacing and retention"
"Got in a trade with TopsecretWaffle. 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but should be very fresh. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, mango, pineapple, passion fruit, peach, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, honey, bread, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with big tropical/citrus hop complexity with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of lemon zest, tangerine, orange zest, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, floral, grass, honey, bread, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, mango, pineapple, peach, floral, honey, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of citrus/tropical hops; with a good malt balance that doesn’t overpower the hops; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic IPA! Tons of big hop complexity and a moderate malt balance; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
"a beautiful golden/copper pour with 3 fingers of bright white fluffy head giving off ridiculous amounts of lacing while slowly dissipating.. lots of visible carbonation. a really pretty looking beer. the aroma of hops is blowing my mind right now. from a foot or so away i get a huge hit of simcoe, the closer to the nose it gets, i get a nice piney/grapefruity scent.. lots of sweetness/caramel. the flavor is simcoe up front, totally. the second i put the glass down after the first sip, i start tasting sweet malt and start getting floral hop notes and light refreshing grapefruit like citrus. a very nice refreshing ipa and quite honestly very mellow on bitterness for the aromatic hop bomb it is! a lovely beer all around, really happy i got to taste some alpine brews finally. the mouthfeel on this is MADE for summer. highly carbonated, medium body.. refreshing, but not lacking on flavor one bit. this is a damn great ipa."

Thanks to KWMiles for the bottle. 
Poured from bomber into glass. Purchased direct from the brewery about 2 weeks prior to opening bottle. 
"A: Beautiful hazy, golden-yellow with a big fizzy, frothy, bright white head. Good lace and retention."
"Thanks to Thecherryman for making this Alpine bomber a reality, and a super fresh sample at that. Distribution is limited on Alpine, so getting a hold of these despite the 2012 increase in production is a chore unless you live in Southern Cali."

A-golden amber color with a nice white head and decent lacing
Big thanks to BeerThirty for the bottle. My first beer from Alpine. Tasted 20 March 2013.
Pours a medium amber color with a decent sized frothy white head.
"This beer poured out as a nice golden color with a massive foamy white head on top. There is a bunch of floating particles in this as well. The smell of the beer has a big hoppy fruit aroma. Some sweet pineapple and peach aromas make this beer really nice. The taste of the beer has a slight pine flavor with more fruit flavors like peach and grapefruit. The mouthfeel is smooth, nicely balanced and gently carbonated. Overall this is a very good IPA. Really enjoyed this."
"Appearance- A nice golden, orange color"
"Another nice IPA offering from Alpine, but I'm not 100% sold on this one. At first look and sniff, I thought Duet would be my runaway favorite. It poured beautifully, had a nice color and head, wonderful floral and citrus aromas; unfortunately though, I didn't find it exceptionally balanced, and the resiny finish lingered on my tongue for longer than I prefer."
Huge thanks to queens1130 for including this in along with my last box of Bruery RS stuff!

"Pours a caramel colour, transparent, with a beige head. Nice lace! Aroma of tropical fruits, floral hops, and a backing malt background, sweet and caramel-y. Medium to high bittering, sweet fruits, flowers, and hints of pine resins, in front of a sweet rich malt background, equally as alluring. It's full bodied, somewhat rich and creamy. "
Glowing orange-gold and hazy body with a dense white contrasting head. Lacing is minimal. 
"Pours translucent honey-golden orange with minimal head that dissipates rapidly. Nose is full of hoppy fruitiness - grapefruit, peach, etc. I want a car air freshener with this scent. Flavor is spot on in terms of the nose. The citrus elements yield to a floral pinkness which is lovely. Little bit of alcohol on the back end which helps to keep the sweetness down. Not an off flavor to be found. Only nitpicking issue found which keeps this from being a perfect IPA is in the mouthfeel - perhaps a bit on the light side. Overall a fantastic West Coast IPA that vies for archetypal status in regards to this style."
Pours a very clear class golden color with a quickly evaporating white head. Grapefruit nose that draws you in like a Siren. MF is wet and full and accentuates the overall experience of the beer. Grapefruit citrus yields to pine in the flavors that get balanced nearly perfectly by the grain. This is a stupendous IPA.
Thanks to Chuglife for this one. 
A - Pours a clear golden brown with a bit of orange and one finger of white head. Nice lacing and pretty good head persistence. 
Having this right after my Nelson. Again ehammond1 is the fucking man and anytime you see him give him a highfive for me please.

"Served on-tap at Downtown Johnny Brown's (San Diego, CA) in a Shaker pint. Reviewed from notes."
Appearance – Pours a clear golden orange color with a nice head and medium lacing.
"Poured an orangeish gold color with metallic shine in the light. Good amount of head and great clarity. Decent lacing, but nothing spectacular. Aroma is resnious and piney. Lots of grapefruit - very acidic and citrusy. Hinting towards a thick mouthfeel, Double IPA style. Malt is lacking, or hidden. I get more of a true pale malt backbone instead of an IPA. Nearly sweet, but bitter definitely comes through right away in the taste. A bit grassy, but mostly nectar flowery flavor. Some orange citrus fades to the hop flavor. The hop bitterness takes over but is mild. Balanced feel, maybe a little on the watery side. Dry finish."
"Pours a clear dandelion color with a tight, white head that leaves chunks of lacing."
"A: Clear golden yellowish brown color with 2 finger fluffy head, lots of lacing. "

Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass.
Aggressive pour into pint glass yields 1/3 finger white head with good retention. More head though please. Crystal clear and golden. Pretty. On the very light side of IPAs. Minus points for that.
"Pours with almost no head on top of a golden clear body. Aroma is really fruity, pineapple, citrus, grapefruit, mango. A bit sweet, but fruity sweet not caramel sweet. Lots of citrus, tropics, similarly sweet to the aroma. Nice bitterness that balances a bit of the fruityness and sweetness. The mouthfeel is nice. Unremarkable. Ok carbonation. Pretty nice beer."
"Little less than an inch fall white head. Body is a bright light orange, very clear. Lots of effervescence. Good lacing."
"22 oz bomber purchased at the brewery April 6 (yes it was a very Good Friday!) pours a clear medium amber with decent head and lacing. Aroma is thick resin grapefruit, pineapple, and bready malt. Taste is a nice subtle blend of all sorts of fruits - grapefruit, peaches, apples, lemons, etc nicely balanced by the malt. Mouthfeel is fairly light carbonation which is a good thing considering the flavor subtleties, with dry finish. Overall is high quality IPA from a high quality brewery."
Pours stunningly clear copper hue. Very small half finger of white head from a smooth pour. Tiny wisps of lacing on the glass with below average retention for the style.

Reviewing the Duet IPA from Alpine Beer Company. Alpine and Kern are quickly emerging as Russian River's biggest threat to steal their crown as the top producer of west coast IPA's.
Bottle: Poured a light amber color ale with a super large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of pure lupuline with floral notes of citrus and grapefruit. Taste is also dominated by some of the most delicate floral hops aromas I have encountered with fresh citrus notes. Malt base is dry and although discernable doesn’t take away any attention from the hops profile. Body is about average with good carbonation. Those guys are probably my favorite IPA brewers.
"From my haul last week at Alpine. Super fresh having just been bottled. Pours a beautiful yellow orange with a nice one inch thick pale white thick head that clings to my glass leaving intricate lacing as I sip down. The nose is a tropical fruit salad in a glass, mango and pineapple and lemon lead the way before being chased down by the super intensity of the Simcoe and Amarillo hop explosion, just amazing nose. Flavors of tangerine, mango, grapefruit and lemon peel attack the tongue with a balancing act from the malt to deliver an amazingly balanced brew. The mouth is crisp, refreshing and lively from the perfect carbonation, it begs to be gulped, but don't, nurturing this brew brings out a plethora of Flavors and complexities for those who sip. I am an unabashed Alpine head and am in San Diego on a weekly basis on business so I am fortunate to drop in for lunch and refills and get to try a lot of Alpine beer. This along with Nelson, Pure Hoppiness and Exponential Hoppiness are world class ales that I hope all BA folks get a chance to drink at least once."
Thanks to breaks808 for the hook-up.

"Picked up a 650-mL bottle at the brewery and drank a week or so later, 8/22/11, from a tulip glass."
"I was lucky enough to get this in this years secret santa. I poured from a bomber into a SA perfect pint glass, deep orange pour with a very big white head, some lacing. Lots of fresh pine and citrus on the nose. The beer is piney and has notes of grapefruit, and tropical fruit. It finishes with a light lingering bitterness. The body is medium, above average carbonation. A very good IPA, lived up to the hype."
A: Pours a very nice golden orange
Acquired from mthomas84 via SS '11 so a big THANK YOU goes out to him! This puppy has been on my wants for over a year. 
"Big fan of Pure Hoppiness here and I just realized that I've never opened the bottle of Duet that I got in a trade. Well, can't waste any more time as I have a homebrew that needs bottles."
Poured this into a stemless wine glass.
Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass.
"Pours a deep golden color with decent head and lace. Nose is grapefruity grapefruit with grapefruit on top of a touch of tropical fruits and a touch of malty goodness. Taste is harmony for sure. Great showcase of two lovely hops. Bitter grapefruit is the lead role, and it reminds me how amazing it is that these flavors come from hops and barley. Doesn't seem out of balance. Medium light body that finishes a little oily. Looks like a lot of other reviewers find it thin, but I think it is quite nice. Very very nice ipa from alpine."

Excited to try this Alpine IPA which touts its combination of my two favorite hops: Simcoe and Amarillo.
Updated on 10/21/15 with the Green Flash version of Duet (Alpine version listed below with original rating numbers).
"Duet pours a really nice clean copper color, very golden, hues of light amber and orange with a small, finger high white soapy head on top. The head has moderate retention but leaves behind great lacing. The aroma is very potent, lots of tropical fruit with a zest citrus backbone of grapefruit and lemon, sticky pine with some faint cereal grain, the hops are in full force and balanced quite well. The flavors really bring it all together, grapefruit, lemon, lots of tropical fruits like pineapple and mango, really nice juiciness. A big burst of bitter, sticky pine and earthy resinous hops come through behind the bright fruit flavors than trail off with some light malt sweetness at the finish. The body is great, very juicy, big and thick, coats the mouth well with a very dry finish."

"Bomber sent to me from HeavyTaste, my first Alpine beer."
"Thanks again jimmy2282, the Surly will be coming soon."
Bomber poured into my Hitachino Nest glass.
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber with two fluffy fingers of white head that left a nice sticky lacing. Nose is full of tropical and citrus scented hops - pineapple, grapefruit and orange. Moderate bitterness with tons of sweet, citrus, almost dank hop flavor. A light, sweet cracker type flavor comes through from the malt when you look for it. It really is all about the hops though, as the dominate the beginning, middle and end of each sip in a supremely pleasant way. No major ups and downs, just a nice solid bitterness and strong hop flavor all throughout. A low to moderate carbonation complements a slightly less than medium body with a nice sticky, dry finish. This beer drinks incredibly easily. If I lived closer this one would be a staple in the fridge. Thanks Dane!"
"Picked up a bomber from Perry's in Livermore, CA. I pour into a large snifter to review."
On tap at O'Brien's. Pint glass.
Poured this beautiful pale amber IPA into my trusty New Belgium globe. Only about a finger worth of head that dissapated rather quickly.
Have had this many times on tap and in bottle. Review is from a bottle.
"Received in NOOB BIF 5 from ExplosivoSR...thank you, sir. Really enjoyed this beer...I am just getting into exploring the world of IPA/DIPAs and was excited to try one from a west coast brewery that I had not heard of (beer and brewery). "
"Pours an almost-clear golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is OUTSTANDING! Lovely tropical and piney hop notes with some nice citrus hints. The hoppiness in the nose is just so distinct with a hint of burnt malt. Taste just explodes with clean and fresh hop flavors with a solid malt backbone. Not enough to make this any short of an amazing west-coast style IPA, but just enough to know it's there. The tropical fruits really come out in the Simcoe and Amarillo hops used. Finishes with bittering hops and melon flavors. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied...creamy yet refreshing. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is awesome. Very tasty and drinkable with no detection of 7% ABV. Alpine just knows how to make IPAs, that's all there is to it."
A - Pours a fairly clear copper-orange color with a finger plus of frothy off-white head. The head fades down slowly leaving behind some nice lacing in the process.

"The last one: that’s right, this is the last beer I got from my first long-distance trade. And believe me, this double-hopped IPA has been staring me in the face every time I’ve opened the fridge since the package arrived. I finally cracked, and now it’s the end for my first bit of loot from California; maybe I kept one in the fridge just to keep the memory alive, but I just can’t wait any longer. It’s time for some hoppy love from the boys out of Alpine."

Pours a hazy golden orange with some nice white head. Looks fairly solid for an ipa. Smells buttery... There is something off about this beer. The smell isnt horrible but there is something truly weird going on here .the buttery smells carry through onto the palette. Tastes buttery with some hops as well. I can see where the hop profile would be pretty desireably if not for the weird buttery flavors overwhelming everything. The mouthfeel is solid but the off-flavors make it not very drinkable

"From notes taken on my trip to Alpine in late May, 2011. 4.5 oz. pour from a flight of four."
"Nice looking beer, golden copper color but poor head retention. Slight clinging lace, but it's spotty at best. Aroma is a familiar Amarillo simcoe blend. Flowery and fruity, grapefruit, some pineapple, citrus very nice and refreshing, it just doesn't blast you with aroma though. Very fruity ipa. Flavor balances bitter and malty. Nice flavorful hop blast right off the bat, juicy, fruity in the middle and then a wave of buttering hops. Clean yeast profile. Nice weight on the palate. I'll be trading for this again."

Bomber into a wine glass; sampled at DLD '11 - thanks to the provider.
Have enjoyed this brew many a time at great establishments like O'Briens and PizzaPort. It is nice to finally track down some bottles and give it a review.
A- Soft pour produced a large 2-1/2 finger head that after a while receded to a 1-1/2 finger head that stayed around almost the whole time. Nice frothy off white head. Beer is a hazy golden-yellow in color. 
Pours a gold c-thru color. It looks super refreshing. It has a very thick white head that's sits on top.

Appearance: This beers pours a beautiful golden color with a slight bit of haze. The head is bright white that quickly dissipates.
"Been wanting to try some Alpine IPA's for a while, thanks to NorcalGrowler for hooking this up. I wasn't totally sold on Nelson, so let's see about this one. "
"Pours a dark golden color with a big cap of white head. Clear and clean and great looking. Big pine, orange and grapefruit in the nose with a touch of malt sweetness. Yum. In perfect harmony, the pine hops and the citrus come together with a touch of malt sweetness for balance. Really good hop flavor exceeds the actual hoppiness of the beer, making it almost a hybrid between an IPA and a DIPA. Definitely one of my favorite IPAs. Good carbonation and a medium-heavy body for the style (again, it's almost a DIPA). Overall, this is a great beer that I think is a must try for anyone who likes hoppy beers. Try Pliny/Blind Pig for the perfection of balace and hop flavor, but try a beer like Duet to see some of the other things that can be done with hops."

A: It pours a beautiful golden color with really good clarity. There is a hint of amber when held up to the light. A strong pour into a tulip yielded a strong two finger head with ample retention. The lacing was just as impressive coating the sides of the glass in sticky foam.

"I must say that I opened this bomber with great anticipation. I'm lucky enough to live near a bottle shop that carries this beer, but even then securing one isn't exactly easy. "
"With a solid pour you get about a finger of just off white foam, majority medium to larger bubbles with below average retention, runs down to the surface quickly, the lacing sticks in random splotches more than streaks. The liquid has a zinc orange metallic look to it, much closer to yellow than any red, no cloudiness, a few trace bubbles here or there, consistent down to the glass bottom. Hop-driven nose of pretzel dough, salt, pine cone, herbaceous matter and earth, gets right up in there and starts scrubbing, plenty of brawn in the grapefruit to blood orange scents too, not a lot of fruit, mixed white pit fruit, thin dusting of cocoa powder accounts for the presence of malts. Close to full-bodied with a noticeably firm mouth feel, the carbonation has the grit of semi-fine sandpaper, persistent from mouth entry through finish. The tangy white grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus zings your tongue alongside the pine, iron flecks, pepper and salt bits. Were the total experience more “wet” the peach, nectarine, apple fruit might appear more tropical. Cocoa, mocha accents dry themselves, offers some yeast to multigrain bread dough. About as “chewy” as a regular IPA can get, not really an easy sipper but deserves attention for achieving personality."

"Thanks to walows for the extra! Poured from bomber (no date stamp) into a dimpled mug. Pours a bright orange color along with a nice creamy head that quickly dissipates, good lacing that lasts throughout the session. Moderate malt and hop aromas of light bread and caramel, flowers, spruce, grapefruit, orange, light yeast, and perhaps a background note of sour milk on the last pour. Flavor starts lightly sweet and moderately acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and lightly to moderately bitter. Palate is medium, oily with a lively carbonation and lightly astringent and dry finish. The combination of the two hops (Simcoe and Amarillo) bring out some excellent aromas that give Duet a great name! This went very well with my sausage and mushroom pizza."

A- Clear dark gold with a fluffy white head that lasts leaving moderate lacing.
"Pours a clear light yellow color with an immense 4 inch head that settles into a plateau of foam. I had to pour this beer and wait for the head to settle a few times before I got a decent glass. Thick globs of lattice lacing all over the glass on the drink down. Smells of fresh citrus zest, tropical fruit, sweet malt. Tastes of citrus zest, tropical fruits, sweet malt, and a slight touch of honey. Mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. Good carbonation on this beer. A bit coating in the mouth. Overall, a very good IPA and a solid offering from Alpine."

The hops are nice and subtle. but on the finish there is a citrusy bite with lots of grapefruit. The hops here do not overpower the beer and the balance with the malt is really nice to make this an incredibly approachable and drinkable IPA. "

The taste hints of pineapple and coconut with a bitter backbone of grapefruit and orange rindw, well balanced by mildly sweet malts. The fruit is quickly swept away by a refreshing bitterness that lingers nicely. A wonderful example of an IPA that is a notch below my all time favorite sculpin. A must try and if i could get more i would drink it often. Purchased at citybeer in SF."

Thanks to Tieman for this bottle. Haven't had an Alpine in almost a year.
I enjoyed my first Alpine Duet with a buddy from out of town that's also on this BeerQuest to drink BeerAdvocate's Top100 US Beers from this past August. I know... good luck.
This beer pours a golden color with a white head that had medium level retention and left some lacing. There is a big grapefruit hop explosion off the nose and the hops explode in your mouth as well. It's got lost of hops but is quite sweet with some piney bitter finish. Good carbonation in a medium bodied beer that is really easy to get down. I would like some more of this.
Enjoyed with some friends before the holiday break and it went like this...
Aroma:Smells amazing. Tons of grapefruit and sweet cotton candy in the aroma. There is peaches and nectarines in there as well.

"Pours a crystal orange amber with a large, pillowy and firm pure white head. "
"A solid pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces almost a two-finger thick, pale tan colored head that leaves quite a bit of lacing on the sides of my glass as I slowly work my way through this beer. The beer is a murky, copper tinged, amber color that shows a fairly hazed (though I can see the lettering on the other side of my glass if I hold it up just right) pale amber tinged, copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells nicely dank smelling; it is quite thick with hop aromatics that leans towards hemp oil, a slight garlic-chive note and cheesy pine needles that are all backed by a bright fruit notes of lychee and tangelo zest. The herbal character is definitely dominant, with the fruit playing a supporting role and nothing of the malt being noticeable at this point. If you really dig into the aroma the hops take on a woody and pepper like character; and the woody character really seems to be accentuated as the beer warms up. Really though this just reminds me of sticking my head into a bag of fresh ""hemp"" buds."
So another instant favorite from Alpine!
Got this one in a trade with Mulder1010. Thanks man!

"Thanks to grilledsquid for this bomber, poured into a tulip."
"Hazy peach orange body with a large white head appears a beautifully with layers of lacing between sips. Aroma is heavy on the grapefruit and leafy earth and floral aspects, a fruity zesty grapefruit tone with hints of rolling malts. Flavor of duet highlights Amarillo and Simcoe hops battling it out, juicy malt sweetness adds on a nice flavor mix with the super hoppy West Coast IPA tones. Grapefruit, herbal mint, floral tones on the palate. only on the west coast good a grop of people adjust to hoppy delicious beer like this. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, slick hop oils caue this to guide across the palate, medium bodied soft even carbonation. Drinkability overall is rock solid another awesome west coast experience as far as IPAs go, these malts blend nicely a touch of knowing diacetyl actually works once in awhile it doesn't taste bad at all in this case."
Received as an extra in a trade. Thanks Chris!
"Bottle, thanks Craig. Pours a medium orange with a fluffy white head. Nose is floral, bright, and juicy. Hopes express themselves as pine with light light citrus elements. Bright and expressive mouth, more tropical fruits than citrus, light pine needles, floral. Nose is amazing on this. Soft. Not highly bitter, which I like, with some nice sugar interplay there. White grapefruit that doesn't become abrasive at all, mangoes, wonderful combination there. This is a pretty elite IPA, but if I must nitpick there's an odd discordant flavor that hangs around on the back palate, as an odd bitterness. Very nice stuff."

"Thanks got to Grant for obtaining this growler. Thanks! I really enjoyed this one! I generally really like Alpine's brews, and this one is no exception, in fact I thought this was fantastic. Pours a dark golden with a medium head that is pure white and leaves some great lacing. Not bad from a growler. The smell is a clean burst of pine- like walking into a pine forest after a spring rain. There is just enough clean, sweet, honeyed malt to balance the beautiful pine aromas. Perfect for me in the flavor department. Beautifully balanced with a blast of sweet pine and a hint of citrus. The mouthfeel is clean, sweet, and slightly spicy. Classic beer, really, really drinkable- I could drink these all night. Wonderful! I also really like the way that Alpine's IPAs and doubles each display a different hop note/mix- they don't at all taste the same. Great brewery!"

"Picked this up at Lone Hill in Glendora?? or east of LA. This is a great beer, not to be a rude rude in any way but this is a simple IPA, but very well made. These guys have the over the top DIPA's, but it's great when they can bring it back to the basics and make a solid West Coast IPA that you can drink for days. This may be one of the most balanced IPA's i've had in the last few years, nothing over the tops on hops, nothing to boozy at 6+%. very highly recommended."
Picked up a few bombers today and had to drink them almost instantly. Poured a hazy amber and copper hue into my Duvel tulip. Finger tall white head had some very nice hang time and left some clingy lacing.
Thanks again to Crazeguy for sending me this great beer! One of my new favorite single IPA's!! 
Had this on tap at Downtown Johnny Brown's in San Diego. 
"Huge hop aroma, powerful bitterness."
"Great beer, good amber to orange appearance, small head, small lacing. Pungent tropical citrus aroma with some desert pine thrown in."
Huge thanks to my resident drinking buddy beerFMAndy for bringing this one back from Cali. 
Very nice looking pour mainly because of the thick pillowy white head of 3 fingers. Nice retention with thick retention. Clear orangish gold obviously filtered.
"Part of a blind tasting involving Pure Hoppiness, Nelson, and Duet. Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a snifter."
"22 oz bottle split and poured into a Sierra Nevada tulip. 7% ABV, no date."
"Appearance - Eggshell white one finger soapy head, hazy golden orange color. Doesn't stick around long but leaves nice lacing. "
"Part of a blind tasting that included Nelson, Duet, and Pure Hoppiness. Nelson was my least favorite and Pure Hoppiness was my favorite - an incredible beer."
Another Alpine IPA thanks to imperialbeachbrw. It is good to have a few to compare their offerings.
"22oz bomber split, served in standard pint glasses"
Bottle picked up at South Bay Drugs.
"The last time I had this beer, it was a snow day and I had nothing to do. After drinking some rather awful beers today, I need something good, and Andy delivers. Thanks, bud!"
"Clear, glowing gold with a firm stand of white foam that lays down rings of lace."
Reviewed from notes taken at Alpine during SD Beer Week.

"Absolutely tremendous IPA. Full bitterness without the extreme hops and malt of a DIPA. Good amarillo orange flavours, and grapefruit. A bomber was a satisfying fill. Generous white head, above average mouthfeel. Good carbonation, balance.Thanks Augustgarage."
"Clear gold pour with a small, loose, white head. The aroma has a touch of honey sweetness upfront with pungent cattyness, bubblegum and tree fruit. The flavor is sweet with notes of bubblegum, grapefruit, cat pee, oily pine and a lasting bitterness on the sides of the tongue. Creamy, medium-full body with moderate carbonation and some astringency."
On-tap at Toronado San Diego.
22 oz. bomber poured into a tulip.
"When in California, drink as the Californians do...and I've been doing just that, and here's yet another highly-rated Cali IPA that I can't get in the East. Label says 7%, btw..."
"Tasted from bomber bottle. Pours clear amber with a thick pearl white head that fades to lace. Nose is caramel malt with grapefruit, slightly dusty, hops bitterness. The palate is very similar. Caramel malt, grapefruit, some lemongrass, lemon pith bitterness comes through on back of palate. The carbonation is fairly light, and the body is medium, but I love the somewhat coating feeling that I am getting. The finish is long and bitter and slightly nutty. Overall, this is a great IPA, it is super balanced and easy to enjoy, and I am really enjoying it."
"Appearance - a slightly hazed golden. Ample lace all around, achieving almost complete coverage."
A: bright golden straw color with nominal lacing and head retention
"Pours a great golden orange, some pine and citrus on the nose. Taste is more of the same with a very good balance between the bitterness and the caramel malt flavors. Mouthfeel is just about perfect for the style, as it warms it has a bit more orange and lemon zest on the tongue. A very well balanced and flavorful IIPA."
Thanks to stevemcqueenjr for this bottle in a trade.

"A - Golden yellow color, very clear, can see through it nicely. Big puffy head that left some nice lacing on the sides for a very good looking beer."
"Poured from a bomber into a mug. Thanks, mikesgroove!"
Obtained thanks to FreightTrain
22 oz bottle poured into a tulip. Thanks womencantsail. 
"Amazing nose on this beer! Ripe tropical fruits with honey. Yum. Pours a honey golden to light amber, with generous white head. On the palate the hop focus is center stage, with no real need to mention malt presence. Nice piney and grapefruity hop flavors with a dry, chalky bitterness that goes nicely into the finish. Fine example of an IPA."
LongBeach thanks for the hook up. First Alpine brew well worth the wait and lived up to the hype. 
So glad I live near San Diego where I can get Alpine brews.
Thanks to my SD Connection for procuring a bomber of this for me. Shared with FooFaa and brewslut on 3/29/10.
Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a foamy white head. Aroma is of grapefruit and grass mostly.
thanks to smokepot23
Huge thanks to scribe594 for hooking me up with this-had a small sample of 4 month old expo(at the gratitude release) that was awesome now I am super excited to try their IPA line-up. 22 oz bottle poured into a snifter.
22oz from a trade. Thanks to mroberts1204 for recommending and supplying! 
"Thanks to Skuter for sending me both long-sought Alpine brews, Nelson & Duet, in a recent swap of fine beers. Split with the wife while the hops are still kicking vigorously. "
"Bottle, home. Holy crap, this is good. This beer pours a light golden amber with a nice white head that leaves good lacing. The aroma hit me the instant I uncapped the bottle. This is not a shy beer. It smells like a truckload of tangerine rinds and pine needles were mixed with fairy dust and dumped in a meadow of flowers. A big whiff of this beer is like aromatherapy for a hophead. As Ninkasi doubtlessly intended, this IPA is all about showcasing the hops. The flavor is light and dry with lots of hop bitterness, but there's just enough malt sweetness to keep it from paint thinner territory. The mouthfeel is oily with hop residue but just a bit thin. However, I think that I'm only noticing that because the hops are so big that my palate is assuming it's in DIPA territory. For a dry 7% abv beer, Alpine probably couldn't do any better in this regard. This is a phenomenal beer. I can't wait to try the rest of the Alpine bottles that I bought."
Credit to JesseTheHutt for this wonderful Cali IPA. 
Pours a dark golden color with an amber hue. Head is very thick and bubbly leaving significant lacing as it dissipates down the glass.
"on the visit to san diego, we drove out to alpine to sample the wares. except my partner in crime passed himself out in the back of the van. left alone to trudge on, i put forth my best effort. a light orangey hue, spewing forth grapefruit and mango goodness with a slight bit of malt. a nice bitter, touch of sweetness and plenty of citrus fruit. pretty tasty, nothing to go too wild over, but enjoyable nonetheless. perhaps the sours from earlier in the day were still vengeful, but i would think my excitement from the 45 minute drive would overcompensate for any of that. at any rate, i shall try a bottle in the future or perhaps find it at sd beer week if everything goes right."
"Fresh bomber pours into my glass a wonderful peach color with amazing clarity and a half inch of creamy white head that leaves some spotty lacing. Enticing. Aroma is all hops! Tropical fruit, grapefruit, green hop resins, floral accents and a bit of spiciness. Really shows off the Simcoe and Amarillo. Mellow caramel sweetness in the background."
Thanks to javib458 for sending this in a trade. Poured into my RR tulip glass from a 22 oz. bottle.
Big thanks to errantnight for hooking me up with this. Bottle spit among friends produced a big fluffy white head that laces out great. The body of the brew was a cloudy golden yellow in color.

A 22 ounce bomber poured into a mug.
"22oz. bottle received in a recent trade, courtesy of WeeObese."
"22 oz. bottle from Beverages 4 Less, poured in to a cervoise."
"Appearance: Pours a hazy and golden peach and orange blend with about a finger of crisp snow white semi-persistent head. The carbonation bubbles are medium sized but bountiful and quickly flow up in many streams to the top of the glass. A sheet of fine lacing, made up of medium size bubbles, is persistently sticking to the side of the glass and shows no sign of movement. Consistent, pretty, and nice. "
"Appearance - Poured from a 22oz bottle into my SA Perfect Pint with a copper, golden color. Over an inch of white, chunky looking head that is slowly dissipating leaving some great looking lacing on the sides of my glass."
22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. 
22 ounce bottle poured into a tulip. Comes in at 7%. No bottling info is given.
mymrnngjckt has shared a bottle of this on two separate occasions and both times I've been very impressed.
Thanks to Stawn for this bomber in a recent trade!
"22oz bottle, trade with beerman4. Clear copper color, a little chill haze. Really big foamy head, easily 4 fingers worth, and large weighty clumps of sticky bubbles sticking to the glass walls. All kinds of citrus, grapefruit and pineapple, mango and other tropical aromas. Perfect pairing of Amarillo and Simcoe hops. This could be the perfect IPA. The flavor is dead on target, with the hops giving all their flavors in the fruity realm with just a little contribution towards bitterness. The use of pale malts with just enough caramel malt gives some sense of balance while allowing the hops to take center stage. Just thicker than water, with a lasting aftertaste and slightly oily mouthfeel."
Many thanks to JessetheHut for sending me these Alpine beers. Much appreciated.
Finally got around to trying an Alpine Beer and I must say that the bar has been raised!
22oz bomber courtesy of dannyhipps. Poured into a tulip 01/20/10.
Ugly light copper color with a gigantic 4 fingers of head that engulfs my tulip glass and leaves a trail of webby lacing as it recedes.
Chilled bottle into a glass. Thanks to Sandstone for picking this up. He assured me that he left it in bright sunlight and warm temperatures. Thanks man. 
Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. 
Poured from a 22oz bomber into two St. Bernardus goblets. Special thanks to HeatherAnn for the assist. Extra special thanks to errantnight for this from our trade!
"Acquired via trade from radshoesbro so a big ""Thank You"" goes out to him. Poured from a 22oz bottle into an imperial pint glass."
another alpine bottle shared by ritzkiss. thanks eric!
"22 oz bottle, big thanks to ritzkiss for sharing this one!"
22 oz. into a pint glass/ Consumed fresh
Thanks to choprite for this 650 mL bomber.
A: Pours a golden orange with nearly 2 fingers of head that lingers and finally leaves a very nice lace.
I drank this from a 22oz bomber into my Rochefort chalice.
22oz bomber sent from hophead84 - a god among men indeed.
"A- Pours a sunset orange hue with a thick, frothy 2 finger head. A perfect example of the style."
Thanks to Exiled for sharing this bottle.
Bomber poured into an oversized wine glass. Golden body with a light brass core. Lacing is sticky and has a long life.
"22oz from a trade, thanks augustgarage! Always there to oblige my hop cravings..."
"Pretty easily the best looking IPA I've ever seen. Very clear amber color with an explosive, billowy offwhite head with infinite retention and THICK lacing. So inviting. "
Thanks to BeerTruth for the bottle.
"Pours a medium gold color with a large creamy off-white head. Aroma is tropical fruit salad with pineapples, oranges, honeydew, and grapefruit. Almost perfumey with citrus oils. Flavor is light unobtrusive malt overlaid with citric hops. Nice solid bitterness on the back of the palate. Hoppy and drinkable, an always welcome combination."
Served from a 22oz. bottle acquired in a trade from thegonzz (Thanks man!) into my 20oz. Victory HopDevil nonic pint at the appropriate temperature.
"Rustic bronze color with medium head. Pine cone, grass on top of floral, light citrus, with faint caramel sweetness peeking through. Creamy mouthfeel nicely balances the almost spicy hop bitterness. Pleasantly lingering bittersweet finish - not at all harsh."
Pours a sandy brown with shades of orange. Silky beige head has excellent lacing and retention.
Big thanks to jyoungsbcp for trading me this bomber!
10/31/10 Sample:
Pours a golden hay-like color with about a two-finger head.
"Poured from a 22oz bottle like the one in the picture. Glassware used was an imperial pint glass. Clear golden color; aggressive carbonation, topped with a burgeoning pillowy white head that left a good account of its drinker's progress after each quaff."
"Received this in a trade. Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass. There is no bottling date on the bottle (22 ounce). Beer is heady and aggressive. Carbonation moderate to high and steady. After a careful pour I got about 6 ounces into my glass, the head took up the rest. White tiny bubbles giving way to larger bubbles at the top, looks like soap. Beer is light amber in color and mostly clear. There is a slight haze to it. There is aton of lacing as the head falls away from the glass."
22 oz bomber poured into a standard pint glass
"Appearance: Iridescent orange, much less head than I expected, same goes for the lacing."
Drank from a 22 fl. oz bottle
Just received this brew this morning from Masterski. The description on the back of the bottle has me pumped. Full of Amarillo and Simcoe hops. Badass. Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale tulip.
"Poured from a bomber obtained from Red Carpet Wine this afternoon. Very, very fresh. And the head certainly agrees -- it's huge, pillowy, fluffy, and absolutely beautiful. Leaves an enormous amount of lacing behind, and it's very, very sticky. Great start to the beer."
22oz bottle obtained in a a shipment from South bay Drugs poured into my Southern Tier tulip glass.
Sun-drenched Sunkist orange with lemon peel highlights. Fine streams of bubbles disappear into the underside of a two finger cap that is darker than ivory and lighter than sandstone. The foam is crazy sticky and is blanketing the glass with some of the finest lace that I've seen in quite some time.
Huge thanks to czoch75 for this one! I owe you big time!
"Finally, Alpine has started bottling their brews in earnest. Easily one of the best producers of pale ales in the country. Duet pours dark golden with one-finger of foam capping it. In a true display of delicious hop oils, the head does not go anywhere at all and leaves a huge amount of lacing."
Thanks Jay for sharing this west coast IPA. 
"Thanks to stawn for sending this my way. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my Imperial nonic pint glass. The ale appears a slightly hazed golden yellow color with a huge inch plus of fluffy sticky bone white foam. The head leaves quite a lace in its wake. A very nice looking pour, can't wait to dig in. The nose and flavors consist of caramel malt, tangerines, floral, orange, pine, white grapefruit, grass, spicy citrus mint, peach skin, ripe tropical fruits, toffee. Just about the right amount of bitterness with no alcohol heat to speak of. Adequately carbonated with a clean medium body. Simply delicious stuff and very fresh right now. By all means, get your hands on a few bombers if you can."
I'm always interested in a new Alpine offering.
Bottle thanks to OlieIPA.
"I got this gem in a trade with stawn. Thanks Chris! Poured a 22 oz bomber into a oversized Pinot wine glass. Pours a golden caramel with minimal lacing and a fluffy white head that quickly dissipates. I put my nose to this beer and this is exactly what I like about west coast ipa's rich citrus. This ipa uses a mixture of simcoe and amarillo hops, yummy. This baby tastes exactly how it smelss citrus pronounced with wonderfull grapefruit bitterness. This beer goes down very easily, too bad this is not readily available on the east coast."
thanks to kbm on this and several bruery and alpine brews.
22oz bottle from a shipment recieved today.
"Hazed pale copper. Dusty looking cap of ivory white foam. Lace is quite substantial and intricate. Aroma is tropical, grassy and resiny. Flavor is a lot of citrus. Tangerine, orange, grapefruit, nectarine. Good hop flavor. A little grassiness and some pine resin. Bitterness is very clean. Underneath all the hop character is a solid enough toffeeish malt base. Medium-full bodied and moderately carbonated. This is a flavorful, easy drinker. Great IPA overall."
"A: like light colored honey, white head with a slight haze."
"Let me start this review by noting that if the appearance category included label consideration, my score would be significantly lower. I kinda get the Bavarian-esque cartoons that grace all the Alpine bottle, but the inexplicable picture of the circa 1960s suburban church on the front of the Duet bottle leaves me a little annoyed. Don't get me wrong. I don't have problem with the church theme. I just don't get it. Trinity, yes. Duet, no. Anyhoo, the beer more than makes up for any aesthetics lacking in the package. "
22oz bottle poured into a Portsmouth goblet.
Thanks to Alex (Masterski) and Shane (HopHead84) for the joint venture in getting me a few Alpine beers. I owe both of you guys! Poured from 22oz bomber into Surly Imperial Nonic.
22oz bottle split with friends; mine in a Foothills pint glass. Major props to Mauerhan for the ri-donk-ulous trade.
"Huge thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. 22oz. bottle served in my Allagash tulip. Poured a honey-gold with a dense, half-inch, bright white head. Excellent head retention with some spotty lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose was sweet grapefruit all the way. Taste consistent with nose - sweet to start, some bitterness in the mix, but incredibly balanced. Mouthfeel was light-medium and very lively. An exceptional IPA that approaches a DIPA in flavor profile without the big abv. Another top notch IPA from Alpine."
"This is the second time I've had this beer and this first time seemed more fresh than this. It reminds of Pliny or Sculpin in the fact that if its not perfectly fresh, its a different beer altogether. This is substantially bitter in a good way. Floral and hoppy. "
Simcoe and Amarillo are arguably my two favorite hops so expectations are high for this one.
Purchased at south bay drugs.
Picked up at the brewery during my San Diego trip last week. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. No dating info but since got at the brewery it's gotta be fresh and well handled. It was a slightly hazy golden color with some floaters in it. Lots of carb streams and great lacing. It had a massive white head that very slowly settled into a foam.
A: bright yellow with a slight tinit of gold. Soapy white head that was only about half an inch thick. There is minimal lace and average carbonation rising from the bottom.
"Got this great extra from goodspeed94. Thanks, Jon."
"Pours an ultra pale golden color that first appears effervescent but is actually laced with suspended micro-particulate. The collar is better that a full finger deep loose foamy and off white and in nature. A nice amount of Belgian lacing left behind each mouthful. The smell has a really nice balance of floral citrus-pine perfume and sweet maltiness. The flavor presence wanders around some and in the end is suggestive of that same piny element. I am really enjoying this beer. However, the body abandons the experience IMO. It's as if the bottom drops out. I'm half way through the glass and now notice that those unique little floaters have settled to the bottom and don't quite cover the half dollar bottom of this most recent shapely Ithaca receptacle. Very drinkable; it feels so light that it surprises me to find that there is 6.7% ABV. This one has a whole lot to consider. Many thanks going out to radshoesbro for this opportunity!!!"
"a - pours a golden amber color, smallish ivory head with retention around the edges and decent lacing, pretty clear on the first pour"
Thanks to stevemcqueenjr for this one.
"A - Finally in the bottle. Pours not very pretty brown tinted honey. Some light almost white head, lots of cling lace."
Bottle courtesy of Mauerhan. Thanks Topher!
Bottle picked up by my buddy ArthurPendragon. Consumed on 10/11/2009 and poured into a snifter. The beer appears a transparent and vibrant golden with a one finger fizzy white head. Retention and lacing are both decent.
"Tried this on tap, reviewing from notes from a couple weeks ago."
Had this on tap at O'Brien's in San Diego in August 2009.
"This was poured from a growler purchased at Alpine and I also had a glass on tap at O'Brien's the day before. Bright orange color with a white head that really laced the glass. The smell was a little pine but mostly bright fresh citrus fruit, excellent. The flavor was like nectarines and oranges, so juicy and hoppy, fantastic. This beer really impressed the hell out of me and I hope I can get my hands on a couple bottles if they release them."
Sunny Day
Growler courtesy of cuda7051. Poured into a large tulip.
"On-tap at O'Briens, and I'll be going back for more of this one, for sure. Watch for this one to rise up the top 100 as it becomes more available. "
"Picked up a growler with a couple of friends while visiting SD this past week...which was awesome by the way! Anyways, we went back to the condo the very same night and polished it right off. Thanks for a great weekend guys! "
On tap at Pizza Port
Sampled on tap at the Stone World Bistro in Escondido.
"Growler from the brewery on release day, consumed the next day. Hazy gold-light orange with a sticky white head. Ripe apricot, sweet grapefruit and lots of tangy nectarine in the aroma. Like a tangy hop-fruit salad. Almost no malt in the flavor, just pure fruity and spicy hop flavor. More bitterness in the finish than Nelson, though still not strongly bitter. Medium-light body with a dry finish. More of a classic fruit hop profile than the grapey nelson, but very tasty. One of the most drinkable IPAs that I've ever had. Alpine is owning the IPA segment right now with a handful of amazing examples that all have their own flare."
"On-tap at Blue Palms,"
Growler courtesy of JessetheHutt shared with the usual suspects at the Brick Store.
Huge thanks to Dave (d0b) for sharing this growler with me - and by extension big props to JesseTheHutt. Served in a Piece pint glass.
"Solid beer. Nice the Alc is ""only"" 6.75%. Not as aromatic as I thought it might be. A bit more IIPA feel, big rich body. Pine hops, nice drinkability. Has more weight to it than other IPA's. Richness and a nice finish. Though the richness adds to heavyness which 1 pint of this was plenty. Nice and fresh at Toro SD today."
"A big thanks to Jesse for getting me this growler. I have searched long and hard for this one and I am thrilled to finally be able to throw this one down. I drank this growler throughout the day while messing around in the yard. Served cold and poured into pint glasses, this one was consumed on 04/26/2009."
On tap at O'Brien's in SD. Was pleasantly surprised to see this one on the beer list.
Another day another wonderful brew added to the taps at Downtown Johnny Brown's San Diego.
"Shockingly good IPA from Alpine. I'd never heard of Duet, but will look for it in the future. Shame I had to drive, so just one for me."
"Appearance: A tangerine colored body with brilliant clarity. The head is two fingers thick, frothy, lasting."
Poured from a freshly filled growler into a nonic glass. Pours a deep golden orange color with a rich head. Decent retention is followed by sheet lacing with each sip. 
"Tap at Pizza Port, Carlsbad. Clear yellow pour with a average-sized white head. Perfumy hops with grass and pine. Smooth hop-and-malt balance that takes nothing away from the bite. More resin than grapefruit, but the citrus is definietly noticeable. Thick, but not as syrupy as other borderline IIPA/IPA's. Very good."
I saw that Alpine was offering this fine IPA and had to go get it. Me and 3 empty growlers in tow made the short trek this weekend and it is always worth it when I come home with a beer this good.
Growler. 
Pours a slightly fogged amber gold. Nose is pine resin sticky-ness. Flavor is just smooth. Damn smooth. Obviously wet hopped. Pine tones but a nutty edge to it as well. Some caramel is there also. Feel is slick and smooth. Good carbonation. A damn fine IPA. A stellar and masterfully brewed beer. Just damn good. 
"A-Deep, orange hued copper with a thin white head that left spotty lacing."
Had on tap before but brought this growler home a few days ago right from the Alpine Brewery's tap.
on tap @ San Diego Brewing Company
On draft at O'Brien's
Sampled at the San Diego County Fair.
"I love some of Alpine's ales more than life itself, but I was disappointed in this one. It has a nice floral bouquet, but it lacked body and sufficient flavor to really wow me. Very little complexity. Maybe I was hoping for too much since the pub I was in had just run out of pure hoppiness and the barmaid said this would be a reasonable substitute. There really are very few substitutes for pure hoppiness."
Thanks to weeheavySD for the growler!
"What can I say about this beer. 1st of all the smell is that of pine and citrus, I know, I know everyone has heard that about this beer. But quite strange, yesterday I smelled pine, today I smell orange citrus. Sort of smells as if you put a package of simcoe hops with oranges. Yeah, how silly that's the smell of the hops used in the making. "
"Duet is the perfect west coast style IPA. Light in body, beautiful floral / citrus aroma, clean taste with just enough bitter overtone."
"The only disappointing about Alpine's beers is limited geographic area that I can get them in. Everytime I'm in the San Diego, one of my goals is to get a bunch of these delicious brews in my belly. Arriving at the Stone Anniversary, the guest breweries were alphabetized. Brilliant! Alpine for the start!"
"This beer pours a light golden color with a white head. The head fades fast, leaving a lot of laces."
On tap at O'Briens.
"West Coast style IPA made with Simcoe and Amarillo hops. Sampled this one at the brewery, then on tap at O'Brien's and again at the Liar's Club. Could not get enough of it. Light bronze, big sticky foam head. Huge, unique hop explosion of an aroma. Reminded me of sticking my head into a big bag of leaf hops before tossing them in the boil. Flavor follows suit, grapefruity citrus blended with dirty spiced pine. An astounding blend of hop flavor. Hints of mandarin orange & fresh cut grass. Not a harshly bitter beer, but it certainly lingers on the tongue. Medium bodied. Biscuit and light caramel round this out beautifully. Delightful medley of flavors showcasing the hops uniquely. Best IPA I've had to date."
I am a huge Alpine fane and when O'Brien's was pouring a new IPA from Alpine I had to stop by for a pint.
"5 oz pour at Cleveland Fat Head’s. Clear pale amber pour with white head. Aroma is distinctly piney, grapefruit, citrus with caramel notes - smells very inviting - screams drink me. Taste is hoppy pine, pineapple and citrus bitter sweetness; bitterness carries the day - but so well balanced with the sweet malt. Medium full mouthfeel - finishes with a delicious lingering happiness. A beer that I could drink every day and be perfectly happy."
"Golden hued body with a fine foamy head; bits of lacing clinging to the glass. Spicy, herbal and pine aroma. Crystal malt base (it seems like) with a spicy, peppery hop taste; very bitter. Medium body; dry and prickly on the palate."
"Today is the occasion of New Fat Rusty Head Rail Sunday (Week 714) & while we just began receiving distro of Fat Head's beers, we do not get the full oeuvre as yet. This will be my last from them for today, but it will be a glorious exit! This is not only one of their flagships but also one of my faves, both from them & in general. "
"My first from Fat Heads, so I went on their website. A successful family business 25 years old and now full of friends and admirers as customers. So who am I to pan their cash cow? I won't."
"The first sip and smell are a little off, but it gets great."
"And old school DIPA, juicy and bitter. With a clean malt bill, and at almost 8% it’s extremely drinkable. Citrus and pine dominate with hop bitterness on the finish. Awesome!"
"Again, another brewery JUST coming to this god forsaken land of Western New York. So late to the game, but now that it’s here...wow! Fresh growler tap, poured chilled aggressively to a tulip glass. In hindsight, a moderate to slow pour is in order, as this has some lively carbonation. Huge white foamy head that dissipates to a bubbling hot tub sizzle. Nose is immensely fragrant citrus and pine, sensed easily from two feet away. Clear amber, with tons of carbonation deep from the bottom...reminds me of PtE’s bubble pattern. Pause for Pliny respect...oh, I’d have to drive to Philadelphia to get another one...damn you Russian River with your spartan distro! First sips are all juicy, piney, grassy, hoppy bright tones. Totally balanced by a semisweet malt back end, that is dark like a hoarhound. Mouthfeel is just above thin, but stays full with a lingering hoppiness. Alcohol is in the above average range, but the crispness and flavor put it in the crushable range. I’ve seen reviews that this will fade fast, but one doesn’t expect a juicy IPA to live long, right? I could see this as a summer staple while I bide time for stout season!"
"Pours golden clear, appropriate foamy head. Aroma is faint - dank and hoppy. Very hoppy flavor - plenty of bitterness, piney hops. Carbonation is on point. I remember this beer a bit bolder: that being said, this beer is 2 months old. I will revisit with a fresher beer in the future. Several years ago, before the explosion of breweries, this was my go to beer. My palate may have shifted to the New England style of IPA.. This still a great west coast IPA."
Poured from a 12oz glass into a high sided pilsner glass. 
"Had a bottle at D'agnese Italian restaurant in Richfield Ohio. Served in a pint glass, this beer was a clear, amber color with a small white head. Good lacing and retention. Aroma and flavor featured citrus (grapefruit) and dry, biscuity malt. Good strong favor and nice level of bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp and rich with the balance favoring the hops. I would drink this one again."
"First had poured from 12-oz. bottle, neck stamped “BOTTLED ON 06/11/18,” into hotel water glass. You are greeted at the door with a huge hop hug, then malt slides over, says hello and hangs around, while hops firmly but friendly escort you to an IPA throw down."
"Horse a clear, copper - Orange with a one finger off - White head. Good combination with some lacing."
"A very drinkable IPA, fruity smell, malty taste, complex."
"Draft at the Industry. Clear body, medium golden, soft fluffy head. . Pretty gentle, but wonderful malt profile. Fairly smooth throughout, despite its claim of being aggressive. Pretty lavorful, nice feel."
"Pours a medium amber, coppery coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells of caramel malt, citrus/tropical fruit: grapefruit, pineapple and pine. Taste is quite malty and resinous, with strong hoppy accents. Notes of caramel malt, citrus/tropical fruit: grapefruit, pineapple and pine. Finishes with a medium/strong bitterness and a good bit of pine coming through in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. I'm not even sure if I know what East/West Coast IPA is anymore, but this a great example of that typical, resinous, malty, citrus bitter IPA, but with a tropical twist. Personally, I could very well do without that pretty dominant pineapple note, but a great brew nonetheless."
Best IPA going. Great aroma and even better flavor.
Pours a clear orange amber with a thin off white head from a gentle lour.
"Best from a 12oz snifter, very smooth with slight citrus, grapefruit, and hints of pineapple. The smell and taste are outstanding. These go down so easy! Of course, the best place to have one is in the Burgh at Fat Heads on the South Side!!"
one of the best
Freshy freshy. 1/19/18. 
"If there was ever a ""mowing the lawn"" beer for me, this is it. Wonderful fruity hoppiness comes to the forefront and smacks you in the face. A bit of bitterness followed by a sweet and citrus finish. "
"Tasted very grassy to me, like hay. Nice hops, but can't get over the dry grassiness. Pours a lovely orange with a finger of head, lacing stops pretty early in the pint. Expected more for the price."
Really liked the aftertaste. Great body feel
This is an excellent beer I had on draft. Very nice complex flavor with strong fruity undertones. Not too bitter and yet hops right up.
"13oz bottle received through the lunatic generosity of WesMantooth, whose name must be spoken in hushed tones and with downcast eyes by UPS workers the world over. According to the stamp on the bottle, this was bottled on September 8, 2017. My 1st from Fat Head's."
"Poured out a clear, golden amber color with a bubbly, off-white head of foam. It smelled of pine, grapefruit, orange and toasted caramel. Big bold, hoppy bite of pine and citrus. Nice roasty malt, caramel and toffee, too."
L: clear golden with a small white head
Poured from a 12oz bottle.
12 oz. bottle dateed 7/28/17. Poured into Teku glass.
12oz bottle marked bottled on 06/22/17 12:11. poured heavily into a pint glass.
Dirty gold colored beer with excellent clarity. Soapy head laces the glass. 
This is a great beer! I was surprised but when something is good it's good.
"My kind of IPA. Pours clear golden with a foamy and sticky bone white head that has exceptional lacing. Smells of dank resin, pine, citrus/grapefruit, and faint notes of tropical fruit that all transcend well into the flavor. Very rich and sticky feel, plenty of carbonation. Overall, this is another outstanding IPA from Fat Heads. I've only had two from them so far and have been very impressed. Thanks again Corey! Cheers!"
"The appearance was a transparent somewhat golden/orange and slightly yellow colored body with a spectacular looking one finger white foamy head that once it starts dieing. The lacing is just so thick and clingy, nice show. The smell has bitter hoppiness up front, primarily a nice combination of a citrus/pine-like substance of sorts, slightly spiciness of sorts plays nicely in the background. The taste has a nice combination of a bittersweetness that plays very nicely with the spicy flavoring coming from the aroma, dry piney aftertaste and finish. The palate has a nice light to medium body, and is fairly sessionable. Carbonation is great for an AIPA as a more than adequate sharpness invades my tongue and mouth. Overall, I can see why so many people really like this one."
Poured into a tulip and look is burnt orange with a fluffy bubbly head that dissolves yet leaves lacing around the glass. very hoppy in the body.
"Nice copper look to this brew, almost see through. Love the scent of this beer, tropical fruit, citrus and pine, not much malt detected. Decent flavor of citrus and pine that has a gentle bitter and semi sweet finish. It doesn't quite live up to the nose of this beer. Also getting a bit of heat on the finish. Dare I call it a bit watery with less carbonation. All in all it's a good beer here."
Great IPA from Fat Heads. Not as much citrus as Hop Ju Ju but a stellar beer with a nice color and aroma. Always good to have a few of these around.
"Truly exceptional, and one of the finest American IPAs I have tried."
"Pours translucent orange with slight head with lingering rim and moderate lacing on tap. Smells of bitter hops and tropical fruits, though no clear fruit comes through. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. Really good IPA."
"Great IPA!!! Had it at B Spot Burgers in Indy -- great restaurant between Chicago and Ohio, BTW! Will definitely try to find this in a store."
On tap:
"Golden - copper color w/ good lacing throughout. Great smell w/ hints of pine and citrus. Taste and feel are substantial. You know you are drinking an exceptional beer as soon as you first taste. Finish is equally good. Fatheads brewery, North Olmsted, oh"
"Mostly clear, golden amber color. Foamy, off white head with streak lacing. Aroma is light tropical fruit, grain, and spice. Flavor is citrus and pine, bread and mango. A hoppy bite to it, but still smooth. A good beer overall."
Revisited 6/8/18
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish tulip
"Great beer, terrible lace."
bottled 2/24/17.
One of my favorite beers from one of my favorite hang out spots. Drinks really smooth and it has a great aroma. It's hard to get where I live and it's a must have when I'm on vacation.
"Pours a clear rich gold, with a 1 inch head that fades into a lingering ring."
One of my favorite go to beers in da burgh. One of the best West Coast style IPA out there. That's what my No. Cal. Friends tell me
Acquired from mantoury74 so a big “Thank You” goes out to him. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.
"I really enjoyed this beer. I thought it was well balanced and drinkable, yet had dimension to its taste and booze that leaves you feeling accomplished. This is what I look for in my IPA daily driver."
"Excellent IPA. The scent conjures foggy images of late afternoon tea time (perhaps solely herbal) at a sophisticated cat lady's domicile. Typically I would consider this repugnant, though for some inexplicable reason, I find myself memorized by the humulus lupulus. Mouthfeel is exemplary. Consider this hophead's intractable palate sufficiently placated."
"Picked up a sixtal of this I PA, glad I did. Cleaned the line's and faucet first, haven't wasted a drop since the first pour. It made the bar area smell of Hops. Great lacing however the head doesn't stick around long. Hope it lasts until Christmas, I don't think it will make it to New Year's Eve."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle,into a Cigar City IPA Spiegelau."
on tap at Soho restaurant in Pittsburgh yesterday.
"Pours a rather standard slight orange hued golden yellow, but at first glance I'm noticing not only a bit of haze (which is fine), but rather large particulate floating about, looks more like citrus rind that chunks of yeast."
A fabulous IPA - but very bitter - IBU of 87! Yikes prob higher that Stone Delicious (which is 75). Had at Tria Fitlers on tap yesterday in Phila. Beautiful creamy head that stays. It should be avail at Brewers Outlet.
"I have had this beer several times, it is Incredible on tap; you can find it on tap at several locations throughout Pittsburgh. A very balanced IPA, does not over due it. I prefer it to several IPAs within the top 100; there is No surprise it has won so many awards."
"Has a huge amount of citrus, among other fruit, on the forefront of drinking, but then mellows out with the citrus lingering on the tongue along with the more piney profile. Smell is likewise the same for what the flavor dictates. "
Whoa! Serious hop punch with this one. Loads of tropical fruit and citrus hop in both the nose and taste. Where this IPA excels is in the back end - malt sweetness provides the perfect balance to the resinous aftertaste. This is a superior IPA. Get it if you can!
Easily one of the best IPAs I've ever had... Bright and citrusy with loads of flavor and aromas.... Delicious... So glad I found this fresh... Its superb.. Would be a staple in my fridge if it was local...
"One of my all time favorites. One of the first elite tier ipas I had outside of the west coast. When they showed up at the Bistro ipa festivals, it was on. "
"Quite an IPA, at first it reminded me of Two Hearted with a little extra kick and a little research shows they share Centennial hops (tho this has Columbus and Simcoe too). My bottle is 6 weeks old and the grapefruit, pine, passionfruit, and pineapple still seem to be in full effect, with just a hint of light caramel malts. Light bodied, dry, and dangerously drinkable. The more I think about it, this has a lot of Pliny to it as well. Damn tasty beer."
Grapefruit notes and a hoppy taste
Pretty deep orange filtered color. Nice abundant lacing. Smells dank. Noticeable hop presence. Taste is malt and grapefruit with some pine present. Decent on the palate. Refreshing and well above average.
"L: A beautiful golden orange, like the color of Commodore Perry. Unlike Commodore Perry, it has a creamy, long-lasting head."
L- The beer pours clear and golden in the light. The head is a solid 2 fingers of frothy white bubbles. Lacing is patchy but lasting.
Poured into a 13 oz Weyerbacher tulip glass bottled on 7/19/16. Pours a beautiful slightly hazy orange with a 2 finger sticky white head that clings to the glass.
Bottled 6/27/16
A - pours a clear golden brown with a ruby tint. Fine spotty lace appear and disappear quickly after each sip. 
Dark gold to copper in color with a quarter inch of off white in top. Moderate lacing. The aroma is pure orange juice and light malt. I taste a wallop of citrus hops and light malt. The mouth is light in nature and lightly chalky and dry.
"Insanely good. Great look, aroma but the taste is so smooth for such an assertively bitter beer. When fresh it is hard to bear. One of the best out there."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/7/2016. Pours slightly hazy golden yellow color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dank citrus/tropical/pine hops and light-moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Large amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon/orange rind, pine, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish with a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dank citrus/tropical/pine hops and light-moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal astringent hop flavors lingering after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, that increases through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and lightly creamy/grainy mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an insane IPA as expected. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dank citrus/tropical/pine hops and light-moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. An insanely amazing offering all around."
"Wow this is a massive tropical IPA! So much of the aroma is dominated by pineapple, grapefruit juice, lots of resiny hops and grassy notes. Very hard to detect is a fresh bready malt base. Taste is tropical hoppy goodness with enough malt to give balance and body. Not many beers have this much of a layering of hops showcased. Hop lovers must try this! I would get it again for sure."
Smell: mandarin oranges tangerine candy fruit peach pineapple grapefruit.
"By far the best IPA I've ever tasted blows blind pig l, Pliny the elder and sculpin out of the water"
Tasted this one at PDX Craft Beer Festival. 
"Pours a clear copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and good lacing. Smells of citrus hops, caramel malt, slight pale malt, piney hops, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, slight floral hops, caramel malt, slight sweet malt, slight alcohol, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good complexity, but otherwise a standard AIPA."
Pretty west coast like but better
"Light yellow-orange-amber color with a thick and lasting white head that eventually leaves heavy lacing. Sweet malt and pine on the nose. Nice piney flavor that seems light and refined, with a good malt backbone balancing it out. Bitter aftertaste with a slight alcohol kick. Medium bodied with ""scraping bubbles"" carbonation. Excellent beer."
What a smell! What a taste! Hop heaven!
Nice taste and color
Probably an older bottle. Very standard west coast IPA but has a bit of extra malt and older hop notes. Not exactly my favorite thing. It looks and smells fine but just not there for me on the flavor side this go.
"Pours a copper orange with a finger plus of foamy head that settles to a ring with lots of fuzzy lacing. Pine resin aroma, taste follows nose. Very nice balance. Thoroughly enjoyable."
Pours a clear amber color with a good foamy head. Retention is mild. Lacing is good. Has a big piney aroma with some citrus. This has a big piney hop at the end. Very aggressive. Assume it is dry hopped. Don't really get it from the aroma. It really overwhelms the citrus taste. Very astringent at the end.
"Poured into shaker from bottle, nice 1 finger cream colored head. Nice retention and lacing. Light amber in the glass, not quite clear and some floaties. Smells of caramel, mango and pineapple. Taste a little sweet on the front followed by mango, pineapple and a little citrus bitterness. Great mouthfeel."
"4 pack purchased at Kroger supermarket in North Dayton, OH (Tripp city to be exact) during my cross country road trip from Tucson AZ to NJ. Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip glass. Bottled 4/18/16 (originally consumed on 5/12/16)"
Pours a clear golden amber with a decent head.
bottled 5/16/16 and enjoyed on 6/1/16
"Pours a nice light amber color, aroma of grapefruit, pineapple, slight pine, and malt. Taste is very hop forward like I prefer, citrusy, slightly malty, and a resin aftertaste which is fabulous. I like It. Keep up the good work, this beer is in my top 5, Thanks. After tating this beer for a few more months,... I have put it at the top of my list,... I have rated it higher than any other beer, the aroma, taste, it always is fresh. Thanks."
2 weeks old in the bottle.
"Had on tap. Pours clear, bright yellow in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is wet hops, big pine, and a nice dose of lemon. Very tasty first brew from this brewery. Has me curious to try other brews from them."
Had on tap. The flagship IPA. Solid all around IPA with a crisp pine and citrus character and a drying finish. Just enough bitterness to bring things into focus.
"Epic IPA. Solid mouthfeel, fresh hop aroma and taste. Perfect balance. Definitely give it a try!"
Phenomenal flavor and depth of hop character. Aroma of crisp malt and sharp hops. Flavor expands across the palette and leaves with a clean flavor. This beer is pine and sticky simcoe/Amarillo vegtel notes that compliment the bitterness perfectly.
"Pours a clear golden color with a white head, smells of malt first with some citrus hops, taste follows the nose more malty than hoppy, did not care for that, mouth feel was sweet with a slight, hop bitterness in the finish, preferred Hop JuJu to this one."
"The Fat Head's line up is new to PA so before dinner out this evening I took advantage of an excellent tap list to see if I'd want to buy some of the bottled beer when I find it. The clear dark amber colored beer was served in a nonic glass with 1/4"" white head on the top. While sipping down the beer some lacing and partial patches of foam cling to the sides of the glass. Sipping creates scattered small bits of lacing. Even to the end there's at least an island of foam on the liquid."
"Golden in color and very clear, thick white head on top that goes away after a minute. Smell is very hoppy and citrusy. Very hoppy and piney in taste."
"Fat Head's Head Hunter India Pale Ale"""
"I could drink this everyday. Such a great hop flavor that balances the bitter. Like a toned down Hop JuJu. Definitely a citrus component, but not overwhelmingly so. The dense hop flavor really steals the show."
"Look is above par; smell is like refined bitterness, coarse, grassy, and filled with grapefruit. The taste follows with exquisite balance. It's dank; it's bready; it's fruity; it's dry; it's malty; it's all of those things. This beer is world-class. So damn larrrge. If you want an IPA that hits on all your notes, yet traditional, this is the one."
"This is one of the better IPAs I have ever had. Got it in a trade and I am loving it. The fruity, citrusy hops are perfectly balanced with the malts and earthy tones. This a great beer."
"Tasted in a pint glass from draft on Brother Jon's Alehouse on March 31, 2016. Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 12 oz bottle on November 30, 2017. Well made. Quality ingredients. Recommended."
This is one of the best IPAs I’ve ever had.
"Bottled in January, enjoyed ~10 weeks later. Dark golden orange pour with a, uh, fat head. Nose of muted citrus, tea and tobacco. Taste of orange rind, blood orange, tea and apricot. Hard to justify the rating, so much so that I'm doubting the bottle is a representative sample. So be it - not getting my hands on a couple more of these anytime soon. Solid beer but nothing heavy about the hops."
"Freshly tapped 1/6 keg at my basement bar poured into a Belgian tulip glass. Lacing is sticky and impressive. Orange, copper in color with a hint of haziness. Swirling the glass brings out all the aromas. Pine, sweet grapefruit with hints of pineapple and mango. They should make an air freshener out of this, seriously...The hoppy bitter goodness gives you a quick smack in the face, followed by the citrus grapefruit, sweet pineapple and malt, finishing with the same bitterness that reminds you that you're drinking a fine IPA. This is my first beer from Fat Head's Brewery and won't be the last. The 1/6 keg was a bit pricey at $105.99 plus tax, which is about what I paid for my last keg of Ballast Point Sculpin Grapefruit. I think the Sculpin is just a tad better though IMO. Either way, Head Hunter is definitely one to seek out and drink again and again."
draft in pint glass. feel like low rating due to dbl ipa before it. will retry this one
"Pours a yellowish copper with a thin layer of head. The nose is citrusy, fruity and something sweet. The flavor is malt forward but the body is not quite what I would describe as hearty for the style. The hop profile on the finish is less potent than I might expect."
"12 oz bottle. Pours bright orange, light haze, finger white head, fades to a ring with soapy lace. Aroma is fruity, orange peel. Very balanced IPA, dank weedy hops with grapefruit and orange peel turning earthy in the swallow. Just enough sweet malt balance. Medium soft slick mouth, slightly oily. Have had this one many times on trips to Florida, and it never disappoints."
Absolutely delicious. A very dank beer that gets more delcious after every sip! Enjoy!
Had on tap at Dunedin HOB. 
"BOD 8/24/15. Clear copper pour. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention."
"LOOKS: Clear golden-amber, with lots of small bubbles streaming up the glass. 2 fingers+ of off white foamy head that lingers and leaves thick lacing down the glass."
"A - A beautiful IPA, clear golden orange body, big white head, fades to a ring and film across the top with copious lacing all the way down."
"Damn good beer. I had never heard of it so this was a pleasant surprise. Got a bottle at Jack Flats in Key West because the Two Hearted on draft was out. Pours clear and golden. Nice sized head with lacing all up and down. Great flavor and hop bitterness. Pretty clean in the finish. Great brew. Had the Two Hearted after this one, and the Head Hunter was way better."
Strong hop smell big citrus flavor. The taste is pretty dank yet nice and crisp. What a treat. Everyone should give this a try that loves a good IPA!
L: Clear Amberish tint.
L: Classic bronze. Extremely clear. Negligible head poured from a bottle dated 12/29/15 into a wine glass. 
I learned that I am not a fan of these particular hops. The beer is finely crafted. I simply don't care for this flavor.
I generally don't like IPAs but this one is tolerable for me. Nice citrusy flavor with a bite but not too bitter.
"Look: Medium orange-amber hue with a light, white foam head. Dissipates relatively quick but leaves a web of lacing."
"I really enjoyed this one, but was not blown away after some of the TH stuff I drank before it. This one is your prototypical IPA. Lots of hoppiness on the nose and good balance, but bot as juicy and dank as I prefer."
"Very nice mix of pine and citrus going on. Grapefruit and orange both present. Fairly bitter, but offset a bit by a nice caramel malt base. The nose gives off pine resin and citrus. Tasty."
How I love IPA's...
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a one finger soapy white head. Not much retention, but excellent sheets of lacing. Smell is pine, citrus and grapefruit. Taste is similar with a huge resiny dankness and a good deal of bitterness on the back end. Feel is light and almost sticky from the dankness. Overall this beer is amazing. Blows a lot of west coast IPAs that are actually from the west coast out of the water. Will need to trade for some more Fat Heads beers soon."
Good white head and a very apparent floral perfume hop smell. Very full mouth feel due to the carbonation. Bittef back end that hides the malt completely. Solid beer!
Poured from 12oz bottle dated 12/11/2015 into a pint glass. Clear golden copper color with good residual head. Bright citrus aroma and taste with excellent hop bite. A stellar IPA which I continually revisit.
"Look - A clear golden color, good amount of carbonation "
"Big Suprise here. Drank one after Jai Alai and think this was much better, dangerously drinkable"
"Orange-yellow with a moderate white head, there's a fair amount of pine with orange rind and grapefruit, but it's also spicy, slightly dank, and a little more fruity than that sounds. Fat Head's likes to lean West Coast and this is one of their flagship efforts on that front, with a nice bitter bite, but at the same time it's is quite a drinkable brew that's not too far overboard at all, and a very reliable go-to."
"Opaque gold pour verging on lite copper (9); loose white head following draft pour. Aromas of grapefruit and lemon grass hops. Strong bitter grapefruit with caramel malt supporting the bitter hop flavors. Moderate carbonation and medium lite mouthfeel. Overall excellent balance of malt and hops, leaving a pleasing zesty lemon rind/bitter linger."
"This is what I'm looking for in a respectable IPA. Just enough sweetness to balance it out, but hoppy enough to feel like chewing on a pine cone. Very little bitterness in this one, as it fades to light tropical and floral flavors like pineapple and guava. Gimme more of that citrusy resinous goodness!"
"Fresh bottles, poured into snifter."
"32 oz Crowler purchased at the Hulmeville Inn in Langhorne, PA."
"Decent looking brew. Smell is a 100% pine bomb. Rarely get that smell in IPAs these days. Taste follows the nose with strong pine hops, a touch of floral and plenty of resin. Also a nice malt balance. Moderate bitterness. A very solid IPA. Not exactly my usual wheel house for IPAs but its a very good beer. Enjoy."
"Head Hunter pours a slight dark golden color. The nose has a fruity malty sweetness to it. The body has a bready sweetness, medium bitterness with a dry finish."
Great citrus notes with a crisp finish.
"Head Hunter is always running through my veins… Living <15mins from the production brewery MIGHT be a reason why, but it really is because the beer is just so damn good. I actually only drink this fresh on tap, never from the bottle."
Actually 4.4 a really good beer
A: clear golden to amber orange with yellow. Thin opaque head
L: A dull Golden amber appearance (yellowish/orange)
B-spot
I have nothing but good to say about this beer. packed with flavor with every gulp.
L: Translucent yellow-orange.
"Gold to copper color, decent head, good bitterness."
Look is amazing. Smell is attractive. Initial taste is of kumquats and figs. Pretty good overall taste but noticeable alcohol taste. 
"Had this on tap at the pint room. Color was an almost transparent golden yellow, very light for an ipa. Some good lacing, white head. Aroma and flavor were all citrus, aroma was a little light considering the flavor. Solid taste. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh, even for an IPA with this much booze. Good, maybe a touch overrated."
"Drank in my damn house! 12 oz bottle in my HF chalice. Date tough to read, but just received in a trade, and dude shipped fresh, so I'm guessing no older than a month."
"This is a high quality workhorse IPA. Smells great when fresh, and even when it's not super fresh, has a very pleasant resiny, grapefruit taste. Dry finish with some spicy carbonation."
Bottle poured into a BarrelHouse Brewing Co pint glass
Pours orangey amber with a big one inch head and lacing.
"Oh yeah, that's a fruity IPA. Not a fan of $12 for a four pack, but this one is worth it. Not often that I find a memorable IPA these days, but this was one. Highly recommended"
"12oz bottle, pretty old (3 months) into a snifter"
"Poured cold into a tulip glass. Consumed on 8/10/14, bottled less than a month ago."
Woah Midwest! Kinda crazy how this brewery is overlooked outside the state. Aggressive west coast style with bittersweet pineapple and grapefruit stealing the show. Not balanced in the least yet it is not bitter for bitterness sake. Great carbonation with a dry crisp finish. Very drinkable for the Abv Ibu combo going on. This is the best IPA I have had in some time. Can't believe this is their year round offering. Wish it came is 6packs though. Kudos Fat Heads!
"This is a very good IPA. The best I've had out of Ohio. Not quite the level of some of the IPA's out of the northeast or some of Stone's better IPA, but just a couple steps behind."
This one deserves its lofty reputation. I am an IPA fan and I can say this is one of the top 5 I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. It hits all the notes you want in a great IPA squarely on the nose. Very impressed.
"L: looks like an IPA. Nice head, and good lacing."
Thanks Phil for the hookup! 12 oz bottle dated 6/19/15 poured into a Tree House Teku glass
"I big juicy, hoppy IPA...highly recommended."
Pours a deep golden color. Has a huge aroma of citrus piny hops. Has a big flavor of citrus with an almost resin pony taste. A nice touch of malt to balance and a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. Great beer
"Pours hazy amber-orange with a moderate white head that retreated fairly quickly but left nice tracks. Aromas of citrus, grapefruit, orange. Taste is cleanly bitter, with more citrus and some resin, slightly dank. Little malt but medium-bodied with a great feel. Clean dry finish with a bitter ring. Love this IPA."
Enjoyed on tap and in bottles several times during a week long trip to the Pittsburgh area.
look and smell are nothing special
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12-oz brown bottle with a bottled-on date of 15 days ago. Hit with aggressive hop aromas immediately upon pouring. Taste is big, piney hops. There is some citrus flavor, but it wasn't as apparent for me as others had said. The aftertaste is extremely bitter, almost to a fault. All in all though, this is a very well done IPA."
The 4 pack I got was a Feb BOD so I'm sure that it had something to do with it.
"Received this in a trade this weekend. However, it is being poured at about a month and a half after the bottled date. There doesn't seem to be as much of the great citrus flavor I read about. A A little more malt/bread flavor than expected. "
This was poured into a nonic pint glass.
A: [4.00] Pours a light copper to golden color. The beer has a small 1/4 - 1/2 finger of white head. The head is not long lasting. The bottle lists the ABV (7/5%). The is a date code that I cannot figure out.
"Consumed May 29th, 2016 from a 12 ounce bottle with a smeared date code. It looks like April 2016. Poured into one of those fancy Sierra Nevada IPA glasses."
Poured from bottle into tulip glass.
Nice & strong hop bitters hit at first. Finish is strong too with malts sneaking into the full roundness of taste in your mouth.
"Pours a beautiful, fluffy big head, with a vibrant yellow-amber color."
"Color is a golden amber. A lot of tropical fruits here, but also dank and weedy. Mango and pineapple. Very juicy. A solid dipa that I wasn't expecting to be so good."
"This beer really stands out especially for the style. Luckily I live in Ohio and enjoy Great Lakes, Thirsty Dog, Fat Head and Hoppin Frog every week. Very nice mouthfeel and taste. Piney and citrus overall a great west coast style IPA. Highly recommend this beer if you can purchase it."
Nice golden color with an off-white head. Great hoppy aroma with a lot of citrus and pine that builds high expectations. Flavor did not disappoint. A lot of citrus and tropical fruits. Noticable mango and less pine than expected. Good malt balance and sweetness without much alcohol heat. Moderate bitterness that finishes clean at first but builds and lingers a little at the end.
On tap and simply delicious. One of the best IPA offerings I've ever had.
12oz bottle no date.
"Bright cloudy orange with a big white head and spotty lacing. Citrus, pine, light tropical note in the back. Bitter citrus and pine with not much of the tropical note coming through and a light grain backdrop. Bitter, resinous and dank. Well carbonated but thinner than I expected from the cloudy look. Overall a very solid IPA with some big bitter citrus and pine components. Mouthfeel lacks a bit and flavor profile lacks real depth but a straightforward hop punch and that's not a bad thing."
"Pours a nice clear Amber color. Head is a thick foam that dissipates quickly leaving a thin film. Well carbonated. Smell is of clean malt with lots of hop profile. Mango, citrus, pineapple. Taste is crispwith sine nice malt sweetness seeping in, with some bitterness from the hops. Very well balanced. Finishes nice and dry urging you to drink more."
"Hands down the best IPA out of Ohio, and definitely does not get the national credit it deserves. Smell is outstanding with citrus dankness, and tropical fruit. Taste is very bitter, but done exceptionally well. If you like a citrus, resiny, hop explosion, this is for you. Uncivilized and aggressive!"
Been seeking this out for years and was not disappointed.
"Pours a clear golden color with a white head that leaves a little lacing around the glass. Smell is tropical fruit and citrus right away. Taste starts out with bitter orange/grapefruit rind and then paves way to mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and pine resin. Bitterness is very aggressive, but maybe a bit too much for a tropical fruit bomb like this. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but very drinkable. Carbonation is on the higher side. This may be one of the midwest's best interpretations of a west coast IPA, although I think I prefer White Rajah which I just had recently as well."
"Mango nose. Very, very hoppy but not too happy. Citrusy flavors with may be a little a little something in the finnish I can't define other than a good but of hoppiness. Nice for an IPA. Ballsy on the hops."
Wow! Great head and flavor and mouthfeel. Very smooth drinker. Upon first smell and sip all I'm thinking is Resin minus the extra ABV. See it as a go to in the near future....as long as its within reach.
"My go-to beer. Possibly the most under-hyped, best tasting IPA available. Similar to all FH's beers, this is a total hop bomb. Honestly, I kind of hope the BA world keeps giving a sh*t less about this beer so I can keep getting it fresh and delish without too much effort."
A really solid IPA. Great stuff.
Excellent all around IPA. Upfront Hop Profile with an excellent finish.
Had it at a bar I Pittsburg when I asked about a good local ipa and they recommended it. I loved it. Outstanding!
Clear orange amber with two big fingers of off white head. Moderate lacing.
"12 oz. bottle from a 4-pack: deep, clear golden pour with a quickly receding white-head. There was a date stamped on the bottle indicating the ale was less than a month old. "
"Served at the brewery. Powerful, aromatic, bitter and exceptionally good. Awesome IPA."
Not a lot of depth to the flavor profile - ok but not a winner.
"Brought back in my luggage from a trip to Columbus, OH. Bottled on 4/13/15. 42 days old. Poured into a nonic pint glass."
Can't find anything wrong with this beer. Would drink everyday if possible
On tap. Huge pine taste juicy and mouthwatering .
"Great citrus, pine, and resiny hop aromas. Well balanced malt and hop flavors. Not overly bitter or lingering hops. Well made beer."
"Mostly grapefruit on the nose but the taste offers a more robust citrus fruit profile, with some pineapple & some other tropical notes to help smooth out the hop punch. An in-betweener, not as easy & smooth as something like two hearted but not a bitter bomb like lots of IPAs"
"Had heard about Fat Head's on the site for a long time. There is a reason for the hype. This is one of my top ""go-to"" IPAs. Light, refreshing, dank, and delicious."
Look: Poured an orange color with 1 finger of eggshell white head quickly dissipating into a thin cap. Awesome lacing left on the glass.
I got this once and it was terribly oxidized and awful which made me not want to get another one but this one has a bottling date of less than 2 weeks old so I gave it another try.
"Really well done. Had to pay a premium for a bottle in CA but glad I tried it. Great ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavor balanced by a solid but appropriately subtle malt backbone. This west coast IPA, made in the midwest, beats out a lot of IPAs actually brewed over here."
"A fantastic aroma of citrus and biscuity malts. The taste follows the nose, only crisper and brighter. Easy drinking and quite delicious. Another winner from Ohio."
I love this beer - nice balance of piney bitterness and citrus/tropical fruit. Decent enough malt backbone to support the aggressive hoppiness. One of the most underrated IPAs (even in Ohio) out there.
"Very good, citrus isn't overpowering."
"12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Pours a dark gold with 1 finger of dense white foam. Strong pine and citrus on the nose with mangonand grapefruit in the background. Light weight, crisp mouthfeel. Big hop flavor up front. Lots of piney bitterness with some grapefruit and caramel. Decent malt on the back end. Dank, bitter-pine aftertaste."
"Purchased at my local spirits shop in Tampa, FL. $12.99 for the 4-pk, outrageous! Btld 3/10/15, drunk 4/13/15. "
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden/orange color with a 1 inch head. Smell is bursting with grapefruit. Taste is very hoppy, grapefruit, pine, tropical fruits, bitter and dry. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a very good beer."
"Resin, tropical fruit, citrusy finish, not too bitter, good job!"
12 oz bottled on 2/18/2015 poured into an IPA glass. 
"Well, this took too long...."
Great west coast style beer. Can taste the chinook. centennial and cascade hops. Not sure of the exact variety but they did a good job balancing with the hops.
"Mangos, Pineapple, Oranges and a balanced malt backbone that equals the hops. "
"Lots of citrus and grapefruit flavours in this tasty ipa. Smooth finish that doesn't leave you reaching for water. Surprisingly refreshing considering the 86 ibu. On tap at Fat Heads Sah Side, PIT."
First Fat Head that I've been able to get my hands on thus far. 
"First Fat Head's brew in my portfolio. Hop explosion for sure. Beautiful golden color. Lots a of different tastes going on here. Every sip brings out something new. Pine, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, floral notes, lemongrass and other subtle tropical flavors. Dry hop finish and nice carbonation. Definitely a party in your mouth. Great IPA. Looking forward to trying some other Fat Head's offerings."
"Spotted this at Whole Foods. Bottled on 1/7/15, tried on 2/23/15. Well, this one suprised me. Hop bomb for sure. Very light malt presence. Hops more pine, floral then anything else. Glad i was able to try this."
Poured from a bottle into a tulip
"Pours a clear golden color with white head. Pine, citrus, grass, and resinous notes on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes bitter, with a nice hop bite"
"Great every day IPA. Very dry, hop forward beer with bitter after taste. Grapefruit, pineapple, and pine come through on the aroma and taste. Its balanced with pleasant mouth feel."
Bottle was a few months old (12/24/14). Still tasted great. Probably would have been rated higher if it was fresh. Had it on tap a few weeks ago and it was amazing.
MY favorite cleveland beer! Great stuff!!
Update 6 /15 Great color lots lacing to bottom grapefruit and juicy fruit taste and smell with hop and pine finish finsh
"Pours clear golden with a big white head. Fantastic aroma of pine hops, citrus, grapefruit. Taste follows the nose with juicy pine hops, and a citrusy, malty finish. Clean and crisp, this is hands down one of my top 5 IPAs."
"You'll be hard pressed to find a better American IPA, even though this baby is from Ohio and not the west coast."
Top 3 ipa's in my list
"Bright, clear golden color. Pleasant citrus aromas gave way to a palate impression that was dominated by a bitter hop essence, yet did not seem to be out of balance despite a relative lack of accompanying malt qualities. An excellent IPA that would be a fine choice for everyday drinking."
A - Golden clear
This is a great ale. Nice and complex. Hard to find a better IPA.
"Exceptional taste, wonderful, I love ipas and this is now my favorite."
"As far as IPAs goes, this is it. It just doesn't get any better."
"Looks are deceiving as this has the appearance of a common IPA, but as you quaff the aromas from the hops your expectations increase. If you like a huge hop mouthfeel and body in your IPA you can't go wrong with the Headhunter, especially on draft."
"Pretty good IPA, not my favorite but it is a solid beer. You can't go wrong with this one."
Awesome taste. Poured from the growler. Definitely going to look for more!
"Tried on tap in Dayton as well as from bottles at a later date. Poured a dull copper orange and gave off a nice fragrant west-coast hop nose. Typical grapefruit/pine aroma. Mouthfeel could have been a bit fuller, but overall very good flavor. Not as bitter as I expected, but a tasty brew indeed. Might be just average if it was in San Diego, but it seems to shine brighter in Ohio."
It doesn't get much better than this. Extremely drinkable at 7.5%ABV. Top 5 IPA IMHO.
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass, outstanding citrusy hoppy aroma, a great beer!"
12 oz bottle served chilled into a pint glass.
this is a great everyday IPA... right behind sculpin in my book
From a mixed six on a Florida trip. Bottled 9/23/14. More than 3 months old.
Thanks to Benesi88 for this one.
Slightly cloudy gold. Pours with one finger head. Good lacing. Fresh citrus and pine on the nose. Great bitterness with some citrus in the middle. Finishes with a lime-like taste and more bitter. Strong carbonation.
"Piney, earthy, citrus, and juicy. Leaves the mouth pleasantly dry."
This is an IPA for the true IPA lover. The taste is incredible! Awesome beer! Treat yourself to one of you want to get hooked!
Pretty good. Had a couple month old bottle. Had a lot of caramel/malt flavor and smell for an ipa. But afterwards a good hop/resin bitterness and bite
"Picked up a 4 pack in Pensacola (July 2015). 3 weeks old and I got lots of citrus/tropical notes. Overall I thought this was a great beer, wish it was sold in AL"
Lots of really good things. 
I'm a sucker for beers resembling WC IPA's. Here goes:
Had at Pittsburgh Winter BeerFest.
Poured into an IPA glass from a 12 oz bottle.
I went to the new Portland brewpub when the first batch of headhunter released. While having a great aroma it seemed to be lacking in hop flavor and had a harsh bitterness. Still a great beer (4/5) The brewers even admitted they weren't super happy with it and it would get better.
"As a self-professed hop head, I was really looking forward to this. And indeed, the aroma is fantastic. However — and I never thought I'd ever say this — it might be (shudder!) too hoppy, bordering on bitterness beyond palatability. "
2014-11-22
Look 9/10
Draft poured into shaker pint 
"Pours a clear golden amber color. Has a strong resinous piney aroma. This beer smells of dank dank hops. This taste is a tad weaker than the smell which threw me off a bit. Lots of pine and grapefruit and it lingers the perfect amount. Overall this is a great IPA, and at 7.5% it's pretty high for a non-imperial IPA, and the alcohol is masked very well. I'm glad Ohio has more great beers than I can count, including this one."
"Had on draft at Champps in Columbus, OH and also scooped up a sixer from Whole Foods in Columbus. I was super excited to try this one and it did not let me down! big tropical fruit taste, same with the small along with some slight dankness. Just excellent. Wish i had regular access to this one. Another Big Time beer for the Midwest arsenal."
"Thanks to HopFace for the opportunity to try. Served in a shaker pint. Pours a translucent burnt orange with a loose, half-inch, cream-colored head. Great nose - grapefruit, tropical fruit and hints of Simcoe and citrus rind towards the back. Taste expresses less fruitiness and more Simcoe and rind in the forefront with grapefruit (not as sweet) towards the back. Finishes with a light and pleasant herbal bittering between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant carbonation that falls just shy of crisp and biting. There's a slight acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands and also a little maltiness to the body. Overall, a solid IPA. If I had regular access to this, it would be part of my standard line-up."
"The more i drink it, the more I absolutely love it. Phenomenal.like a tropical hop wet dream. Not sure how it could be better. Super drinkable and available year round. My first choice in american IPAs.; re-re-reviewing this. Still amazing. Every time I drink it I think ""why ami not drinking this daily?"".i will continue to prostrate myself unto the fat man, and his elixir of hope."
"Head Hunter has enough hoppiness that it could be coloured green. It's not of course, but it aught to be. This honeyed golden beer is a divine nectar indeed and looks picture perfect: brilliant clarity, resplendent highlighting, stalwart carbonation and a bulky head. "
"pours a clear gold, with a hint of yellow to it, lots of white, creamy foam that retains wonderfully."
"This brew was served from the bottle at The Brick Oven Bistro in Sandusky, Ohio. We poured into a set of half-sized house snifters, and the beer showed a clean sunset orange hue, with a quick finger tall head of white foam. This retained only okay, leaving behind an absence of lacing. No real haze or sediment was noted, and carbonation appeared to be moderate. The aroma gave orange rind bitters, black olives, manila envelope dustiness, sticky caramel and pale maltiness, Band-Aid phenols, mandarin orange juiciness, resiny and grapefruity hoppiness, coiny metallics, lavender and rose petals, dried thyme, harsh tannic tea leafiness, and big musky perfumes, especially as it warmed. The taste gave bittered, chlorine chemical bite, citric and grassy hop bitterness, pale and amber adjuncty grain, fusel booziness, bitter herbal rumbles lactic creaminess, plastic phenols, light clove and black pepper spiciness, green sap resins, toasty pales, acidic tomato vegetals, gingerbread and pumpernickel starchiness, and tight aluminum metallics. The body was medium, and the carbonation was light. This translated into very light creaminess and mustache to the slurp, smack, froth, and pop, with the lips left otherwise evenly wet and tingling. Puck trumped astringency along the palate and cheeks. The abv was appropriate, and the beer drank back lightly and nicely."
"Clear yellow/orange color. Nose has some earthy hops, but not a lot. Taste is all earthy bitter hops. Finish is more of the same. A solid but one track beer."
"Clear amber brew, light and golden, topped by a decent snow white head with good retention and nice lacing."
Look: Crystal clear honey orange with a medium white head. Mild activity. 
Hop Heads Dream Beer!
"On draft, Modica Market seaside. Sculpin on roids, nuff said."
"Description: Clear, honey color with one finger of white head. Smell is clear, unquestionable hops and pine. The taste is similar as loads of bitter, hoppy goodness comes through to an exceedingly clean, dry finish. This is a West Coast IPA all the way. I thought there might have been some malt or sweetness once the beer warmed but whatever it was fleeting at best and might have just been my imagination. Body is light to medium."
Huge thanks to my friend Jay for this Ohio find! 64 oz growler into a wine glass.
"Pours a relatively clear, orange color with a thick, compact, doughy, white head. Lines and bands of lacing. Aroma is filled with pungent, musty oranges and onion notes. Spicy hops. Soft, sweet, sugary malt. Flavor just smacks you with upfront citrus. Grapefruit uprising. Piney and grassy and hempy. Tropical fruitiness (mango, specifically) is detectable but starts to burn off by the aggressive bitterness. A submissive maltiness is a bit toasty. Percussive bitterness. Moderate carbonation. Resinous. It always feels good to finally nab a beer you've been eyeing and it also isn't a letdown. This beer is mightily hoppy. Bottled offering."
"Amazing IPA, excellent taste and quality."
FatHead's Headhunter IPA. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a glass. 
12 oz bottle from 4 pack dated 8/3 into tulip glass
"Very good. Excellent IPA, or American IPA if you must. Huge flavor, tons of hops and simply awesome."
"12 oz bottle, no date"
Appearance: Copperish amber. Leaves an OK head lace. Some 
"Pours with a rolling, huge, off-white head. Color is a clear amber. Smells of resin, pine and subtle peach. Tastes earthy with a wave of citrus, a slight chalkiness, orange peel and subdued spice. Medium-bodied with a touch of alcohol heat. Straight up IPA awesomeness."
Big Thanks to Michael Gabor for letting me taste this one!
"Pours a golden hue, little-to-no foam head forms. The nose is nice, grapefruit/citrus and juicy qualities. The nose is killer, its got some big mango notes as well - my favorite smell. Taste is delicious, lot of juicy qualities still - leaves you with a bitter bite but its welcomed at this point. a true to style IPA with tons of flavor. Hop forward punch in your face in the end but nice medium mouthfeel, alcohol cold be hidden just a bit better but this is very good, I will seek it out again."
"This pineapple, citrus, pine, punch in the face is very tasty. A good, dry hop profile really makes for a crisp tasting IPA. This beer has excellent carbonation giving an enjoyable, balanced mouthfeel.. The beer pours a small head and looks amazing in the goblet. This brew lives up to its ratings and I would seek it out again."
"Reviewed during the last week when out of service area/Wifi in WY/UT. Full phone notes taken at the Watchman Campground, Zion National Park, UT."
"12 oz shorty brown bottle. Label consists of literally of a bright blue sky with clouds forming and the typical but great Fat Head sitting directly in the middle of the label. His style this time is of a tribal head hunter. Face paint, piercings, shades and all. Just more fun artwork from Fat Heads. Poured into a nonic pint glass."
"A: light tea orange with moderate carbonation, seafoam head and flakes of yeast floating around the glass."
"12oz bottle from the 7.9.14 batch, enjoyed out of a teku"
"12 oz bottle. Date of 07/14/14, just under a week old!"
"I poured it into a glass, it has a gold color body with a small head to it. The aroma has a piney smell to it. The taste is in your face hop explosion. Pine notes and slight bitterness follows. The mouthfeel is good, well balanced and leaves a hop aftertaste on your tongue."
"Bottle date 7/9/2014. I had to double check, as I never thought I would get to try this beer at a week old. "
Pours an effervescent gold with 3 fingers of cream colored head. Good lacing & great head retention
"Single bottle, bottled on date was too smeared to read. [re-reviewed, bottle dated 9-14-15, again, very smeared]"
"Straight pour from a 12oz pry-off bottle to a fat tulip; there’s a bottling date of June 2, 2014 printed in yellow ink on the side of this bottle, making it just under three weeks old at 20 days (“BOTTLED ON 06/02/14 13 19”). "
Bottled 6/12/14 and poured 6/22/14. $10 four pack.
"Very good IPA, worth your money."
You can definitely smell the cascade and taste the simcoe. It's light to medium with quarter inch head. It's a beautiful light copper color (probably crystal 20 or 30 in the malt). Overall great IPA. Will definitely be added to my regular rotation (if it ever gets any cheaper)!
"Undated bottle into an IPA glass. Hadn't planned on reviewing this (didn't love JuJu and didn't have high hopes for this), but it surprised me, so here we are."
This is based on the most recent bottle I sampled.
A - a nice amber golden color with a good head
Super resin aroma of what I'm guessing is Simcoe and Cascade. About as much hop aroma as you could ever squeeze in to a beer. Slight woody and earthy smell. 
"Big ups, no wait, big big ups, to kgncfl for gracing me with a bottle of this longtime want. Well worth the wait. A fruity, juicy bomb that goes down aggressively and easily at the same time. Extra shot of hops on the finish. Highly recommended. Possibly a permawant for me."
"Bottled 4/28, very fresh."
"Poured from the tap, nice golden color, good carbonation, nice thick head and lacing all the way down. The aroma has great floral hop and citrus scent. Flavor is perfectly balanced. Good malt base, with great and well balanced hop flavor and bitterness. This is really one of the best IPA's out there."
"12oz, Bottled on 04/14/14. New brewery for me. Indiana pick up at Liquor Stop in Highland - a place I haven't stopped in at in years"
Poured from a 12 ounce glass into a teku.
The Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA is an outstanding beer. I first tried this off the tap on only rated it. But my wife recently visited Ohio and stopped by a beer store to kindly pick me up a bottle. The beer poured a clear golden color with white head that is leaving a lace. The scent was fresh hops bordering on bitterness and pine. The taste was crisp and bordered more on bitter with touches of sweet malt and pine like hops. The mouthfeel was medium body with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer and would recommend it to any one who like the Z'Dust.
A- bronze color with some nice creamy lacing but not much head.
Appearance: It has a nice hazy golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderately and leaves nice lacing.
"A - The beer appears a complex orange with a great deal of debris floating amongst the steady stream of bubbles rising to the surface. White, sticky, good looking lacing. "
A- bright amber that is not completly clear
"a: Clear, orange tinted golden color; served with a small, foamy cap. "
Poured into a snifter a rich yellow body with a small head. Down to tiny ring with a bit of lacing. Smell wasn't big but what was there was tropical fruit and sweet malt. Taste was a very good balance of hop and malt. Here you get the grapefruit with very little bitterness and sweet caramel malt. Very pleasing to the palate with slight carbonation and very little bitterness. Solid brew that could be an everyday for me.
bottled 2/11/14-- date on the bottle
This is my favorite IPA that I've ever had; sampled this beaut at the FatHeads on the Southside of Pittsburgh in a pint glass. Could God have crafted 16.9 oz more perfectly? I'm not sure... 
Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a willibecher. This was bottled on 03/19/2014 - 1 month ago.
A- Dull copper with a 1 finger white head. Lacing is soapy
"Bottle purchased at Pace High Carry-Out in Columbus, OH."
After its recent 2nd silver medal I decided to review an old stand by
Availability- year round...style- IPA(west coast style)
"This bottle is about 4 weeks old, poured into the Spiegelau glass. Looks clear, carbonated, and a beautiful deep hue. Aromas are off the hook. Big citrus, a hint of pine, orange juice, fresh smelling as can be. Love everything about these aromas. Huge hit of citrus on the front end, major bitterness (and so clean), and strong backbone. To me, this drinks like a big DIPA. Clean mouthfeel with a bitter note that reminds you of the freshness. This is a awesome IPA. One of my very tip top. Get it!"
"Pours a golden color with a hint of amber. Off white head that holds fairly well before fading into a medium collar and wisps of head across the surface. Fair lacing. Aroma is bold citrus (grapefruit and lemon) with some resiny pine and a bit of pineapple. Medium body and high carbonation with a good hop bite. Taste is complex. Grapefruit, pineapple, pine and floral hops all intermingle and compete for attention. The aftertaste is piney, grapefruit in the front. I had this with two weeks from bottling and the flavors were much more pronounced and played better. This was written from a 3.5 week old bottle."
"This is a great IPA with an amazing taste and a smell that's even better! Golden tint with light amber in color, with great head and nice even lacing around the glass. The spicy, citrus, and pine nose really started thing off great and the beer tastes almost as good as it smells. A bit of bitterness, but the sting leaves the tongue after a few sips... I taste hints of heavy citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, roasted carmel, and even a little bit of spiciness which is my favorite thing about this brew. This is one of my favorite IPAs I've tried as of recently, I would for sure recommend it to any IPA lover!"
Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle acquired in a trade with mps
"One of the better IPA's I have had here in Pittsburgh! This was a delicious beer, poured a nice golden/orange color and smelled of grapefruit, citrus, hops, pine, and a bit of lemon. Once I tasted it I was hooked! Crisp clean IPA taste! If you find this beer I highly recommend drinking this one! Two Thumbs Up!!"
"Had fresh on tap. Looks decent. Smell is probably one of the best IPAs I have ever smelled. Floral fruity hoppy goodness. Tastes great. Just enough sweetness. Blossoms in your mouth. One of the best IPAs I've ever had. Up there with 90 minute IPA and Jai Alai. If you find it, drink it."
Appearance: yellowish orang color. a finger of a white head that fades slowly and leaves a little bit of a lacing behind. some haze but no where near opaque.
Pours unfiltered gold/orange with a bit of yeasty chunks. Forms a two finger soapy cap of white with good retention and scattered lacing.
"Pours golden copper with a big soapy head. The nose is full of pine, lemon, and hop resin, with perfumy hops and clean malty sweetness. Bitter grapefruit hop flavors abound, but are kept in check with caramel malt, toasted oat notes, and sweeter fruits like pineapple. The end result is a tasty, balanced brew that is straightforward without being one-note. Mouthfeel is medium and the alcohol is well hidden."
12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter
"More thorough review to come later, but in brief this is one of my personal favorites. Moved around PA over the last four years, but just became acquainted with this brew in 2013. Fantastic citrus-leading IPA. Clean crisp taste, with a light overall mouthfeel. "
tasted from both a bottle and a poured into a glass. 
"Nice golden amber on the pour. Nose is pretty standard, but nice pine and floral hop scents -- a little less tropical fruit than some. Flavor makes it squarely a ""Midcoast"" IPA (I.e. Midwest take on a West Coast style). Pungent hops are warmed over with a heavy pour of sweet, gooey malt. The proceedings are well balanced and clean. Good beer all around."
This is the holy grail. Beautiful copper pour into snifter with nice head and awesome citrus and smash mouth hop aroma. This beer is what others aspire to be. Great malt balance and hop head kick you in the mouth. Matt and Fat Heads hit a grand slam with this classic.
"Pours a beautiful, clear golden orange with a half inch fluffy, off-white head. Simmers down to a slim film, leaving spider web lacing on the glass. Citrus fruits shine through the first whiff, followed by a malt, caramel sweetness. All of which play nicely off each other. Citrus fruits, grassy notes flow across the tongue first. The malt flavors finish it off. Another medium body IPA, that's smooth and finishes with a nice bitterness. Overall, another fantastic IPA from the Midwest."
Pours out a clear orange with a thick two finger off-white head. Leaves some lacing and has good retention. 
Bottling date of 01/29/14
Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass at around 45°F
"Just as the bottle suggests . . . this beer is uncivilized and Aggressive. Pours a deep and dark burnt yellow with floating sediments. An awesome, glowing ipa ! Smell is dank with huge hop scents of pine, grapefruit, citrus and pineapple. Huge hop bitterness and flavor. Above mentioned fruits and a touch of caramel. Medium-sized feel with tangy carbonation. Resiny and sticky. Leaves a sticky finish on the lips. A punch you in the mouth brew for those who truly love their hops !"
Poured from the bottle into a Spiegelau Dogfish Head IPA glass. Bottled Feb 17th 2014.
I was let down with this one but will be giving it another chance when I find some fresher bottles.
Poured into a tulip glass from the bottle. 
Appearance: Pours with just under a finger of head. Sticky lacing left behind. Color is a burnt orange color. Moderate active carbonation. 
"Has a great golden look with good everything and a great citrus smell. Only reason I downgrade the taste is because it's to bitter but has a good citrus taste as well. Creamy but crisp feel with a full body. Pretty good but like I said, to bitter for all the other taste."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a tulip glass, extra'd courtesy of great BA member Madcap74"
"Pours a clear orange with some yeast sediment, two fingers of white foam that settles to a thin ring with big splotches of lace on the glass. Smell: grapefruit rind, apricot, big simcoe dank blast. Taste: tangerine, tropical note, rindy, soft biscuit in the back. Sweet, drying finish. Well done."
12oz Bottle received in trade with iguenard - thanks!
The beer comes in a clear reddish amber.
This was one of my goal beers on my Ohio buying trip and I was not disappointed. This ale pours a very cloudy copper color with a ton of sediment (god I love unfiltered beers). The head is off white and short lasting but the lacing is quite substantial. The nose is a delicious blend of bitter hops; both citrus and pine. This offering smells very fresh and lively. The taste totally follows suit; all hops. It is a sparkling delicious and fresh ipa. Not complex but awesomely is what it is. Think hopslam but smoother and a little less in your face. This is a great beer and will pick up every time I'm in Ohio.
"Sampled on tap at Melts in Independence, OH. "
Update: bumped it up a little after having it again. I think I had a fresher bottle this time.
12oz bottle to small snifter. Bottled on 12/27/13. Sampled 09FEB14.
"This is my go to IPA. Living in Pittsburgh this is readily available all the time. This is an aggressive IPA, not an IPA starter. A nice grapefruit, tropical fruit flavors, with heavy floral notes. Hoppy in the front and in the finish. If you love an aggressive IPA this is the beer for you."
12oz bottle poured into tulip.
"I've had this beer so many times, it's about damn time I reviewed it. Spoiler alert: I'm gonna rate it highly. It's my go-to IPA. Hands down. LOVE this beer. Also, this one is two days ""old."" That's about as good as it gets."
"A: Pours a clear golden amber. Tall and frothy white head. Head fades slowly as can be with great retention. Heavy, fluffy chunks of lacing abound."
"Looks a light copper with nice fluffy white head with good lacing. Smells of tropical fruit, hop resin, juicy juice, and starburst. Tastes resin with hop nectar & juices. Tropical fruit is there. Nice bit of bitterness, but not too much that's overwhelming. Medium bodied with plenty of hop juices to way you down. Very satisfying when you need a hop fix. Overall, a very nicely brewed IPA. Find this out! It's definitely worth it."
Bottle dated 10/22/13 but my distributor just got it!
Poured into a chalice from the bottle. 
This beer is the jam- bitter like a mofo and piney as a forest. This is one of my all time favorite IPAs. Clear and two finger head with a vigorous pour (pour vigorously).
Super excited to try this one! Another find at Palm Beach TW. 
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.. acquired as an extra in a trade. 
"12 oz. bottle poured aggressively into a 500 mL Unibroue tulip. Bottled date is 06 Dec 2013. This stuff is the freshie-fresh, barely 4 days old. "
"Color is transparent orange, but hazy. Nose is citrusy and great. Taste is citrus, orange peel, grapefruit, pine. This is sweet, but not overly sweet, just right. The mouth is slightly creamy, which tames the citrus astringency just enough to make it perfect. This beer is more like an Imperial than an IPA so I enjoy it in a snifter, and sip on it. Could be the perfect beer. Hoppy, but the hop bite is a soft bite. Awesome. Bottle."
Appearance is a golden yellow color with a two finger head.
Yet another awesome IPA.
Poured into a Funky Buddha Brewery snifter. Bottleneck says Bottled 08/30/13.
A: A dense finger of bright white head formed when poured into an english style pint glass. Retention was low/moderate but when it fell it left a coat of foam on the entire edge of the glass with no dry spots. The beer is a light copper color with a mild amount of haze. A few particles of hop sediment settled in the bottom of the glass.
"A - Pours a relatively clear golden copper color with a finger of light tan head, fantastic retention and near perfect lacing. An incredibly thick/dense outer ring remains 10-15 minutes after the pour with a very thin layer of head across the surface."
A- poured into a glass has a nice golden orange color with little off white head that dissipates quickly.
Thanks to sideshowe for hooking me up with these bottles. 
"12oz bottle, no clear bottling date, at bd Mongolian BBQ in Coventry (Cleveland OH). Poured into an unlabeled pint glass. This is the third time I've had this beer, but the first time I'm feeling like reviewing this."
"I don't normally expect much from little known breweries, but after having their autumn seasonal, I had to give this a try."
12oz bottle dated 10/3/13 poured into an IPA glass
Thanks to Kurmaraja for this one. Poured into 10oz goblet. Poured a medium hazy bright gold color with about 1/3 inch of white that had moderate retention and good lacing.
"The pride of Pittsburgh- for beer-Even if brewed in Ohio. Had it on tap 2 years ago at Fatheads southside. Now thanks to my iron city in-laws gave procured multiple bottles. Let me first say there is no other IIPA that can hold a candle to this beer'S aroma- pungent pine, spruce, freshly cut grass. I would buy for the aroma itself. Great bitterness and mouthfeel and the flavor lingers of summer evergreen nights and bitter grapefruit mornings. Great balance and finish. Have had it on tap and most recently in bottle. This review orompted by cellar temp drinking. So so good and satisfying. A hidden gem, kinda like the iron city. Find it in pittsburgh and not much farther but so worth the physical and beer drinking trip. Cheers"
Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint glass. I got a case of this rare gem (around these parts anyway) from Kunda Beverage who somehow got a few fresh cases in. Beer was dated 2 weeks prior when purchased.
Thanks to drewone for sharing this one at his tasting.
Bottled 9/13/13
Crystal clean profile to this IPA it's color tends more to a golden than a typical offering. The head was alive in a boldly fizzy crown that build for a while and dissipated slowly.
"A - Golden, orange with a fluffy 2 finger white head that leaves a small layer of foam behind along with a few patches of foam clinging to the side of the glass."
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an English style pint glass. 
Enjoying this IPA thanks to an awesome gift from FlakyBiscuit - thanks Alan!
Poured this undated 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams glass. The body was a bright golden copper color that left a thin lacing in the glass. 
Thanks so much to Stakem for bringing me one back from the 'Burgh for tenderbranson69 and me to try-enjoyed chilled from the shortneck brown bottle. 
Special thanks to Phyl21ca for sending this beer out west in a great trade.
Read that mrandypandy was going to the brewery in a random mass BM and going to be at a bar in Atlanta a few days after so he graciously got me a 4 pack and I'll forever thank him. 
Poured from Bottle to a pint glass
"Had this on tap at the Pittsburgh location and took a couple bottles home for the formal review. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. The brew appears a clear golden orange with a white cap a finger strong that fades to a thin film leaving a full wall of sticky lace. When held to the light, some yellow is seen around the edges."
12-oz bottle to tulip. Bottled on 8/30/2013. Consumed 9/12/2013.
"Flavorful, pretty heavily-hopped like current west-coast style quad-hopping (I am currently judging all IPAs by the standard of having experienced Heady Topper). Carbonation is a bit on the aggressive side. Overall a pretty well balanced IPA. Not an Imperial but very drinkable. I liked the beer, and the friendliness of the brewery."
Had this beauty in a mug at Fat Head's in Pittsburgh. 
Poured Head Hunter into a Belgian Tulip.
"Damn near one of the best IPAs on the market. Love the aroma, really punches you in the nose with citrus and piney notes. Great pour, perfect head with nice lacing. Great hoppy taste, but you still recognize that their is malt in their, not all bitterness. Easily worth getting an entire case of cause it is so easy to drink. Solid all around."
Poured from the bottle into a snifter. 
"Bottle, bottled on 07/22/13, drank on 09/01/13."
Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA
Bottle poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours a hazy orange with just under a finger of loose off white head of mostly tiny bubbles. Decent lacing from swirling up the head a little bit. 
"12oz bottle poured into a stemless wine glass, enjoyed with family at a great BBQ."
Poured from 12 oz bottle into tulip.
"bottled 7-22, served in a tulip."
Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass with a nice 2 inch thick creamy head head that took it's time to settle down and left some nice lacing on the glass. The color of the beer was a golden orange and it was a bit hazy.
A - Hazy orange with a two finger white head
Poured from tap into pint glass at the brew pub in Ohio. Nice golden orange with a thick 2finger fluffy white head. Nice. 
"Pours a clear orange with a white, three-fingered head. Retention is very good with good lacing. This is what an American IPA should look like! Aroma dominated by grapefruit and pineapple, followed by resinous pine. Little malt sweetness to speak of, the nose is all about hops! Classic west coast IPA. Bitterness dominates the palate, pine resin up front, grapefruit rind right behind. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, Head Hunter finishes dry, with strong astringency. Overall, a supremely crafted IPA in the West Coast style!"
"Ok so this is an interesting one. I'm lucky enough to have fresh access to all 3 of the awesome Ohio IPAs (Columbus, White Rajah, and Headhunter). I have also had HT, PtE, OTWOA, Jai Alai, and the list goes on. Let me tell you that nothing compares to Headhunter that is only a couple days old. It is impossible to find because you have to be lucky enough to find a store that gets it within a couple days of it getting bottled (I went to friggin Fatheads Brewery today and the freshest HH they had was bottled on 8/2.... like seriously!!?!?) but if you can somehow find it fresh, I swear this is the best IPA on the market. It is a waterfall of incredible hoppiness and as smooth as Heady. The mouthfeel is top notch and I swear the nose is so perfect I wish I could capture it in an air freshener. But do be warned, no beer falls off like this puppy. After 2-3 weeks its cringeworthy, a month, bleeehkk! only the drain enjoys the taste at that point. "
"A - bright orange with a big, soft, dense cap of off white head that has good retention and leaves great lacing on the glass"
"Dark honey yellow in color with a heavy chill haze. Poured with a big frothy foam that reduced to a thick cap that never faltered. Huge sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent citrus hop aromas, ripe orange and pineapple, with faint pine hop notes in the distance. Hop aromas are delicate enough to allow sweet caramel to show through beneath the hoppiness. Medium bodied with a slight oily feel and aggressive, but not fizzy carbonation. Pungent citrus hop flavors down the middle with pine hops on the edges. Nice sweet caramel malt backbone keeps the bitterness in check. Citrus flavors taper through the middle as the pine hops take over to the end. Finishes with a strong, lingering pine hop bitterness. A nice variety of hop aromas and flavors."
"Wow, what a a great beer. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Delicious and full of flavor. I am never disappointed with Fat Heads Brewery & Saloon. Very pleased with this brew and I have since recommended it to many. Very excited to get this again."
12 oz. bottle.
"Says bottled July 30, 2013, enjoyed August 2, 2013. That is fresh, and I am impressed that it got to Florida within a day from Ohio (arrived at shop on July 31!). Pours a yellowish orange, hazy, with a very small white head. Aroma is big mango and pine hops, grapefruit, pineapple, lots of citrus. Flavor is a nice big bitter with beautiful mango flavor with hints of lime zest. High carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Good beer."
Bottled on 7.15.2013
Poured into a heady topper stemless glass.
"Small white head on a hazy, copper body. The foam settles moderately and leaves nice lace. A very nice citrus and dank pine aroma. Sweet malt in the flavor with a bit of pine and sweaty hops. Medium thick body, average carbonation, and a balanced finish. Very nice, the aroma really shines with a great combination of citrus and tropical fruit."
Bottle: Poured a bright clear orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some a good lacing. Aroma consists of fruity ester with some citrus hoppy notes and light sweet malt notes. Taste is also dominated by citrusy hops with fresh sweet fruity notes and some lightly sweet malt notes with limited level of bitterness. Body is about average with good carbonation. Definitely above standard IPA from those guys.
Poured into FFF Teku
Pours vibrant burnt yellow with some haze. A finger of head and lots of lacing.
Appearance: Head Hunter has a nice orange color and is topped with a 1” of white head that has great retention to it.
Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass.
Pours a hazed honey copper color with two fingers of white foam.
I drank out of the bottle and will need to edit this review later for appearance.
A : Poured a clouded orangish color with a 1/4 inch white head. There is a good amount of white lacing present. 
A - A hazy orange somewhat close to copper. The head dissipates quick but with nice lacing. 
Out of a bottle and in the backyard.
"Ah, here we are. A want for awhile now. I received this today from a trade with michaellcoates - thanks, buddy! 7.5% ABV confirmed. ""American-Style India Pale Ale."" 87 IBU. Expectations are through the roof; this is my first beer from Fat Head's and its on the list of top beers. Really looking forward to it. Don't see a bottle date/julian code. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with cool fun label and orange branded pry-off cap served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. "
"Thanks, Todd! Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. No freshness or bottling date on the bottle. Oh, well."
"Pours a tangerine color with a half finger of head, pretty clear."
Bottled in April 2013. Poured into Greenbush snifter
"Having a bottle at Arena Bar & Grill in Wilkes Barre, PA. Served in a goblet."
Poured a two week old bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nice orangish gold with a two finger head . Smell is pine upfront with some great citrus in the background. Taste is fantastic. Similar to aroma an initial bitter rush of pine finished with a grapefruit kick that stays with you. A nice dry finish makes it an easy drinker that hides the abv well. One of the best ipas out there to me. Happy to live within walking distance and get this on a regular basis.
"Pours a rich, coppery color with a thick foam. The nose is not very strong, so you're not really sure what you're in for. However, the flavors in this one are so good, I almost put the whole bottle down before I had time to type up the review. It has just a touch of malt to it, but the piney notes assure you that the hops are in control. The overall mix of bitter flavors are excellent, and while they are aggressive, they're not too, well, ""too."" It lingers in your mouth long after the liquid is gone, but not in a way that makes you need to clean it out. It's a great beer that I wish I had unlimited access to in my area."
"As I pour this one into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass I first seem to get very little, but quickly find out I was wrong. My head gets to the top of my glass and trickles over at around 3 fingers. Head is a soft doughy beige in tone. Tones of lace is left behind with nice retention. Body is a bold copper amber in tone. The whole look itself is very enticing. Nose is of fresh cut grass and grapefruit rind. There is a hint of lemon zest and pepper also. All in all the nose is a bit soft. With first sip you get a creamy bitter dance on the tongue. The rind tones really build up the bite as you drink. Piny and rustic with layers of deep dry hops. Really develops well as you enjoy this on. It did start a bit on the soft side but finishes wonderfully. Mouthfeel is one that really hangs on and is monstrously bitter(in a good way)."

12 oz bottle from Ridglens poured into a wine tasting glass
Bottled served in a weizen glass
Teku glass.
poured 12oz bottle into snifter. 
Pours a hazy golden amber with a two finger frothy white head that fades slowly leaving moderate lacing.
"Pours a slighty clear amber-ish color with a soapy white head. Lacing relatively average in the tulip glass, but there are more important attributes to IPA than lacing."
"a beautiful clean copper/amber in color with 2 fingers of frothy off-white head, lots of visible carbonation and excellent lacing. the smell is wonderful, tons of cascade/centennial west coast piney hops, a really nice caramel profile, grapefruit scent is very present. a wonderful sweet malty experience with blasts of grapefruit citrus and piney/floral hops.. this tastes sooo fresh it's ridiculous. medium body with moderate carbonation.. creamy on the lips, but goes down nice and easy making it an extremely refreshing ipa."
"On tap at Friday's in Terre Haute IN. Never had tried it, and took the recommendation of the bartender. Turn out to be, in my opinion, an ideal IPA"
A - Gold with large white head
"12oz bottle from Delock's Discount Liquors (Munster, IN). 8.99/ 4 pack. No bottling date. Served in a Burnt Hickory snifter. "
"Gifted to me by a friend following a trip to Pittsburgh; excited to try given high ranking + non-availability in New York. Fat Head’s markets this as a west coast-style IPA, and while some of the hallmark WCIPA flavors are present, this strikes me as more of a Midwestern, Two-Hearted-style drinker."
"Received in trade from cpetrone84, thanks for the opportunity."
"12 oz bottle courtesy of mgbickel pours a hazed gold color with a large, sticky cap of off-white head. Awesome lacing."
Poured into my new DFH IPA glass.
"Aggressive pour yields a chill hazed light copper body with a frothy 2 inch cream head that slowly dissipates, leaving spotty lacing."
"best ipa ive ever had - better then the elder, zombiedust, etc... i love it. ive had it on tap and in bottle. i live in pittsburgh, where we have a fatheads, but i say definitely worth the pain to get it. it is 100% over the top and aggressive. not for fair weather ipa fans."
12 oz. bottle poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass.

"A- Pours a brilliant, deep gold with a medium, 2 finger, frothy head. Retention and lacing are great. Very slight haze, but clarity is very high for the most part. Just a beautiful looking beer in the glass."
Tasted On: 03-24-2013
First had: ? 
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Off white head, low to moderate retention. Clear lacing on a clear, light copper body. Aroma is dominated by intense, resinous, piney, grassy, hoppy goodness. Taste is biting and bitter, intensely hopped, I'm sure the malt backbone is in there somewhere. Totally out of balance and totally delicious. Delivers on the promises made on the label. Excellent."
Bottle into glass
"Appearance is good and bad. The bad is that while it's a light copper color, it's extremely clear and very translucent...only slightly darker than ginger ale, so points off for that. However, the head is gorgeous and fits the style to a T. Three fingers of bright white, foamy meringue sits up top this clearness in a glass. Great retention as there's still a finger of froth after several minutes and a thick, sticky lace left behind."
Slightly oily body that is a mix of gold and orange full of citrus taste. The carb is on point and helps guide the hop profile across the palate. This IPA is west coast all the way. Distinctly bitter that is delicious cold and becomes a bit overpowering as it warms.
"Clean and beautiful amber in appearance, this West Coast-style IPA pours with a huge head of off-white foam and an exquisite amount of detailed lace."
"A-Clear orange, nicely carbonated, two finger head."
"12 oz bottle, generously shared by someone at Hunahpu Day 2013."
A: The body is a deep golden yellow with a one finger off white head.
"Pours a classic sunset orange color with a finger length white head that goes down slowly and leaves a thick lacing. Pretty good carbonation comign off the glass. Smells like an ipa should. Lots of resinous pine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, maybe some papaya. Tiny bit of a bready malt presence. Pretty dry. Taste starts with the resinous pine, grapefruit, and orange. Then there is a decent malt presence that brings some carmel and breadiness to balance it a little. Very resinous, dry finish with more pine, grapefruit, some pineapple, papaya, along with some sweetness to cut the hops. Almost like a bubblegum flavor. The hops get more abrasive as it goes down. Pretty hefty body for a single ipa. Creamy and surprisingly clean mouthfeel for such a hoppy beer due to the lively carbonation. Extremely well done ipa that lives up to the hype in my opinion.."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. Served at 45 degrees. Picked this one up at Jungle Jim's in Cincinnati. Fathead's just started distributing to Indiana, so I will have access to this all of the time!"
"Served in a bottle at Lola Bistro in Cleveland, OH"
"Thanks to cneville for this local extra! Pours a very nice, almost perfect looking amber and copper color with pretty decent clarity. A big, foamy white head mounts itself slowly and leaves some fat lacing as it slowly crawls back down. "
The first shipment off of the truck to Indiana has a arrived and I am reviewing the bottle. Thanks for coming to Indiana Fat Heads.
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. Pours a clear honey color with 3 finger white head, good retention and lacing. Smells of citra."
"Finally got distribution of this guy, sooo happy! usually stick to ""hads"", but felt compelled to give this gem a full review."
"Pours clear dark orange with big fizzy white head. Big aroma of citrus fruit, mango and spice. Flavor much more predominate. Notes of citrus and yeast. Medium body with excellent carbonation. Extremely bitter finish. Very nicely balanced though lacking in complexity."
"Never heard of these guys, so I’m guessing we just got distribution (even though they’re only in the next state over); lots of GABF awards plastered on the label, so I’m predicting good things."
Absolutely one of the best IPAs out there. At first pour a nice amber color with nice head. Not overly carbonated. Smells of citrus and pine. At first taste a bitter yet delicious grapefruit hits the palette. The seconds taste and you are sucked in and nothing else matters. This stuff is great. Second only to Zombie Dust. For me this is easy to get. zombie Dust is harder than hell to find so this is my first choice. A must try for true IPA lovers.
"My favorite IPA. This beer smells wonderful, pours with a firm head and the finish is a hopheads dream. Living outside the Burgh, I've been to Fatheads a couple times and they never had this on tap! Always out. Now that they are bottling it, I love the availabilty of it. Alittle high priced, But LIFE'S TO SHORT TO DRINK CHEAP BEER! Tried to order a sixtel and was told they quit filling sixtels. BUMMER!! Maybe splurge on a 1/4 sometime."
Thanks to Scott for this bottle.
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip. Thanks for the trade, maximumu13!"
12oz bottle poured into a Sam Adam's Alpine Spring 16oz glass
A-golden amber color with a ice white head and good lacing
Poured into a Stone Imperial glass. Bright orange with yellow highlights. Millions of medium sized carbonation bubbles lead to a small one finger head that is more tan than it is white in color and creamy and rocky in appearance. Lace seems to want to play and is sticking very well.
12 oz bottle poured into a tulip
Had both on tap and bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy light gold with a nice fluffy head and great legs. 
12 oz bottle poured into a DFH signature goblet. No bottle dating info to be found. Thanks to ZRT for sending this. 
"Poured 12oz bottle into tulip. Poured pretty clear orange with a nice two finger head. Smell is citrusy, pine, bready, tropical fruits. Taste is bitter hops up front with great cutrus flavors, great west coast style hops, piney, subtle malts, nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is right on. Overall this is a great IPA that hits you hard with bitter hops. The malty flavor takes a backseat to the piney, floral hops that dominate the flavor of this one. I had this at the brewery before they finally started bottling it, hope the distro keeps expanding so more people can experience superior Ohio brews."
12 oz. bottle served in a Half Acre snifter. Thanks to pmoney for the bottle.
"Big thanks to CruisaC for sending me this one. Orange-yellow color with the slightest haze, good thick foam of a head. Smells like resiny hops, a little . Flavor is super hoppy, very bitter finish, slight bit of malt holding it all together. Whew, this is very bitter. Overall a good IPA and it is what the label says but this can't touch the west coast. Maybe I need one straight off the bottling line."
"From notes at a beer tasting. 12oz bottle poured into a Reidel beer glass. No date on bottle, but person who brought them to the tasting stated that they had just arrived in the local bottle store. "
Served from a 12oz bottle to a Smuttynose pint glass.
I've had this brew several times. This review is fresh on-tap at Buffalo Wild Wings last night.
12 oz bottle purchased as a four pack at a grocery store during my recent visit to Columbus. No visible bottle dating.
"a very very good ipa. clear and quite pale in color, a little darker than golden, call it bronze, with an inch or so of white suds. the nose is very fruity hops, citra maybe, pineapple and lemon attack the nostrils. flavor is more grapefruit than lemon, with equal parts tropical fruit. the hops taste just picked to me, full of resins and oils that i just love in an ipa. alcohol is strong, and can be tasted a bit in the finish, my only real critique of an otherwise near flawless brew. nice lighter medium body keeps it sessionable, and the carbonation is very bright, aiding in a clean crisp finish that gets more and more bitter as the beer warms up. perfect with a chilli chese burger stacked hugh with frito chips. god i want another. one of the more fruity and citrusy india pales in recent memory. this should make its way out to colorado, id be a regular on it."
"This is an extremely drinkable ipa, I'm surprised I haven't tried this yet. "
12oz bottle into a pint glass.
Bottle poured into a Kuhnhenn tulip
Thanks to Adam and Chris for this bottle. Couldn't find freshness info. 
on tap @ star bar in denver
"Revisited, 5 Sept 2014"
"This beer is sort of a dark gold, not quite amber in color, with a sizable compact, slightly off-white head that shows good form and retention, leaving legs all over the place to form a web almost to the bottom of the glass."
A: Peach-orange in color. Very slight haze. Forms a moderate ecru-colored head that leaves a copious amount of lacing on the way down. 
"A 12 ounce bottle from JM03; thanks! My first one of these, and I'm more than excited to give it a try. Poured into a tulip."
Big thanks to Bill for this one. I've been wanting to try this for a while! 12oz bottle into a Heady Topper pint. 
"12oz, no bottle date"
"Alas, I have finally tracked this down in Central, OH."
"Slightly hazy, lighter orange color. Good looking white head stays around for a few minutes, and leaves some nice lace."
"Reviewing the Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA from Fat Head's Brewery and Saloon out of Ohio. This is one of my absolute favorite IPA's, and a review of a fresh bottle for the blog was quite overdue. Major thanks to Brian Callahan for hooking me up with some during FOBAB weekend."
"Well, might as well take advantage of the chance to try this on-tap. I think the nose on this might actually be more interesting than the bottled version. Very salty flavor profile though. A bit too much in that it masks a lot of the other citric and piney characteristics that are trying to show. Still a very nice IPA. Loud and brash, but still bringing enough to keep it respectable."
Clear light golden yellow color with a thick soft cap.
It does not get any better. Fantastic blend of fruity and biting pine resinous hops with an awesome supporting malt backbone. One of the best single IPAs I have ever had. Just incredible when had fresh.
A: Dark gold/orange with a medium sized off white head. Good retention and pretty decent lacing.
Poured from a 12oz bottle received in a trade from WilliamDbar.
Big thanks to maximumu13 for tracking this one down for me! Reviewed from notes. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a CCB pint glass.
"The smell is by far the most impressive aspect of this beer: grapefruit, lemon, guava, fruit loops, pine. The first sip is monstrously pine forward with a oily resin. Playful carbonation in an amber body with nice carbonation. Very well done, albeit slightly unbalanced. This is the definition of hops."
"Pours orange with a little burntness to it and a nice thick, foamy white head. A nice juicy orange aroma on top of a sweet, bready malt base. Flavor starts off with the citrus out the game, the middle is more the bready malt, and it closes with the marriage of piney hops and malt with a decently bitter finish. A nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall, Ohio with another solid IPA."
Pours a clear dark gold with good sized head. Nice lacing on the surface and sides. This is a fantastic smelling beer. Just great hop character. Huge citrus aroma- lemons and grapefruit. Floral and slightly piney as well. Upfront bitterness and fairly bitter throughout. A little background sweetness but hops dominate the flavor. Big herbal and citrus hop flavor. Finishes with a nice lingering bitterness. Medium bodied. This IPA pulls no punches. Close to a DIPA. Pretty awesome.
"Absolutely the best single IPA ever. Perfect balance. Love the hoppy taste and the aroma to make one's knees buckle. Have had it at Fat Heads here in Pittsburgh as well as the one in Cleveland, and it was better in Pittsburgh for some reason. Absolutely love this beer!"
Poured from a bottle had via a trade with TheGordianKnot! Cheers!
"355mL mega fresh bottle thanks to Dan! Pours a clear, filtered, no bottle refermentation (good) amber/orange. Larger, large bubbled, semi rocky meringue foam. Excellent retention. Widely spaced, webby lacing. Nose is soft butterscotch, lemon detergent (volatile), thick orange gummies. Taste is super rich butterscotch, restrained orange and grapefruit peel, mild pine sap, maple, sweet orange syrup. Palate is very bitter, nutty, some walnut/Brazil nut, mild spruce tips. Very rich, quenching, fairly aggressive. 10/2/2012 7/4/8/5/15=3.9"
Big thanks to thebouch01 for this awesome extra in our last trade.
"Bottle courtesy of maximum12, thanks again."
Had on tap at Fat Heads. Review from notes.
"Pours a strawberry copper color with a nice white head. Great lacing down the glass and very sticky. Smells outstanding on the nose. Apricots, resiny hops, strong grapefruit, and more hops. Very nice mouthfeel but very bitter. Maybe because I haven't had anything this hoppy in months, it caught me by surprise, but bitter and much lingering bitterness, but still a very good beer that is local, and I will jump at again."
"Reviewed this blind, thanks to abraxel..."
"Another top notch IPA in an already crowded field. This one is as good as any I suppose; when beer is of this quality it's more a case of what mood are you in today rather than one being ""better"" than another."
12 oz. bottle poured into a Hunahpu snifter.
You had this beer. 
"Thanks to Eric aka spoolinvw for giving me a fresh bottle of Head Hunter. I have always had terrible luck trying to find fresh bottles of this one, glad to finally try the real deal."
Thanks to CaptCleveland for sending me *fresh* bottles of this brew that's been on my wants list for a while. Some other traders could learn things from Mr. Cleveland & sending fresh IPAs in trades...you know who you are. 12 oz. bottle. 
Bottle poured into a Three Floyds teku.
"A: Head Hunter pours out of the bottle pretty clear and golden brown in color. Its head is about a finger in density, white in color, and sticks to the sides of my glass really nicely. Bubbles explode out of the bottom of the beer and collect beneath the head beautifully."
"Fresh 12oz bottle from the brewery, picked up generously by MarkIntihar. Into a Revolution pint glass."
Served in my moeder lambic tulip/snifter hybrid.
"Clear golden orange body with 2"" of dense white head. Lacing is spotty. "
"On tap at deagans in Lakewood, Ohio. Poured into a pint glass."
"Big thanks goes out to JM03 for sending this one my way as an extra in a recent trade! Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit nonic. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, pine hop, fruit, fruit hop, tropical fruit, and subtle apple juice. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, pine hop, fruit, fruit hop, tropical fruit, bitter hop, and subtle pine resin. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really liked what is going on in this one. There was tons of pine notes going on, but it had a nice touch of fruit to help balance it out and leave your palate feeling refreshed for a moment. After that moment the hops come flooding in to carry what is left of your palate away. A really well done brew that should be enjoyed by anyone who calls themselves a hop-head."
Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for giving me a bottle of this
"No dating on the bottle, which is potential deal-breaker on the sale for me, but the shop owner said he got it in within the last week."
Really enjoyed this IPA at the GABF. After all the IPA and Imperial IPAs I tried this one clearly stood out from the crowd. Amazing nose and huge flavor . I went back several times for this one and it's big brother the Hop JuJu Imperial IPA
"I got this beer from Auslander, Thanks Chris!"
"With a proud exert on the label that reminds us that this beer took silver and bronze medals in the Great American Beer Festival '10 and '11 respectfully, this high praise comes with high expectations. And this west coast IPA doesn't disappoint!"
Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Light copper color with head that dissipates but leaves nice lacing.
Big thanks to Beergod1 for the initial hookup with this beer.
"Fat Head's Had Hunter India Pale Ale, 7.5% ABV, 87 IBU. Brewed and bottled by Fat Head's Brewery, Middleburg Heights, Ohio."
Thanks to duff27 for giving me a bottle of this beer to drink! Thanks duff!
"This poured out as a slightly hazy copper color, there was a white foamy head on top. The lacing was sticky and hung on the glass nicely. The smell of the beer was loaded with hops. Very nice aromas ranging from floral to fruity. The taste of the beer is piney, and has a nice balanced malt sweetness to it in there. The mouthfeel is smooth with a subtle carbonation to it. Overall I believe that it's pretty damn good, I'd still put a few others before it but still worth having."
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a AleSmith snifter.
"A: A Nice copper-like appearance. Medium, frothy, quickly diminishing head. Pretty."
"Half inch fluffy white head on a dark golden/light copper body. Above average sticky lacing, good head retention."
A- pours a brassy amber color with two fingers of fluffy white head. Great head retention with solid lacing.
A: Pours a dark golden hue with a fluffy head that sticks around for a good amount of time. 
Pours clear and golden with a white fluffy head. 
Sample at the brewery. Pour is golden color with off white head. Aroma is strong pine with some citrus mixed in. Has a medium mouthfeel. Flavor is strong pine and citrus hops upfront. Leads to a nice caramel touch with more pine hops to the finish. A real hop blast. My favorite on their list. This one is for hopheads only.
Relocated to Pittsburgh about 3 years ago from South Louisiana and landed in the legendary Southside of all places. Having the Fatheads pub within a mile of my house is a HUGE perk.
"Pours a golden yellow, white head, thin collar. Nose is pine, grass, light citrus. Flavor is mostly pine with a nice hoppy kick. Smooth and easy to drink, more citrus then the nose. Light body, good carbonation, nice bitter bite on the end. "
An aggressive pour delivers two fingers of foamy head over a copper body. 
Head Hunter pours a really attractive gold color. It’s mostly clear. Backlighting gives it a slight orange tint. It’s capped with an off-white head that rises to about a finger in height. It holds steady for quite a while before falling to a surface covering. Lacing was rather sticky and thick. Looks good!

12oz bottle into snifter. Thanks Josh!
"This is one beer that is better in the bottle. I've always enjoyed Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA on tap, but I have to say it was never one I craved or sought out. But, Fat Head's bottling is different ... in a very good way. Whatever, they did to capture the piney, citrusy, oily esters and resins in the bottle please keep doing it. The mildly high ABV hides beautifully behind zesty grapefruit, spicy hops, fresh cut grass, and biscuity maltiness. A very well-balanced and well-done IPA bottling that I crave and will seek out. Thankfully, I can find it, for now, right in my local grocery store. Bonus!"
Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA is a remarkable example of what an American IPA should taste like. The aroma is pleasnat and the taste is really oustanding! I am so glad that it is being bottled now. It would be great if Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon bottled more of their products in the future. Head Hunter IPA is certainly worth tracking down at your neighborhood bottle shop if possible.
"I have seen this beer proudly displayed on LNBA posts and when I saw it on the shelf at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, OH, I just had to try it. Poured from a bottle (no freshness date) into a New Belgium snifter, it pours out a beautiful clear orange gold color with a nice tight head that, while thin, does show some good retention. I also see some nice effervescence. The nose is simply stunning. I get big notes of ripe tropical fruits like grapefruit, oranges, pineapples, and peaches. This is how I like my IPAs to smell! Resiny, flowery, pine-like noses are fine, but big tropical fruit notes like this get really high marks in my book. Think ``Zombie Dust'', only toned down just a little bit."
appearance- pale straw color white frothy head
pretty pumped to try this one. thanks a ton to Lat! enjoyed from my HF tulipy wine glass.
PouRed from a 12oz bottle into a standard pint glass.
1463rd Review on BA
Bottle opened on 8.17.12.
12 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada imperial pint
12oz bottle thanks to Veldrid. Poured into Founders snifter.
"Wow simply an amazing IPA. Had on draft at Melt in Independence. Strong smell of grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Taste is very strong citrus with some pine notes. If you like Heavy Seas Loose Cannon, you will love this beer. It's a much better version of this style of brew."
12oz bottle poured into a pint glass
"I am pretty sure I had this at the restaurant in North Olmstead a year or two ago, but today I found it at Andrews Beverage so I picked up a four pack. "
The beer pours a clear amber with a thin white head. The nose is pure citrus hops that evolves into a balanced sweet citrus. The taste is incredibly citrusy and bitter with a crisp hop cone finish. Although this beer is immensely hoppy it's very drinkable and tasty. I can't wait to see it on tap in buffalo.
Thanks to my beer store person for letting me get my hands on a 4pk. (First time in my area!)
"Bottled version courtesy of AwYeh, thanks again."
"A Pours a clear tangerine orange with a nice, large white head. Great lace is left when the head comes down and nice carbonation. looks great"
Thanks to Rudzud for sharing.
"Last two bottles from blue dust. Poured kinda flat little head with some lacing. Amberish copper color, pretty transparent.(3.5)Then came the first sniff. Amazing hops and fruit mixtures that great Ipas are made of. A hint of malt on light side but some kind dry hoppedness all over place, really good nose. Taste has me thrown back to when I thought df 60 min was best ipa . This is world class! Resonates great hop taste for some time after. Delicious hop and Med carbonation that will have you nursing it if its your last! My second was more heady and even better tasting so changing to my favorite ipa out!!"
Enjoyed in bottle. Thanks miz!
Bottle (2012)
The beer was served in a snifter. 
Received as an extra from miketd. Poured into my Duvel tulip.
I've had is before but I feel like now is the time to review since I can now but it in a nice four pack or case at my local.
My first beer from Fat Head's.
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy (grapefruit, citrus peel, tropical fruit) hops, along with a little bit of caramel malt. I think the taste follows the aroma, it tastes mostly like pine and citrusy hops, with a teeny bit of caramel malt noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and oily with a moderate amount of carbonation. It's nice to see this brew in bottles, I've heard about it for a while now but finally was able to try it today and it didn't disappoint! It's certainly one of the best Ohio IPA's (and IPA's in general) along with White Rajah and Columbus IPA. Definitely worth trying if you have a chance to get it!"
Poured a light golden orange with an ample three fingers of lacey amber head. Moderate retention of head and some lacing evident on the walls of my pint glass. 
Serving Type - Bottle
Appearance - Golden yellow which avoids a pee-like appearance. Average head and lacing to the pint glass. Clear like a mysterious golden elixir.
"Pours a brilliant copper glowing slightly orange and red when held toward the light with a bright white head building up big and large. I love this beer, Fathead's has done it again and released when of my all time favorite IPAs. Aroma has big floral, citrus, and fruit filled hop bursts going on...this beer is great. I'm not sure which hops they use, but it has the most tropical fruit smells I've ever tasted straight up mango/pineapple. The most sought after West Coast style IPA brewed outside of Cleveland. This brand new case I picked says brewed in small batches to ensure quality I believe it. This an 87 IBU hop monster that gives out hop flavor with malt sweetness all day, it's balanced yet aggressive and uncivilized according to the label. Hop candy all day, a beer that flows with each sip anybody into hops needs to try this beer, I get layers of grapefruit and bright hop flavors that are literally rocking my world. Mouthfeel is resinous but not heavy, light to medium bodied ample flowing carbonation excellent drinkable IPA for those of us in the know. I know this beer is amazing I've been drinking it on draft at Fathead's since it came out. "
"Served on tap, into a Guulden Draak tulip"
"Poured on-tap and served in a small tasting glass. the beer is a slightly hazed, orange coloring and inch high head with great retention, too. Aromas are citrus-hop blend that smells amazing. orange, and grapefruit blending with the pine, fresh cut grass, and resin to entice you right into the glass. Flavors are rich and resiny. A very Hop forward punch with a grapefruit that keeps you coming back for more. There is a subtle caramel backbone that supports all the other profiles, which is exactly what it should be doing. The finish is clean, smooth, and very satisfying. Another great Midwest IPA."
From 64oz growler to Hess imperial pint glass on 5/30/12
Poured from a Fat Head's growler I picked up this afternoon.
"I believe this batch of Head Hunter was tapped on Wednesday 4/11 at the brewpub in North Olmsted. I hopped over to the brewpub for lunch on Friday 4/13, enjoyed a pint of the IPA there, and took a growler of it home to enjoy over the weekend. This review is from early Friday evening, probably 3 hours after getting the growler filled. Poured into a standard American pint glass."
"orange/gold with a creamy, wispy, white head. It's about three fingers and it's all over the place. Doesn't dissipate much either."
Poured from a growler into a standard pint glass.
Appearance: Arrives with a modest head seated atop the clear amber liquid; splotchy lace is left behind
Poured from a growler purchased a few days ago from Fatheads.
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tasting glass. It poured clear and amber orange in color with a pillowy white head filling one inch of the glass.
Pours somewhat cloudy bright orange with a big 2 finger pillowey off white head with good retention and a solid coating down the glass.
"A - Deep Amber (kinda hardto gauge in dark lighting) lots of lacing, nice head on first pour."
"Pours a light orange/gold with a frantic white head, leaving a nice lace on the glass."
Huge thanks to my Aunt Terri and Uncle Paul for coming through in the clutch on scoring these bottles at the brewery. Love you guys!
A: Pours a nice orange color with a thin ring of white head and some sticky lacing.
"Blonde-to-orange body. An inch of head only, but that just means more beer. Bone-colored topper with good lacing."
Thanks goes out to Hojaminbag for this brew.
Enjoyed this on tap at Fat’s head.
Thanks to Cazlo for the growler!
Got this Growler from my buddy David from Cleveland - Thanks David !
"Poured into an Alpine Beer Co. glass from a growler, filled 35 minutes ago at Fat Heads Saloon Pittsburgh. Beautiful clear amber color with just a small thin white head. "
Bottle courtesy of misterhops. Sent to me because he is an awesome guy. His awesomeness becomes even more apparent the more I drink this beer and realize how great it is. Between this and Columbus IPA I gotta say Ohio knows how to make some hoppy beer. The glass was poured into my New Belgium globe. 
"A: Clear golden color, nice white 2 finger head. Slowley disapating with some nice lacing."
Had this on 2011-09-10 at the brewery in Cleveland.
Served on tap into a nonic glass at the brewpub
I don't make it to the west side of Cleveland too often and I was finally in the neighborhood near Fat Head's and decided to run in and grab a growler of Head Hunter and see what the fuss is all about. 
"On-tap, Harrisburg Brewer's Fest. Feels like I didn't move from in front of Fat Head's."
I have a hard time believing I just now tried this. On tap at the original Fathead's.
ABV was listed as 7.2%
Enjoyed on tap in a pint glass at Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon.
I wanted to try this beer for a long time and with in 4 weeks I was lucky enough to sample it at the brewery and then run into the assistant brewer at Dark Lord Day and received a bottle from him.
Generously hooked up on a trade from Stigs. Poured into my Darkness snifter.
Poured from 12oz bottle. 
Tasted on 3/27/11. Reviewed from notes Thanks to SDSurfer217 for this beer:
"This has been a favorite of mine. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a shiny, transparent, light golden color with a nice foamy white head and very sticky lacing. The aromas are straight dank.. extremely pungent. Lots of grapefruit going on. I mean these aromas are intense! The taste is very bold, but balanced. I can pick lots of pineapple, grapefruit, and orange. There's the slightest amount of pine and resin. This one isn't too malty. Mouthfeel is good, somewhat thin, but well carbonated and smooth. Highly enjoyable! Outstanding! Fun to drink.."
Golden orange with a nice head and decent lacing.
"Fyi, Fat Head's finally bottled this brew so if you get a chance to stop in, the 4 packs are available at a pretty reasonable price!"
I am happy that I was able to grab a growler of headhunter on my way out of fat heads.
Poured into an E&J Cask & Cream glass and a snifter on 3/16/11
from notes
"I have been introducing my wife to good beers for a while now, but she has been really reluctant to start trying a lot of IPAs."
"Big thanks to the Thorpes for picking this growler up, I really appreciate it."
"Clear golden in color, nice white puffy head. Nice lacing."
"Growler split with Ryan011235. A long review using two different glasses, Ryan's famed ""E&J Cask and Cream"" antique shop find glass and an over-sized snifter, carefully chosen to not be ""his"" snifter. "
16 ounce draft
Growler shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!
From 03/05/11 notes. Growled shared by Thorpe429; thanks Mike.
Got a bottle thanks to thebouch. 12 oz. bottle poured into HBG pint glass. 
Pint draft at North Olmsted brewery.
"Reviewed blind. Sent to me by Sitarist, and I wasn't even his target! Thanks Sitarist!"
Thanks again to brew3crew and urbancaver for the bottle. 
"Yellow, golden pour with a bright white head that clings to the glass. Minor grapefruit smell with malt in the background. I'm also getting an old sock type smell. Hmmm. Unusual bitter taste which doesn't improve much at all. Metallic tasting. Not too pleasant. Very thin mouthfeel. This wasn't the greatest beer but it was unusual for an IPA. If you're looking for a different experience in an IPA...this is your huckleberry."
12oz bottle
On tap at Fat Heads in Cleveland.
"Poured fresh from my newly acquired Fatheads growler, this beer pours a yellowish-oranged color with an ever so slight haze to it. One finger white head has settled to a thin lace after about 5 minutes or so. Moderate head retention."
"Thanks for sharing this one, Bobby."
"interesting copper-pink color, sulfur smell in the nose, clear color, little to no lace, short finish, metallic taste, stinky, short medium-length finish, little less than average overall finish. wouldn't seek out this beer, there are much better examples to choose from."
Out of the 12oz. bottle...
Big thanks to Turd fergison(Eric the great) for not one but a 4-pack of this fine brew.
Thanks to thegrogbog for this awesome beer
A-almost a pale yellow orange with white lacing
"Pours a crisp yellowish orange. Sme nice solid head tht dissipates quickly. Nice lacing. Smells great. Lots of piney hops on the nose. Taste is a bit overly bitter. The mouthfeel is a bit lacking due to the bitterness but the drinkability is decent for how hoppy it is. Overall, worth trying but i wouldn't drink it regularly"
"Split a bottle at the Jackie O's release, and then ended up with a couple bottles afterwards ... thanks Paul! Back at home ... time for a proper review. 12oz bottle poured into a Jackie O's snifter. "
Appearance -- Pours a faintly hazed orange hue with a slim but stiff beige head. Moderate lacing.
blind beer #1 from sitarist in round 4 of Blind Beer BIF
"12 oz Bottle Thanks, Mike."
Really psyched to try this in bottle since I have it pretty much every other week on tap. New bottles purchased in the Pittsburgh store. 12 oz. bottle poured into a Founder's pint glass....
Picked up a couple four packs while up visiting the old stomping grounds on the westside of Cleveland.
"Very Proud to have this as a ""Homer""beer!Totally awesome brew from a totally awesome facility!"
Big thanks to my pops for hooking me up some serious bottles from Cleveland. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.
"4th of the 4 sources of Head Hunter. Fat Head's: if you ever nitro this, I will destroy you. "
"Had this beer numerous times on draft at Fathead's under circumstances not conducive for reviewing (but hella fun). I believe this bottle is the first batch of Headhunter ever bottled, and I also believe it's relatively fresh. I've always been very impressed by this as a draft, so I'm excited to see how this bottle goes."
"Was in Pittsburgh visiting family for the holidays, and one of my first stops is always Fathead's on the South Side. I haven't been in several years, and was interested to see that they had opened their own brewery in Cleveland. Far out. I saw a banner hanging on their ceiling toting this beer as National IPA Champion (at what fest, I know not) so I figured it was worth a shot. Glad I tried it..."
"At the Pittsburgh location (even though I live in Cleveland). This is a really great IPA, on par with Two Hearted and a few others in that class. Super fresh and refreshing. Really clean hoppy flavors with some nice underlying malt. The real all-stars in this beer are the citrus and piney hops. Great aroma, great flavor. Very easy-drinking, a bit lighter in body, but that ups the drinkability for sure. I wouldn't say a ""must-have"" in terms of ""you must drive 500 miles to get this beer,"" but if you head to Fat Head's, you better order one."
"I've had this many times, starting back over a year ago when they first introduced it. I've had it all at the Pittsburgh Fat Head's restaurant (never at the pub in Ohio). Always fresh, as it gets kicked fast and the Ohio brewery rockets more kegs out to the Pittsburgh restaurant. Worthy of the accolades it receives."
"A real piney, citric hop nose that even hits grape-like aroma on top of a golden body w/ large head that dies quick and leaves lace ring. Very dry - first thing that hits me - as the citric hops are prevelant throughout entire drink yet it flows smooth, not haggard, and has a nice touch of sweetness to it as well. A well-balanced, solid IPA that a hop lover will love and so will fans of less hoppy, more malty beers as well...must say did not realize 7% until I saw this website b/c they hid it well."
"Pours a golden color...small bubbles rise to a thick, frothy white head that falls to a ring and top coating that leaves webs of lacing."
"Growler thanks to TurdFurgison. Leaked a touch in transit, and was hissing when I threw it into the freezer for a quick cooldown. Served in my Stone pint glass."
On tap at the Cleveland Fat Head's. 
"A - Pours a medium golden orange, clear, and a very mild head with little to no carbonation."
Appearance: An orange/gold in color with a bone white head that leaves substantial lacing down the glass. The head hunter looks as good as it smells.
"Draft at The Bistro IPA festival. Golden amber, bright and clear, with a solid white cap that slowly settles to a collar. Very floral aroma, centennial hops are prominent but there's also a citrusy, herbal character, a little weed and cut grass. Little perceptible malt in the aroma, but it has a touch of bready sweetness on the palate beneath the huge hop flavors. Floral with orange and grapefruit, bitter herbs, a little toasted biscuit. Nice bitter grapefruit finish that lingers for a long time. Pretty damn good."
"Pours a clean, pale orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, big citrus, grapefruity hops. In the taste, big hops, citrus and grapefruity, yet very well balanced with a nice malt. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a grapefruity hop aftertaste. Fantastic, big hops, but not too big."
growler thanks to miketd in a recent trade.
"Pours a nice golden color with a slight head. The aroma is of floral and earthy hops with hints of citrus fruits. The taste is of a slight caramel malt backbone with touches of citrus fruits. The main taste is of earthy hops and touches of floral hops. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. Overall its a nice beer, good flavor and nice aroma, not the best IPA you will ever have, but it is very solid."
Fresh growler from Fathead's in Pittsburgh.
Headhunter IPA has a cloudy orange body with a soapy white head. Retention is OK and a few scraps of lacing stay behind on the glass.
Had this one on tap at Fat Head's Cleveland.
A: orangish golden. Nice color!
Pours very little head atop a golden/orangish body. 
A- Pours a clear amber-orangeish color an off white head. Head recedes into a thin film on top of the brew and leaves some layered lacing here in there. 
"On tap at Fat Head's in Pittsburgh, 2010.2.2."
On tap at the pub poured into a british style pint glass.
"I was lucky to get to try this amazing IPA a few times during the NIPAC, plus the bottle I took home."
"I wouldn't argue with you if you said this was the greatest single IPA in the world. Looks innocent enough, a slightly golden haze of a beer. Beautiful aroma up the nose, amazing simcoe and amarillo feel."
"Got a pint of this at Fat Head's in Pittsburgh, probably the best bar ever!"
"Edit: the beer has gotten much better since the original review below, written over a year ago! I'm happy to say the bottles are fantastic - serious ""A"" material!"
"On-tap at Pizza Plant.Cloudy grapefruit with a foaming white head. Lots of lace. Grapefruit aroma. Initially there is a strong hop bite, nay burn, then the mouth gets more used to the acidity. The flavour is pretty good grapefuit. 77IBU and you feel that. Hours later, acidic is still in my mouth."
Had at Fat Heads in Pittsburgh
Tried this from the tap at Fatheads in North Olmsted Ohio. Everything fit and I though I was going to enjoy this one. Until I actually tried it. 
"I had this on tap at Fat Heads in Cleveland, apparently brewed on premises. The menu description: ""Uncivilized and aggressive, this west coast styled IPA packs wicked hops flavors and aroma. Savage amounts of Simcoe, Columbus, and Cascade hops define this brew's signature pine and citrus notes""."
"Wow, not overly impressed with this. Orange body, pale white head, average lacing. Pine and citrus nose. Enh. Grapefruity taste but quite sour; a little TOO much grapefruit, it seems. Astringent 'feel. Okay drinkability."
On tap at Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon on 8/10/09. 
"On tap at the brewery a few hours ago. Review from notes. Poured into a clean, clear glass. Notes from brewery: Uncivilized and aggressive this west coast styled IPA packs wicked hop flavors and aroma. Savage amounts of Simcoe, Columbus and Cascade hops define this brews signature pine and citrus notes. Try with our smoked wings in the Killer sauce and run the risk of a shrunken head!"
"On tap @ Fathead's (Pittsburgh, PA) on 7/18/09. Served in a pint glass. "
A great IPA!
"Boy, did I love this beer. On tap at the Fathead's in Pittsburgh."
On-draught @ Weldwerks.
Appearance: Arrives with a golden color verging on orange; the cap is a finger high and leaves some shards behind
Something very wrong. Like an IPA with toothpaste.
One of the bests I’ve had.
"Right after the can opening, you can smell a nice tropical smell waving to your nostrils from afar."
Canned 9/28/17; drank 10/12/17 @ the Yarchives. 
This is the best thing I've had from WW.
"32oz crowler, served in a snifter glass. Pours a fairly turbid yellow-orange body with a one finger white head, plenty of effervescence that sticks around for a while, good lacing. Smells of rich grapefruit zest and orange pulp, touch of floral as well. Minimal malt sweetness is evident at first. Flavour is remarkably similar to that of the base Juicy Bits, but with a more pronounced grapefruit presence, with the same big grapefruit skin zestiness lingering on the finish. I thought this was better than the base beer, although it didn't really add more to the beer other than accentuating certain hop aromatics. Mouthfeel is medium-lighter bodied, creamy, a bit more smoother drinking than the base beer with less bitterness on the finish."
Love rpm. Hope they decide to bottle for home consumption
"A tasty and enjoyable IPA. One of my favorites. Look is lighter than many IPA's. Wish it was available in more locations, like grocery stores in 6 pack 1/2 rack and cases."
L: Pours a clear golden orange with a small white head and a few fingers of sticky lacing around the glass.
"On tap. Poured a clear, golden-yellow color with a small, white head of bubbly foam. It smelled of grapefruit, pineapple, mango and caramel. Nice tropical fruit taste with a great bitter bite."
Another beer on my radar found during my Portland trip.
"Aroma and taste are both bursting with huge citrus flavors--sweet oranges, clementines are the first to draw blood out of the glass, with some light bittering grapefruit that quickly follows suit. The brighter flavors are well-balanced by a supporting base of resinous pine, and some light herbaceous peppery complements."
"This was poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was a hazy to off burnt orange color with a thin to almost thick white foamy atmospheric head. It quickly dissipated. No lacing. The aroma starts off with a bright sweet to bitter charging grapefruit pulp and rind bursting into subtle sweet orange and lemon. The flavor starts sweet and rides into a nice bitter backing. Aftertaste seems just about as perfect as I would have wanted for an AIPA with a slow riding almost cloying finish. Is it? No, not really. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it allowing the carbonation to play nice and smooth as well. Overall, as an East Coaster I can put my hat off and say yup, here’s that West Coast AIPA that takes the cake."
"Hazy orange color, strong earthy hop profile with an orange flavor. Zingy, crisp, and refreshing."
"Golden amber in color, slightly hazy with a foamy, off white head. Some streak lacing. Definitely a NW style IPA. Aroma is pine, citrus and herbs. Bold hops flavor, pine, grapefruit and grass. A bit of bread malt in the flavor to smooth it all out, but overall this beer is resinous and very hop forward."
Look: light orange with white head. Very clear
"Grunt fill from bert's. Nice copper color, small thin head with moderate lacing. Mild hoppy aroma, taste is more hops with a nice malt backbone. Solid all around IPA."
"Hands down my favorite IPA of all. Drinking this beer starts subtle and almost fools you in the beginning, yet finishes strong and hoppy. I like this beer for the sheer fact that it mimics many of the nuances found in Hop Venom and Notorious Triple yet won't leave me feeling drunk if I decide to have two pints."
"On tap at The Reservoir in Waterbury, VT. A classic West Coast IPA in a sea of NE style IPAs? Let's see how it fares. I know that Vermont got kegs of Boneyard stuff about a month ago, so it might not be at its absolute freshest."
"Draft at Prohibition Pig. I've always wanted to try this beer. I didn't think it would be while I was visiting Vermont. Medium haze, light orange body, soapy white collar that leaves the glass coated in lacing. Aromas of hops and earthy, bready malts. Hop forward supported by a malty backbone. Solid."
"Drank on tap at Apizza Scholls, Portland, OR"
"First class IPA, bursting with hoppy flavor (bitterness there, but not overwhelming)."
"On-tap at Meconi's, on to the beer:"
"Fairly malty for an IPA, but well balanced with the grassy and piney hops. Tasty"
This is one great ipa. I find nothing wrong with it. I can drink this beer any time of the year and never get sick of it. 
On draft at Hunahpu's Day 2016.
"Can't get enough by far my favorite IPA. Wonderful citrus overtones without the sweetness. Very complex clean and hoppy with a low bitter index. A first class IPA Impressive orange pour with almost a full inch of head. Aroma was above average hoppiness, lots of pine, milder, softer grapefruit note to it. A world class IPA."
"First tasted in a pint glass from draft at Cabin 22 on March 27, 2016. Also tasted in pint glasses from growlers purchased at Growler Phil's and Big Dog. Look is amber color with a thick white head and lingering lacing. Smell is citrus, pine, floral hops, and bread dough malt aromas. Taste is grapefruit, orange, pine resin and floral notes with bread and caramel malt flavors. Feel is medium body with moderate carbonation and a crisp somewhat bitter finish. A nice beer to try when you are in the PNW, but forget finding it anywhere else."
"64oz growler fill. Filled in Bend where this stuff can be obtained fresh and in abundance. This is one of my favorite IPAs. Love the nose on this beer! Great hop profile with nice citrus notes. Bend has so many great offerings, but this is one of the better ones. I love the fact it is a fruity IPA without being too sweet. Very smooth and drinkable."
The standard to which every other IPA (especially in the PNW) must live by. Is literally on tap in every eating or drinking establishment in Bend.
"Impressive orange pour with almost a full inch of head. Aroma was above average hoppiness, lots of pine, milder, softer grapefruit note to it. "
Absolutely my favorite IPA when fresh. Such a fantastic nose of hops with the perfect mouthfeel. I'd drink this every day if I could. Backfilling a review from a few weeks ago when I had this on draft
"With as much beer as I've drunk in my life, you'd think I was a connoisseur (I can't count the 80's)... but I can't find the words for this one.."
Clear orange gold with two fingers of white head and good amount of lace.
Delicious IPA. Chose it at random at a pub during lunchtime and I am glad I did. Definitely one of the better IPA's I have had recently
"32 oz Crowler can flown in from Bend, Oregon!"
"From the 32 oz growler filled today at Railroad Market in Burlington, Washington. Appealing melon aroma. The distinct apricot taste is delicious. More delicate bitterness than the typical IPA. This seems like the Oregon style. Golden amber color with nice foam in the Stella Artois goblet."
"Served in a pint glass at Stuft Crust, Milpitas"
"My first two experiences with the beer was blah - nothing special here, 4's across the board. Guest Brewer at de grade and on tap at a bar in manzanita, or. Both times I was what the fuck? This is supposed to be good? In hindsight, I chalk it up to old kegs or bad lines. Had it again in skamania and was like damn, this is a good beer. Everything I could want in an ipa - hoppy and fruity. Loved it the third time around."
"32 oz Crowler. Copper color with slight haze. Tropical fruit sweet aroma. Fruity floral hops that lingers the right amount. Great balance in this beer. Sweet tasting but in a good way, with dry hoppy finish. Good mouthfeel, exceptionally smooth and drinkable. First brew I had by them and it did not disappoint. Outstanding IPA."
A little malty for me
Another great beer with a bitter taste
From a 32 oz. growler (or whatever you call it) into an imperial pint
"I'm not sure I've ever drank 20oz of beer so quickly in my life. Served at Von's Gustobistro in Seattle. Wanted to visit the brewery when I was in Bend, but they weren't open at the time. Seeing this on the menu, I knew I had to try it."
"On tap at Boneyard Brewing in Bend, Oregon. "
Top notch! Had in the Beaver State!
"Had a pint on tap in Bellingham on vacation, was a little darker than my preferred IPAs, overall was not too bad."
On tap at BA Bar. Quite good!
"Pours a nice, bright light-orange color with a small and quickly dissipating white head. Very little bubble retention here."
"This is such a refreshing beer. Even if you're not an IPA fan, do try it. I can't wait to start seeing these in bottles."
If in oregon drink anything by boneyard you can get your hands on world class all the way.
On Tap at Chuck's Hop Shop (North Seattle)
"On tap at URGE Gastropub – Rancho Bernardo, CA"
"Love, love, love the Bone yard IPA. What a fantastic beer."
It's a very bland tasting
"Not bad. Good to try, nothing that blew me away."
"Clean, straight forward, balanced, lively, rich and steady. Easy drinking yet gentle as a feather pillow. All the makings of a good friend!"
Served On-Tap
"Nice, deep amber-orange color. It's clear and well-filtered with a small (3mm or so) very white head. Well carbonated, overall."
The beer comes in a clear amber color.
"A tad bit more malt than a true West coast IPA but certainly very hop forward and just this side of slick on the mouthfeel. Well balanced body helps carry the heavy pine and citrus rind/pith. Easy drinking, enjoyable, and certainly a dependable IPA."
"Pretty killer IPA. Was expecting something with way more of a punch-you-in-the-mouth bitterness flavor and, while there is certainly a big hop presence, the big bitter flavor isn't really there. It is still very well balanced, goes down pretty sweet and smooth. Head retention was an issue for me but after reading reviews complimenting the beer im this area I have concluded that it may have been the growler i had it from. Still a very noteworthy IPA. Would have again."
"A coupl'a oddities: here it says 75 IBUs and 7.5 ABV... Their site says 50/6.5; I reckon it's somewhere in between. They also do not reveal the hops, but suggest there are six NW. I detect Citra allll through this beer (though light in the nose)...fantastic! A near perfect Citra IPA...I'd drink this whenever/wherever I find it!"
"Very smooth and tasty. Not hoppy for an IPA but the smoothness is ideal. If you're looking for hoppy, not the choice, but looking for a solid ipa, this is it."
Ha at the boneyard tasting room. Hard to compare to the epic hop venom but a very tasty and balanced ipa.
Well balanced ipa. Low noticeable bitterness for the style. Very pleasant and drinkable. Slightly on the sweet side. 
"Smooth grapefruit flavor. Light and not too bitter. If I lived on the west coast, this would be a go-to."
"Best beer I've ever had, boneyard is killing the beer game, places can't seem to keep this stuff for too long it's so good."
A fabulous brew that is worth seeking out.
"Cascadia Hops, wish brewers would use less."
"To me this beer is like listening to a superbly recorded and produced album where every instrument can be heard and felt as intended, everything working in harmony to the listener's delight or in"
Good citrus flavor to balance out the big malt backbone. Very bitter. Smooth mouth feel. Pretty good..................................................
"I love this beer, it's a hoptacular brew. It maintains a head for a good time despite its 7%+ abv had wonderful lacing, this is also in my top five, only problem is no bottling, but trips to the brewery and to all the local pubs in Portland keeps me coming back for more. Please try this if you can, this reminds of oskar blues back in the day. Long live boneyard beer!! 4.5/5 "
"a classic northwest style ipa here, with lots of cascade and centennial characteristics. while i cant confirm that those are the varietals used, i can say with certainty that attributes of those strains on on display here no doubt. the color is a little richer than many, brassy, with a long lasting lacy white head. aromas of pine forest, lush evergreen, christmas, vegetal, pulpy. there is a decent grain base to this too, with come caramel malt that while it doesnt contribute a ton to the flavor, its absence would leave this hopelessly unbalanced. its got some girth to the mouthfeel, which is nice with the wintery hop mix. the hops are unique here not for what they taste like, but for how robust they are. truly as strong on the front end as they are in the finish, i cant think of a lot of ipas that do that, and none do it so vividly and pungently as this beast. i like that its bigger too, a hop heads dream really, super fresh and aggressive, dank and sprucy. not overly complicated either which i like, just big well built ipa. if this was available here i would buy it all the time. its my kind of ipa."
Thank the Jesuses I live in Bend!
growler filled from boneyard.
A-medium amber color with a ice white head and good lacing
"This very good IPA was served with a white, light minimal head that appeared a clear, dark golden orange. The aroma was sweet, hoppy, and inviting. The taste was very balanced and even. The combination of hops and malt made me think of Centennial Ale, however, this is a better representation of that nice combo. Hoppy, sweet fruit, and resinous, with a malty finish. The mouthfeel compliments very well."
"On tap at the 2014 Firestone Walker Invitational Beer Fest held at the Paso Robles Event Center in Paso Robles, CA. "
On tap at Bait Shop in Seattle. Served in a pint glass.
32oz growler poured into a Boneyard Shaker Pint.

1775th Review on BA
"In tap at Capitol Beer and Tap in Sacramento, CA "
"on tap at Interurban, Portland"
"In Oregon there are many quality breweries, but Boneyard is quickly becoming my favorite brewery. Their IPA's are floral, balanced, and smooth. "
"Had this along with some other IPAs in a sampler at the Taphouse Grill in Seattle. 6oz pour. This is a seriously underrated IPA. The smell and taste are fantastic. It's not too strong and it's very citrusy/fruity. I remember thinking it tasted like candy. It was just soo tasty. If you can find it try it, you won't be disappointed."
Appearance- I received this beer with about a finger's worth of head. The head is pure cotton white while the body is a pale amber that lightens to lemon when held up to the light. Leaves lacing in the form of lots of sheeting. 
"32oz, growler"
"Very well balanced ipa, a little hoppier than the usual ipa very well worth it as I prefer doubles or imperial ipas, golden color with a good amount of carbonation, alcohol taste is well hidden and is always refreshing and a pleasure to find on tap while out."
"Had this on recent vacation in Bend, picked up a growler right from their tasting room. Overall really enjoyed this beer, but left me wanting just a little more. Might have been biased after hearing so many great things about it from the locals, so it didn't quite blow me away the way I thought it might."
Growler from Alistair. Thanks! Shared with friends at the Off Color opening party. Served in a plastic cup.
"Draft at Taphouse Seattle. Pours golden orange with little fluffy white head. Citrus and lemon peel on top of grassy pine. Flavor is big raw hops with lots of floral citrus background. This is an awesome IPA and really highlights the floral hops used. Surprisingly light and easy to drink. Good stuff, and I hope Boneyard really starts ramping up production and distribution."
Got this on draft in the corner of portland while on vacation. 
Growler from Mainbrew. 
"mid to high hoppy sweet aroma, mid carbonation, sweet but more bitter, yum, balanced sweet bitter linger. "
Thanks billhilly for doing such a sweet packing job on this world class IPA! Growler filled 6 days ago in WA.
"Notes to self, will tidy up later"
Growler poured into a Hill Farmstead stem.
"On tap at PDX (PDX for the win!) pours a slightly hazy straw with a burnt orange center. Slightly off white head. Aroma is super balanced with notes of fresh peaches, pine, and honey sweetness. Up front is a nice malt sweetness that gives way to sweet peaches, pine, and a beautiful raw hop flavor that coats the palate. Wonderfully balanced, an excellent NW IPA."
"horse brass draft, took a little bush-dive shortly after, then a pleasant walk back downtown"
32 oz. growler poured into a snifter.
on-tap @ Henry's Tavern.
"Tasted on February 16, 2013:"

"Northwest BA's convinced me this was a must-try on my trip. 12 oz. served in a pint glass at Brouwer's on November 27th, 2012. "
Served on tap into a becker glass at Pegasus Pizza
Appearance: orange and slightly cloudy. Thin head. Lacing lasts through the whole glass.
"Have enjoyed this beer a number of times in recent months (once at the Bend brewery, but many times around Portland - most recently on sun-drenched afternoons at Hot Lips Pizza on NE Killingsworth, Branch Whiskey Bar on Alberta St. and Slim's in St. Johns... then in a plastic cup at St Johns Cinema, across N Lombard). In Slim's case, it's a paltry $2.75 for a HH pint... it's becoming soooo easy to find in PDX and that's a very good thing!"
"On-tap at Liquid Assets in Ashland, Oregon. Been wanting to try a Boneyard IPA for a while. Enjoyed 8 July 2012, reviewed from notes."
Poured into a snifter.
"Hazy peach flesh hued body capped by a big, sticky, clinging head. Looks great in a raw, unrefined sort of way."
"Pint served on tap into a mason jar @ Chuck's. My first Boneyard beer, made a special trip for this one."
Thanks to the excellent pwnzilla for a growler of this West Coast treat. Popped open & shared in line for the Steel Toe 'Before the Dawn' release. 
"Growler just picked up from Main Brew, poured into a 1/2 liter stein, RPM is pale orange with an off-white head, big, fluffy and tight, leaving heavy lace. "
Another great Boneyard beer brought from Bend by my brother. Thanks Bro!
"Pints at Collins Pub, Seattle"
I had this wonderful beer on-tap in a pint glass at the Barking Dog Alehouse in Seattle.
"20oz pour at Horse Brass pub in Portland, OR. Looks like it has moved over onto the permanent tap list."
Had on tap at Corner Bar in Tacoma on 4/29/12. 
A: Clear light amber in color. Forms a minimal off-white head that slowly reduces to a patchy surface coating. Leaves some minimal lacing. 
"on-tap, bottleworks."
"Holy hell. I found this at Taphouse Grill (downtown Seattle). I've always wanted to try this, but I didn't want to drive all the way down to Federal (99 Bottles) to get it. "
"Growler from 99 Bottles, filled with m Magnolia growler. 6 days old."
"Picked up a growler in Tacoma, Wa after sampling. "
"February 26, 2012 @ floor_6"

"Appearance- Clear straw color, good lacing, slightly off white head. 4.5/5"
On tap at Belmont Station on 12.27.2011.
"A: Got a half growler of this at NW Liquid Gold in Vancouver. Beer is a nice clear orange color, pretty good sized head with good lace."
"On-tap served in pint glass at Brickhouse in Vancouver, WA."
"This is a fantastic beer. I've had it several times, always on tap. Most recently, I had it during dinner at a well-known Portland restaurant."
Pours a clear orange with a very nice 2 finger off white head.
A pint at Collins Pub in Seattle on 10/3/11
"Poured a subdued orange-amber into a tulip with a finger of off-white head. Huge, bright aroma of grapefruit and tangerine with a touch of caramel."
A: Poured a deeper but glowing orange color with good carbonation and a nice white cap
"This IPA was amazing! It had alot of simcoe in the aroma and taste. It had a lot of mandarin, Ginger, apricot, and some resiny pine in the taste. This beer was quite amazing, it has a lot of characteristics I would like to emulate. I expect great things from Boneyard."
"Big thanks to ramnuts for trucking a growler of this back from Bend. I really need to get out there for a weekend sometime soon. I went over to his house, he thrust a half filled pint glass of this into my hand, I sniffed, quickly paid attention, tasted, and bellowed ""this shit is great, what is it?!"""
"Hazy golden colour with a creamy, off-white head. Good head retention."
"On tap at Latona Pub in Seattle, WA. 8/5/2011."
"Pours a hazy, barely transparent dark honey golden with a good pale beige head. Hoppy aroma has a firm fruity component that is more sweet than sour and mainly orange with a hint of lemon. Strongly hoppy flavor has a sweet citrus undertone, a touch of honey and almost no bitterness - overall, quite pleasing. Texture is smooth, fizzy and lively."
On tap at the Horse Brass last night.
"Oh man, I thought this was an exceptional beer. Many thanks to my buddy Dave for sharing this (and more thanks to his brother, who brewed it!). Looks great, a clear copper color with some moderate off-white head. Smell is great, some big hops in there, pine and citrus on the nose. Huge hop punch."
"Look: Pale yellow, very pilsner looking of a color, thin white head."
Growler that my buddy Pete filled up for me... 
Poured from the can into a tulip.
"On tap at Prohibition Pig brewpub, Waterbury, Vermont. This was poured into a half pint glass, the brewpub normally pours it in. The appearance was a hazy blurry yellow color with a slim white little head that dissipated and left no lacing. The smell started off with a sweet citrus and sweet grassy blend leading into subtle crisp tropical fruits and underscored by just a little bit of bitter pine. The taste had a moderate amount of sweetness with some light bitterness of the pine carrying itself back into the balance of it all. A light citrus aftertaste runs into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sessionable crispness carrying itself along my tongue. Overall, this was a very nice AIPA that I would have again."
"On tap at Haymaker, NYC, had the classic New England IPA looks with a lovely gold hazy hue, but the head was pretty small from the tap pour."
"Look: A light, dull orange color. "
In a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303. 
Had out of a pint glass at a bar.
On-draught @ The Ginger Man NYC.
"L - light orange, opaque, lots of lacing"
Bottle Date: growler 10/14/16
"Pale but bright pastel yellow with some rising bubbles forming a soft finger of creamy head, exhibiting tons of lace that develop like ridges off the head."
Nice....
"Certainly a top notch IPA. Simcoe brings loads of floral and grassy hops that also express orange, grapefruit, and lemon peel. The body is creamy and smooth. Balanced flavors with the bitterness and the juicy citrus."
"Finally had it at HF on a day I was there. Growler purchased 4/9/16, consumed 4/13/16. Poured into Lawson's tulip glass."
Poured from a 750 ml growler from HF on 3/30/2016. First time drinking Legitimacy.
Growler. White head. Lots of lace. Hazy yellow.
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery.
Has a funny taste so it's really not a 4.25 but it should be tried again when the keg isn't kicked
"consumed on draft previously, review from can purchased at the brewery. pours out a beautiful hazed straw color with a dense and fluffy bright white head that hangs around throughout and decorates the glass with excellent lacing. this one is such a wonderful showcase of simcoe, pithy grapefruit, earthy and herbal dankness, grassy and some pine. almost a hint of like a tea note ... also the nose had this earthy herbaceous quality that reminded me of the smell of the brewery lol. some bready malts showing up as well. nice creamy mouthfeel medium-light bodied. overall an excellent offering."
"1/15/16 - On tap at Monk's in Philly. Again, super tasty! Had to have a couple. "
Growler poured into a snifter.
"On-tap 8/1/2015 at Armsby Abbey, in Worcester, MA served in a tulip glass."
A: Yellow orange like a pelligrino. Pure white head and rings of lace. 
"Earthy, nice grass, mild pine, some citrus, not much in the way of bitterness."
From 10/19/15 notes. 2 8oz. pours of this at Pony Bar in HK in NYC.
"Drank from a 750 ml (25.36 fl.oz.) growler purchased at Hill Farmstead Brewery, Greensboro Bend, VT"
What's to say. These boys knocked it out the park on this beer. Everything you want and expect from a Verrmont/East Coast IPA. Brilliant.
"On tap at Prohibition Pig. Pours a hazy pale orangey yellow with an inch plus of head. Some lacing. Smells amazing. The aroma is tons of juicy citrus. Lemon, lime, orange and grapefruit. The taste is citrus hops but some grassy hops as well I didn't get in the aroma. Lemon and lime at the finish with some grapefruit rind. Oily, dry mouthfeel. Not much of an alcohol presence. Medium bodied. Overall, outstanding IPA."
I enjoyed this fresh from the growler purchased at Hill Farmsted in a goblet chilled.
"Had at the Hill Farmstead brewery on Saturday, 9/26, poured into a wine glass. Pours a hazy straw color with not much head on it, some bubbles leave lacing. Smell is a nice gentle breeze of fruity hops, some back end sweetness. This is a bit confusing for me, it's an IPA at 6.7%, but it looks and feels like a Pale Ale or Blonde Ale. Super drinkable, but the overall flavor is a bit light. It's a dry IPA with a nice citrus flavor from the hops, slightly bitter. Overall I think this would make for a nice summer IPA but I was a bit let down by it."
A cloudy golden color with a whispy but complete white head and a major coating of lace from the top down. The nose gets tasteful grapefruit and light grains with just a hint of malty cat piss. Lovely. The palate enjoys a heightened citrus hop and somewhat grassy bitterness. It's crisp and tingly in feel with a medium light body that really goes down easily. Hints of tropical fruits here. Just a real pleaser for hop lovers.
Mulebar winooski vt
"Bright golden with a big white head and ample lacing. Notes of mango, light sugar, light grapefruit, and fruit juice. Light medium body with soft but appropriate carbonation and slightly dry. This is an amazing IPA with a big fruity profile that I completely dig."
Served at Fool's Gold NYC.
"Pours bright orange like a low-cal orange juice with a one finger frothy head. Smells of juicy citrus and earthy malts, spicy hops. Taste is so balanced and has it all - citrus, biscuity malts, bitter hops, a light peppery mouth feel. Drinkable is an understatement. It's hard to pick out anything this beer doesn't excel at. Great brew that can stand up to anything else."
Insanely drinkable and insanely delicious.....that is all
"Poured a beautiful hazy orange, nice foamy white head."
"Look: Pale, hazy, yellow, white head that lingers. Very little lacing."
"Poured from a growler into a shaker pint, the beer is an opaque, pale, lemon yellow coloring with a frothy, foamy, clingy, bright white head. Aromas of lemon, tangerine, pepper spice, grass notes, a bready backbone, and subtle piney highlights. Flavors are insanely balanced, with a grassy and lemon sweet blend forward, followed by tangerine, orange rind, pine pitch, and subtle pepper spice. All of these characteristics are riding on a bready backbone. The body is smooth and light, with a subtle crisp and dry feel at the end. The aftertaste is grassy and bitter, with the citrus notes being subdued slightly. Smooth, slightly dry finish with a lingering bitterness. Great beer."
"A great compilation brew. Tons of tropic fruit on the nose and taste. Tangerines, pineapple, oranges. Not a lot of bitterness, this beer has a smooth and slight carbonation and a fruity acidic lingering taste that lasts a long while on the pallet. A top notch IPA"
"Sweet and juicy IPA. Nose and taste of peach, grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Practically fruit in a glass. Smooth mouthfeel. An excellent IPA that any IPA lover should fine more than acceptable."
From growler purchased at HF
Poured from a 750ml growler acquired at hill farmstead 
Silky smooth mouthfeel. Light crisp dose of citrusy hops w/ pils-esque malt backbone. Citrus and pine dominate the taste and make this one a smooth drinker.
Tap poured
Growler filled at brewery on 7/22/15; drank in tumbler glass in 7/23/15
"on tap at the three penny yesterday afternoon. man, that place is awesome, I miss it badly. a very hazy but still bright tulip of beer, with a lacy white head over an inch high and lasting. the impact of the oats in this are immediately apparent. its got that oatmeal sweetness and basic feel to it, a totally fuller body and more neutral ph. I always think oatmeal ipas are really hit or miss, when it goes wrong its usually way off, but this one is excellent. I love the oily hop complexion, not nearly as subtle as some of the other Vermont ipas that are hot right now, its aggressive and very very aromatic. the oats I think, aside from making it feel fluffy and big without sweetness, help it linger a little longer in the finish, bring out the flavor of the yeast to its fullest, and stand out from the crowd. so smooth and round and big in the feel, but so dry, just hop oil remaining. I thought grassroots meant a hill farmstead collaboration. who is this one done with? doesn't matter, its fantastic. well worth a trip to montpelier for a glass"
"Just fantastic. Really nice citrus flavour with a pine backing. Incredibly smooth. I find one common thread with HF beers is how smoothly the flavours come together. The flavour is usually a bit subtle, rather than pounding your palette into submission. As a result, the first sip usually does not wow me, but as the beer continues, the exceptional quality begins to become clear. This fits that mold. Moderately bitter, very tasty, and incredibly drinkable. First rate IPA."
Acquired on draft 5/16/15 at the Hill Farmstead brewery.
"Bought a growler brewed at Hill Farmstead, poured into IPA glass."
Had this on tap at the farm house tap & grill. Was surprised by it's yellow appearance and white foam. It was delicious! Great beer.
Growler filled during the weekend of the Festival of Farmhouse Ales. Another beautiful IPA from Hill - super crisp and clean with an incredible hop aroma and balanced flavor.
Delicious rarity imported into the Midwest for a special occasion.
Certainly a Hill Farmstead formula. Great beer! Up there with the best..
"Delicious hop and citrus flavors, mild bitter finish and the usual smooth, understated HF flavors... Another amazing offering from the Hill."
Split with angrybabboon.
"Split with Goblinmunkey7, growler filled about 3 hours ago"
"On tap at Beachwood Brewing in Long Beach, CA."
"Juicy, citrus, tropical fruits. Clean finish. Traditional Hill malt bill.........................................................................................."
Poured into HF stemware
"a - Pours a very light golden yellow. An ever so slight haze can be noted as well. When poured a small amount of head forms, about half a finger width. The head dissipates rather quickly with no real lacing noticeable. This looks like it's going to taste like the perfect beer."
"Had this at the Prohibition Pig in Waterbury last week after tasting some Lawsons (Sip O sunshine), Hill Farmstead (Abner, George, Society & Solitude #5) and Heady Topper and this was my favorite beer of the weekend. For me, this is the perfect beer, right now at least."

2L growler filled at Hill Farmstead 2 days ago.
Poured from growler obtained at the brewery yesterday 4/12/14
"Cloudy, yellow-gold and apricot colouring."
"Pour is hazed pale yellow with a tight white head. Nose is mango, citrus, and grapefruit extremely strong. Faint touch of pine and herbal hop. Taste is not as fruity and bright as the nose. Taste has a hint of malt up front, lightly toasted. Hops take over, more grapefruit and less tropical fruit. Light herbal tea hop in back with a moderate bitterness in the finish. Well carbonated and soft body."
The beer is a lightly hazy straw golden color.

"Legitmacy IPA pours a hazy straw yellow with a moderate, creamy snow white head on top. The foam fades quickly leaving a netted pattern of lace on the glass."
"Poured out as a cloudy yellow color with a nice white head on top. The smell of the beer has a solid hoppiness to it, the taste has a good amount of hops as well. The feel of the beer is decent, rather sessionable. Overall this beer is good, I found it to be pretty refreshing."
"Growler picked up at the bottle release on Thursday, drank Friday. shared with rudzud."

On tap at Blackback Pub.
"Having this one from a growler, but I also had it straight from the tap at the brewery and 3rd anniversary party."
"First had this on tap at Alpine Beerco and Restaurant – Alpine, CA"
This is a solid from Beachwood- it tastes much better and fuller than than Tongue Tickles which was thinner in taste. This beer competes with the best of them and it is a grab from the shelf when you see it beer.
A - Pours a clear golden color with a one inch head.
Bottled today 5/5 picked up from Noble.
Poured at 45°F from a 22oz bottle (drink before date 16Dec15) into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
"This beer pours a crystal clear golden orange color with a 1.5 finger fluffy white head. There is not much retention at all and spotted lacing at best. The smell is a great mix of grapefruit, orange, mango, lemon and dank pine. The taste follows suit with a nice tropicql fruitiness up front and a great deal of piney bitterness on the back end. Feel is light side of medium slick and very drinkable, no noticeable alcohol. Overall a great west coast IPA."
22oz bottle poured into an IPA glass.
22 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass
"look: light orange color, more yellow than red and not much of a head when you pour it."
Appearance: this beer is a sexy ass goldish orange with yellow hues glittering in the edges. Almost completely clear and filtered. Super nice looking beer.
Not bad. Not quite there yet. Needs a smoother back end. Some more floral at the front. The carb is good. Needs to be juicier IMO. Cheers.
"I call this Pupil minus, Which is a high compliment. A solid and top IPA that competes with the best."
"Lemon yellow, slightly hazy brew, topped with a billowy white head of decent size. Good retention and lovely lacing."
Another home run from Noble Ale Works.
Nobel makes some pretty amazing stuff. This is up there with anything else they make.
A: Golden to straw. perfect balance of clear with hazy hue. Medium to large white bubbles.
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a white head. Doesn't leave much lacing. Smell comes off with huge dank aromas followed by mango, pineapple, guava, berries, pepper, citrus, and just a hint of pine. Taste follows the nose for the most part. Not overly bitter and a really clean finish. Slight malt sweetness on the back end. Mouthfeel is light with a good amount of carbonation. Can't really complain about much. Overall a fantastic IPA. Noble just keeps putting out amazing beers."
"Bitter, citrus, hoppy with a touch of pine. Really an excellent ipa"
Updating my review after the most recent bottling. 
"An accumulation of all they've learned with the Showers series of beers. It really seems like they used every hop from their series in this beer to some degree. They've lightened the ABV to a tidy 7.5%, same clean malt profile and gone heavy on the Amarillo and Mosaic for a berry and clean citrus flavor uppercut with more tropical notes on the nose. I really do love it! This is worthy of the mark, California IPA."
These guys know what there doing! Great beer!
"This is a very good result from the culmination of Noble's Shower series. A little heavy on the Amarillo, and the resulting bittering notes that come from it, for my taste, but overall this is a very well done west coast IPA. I would drink this everyday, worth seeking out fresh."
"Oh my god the smell!! Smell is citrus, piney, and hoppy. Just like citra and mosaic hops. Initial taste is very bright. It's like a Slightly bitter grunion"
"wow! I've smelled something like this before, but this is even more pungent and yummy-smelling! very thin, very light, no alcohol burn for the 7 1/2%, and very nice smooth flavor of some premium hops. mosaic, simcoe, citra, centennial, equinox.... must be an expensive brew to make. super nice brass color; a true delight to finally try. had to hard pour it to get some head, but a great beer doesn't have to be great on all cylinders to be great, right? this is a great brew!"
Drink before 6/19/15.
Look-golden with zero lacing and head.
"Appearance: Arrives at the bar with a clear amber color; no amount of shaking can stir up a head, however"
"Noble makes a lot of good beers and I think this is probably the best IPA I've had from them. Really outstanding and well-balanced. Had it on tap at Far Bar in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles."
"A: Hoppy aromas of danky, white grape mixed with berries, coupled with a light cracker malt sweetness. "
On tap at Cellarmaker
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, yellow session. Mostly grassy and dank, herbal with a medium bitterness. Body is quite light and dry."
"i have always said that you could dump a boatload of nelson hops into a glass of urine and it would smell and taste delicious, so its always a little weird critically judging nelson beers. i love the hop so much that i favor almost any beer that uses it. this is one of the best examples of it, pure and true, unmolested by other hops, too much grain or alcohol, or time in a bottle. fresh as can be at the taproom, it has a pale yellow milky unfiltered east coast look to it under an inch of shaving cream thick white head. all nelson in the nose, pineapple from the can, white peaches, lemon meringue, and all the other aromatic elements this hop brings to the part so consistently. the flavor here is more like a pale than an ipa, not a lot of bitterness happening here at all. a nice juicy fresh hop flavor for certain, but it trails off a little at the end, primarily late kettle, whirlpool, and dry hopped i would imagine. some fruity notes, white grape, tangerine, pineapple in the taste, and a nice wheaty or oaty rich structured but nice and dry grain base for it. if you want to know what nelson hops do, this is a perfect example of it. i could have drank ten of these happily..."
"On-tap at Alvarado Street Brewery, Monterey, CA"
"From a growler into a high ball glass. Hotel life. Pours golden, hazy and with light carbonation. Light head. Sticky trails of lacing. 4.25"
Very nice nelson character
I guess I'm really not a fan of nelson hops. Just doesn't do it for me
Growler from the brewery. 
"Pours a nice, bright shade of gold. Quite clear, looks perfectly transparent. Medium head, pure white. Lots of lacing, good retention. The aroma is fruity and pretty juicy with sweet hop flavors. Big white grapes, white peaches, pine, raspberries, mangoes, some pineapple. All sweet fruit with little malt contribution beyond simple background sweetness. Moderate bitterness. Starts out honey malt sweet before drying out and letting the hops take over. Mango, pine, grass finish. Light feel, normal carbonation, some hop oiliness. Very nice. Interesting blend of the these two hops. I prefer Nelson to Mosaic, but it’s all good hop fruit salad."
My favorite Trillium beer (so far) with hazy look and smooth finish. Tough to find it though as I'm not sure if this was limited.
"Excellent New England juicy IPA. My only mistake was having double dry hopped Summer Street before this base model. While DDH Summer Street is extraordinary, this is a solid, enjoyable beer from it's hazy golden color, to its light and satisfying series of flavor stages."
"Dated 5/8/18 on the bottom of the can, 12 days since brewing."
Simcoe all over
Poured to a BrewDog stemmed glass.
Poured from can with perfect head. Pours a thick cloudy yellow. Smell has hints of fruit but taste is malty. Smooth on palat with a bitter finish. Good beer but others are better from this great brewery.
16oz can dated 5/24/17.
"Pours a hazy orange with two fingers of white head. Good retention, with no lacing left behind. Aroma is citrus, orange peel, lemon zest, lemon grass, with a kiss of tropical hops in the back. Flavor profile is orange peel, lemon zest, lemongrass, and tropical hops. Biscuit malts are there, but only in the distant background. Mouth feel is smooth, with a velvety texture. It has a medium thickness. Overall, heavy citrus notes, but in a smooth package. Active malt notes in the flavor profile keep this NE IPA drinking extremely smooth. "
"L: hazy, yellow, white head, lacing"
"Poured 5/17/17 from a 64oz growler that was filled at the brewery on 5/15/17, into a mug glass."
"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass on 5/14 (11 days after the release). Appearance is a hazy yellow orange, almost like darker orange juice. Smell is citrus (tangerine, orange pulp) with pine, oats, and lemon. There is a hint of caramel sweetness. Taste follows the nose with really clean citrus flavors (almost pureed orange) and a good balance of pine. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy up front (medium body) with a good amount of carbonation coming through on the mid palate and finish."
"Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is tangerine, pineapple, and white grape juice. Slightly sweet, medium-bodied with low carbonation. This one is a lot more subtle than other Trillium beers. Layers of gentle fruit unravel. Great tasting beer. Certainly in the upper quarter of Trillium beers I have had."
Poured into my favorite Lost Abbey long stim tulip glass canned on 3/23/17. Pours a very hazy dark yellow with a 2 finger sticky white head that leaves behind plenty of webs of lace.
Poured from a can and the smell of citrus hit me right away. This is a beautiful looking beer as well. 
A pint can dated 01/30/17 received in a generous box from fellow BA jhavs poured in a 13oz. tulip. 
"A hazy glass of orange juice with an aroma that explodes with oranges and grapefruit pith. There is also a nice pine scent that is complimentary and not overpowering. The taste is a nice, malty sweetness with tons of citrus flesh and pith with a nice striking bitterness at the end that cleans it all up. This is really a fantastic beer."
"Had this on 2016-12-06 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz can, with a canned date of 2016-11-17, so this is about 3 weeks old."
"this was one great beer, the look and smell were fantastic and wafted very strongly through glass as I drank. taste deep grapefruit and pineapple, great flavor and this is deeply recommended. great carbonation"
L: Gorgeous golden haze with half inch head. Assuming soft carbonation so not expecting more.
"Overall a great beer by Trillium. Beautiful golden orange. Quite hazy. Not as much head built up as I hoped and didn't last as long as expected either (possibly a downside to the soft carbonation that pair so well with this style of IPA). Aroma is a little subtle but when you get your nose in there it is fantastic. Pine, citrus, grassy notes. Similar hop notes in the flavor but a bit sweeter than expected. Would prefer a little more dry. Great mouthfeel. Overall great beer."
"Hazy, bright ripe peach color with off-white head. Aroma has floral, grassy notes with a touch of grains. Taste starts slightly sweet and fruity with lots of citrusy hops. Finishes with medium to low bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. Really tasty and extremely drinkable for 7.2 ABV."
Poured a very hazy golden orange color with two fingers worth of bubbly head. The smell is orange up front with some pine a spice following. The flavor is much spicier than the nose leads on but it's balanced well with the pine and citrus from the hops. The more you drink the better the flavors meld and more of the hop flavors take over and remind you what type of beer you are drinking. The feel is medium with decent carbonation and dry finish. I've only had 4 beers from Trillium but each one has been superb!
"16 oz can. Pours hazy orange, two finger head slowly fades, sticky lacing. Big citrusy aroma with grape notes. Juicy taste with grape notes evident and some citrus peel and grassy bitterness. Silky soft medium feel. So good."
"Poured out as a hazy yellow color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer is citrusy, mostly getting some lemon notes and some orange. The taste of the beer is slightly sweet and then it transitions over to hoppy, good juicy bitter finish. The feel of the beer is smooth and creamy. Overall this beer is damn good."
"Poured from a 16oz can into Trillium glass, cuz I'm cool like that."
"750ml brown bottle, sample purchased from Gordon's Wines in downtown Boston, MA. "
Bottle Date: 3/15/16
Bottled 3/15/2016. 
"Simcoe is a hit or miss hop, mostly on the batch/year of the harvest, so hopefully this is more tropical fruit and grapefruit and less pine and resin. Bottled 3/15/16."
DDH version is way better. This one lacks the hop punch and mouth feel I have come to expect from Trillium
"This beer pours a hazy straw yellow golden color with a loose 3 finger soapy white head. Actually slightly more transparent than other Trillium beers. The retention is great and there are some hanging spots of lacing. Smell is citrus (lemon and orange) dank pine, and a bit of hop spiciness. Taste is the same with a good amount of bitterness on the finish. Feel is light side of medium, juicy and smooth. Overall another excellent Trillium beer. Over a month old and still packing a hop wallop. Fantastic!"
Serving: Bottle
"pours a golden yellow hazy murk, head that dissipates quickly and rings the glass. lacing. smell is very different from every other street I've had: Apple juice and citrus. malt is pretty apparent. taste is apple juice, citrus, and pine and it's really not that juicy like most of their other hoppy beers. feel is decent, could be a little fuzzier. hate to say it, but I think this is my least favorite trillium offering to date, and it's still better than 95% of what you can find elsewhere."
From 04/15/16 notes.
White head with some lace. Golden orange color.
"Very good beer but slightly below par for Trillium. It doesn't taste like they made it as it's missing that signature mouthfeel and depth the rest of their IPAs have. Pretty much a lemon bomb unsurprisingly as Simcoe is on display here. The simcoe does shine pretty well though. Lemony, earthy, slicy. Mouthfeel isn't as rich as their other hippy offerings. Very good beer if another brewery made it"
"Hazy NE IPA appearance. Juicy floral aroma. Spicy nailpolish-esque taste. Enjoyed it. Yes, nail polish is a compliment."
"This would be a good IPA on its own, but against the majority of other trillium pale ale's and IPAs it is close to the bottom. Not bad, but prefer other trillium beers by far, wouldn't seek this out in the future."
Consumed 4/4/16
750ml Bottle dated 2/23/16 
"Another citrus bomb from Trillium. Orange juice at the forefront. Very smooth. Not as assertive as other Trillium IPAs, but the most balance. This is very close to Treehouse's Julius in my opinion..a very underrated beer in the unbelievable Trillium portfolio."
"A: Hazy, straw colored yellow with a thin, white and soapy head."
3/15/16 bottling date
L - straw colored haze. Can't see through it. 
Easily one of my favorite Trillium to date.
"Ok,I had to write this one up. Since the new Trillium brewery opened I have been able to get some of their single and double ipas on a somewhat regular basis. I really like them all but this one motivated me to write a review. Maybe it turns out simply that I am a simcoe fan but the overall taste and feel of this beer is my favorite Trillium to date. The nose is subtle, much less citrus than Congress St or even the dry hooped Fort Points but the taste in my opinion is perfect. So much bright citrus flavor and a perfect somewhat bitter aftert atste. I will have trouble not picking this one up whenever I see it moving forward!"
"In the land of super citrus forward, super hopped up ipas, I'm glad trillium throws summer street into the mix. It embraces more subtle hop notes and hammers them into the palette through their unique methods - it makes for a truly unique experience. "
A - Poured a completely opaque cloudy orange-juice-like yellow with a thin layer of off-white head.
750ml bottle dated 02/23/16
"I really didn't want to say this, but I gotta let folks know- this is the best kept secret at Trillium I know that all the other beers are very good, as I have had and have been impressed by many, but this one perhaps because it was extra'ed to me I had very low expectations for. However, the balance of bitterness, bursting w lemon, and the buoyancy of citrus all bring the taste to an absolute satisfaction."
"Outstanding IPA. Enjoyed from a growler capped two days ago. Pours a bright golden hue with a light lace atop. Aroma of stone fruit, orange rind, grapefruit and pakalolo. Taste follows suit with a lingering bitterness that settles on the tongue. Tropical, citrus, bitter, light malt, very dry."
"Pours orange hazy and unfiltered with a one finger head. Smells of orange and citrus with some herbal hops. Taste is juicy, orange, really 'summery' actually. Drinkable and smooth to boot. Some bitterness on the back end. Light body. This is a nice and delicious IPA from Trillium. One that tends to see a little more rotation. Worth picking up."
"Poured into a tulip - comes out very light and hazy. I like the smell of this quite a bit - really like smelling some orange juice. The taste is a different matter, though. It has a little bit of that citrus taste, but it just feels like it's missing something, and the finish is a bit too bitter. I'll see how I like the remainder of the Trillium brews I recently picked up."
Poured into a tulip glass.
"This beer looks like a glass of orange juice; it pours a hazy pale golden orange in color with a finger of frothy white head the settles to just a film and leaves sporadic lacing. Aroma is very heavy on mangoes and citrus, namely orange, with a fair amount of rind. Taste follows the aroma with mangoes and oranges dominating with some peppery notes in the background; fairly juicy. Medium-light body and moderate carbonation. Overall an enjoyable beer, not one of Trillium's best but it does have a great deal of their typical haze and a touch of the juiciness."
Bottle dated 12/19/15; drank in a teku glass on 12/21/15
My favorite Trillium IPA
"Wow! Welcome to the orange grove. I love the smell an taste of oranges, and this beer has it in spades. A nice soft finish that will make you yearn for more."
"Look-color is a hazy straw, pours two fingers of eggshell colored head that leaves wonderful lacing as it settles."
Thanks Kevin.
"Lackluster in every aspect. for a trillium ipa this is terrible. Mind you, for texas this could be top 5 for sure, but overall, in comparison, it isnt hoppy enough, doesnt have the body..."
750ml into snifter. ~10 days old.
The color is a golden unfiltered masterpiece. Nose smells strong with citrus. Great taste. Solid IPA by trillium
"Pours an utmost hazy, amber-yellow color, with a great, stable head."
"Hazy pale orange. 2 finger head with no quits. Good lacing down the sides. Light hops on the smell and citrus yeast. Good citrusy taste, not over-lemoned though the balance diminishes over time. Carbonation present, smooth, citrus tang. More new england ipa than a summer beer, but very good."
"Hazy peach color, thick head that lingers nicely. Great lacing on the glass as it drinks. The citrusy, mango hop aroma is the star of the show here. Hop flavors shine nicely on the taste with a pleasant bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation on the mouthfeel. Overall very solid beer from the good folks at Trillium."
"Trillium Brewery - Summer Street IPA. (7.2%) Rated 96/100 on Beer Advocate. Bottled on 7/1/15 in Boston, MA."
The nose is great. I get a tropical fruit and citrus aroma with mangoes coming out frequently once it warmed up. The color was a murky peach orange. There is a light forward bitterness and it finishes the same way. Very refreshing to drink and another fantastic beer from Trillium. They are ruining all other IPAs for me.
Poured from the bottle into a snifter.
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
Foggy golden look.. Hoppy citrus grapefruit taste to it..
64 oz growler was poured into a pint glass. 
750 mL bottle poured into a snifter.
"Pale golden yellow in color. Turbid in appearance. Lots of tangerine, orange rind, and pineapple citrus. Tropical fruit nose. Cracker malt base with a creamy feel. Very good."
"Hazy honey yellow color with a creamy white head on top. Lots of netted lace on the glass. Dank tropical fruit aroma with some grapefruit mixed in. Medium bodied, mild carbonation, dank flavors of tropical fruit, grapefruit, and pine. Finishes dry with lingering tropical fruit. This is a delicious full flavored beer."
"Not one of Trillium's stand out IPAs, but still pretty darn good."
Great flavor. Another great trilliuim beer
"Pours a familiar hazy light apricot (just say no to clear beers!)... with a foamy white head that slowly dissipates into a thin layer of soapy-looking bubbles (why any of this matters I don't know)... juicy pine-floor hops and orange-citrus make up the nose and taste with just the right amount of bitter finish... reminds me of HF citra, but could be some galaxy in their... not sure, but damn trillium is hitting it out of the park-- another winner!!"
12 oz bottle from a six pack purchased at the LCBO; bottled Aug 8 2018 and served slightly chilled.
"355 ml bottle served cold into a tulip. Purchase came out to $3 CDn per bottle, but it's not often that we get SoCal IPA's available in this neck of the woods."
I don’t love it for some reason
"Like this a lot, have tried several Ballast Point beers, like them all, this is my favorite. Citrus in nose & taste, good mouth feel, expensive so I pick it up when on sale."
Darn good
"This is my favorite IPA so far. Tried about 15 and I'm from SD, the ""IPA capital of the US"" so most have been local and very highly decorated and rated. This one is NOT what I thought it would be. I actually hate that ""piney"" (guess some people eat pine...) and ""hoppy"" IPA taste. I hate grapefruit too. This is much more like what I like: Juicy orange and apricot with a HINT of grapefruit and lemon rinds. Very, very well done. I consider this world-class, minus the smell and look, which drag it down a bit."
L - golden with notes of orange highlights with a good amount of clarify and a medium off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves behind a little bit of lacing. 
"Pours a very nice orange color, a bit cloudy. Big long-lasting head. Excellent balance between bitterness and citrusy sweetness, with just a hint of the namesake grapefruit coming through. A great beer and a very well-balanced IPA!"
I’m just not a fan of grapefruit
Strong grapefruit flavor.
"Very smooth easy to drink, strong citrus notes"
On tap at BJ's Brewhouse. Solid but if grapefruit wasn't in the name I don't know that I would have identified it as such. Beautiful orange/golden color.
Lives up to its name and tastes exactly how one would imagine it. Accessible but expensive which is typical for Sculpins. It’s a great beer and more than worth trying especially if you’re a fan of the regular Sculpin IPA.
There are a few crafted so well that words are insufficient to describe how much pleasure and satisfaction can be delivered by those brews and this is one of them.
"On tap at Albertsons. True to its name, big citrus aroma and taste (yellow grapefruit). Normal body with decent fluffy head. Goes down exceptionally easy for 7%."
Pours golden amber with heavy fading foam head. Nice notes of tart grapefruit and citrus. Good balance to bitter hop with a summery bite... good IPA!
L: This beer looks like a great IPA should. Created a 2 and a half finger head. A copper color to it great looking IPA.
its a really good IPA but i do prefer the Original Sculpin to this one.
"A little disappointing given the high reviews already given. Very grapefruit-forward. Nice golden color, moderate carbonation and mild head that lingered. Smelled of citrus and grapefruit. Tasted of malt, floral and fruity hops, grapefruit, orange zest. Thin mouthfeel, slightly bitter grapefruit aftertaste. I actually prefer the Sculpin IPA."
"Love the in your face citrus & pine tar, and tropical notes vs IBU / ABV balance- The first WCIPA that I can actually say was ""refreshing"". Drink it really well chilled from a chilled glass. Just don't let it get warm, as it quickly becomes unpalatable when it goes above 50."
Poured into a pint glass.
"Sculpin is hard to beat, but adding Grapefruit kicks it up a notch. It's subtle, not overdone."
"Nice, lacey head. Very smooth, the draft more so than the bottle. To me, the grapefruit knocks down the hops a bit and brings out the malt. Nice nose."
That hoppy grapefruit taste from this beer is delightful on the palate and makes for a smooth drinking experience.
"I hate all fruit beers, except this one. The grapefruit pairs perfectly with sculpin’s citrusy hop profile. It’s not overdone in anyway, which IPA lends itself to, but it does what it should perfectly. Widely distributed and simple to find, and pricey."
"great summer brew , ballast has other great beer as well"
Beautiful rose gold color with white cap and lacing.
12 oz bottle
"Bottled 1/4/18, consumed 2/25/18"
"The smell is basically as advertised - grapefruit, with some other citrus flavor underneath. It's very crisp, very refreshing, very tasty. It has very little bitterness (just a little on the back end) but also isn't sweet. It also doesn't have any of the tartness of actual grapefruit - everything else here softens the impact of the grapefruit and rounds it out with a very smooth, light mouthfeel with a slight spritz of carbonation that feels like it would be perfect for a bright, sunny day. This is expertly crafted and perfectly balanced, and definitely one of the best beers I've had to date."
the grapefruit flavor really enhances the citrus aroma of the hops.
drinkable.. ok.. somewhat bitter.. not too tasty
"Decent taste overall, grapefruit is a bit more pronounced then I would have liked."
Pretty decent brew but the addition of grapefruit adds an unneeded iffy flavor to a really good beer. Still looks nice and has a good feel to this brew. Not as good as the regular sculpin.
Very tasty IPA!
IPA with natural grapefruit flavors.
"Grains at the front and in the finish earthy hops, a burst of grapefruit in them middle. First drink will knock you back but easier to drink the farther in you get. Drink very cold."
16 oz draft
"Too much Grapefruit! Sculpin should not even be mentioned. This is a Grapefruit beer, period. It is similar to Graperfruit Shandy that I had from Leinenkugels, but more expensive. This does not feel like an IPA to me. Just too much Grapefruit which takes away from what made Sculpin great in the first place. The great Sculpin taste is taken away. This is not worth the price tag and quite frankly I'd stay away from this one. Sure if you absolutely LOVE grapefruit then maybe this is for you. If you just like grapefruit but enjoy IPA more then don't get this. If you don't like IPA's well then why are you buying this, just go get Grapefruit Shandy, some fruity wheat beer."
"Taste: tangy super dry, grapefruit juice, semi sour, bitter citrus hops. Fresh squeezed Grapefruit juice, tart, and some dry hopped nose. Gold, mostly clear, tall white foam head. Medium body. Lots of people lick this sour bitter but one glass is enough for me. 70 IBUs"
my favorite..on tap or canned (icy cold).
"Pours a cloudier version of regular sculpin, a little bit orange with plenty of that grapefruit zested skin floating throughout the beer. Aroma smacks less of the dry hopping and more of the old school grapefruit C hop bitter kick."
"Hands down my favorite, readily available beer. Pours the prettiest deep, gold color of any beer. Hits all the spots that a West Coast IPA needs to hit, while the extra grapefruit makes it stand out just a little more."
"I think the regular Sculpin is overly bitter and this one, while similar and containing all the same bitterness, “freshens” it somewhat with the grapefruit addition. This seems to mellow it out. A hoppy but juicy, bright and refreshing drink."
very expensive given what you are drinking - west coast IPA through and through.
Looks like a typical IPA 
The look of this beer is s nice dark amber color with about a finger and 1/2 of head and lacing.
This is an expensive beer but oh boy it is worth it. It is the king of IPAs and beers in general. It just cannot be copied.
"Pours a clear, dark gold color with a little over a finger of fluffy, white head. Smells sweet with candied orange and grapefruit. Taste is red grapefruit, a tiny bit of bitterness, sweet malt flavor, and apricot. Dry, finishes very clean, smooth. Good grapefruit flavor, refreshing beer that has you coming back for more with the finish."
"A - Beautiful clear, deep-gold/amber, decent head with good retention"
Picked up a couple of bottles at the supermarket. Poured into a pint glass. Nice head and orange color. Smell is bursting citrus and grapefruit. Great for a summer day or night. Easy to drink if you like grapefruit. A nice dry IPA with a little fruity kick. Loved this beer.
Bottle
Delicious!
Light balanced IPA with tender grapefruit taste.
"Bright, clean gold with a 1/4"" off white head falls to a cap slowly....sticky lace, looks great."
"This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a nice hazy golden orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a good thirty seconds. The lacing stuck at first and then slid in a messy sort of way. The smell had a sweet and bitter grapefruit, somewhat like pulp and somewhat like rind. Extra citrus comes through nicely. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors to combine and lead a slight spice to round out. A dry grapefruit/grassy aftertaste leads to a quick dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation pounds like a fresh AIPA and subdues my tongue into submission. Overall, this is where it’s at, great stuff!"
Bottle dated 17140 (May 20). DFH Tulip.
"Bottled on 4/3/2017, drank it on 6/17/2017, so it's got some age on it. Poured into a tulip."
"Wow. Just got home after having 2 pints of this on tap at a local pizza place here in Lexington KY. It was the only draft IPA they had, and I was skeptical while ordering it, not being a big grapefruit fan in general. I was blown away by how tasty and drinkable this was. I couldn't really distinguish much grapefruit flavor in particular, just a general sweet fruitiness that was a perfect counterpoint to the hop bite. I'll definitely be seeking this one out in the future. Cheers!"
exceptional! well done!
"Poured into a shaker pint glass: color is straw gold, head is presented 1/2 inch thick with mixture of small/fine bubbles, head is off white."
"Beer and grapefruit ... go figure . It certainly works with this brew. A great summer beer, very refreshing."
"Julian date 16266 (9/16), enjoyed on 5/23/17... very disappointed about the freshness of the purchase but this beer is so highly coveted I had to give it a try..."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a small white head. Smells very strongly of grapefruit peel (maybe a little too strong which is my only complaint), and hops. Tastes of bitter hops and grapefruit. Medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall this is a great IPA, a little better than regular sculpin in my opinion."
This is F A B U L O U S !
"Great beer. Looks great. Smells fantastic. Tastes even better. Ballast Point is always ""on point"" w/ their IPA's!"
I've found..... true love.
Light amber appearance with one finger white head and plenty of carbination. Aroma is a very pleasant grapefruit and hops. Taste is at first dominated by grapefruit and then hops. Very refreshing combination.
West Hill Flats & Taps draft poured into a pint glass.
From Untappd
A-Pours a clear golden copper with medium head that dissipates quickly.
Pretty damn good
L - Medium/ Light Amber. Trace of head on glass.
Bottled on 2/7/17.
"Pours deep gold with nice foamy head and mild lacing. Smell is very nice, hoppy citrus with grapefruit in the front of the citrus. Taste is super dry hoppy goodness, with warm temps hitting AZ this is just a nice beer for a warm day. Lots of hops and that grapefruit bite make this a good outside beer. The finish is light carbonation with dryness, just a well done IPA."
L - Bronze/ copper with a little bit of clarity. 1 finger of head and lots of lacing left all over the glass. Gorgeous beer
"12 oz can aggressively poured into a pilsner glass to produce a sizable head. Holds the head for a couple minutes and left some sticky lacing on the glass. Beautiful burnt orange color that glows when held in the light. When they say grapefruit...holy smokes is it grapefruit! This beer smells like a fresh, sliced grapefruit with a passionfruit compliment (not just a hint), followed by the dank hop that the regular Sculpin is known for. The smaller the sip, the bigger the grapefruit I find, this beer should be slowly sipped for maximum flavor. Grapefruit, passion fruit, nice balance of citrus and hops, perfect amount of carbonation. Feels a bit on the thin side but if you're drinking a grapefruit you want it be thin. VERY impressed with this one. Will absolutely grab a sixer of this next time I see it."
Bottle Date: presumably this year
The grapefruit is very subtle in the bite of this excellent IPA. Would be my go-to if it were a little less expensive.
"Slightly cloudy and veiled golden color with low activity, and a mist of yeast. A foamy and bubbly creamy, beige with an orange hue, 2-3 finger head, lasting around 10 minutes, with pretty good legs, nice lace and swirl effect. Flavors of soft butter and caramel, grapefruits, tangerines, passion fruits, sweet grains, lemon, wild yeast, herbal spices. Tender tropical fruit sweetness with sharp bitter hops. Slick and smooth medium body with extra crispy carbonation. Medium to strong strength finish, slightly dry and clovey, a bit piney and grassy but dominantly fruity, with zesty citrusy hops, some hay and funky yeast. Quite delicious with a high quality fruity feel, almost like raw juice. Great balance and very well intensified, complex and rich. Highly fresh and drinkable. Almost like California in my mouth. Overall superb quality craft."
"Pours a dark golden color with a small white head. Smells of grapefruit and citrusy hops. Taste is sour grapefruit. Very little bitterness. Citrus aftertaste. Mouthfeel feel is medium. Overall, not impressed. Would like more bitterness, and less sour."
"Big mistake, don't brush your teeth before trying. Lots of grapefruit, not much hops. Dry finish."
"A: Moderate grapefruit, followed by a light citrusy hop aroma, "
"L: hazy orange, lightly carbonated, fluffy head that soon becomes lacing that smears the glass on every sip. "
A: Poured into an IPA glass to a clear and deep yellow topped by a three finger dense white head that retains well and leaves excellent lacing
"Look: dark golden and clear, looks like a nice clean ale"
I think I prefer this version over the original. Nice balanced grapefruit notes that do not overpower the base beer itself. And the hops still get to shine. Would like to try the other versions.
"On-tap served in a pint glass at Wishbeer, Bangkok."
Love this on tap. Bottled is good but not as amazing.
Poured from 12oz bottle without bottle/freshness date into standard pint glass. 
Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Cycle Brewing pint glass.
"A- Amber hue, one inch creamy white head with some lacing, ample amount of carbonation drifting up from the bottom"
I bought a bottle of this off the single shelf at the local Meijer. It poured a clear copper with white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent is grapefruit. The taste is bitter leaning but easy to drink. There was grapefruit present throughout. The Mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it's a solid beer.
355ml bottle into a Spiegleau IPA glass. Paid £5.10 for a single.
Nice beer with a good citrus taste nothing after.
"An excellent IPA. Grapefruit smell and taste is throughout, sometimes subtle, sometimes strong. The bitterness from the grapefruit blends with the hoppiness, creating a sour, but earthy bitterness."
"Pours a very clean, bright gold colour. Elf hair."
"Great beer just the right among of alcohol, bitterness and grapefruit. It is very refreshing. On tap at napped tandy"
It's a unique taste I'll give it that..
"Looks nice golden amber orange with medium white foamy head. Smell is citrus hops, juicy grapefruit, sweet aroma. "

GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint... a robust orange amber body raises confident bubbles at a constant rate... the two-finger head is thick, white, and lacing like a picket fence of cloud cover... yes, the grapefruit is the soup du jour, but a refreshing sense of lemon, an earthiness and flowery uplift that is winning... sweetness comes in an undercurrent of bread malts... mouth feel is incredibly sessionable, medium-bodied, active at the teeth but balanced enough... the aftertaste is ebullient, with plenty of staying power... flavor profile includes the aforementioned grapefruit, with lemon, orange, bread, and earthy hops... the much lauded Sculpin is given a fruity, Pacific island kind of feel, with enough strength to create a buzz after only a few... does not disappoint..."
"A 355ml bottle brought in Whole Foods while in NYC.  Pours a bright golden orange colour with a small foamy white head which leaves lacing. Moderate carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, citrus, tropical fruits, sweet candy, grass and dry hay. A comforting malty citrus backbone is present throughout with an initial taste of grapefruit, orange, and lemon, finishing with a hoppy grapefruit flavour that lingers, but does not dominate. Medium sweet aftertaste with a malty grapefruit medium hopped bitter finish. Overall a very good fruity AIPA."
"L -- pours a lively, two finger head with minimal lacing. Slightly Hazy orange and quite bubbly, this beer looks very refreshing "
Pours a slightly cloudy orangish-amber colour with a tall head on a hard pour & leaves some nice lacing. 
"Way too over priced for what it tastes like. It smells good. Its slightly hoppy, bummer, and not as grapefruity as I expected. Kinda normal beer/ipa mix taste to it. A tiny bit burnt out bitter, like a previous reviewer stated. It may just have been a bad batch due to merchandising negligence.(And because hardly anyone buys the things. I live in Vegas by the way) It does have a great orangey burp. Overall not great at all. Sorry guys at Ballast. I'm truelly not a picky snobby prick but your selling a Maybach and giving an Acura. Good but only 6.99 a six good. Not 16$ a six."
Serving: Can
"Finally bought a six pack for my birthday. The grapefruit is good, but both my wife and I are turned off by the metallic aftertaste. Not sure if it's us our an old batch."
"Copper filtered with a pink tinge, topped with 4 fingers of glass white head."
"A damn decent IPA with a citrus punch that they do a lot better than most of the ""citrus"" IPAs that have run rampant in America of late. What more can be said? Again and again I revisit this beer (despite its hefty price) and it still proves to be one of my favorites, not only from ballast point but overall. Will not disappoint. For a real treat get it fresh from the brewery in San Diego."
"One of the good tasting and easy drinking IPAs. If you want to drink it, it smells like a real grapefruit."
L - Clear amber - gold tint
"Pour is a clear golden orange hue. Settles quickly to a ring of head with excellent lacing. Aroma is grapefruit just as expected, with a few doses of pinneapple and mango as well. Somewhat grassy and piney compliment the real rich citrus smell. Taste follows the nose well, dominant grapefruit. Hoppy bitterness and a sweet malt profile in the back end. Not detecting any other tropical flavors except for grapefruit, which is fine with me. Mouthfeel is relatively thin bodied, moderate carbonation. Solid IPA, not quite as excellent as Sculpin, but the grapefruit title follows the taste and aroma very well."
I Like. this better than reg sculpin but overall this is grapefruit juice with a kick. good mouthfeel and overall a decent offering. better than the pineapple as well
A: Clear golden color that had an orange tint in the light. Beautiful fluffy head and steady bubbling from below.
"On tap at Verona Inn. An interesting rendition of the style given that the original Sculpin was such a hit. The grapefruit isn't as apparent as one might think, although the flavor is certainly enjoyable and thirst quenching. Citrus apparent throughout. Good stuff. Recommended."
"I had the opportunity to try this beer at a Seafood Restaurant: ""Dead Eye Dick's"" on Block Iland RI. it was an on tap version which frankly blew me away. What a tremendous beer! I subsequently bought a six pack, rather costly I might add and was somewhat dissapointed. All characteristics: color, appearance, foam, scent, etc. were essentially the same. However the taste was not. I preferred the on tap version as it revealed the balance of the grapefruit's acidity, sweetness, and bitterness all at once in a much more rapid manner. I thought perhaps it was because the tap version was slightly warmer when poured. So, I let the bottled version warm slightly but it still did not compare as well to that of the tap. I'm. Not disparaging this product at just stating a preference."
"In the past, the bottle dates in my area have been old for Sculpin. 8 months. A distributor problem,"
"Good beer, was somewhat disappointed at the hype. Might order again."
"Might be the best smelling IPA I have ever tried. Chewy, sweet, massive grapefruit. Incredible. The same is true of the taste, with a bit of alcoholic burn at the end. Great brew."
"6/19...pours bright gold, very still. Fast, fizzy and settles out to almost nothing. Strong grapefruit nose, pulpy. Full juicy malt flavor, controlled by a grapefruit sharp bitterness. Chewy mouthfeel, residual bitter. Excellent."
"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a cloudy golden color. There was a minimal white head and some lacing. The nose is mainly grapefruit. The taste isn’t overly bitter, but it has lots of grapefruit. A good malt body behind it."
"Perfectly clear, medium light amber."
"I love Sculpin, but for ME this was a grapefruit bomb."
Poured out of a 12 ounce can. Evident from the start that this had a great color and aroma. Starts with a pleasant IPA flavor with an awesome grapefruit flavor. Excellent beer.
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a standard pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with lots of visible carbonation. Nose is grassy with lots of grapefruit. Taste is floral and fruity on the front, with a resiny but not overwhelming hop finish. Grapefruit is present but not excessively sweet. There is a lingering sweetness of melon/honey, most likely from the malts, though the beer could use a bolder malt profile IMO. Mouthfeel is crisp with vigorous though not strident carbonation. By the end, the hops have completely overpowered the fruit, and it tastes more like its resinous father, the original Sculpin."
"If money is no object, grab some of these. I think there's other beer that's just as good or better for less from little guy breweries that you won't find at every grocery store in the United States. Now that this is being produced by the same company that produces Corona, and the supply is virtually endless, the price should not be this high. How many years has that been said about Starbucks?... It is what it is."
Delicious summer ipa
L - Nice amber color with a moderate head
"Look: Golden, honey-like; white head"
"Amazingly aromatic variation on an IPA base, delightfully full of grapefruit but also peach and mango notes. Nose is just sublime."
"For the price I paid for this IPA ($13), I would have been better off with the local Michigan IPA I was originally going to get (Short's Freedom of '78; collab beer). This beer I thought was very good, but 95?? 99?? No way! Too light and fruity for an American IPA. For the price, I will never buy this beer again. If I'm paying that kinda money for an IPA it better have more balls than this beer has! Good, but not great; especially for the money I paid here in Michigan. And if you're throwing fruit into a beer, you're probably not putting in enough hops to let them do the talking for themselves!"
"L: pours a nice medium golden amber, with a white head that lasts a while."
The smell makes you want more from the taste. It's much more complex. The taste Is all about grapefruit but the smell is about pine and caramel malt. Good bitterness and drinkability. It's clearly balanced even with the grapefruit addition but the original sculpin is definitely better
"This is an exceptional beer especially on a warm day. I went into a local tavern about a year or so ago and they had it on tap and recommended it. The folks seemed like knowledgable persons, so I gave it a whirl. Note, I'm not usually one for beer with anything added (Rheinheitsgebot and all that). I hate it when Americans insist on applying a lemon to my Hefeweizen... Anyway, it was a hot afternoon and I went to the outside seating area to try it out. Wham! The perfect beer for me at that time and place and weather. Nice."
In tap at the local Ale Emporium
"Didn't pour a very impressive head. Light and airy, dissipated quickly. Wonderful grapefruit nose and flavour but bitterness came in a bit cat pee like. Overall still a great beer"
"Tap WOB Arlington, Va. Ballast Point manages to walk the line between hops and fruit, the result is a remarkable beer. Light golden amber color and complex zesty lemon and grapefruit notes. This is a beer that you keep for yourself and share with no one."
"Clear yellow, nice white head. Smells like grapefruit, up in your face grapefruit peels. Tastes like citrus hops, up in your mouth citrus hops. Feels light and crisp. What a mind screw, the aroma and taste are like two different beers to me."
I love this beer! The only problem is it goes down really fast for an expensive high ABV beer
Look: 4.25
"Supremely refreshing, this is a very cool take on an IPA. The citrus in the hops blends beautifully with the grapefruit added. It's a tad too fruity for my tastes, and generally I find it too light bodied, but on a hot summer day this one is hard to beat."
Had from a can. Not bad. Taste for warm weather.
"Admittedly, I'm not a big fan of regular Sculpin. I just don't get what all the fuss is about and actually would rate it as one of the more overrated beers on the planet. That said, I love grapefruit Sculpin. There are plenty of reviews on here that capture its essence so I'll just say that it has extraordinary depth that regular Sculpin somehow lacks and is one of the most refreshing summer beers I've tried. Outstanding."
From notes.
"This beer has been rated thousands of times, but here is my take on this grapefruit splashing IPA. This has the scent of its name w/ that piney grapefruit taste hitting the buds and a rocking nice bitter aftertaste. I happened to pick this up on sale @ Binny's Chicago so I figured I'd finally try it. Very nice and enjoyable IPA."
"The beer is ready to go in the yellow / red color. The foam is white with small bubbles. The foam disappears leisurely quickly and leave fine traces. Aromas of grapefruit, jasmine, hops, flowers. A little citrus and orange. Tall in the background, slightly malty. Taste of a hop bomb decreases of grapefruit that is growing up. Some citrus and orange blossom, jasmine, flowers. Malty sweetness, bitterness will humlig at the end as it should. Plump body, with associated bitterness and bitterness at the end. Medium carbonation. The beer turns into a fruit bomb with grapefruit in the main event."
"Ballast Point Brewing 'Grapefruit Sculpin' @ 7.0% , served from a couple of 355 ml bottle's purchased for $4 each"
"12 oz bottle. Pours slightly hazy dark golden in color. Aroma of grapefruit, jasmine, touch of pine. Flavor is grapefruit, floral, hint of pine. Has an awesome grapefruit flavor without being overly tart or sweet."
"Grapefruit smell, beautiful color. No lacing or head really. The grapefruit is hard to detect in the taste. Smooth mouth feel for a 7% abv. Overall not bad though I don't agree with it being a 99 world class beer. Also fairly expensive. Sorry Sculpin. Good brew though probably won't seek it again unless I see it on tap. I had a bottle."
I love what twist ballast point put on its award winning sculpin. The aroma of citrusy grapefruit notes hits your nose almost immediately. It has a nice feel on the palate with grapefruit pith finish that will pucker your mouth with satisfaction. Any IPA fan should appreciate this one.
"This is my favorite beer of 2016! Amazing IPA with excellent, smooth, crisp feel that packs a great citrusy smell and taste. Pairs the best of IPA with the citrusness that is grapefruit :D"
Poured from a can into my favorite tulip glass.
"Appearance: Pours a clean amber, with a nice near-white head of suds and a thick wall of lace."
Pours a hazy reddish bronze with a finger of white head. Smells of grapefruit right away followed by lemon and tangerine with a little pine. First taste is a bit of a shock because it is just like fresh squeezed grape fruit juice mixed with classic sculpin followed by a piney bitter and sweet malt with a lingering taste of mango and orange zest. Mouth feel is well carbonated and is refreshing and crisp and has a dry finish. Overall it is really great and highly drinkable I could throw these back at a bar all night long and I can't say that with a lot of other ipa style beers. Grapefruit and tropical hops work perfectly and man they killed the grapefruit flavor. Well done.
Poured from can into IPA glass
"I picked up a bottle of Grapefruit Sculpin for $2.49 at The Lager Mill. I've been wanting to try this one for a while, so lets see how it goes. 2015 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass."
"Have purchased singles of this a few times from my local Trader Joe's but I guess I never reviewed it. Pours a gold medal color with medium head but thick, adhesive lace. Nose has the promised grapefruit, grassy hops, and other assorted fruit flavors."
"Pours a golden amber color, mostly translucent, with a frothy white head that leaves tons of lacing. Smells like grapefruit (duh). Some other citrusy smells and tastes come through: grapefruit juice and rind, lemon, orange rind, etc. Also getting some alcohol taste that adds a medicinal/chemical flavor that I've found all variants of Sculpin to have. Luckily, this one is so bitter with grapefruity goodness that it kind of drowns out that flavor that I normally don't like about regular Sculpin. As usual with all Sculpin types, I think this beer is slightly too bitter and lacking in a malt backbone, but I kind of enjoyed BP playing up the bitterness of this beer by adding grapefruit to it. Feels about medium, and leaves a sticky, lingering, bitter finish. Overall, this is a better than average IPA, but the price point (nearly $20 a 6 pack here in PA) keeps me from being a return customer. I think you can do better for much, much cheaper, but it's worth a try anyway."
"Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass, clear amber glow with a fluffy head that lasts for days."
"Having rated nearly 1100 beers on BA, this is my first from Ballast Point! Someone advised me that the grapefruit sculpin was the best. I'm not an IPA drinker because I hate the bitterness from most IPA's, but this one isn't very bitter at all. Very good, with grapefruit coming through strongly. May have to try others from Ballast Point."
"The best grapefruit IPA I have had to this day, just wish the price would go down. To me this is a $12.99 6-pk max, $15.99 is the only reason I don't buy it, Trader Joes in my area sell singles of this but it's the only way I will buy."
"Pint on draft at Loco Coco's in Kittery, Maine."
Look: Beautiful: Translucent orange color with +2 fingers of foam on-top;
"I am not a huge fan of the typical West Coast ipas, but this one was stellar. Much better than regular Sculpin IMO."
"The grapefruit citrus bitter mixed with the hop bitter is a fantastic pairing, its a must try beer with a great feel and flavor, Ballast Point hit it out of the park on this one."
Might be the best overall beer out there. The grapefuit rind flavor adds citrus and bitterness that complements the hops extremely well. Only Green Flash double IPA rivals it.
Golden amber color - very clear. Poured a 12 oz can into a standard pint glass. Beautiful 2 finger head that remains as a film atop the beer for its entire existence. Rich citrus and grapefruit come thru in a pungent manner. The taste is fantastic. Full grapefruit flavor and a great finish with some citrus hops. Slightly bitter and dry is the mouthfeel. An enjoyable beer that I would definitely drink again.
This beer has the perfect amount of grapefruit and is an amazing IPA. Would reccomened to anyone who likes IPAs especially if they like citrus.
Pours a classic clear gold with all sorts of foam and head retention. 
Poured straw colored with 1 finger white head. Strong grapefruit scent with additional notes of pine and melon. Flavor follows nose perfectly. Very strong citrus beer that leaves me craving more!
"Usually not a huge IPA fan but the way the grapefruit and hops work together in this beer, it is amazing! Nice pungent smell of grapefruit and hops, seems somehow they cancel out each others bitterness and enhance the flavors. Went down too easy now I need to find more!"
"Looks like a good IPA should. It pours a golden color, with just a bit of chill haze. Mostly opaque. The head is a gorgeous finger and a half of bright white. Good retention with s foamy top."
E
Nice easy-drinking IPA; grapefruit influence is there without overtaking. Smooth dry finish; some bitterness again without overwhelming. Best as temps rise in later Spring and Summer.
"The 1st taste was fairly bitter, however the 2nd sip and beyond was much smoother. Excellent beer, I highly recommend!"
"Nose is great, lots of grapefruit along with the other citusy fruits. So fresh smelling and grapefruity. Bitter and hoppy on the palate. Fresh and easy to drink."
Pours the same translucent gold with just a bit of haze as regular Sculpin but slightly lighter in color. Smell is definitely grapefruit forward with some hops in the background. Taste is a big splash of grapefruit that has some of the properties of hops entangled in it but somewhat overpowers them as the grapefruit is in the spotlight. They did a great job of nailing the super fresh grapefruit taste. Feel is close to perfect and makes for a smooth swig with a burst of fizzy micro-bubbles on the tongue that adds even more life to this brew. I prefer the regular Sculpin by just a bit as the grapefruit is so forward in this one but on a hot summer day I can see this being a very refreshing choice.
"Look golden with some orangish hues. Thick, fluffy head is khaki and leaves spotty lacing all over the glass. "
"In quotes before it'so my original flavor Sculpin review. As for the grapefruit, this one is my favorite so far. I'm not big on fruit flavor in my beer, let alone grapefruit, but this is a clear exception to that rule. I never would have even tried it if it weren't for a cute bartender that raved about it and I declined for my first coupe pours. Then she put a sample size in front of me and basically dared me to try it. I did and then had a couple of those and the hook was in my mouth and I was being pulled in. This one I prefer on tap, but bottled it's probably still my favorite Sculpin flavor. "
On draft at Ron's Corner Tavern
Appearance: Pour is dark orange color.
Poured from can into a pint glass
Poured from 12 oz bottle into shaker pint glass.
"Poured from a can Julian dated the 18th of February maybe? 16048. Anyway, big bubbly foamy head atop a gold, medium carbonated beer. Lots of slow rising bubbles. Smell is straight grapefruit, maybe a few other undertones like mango or peach. Fades to more of a citrus as the beer warms. Taste is more reminiscient of the latter, with some orange in the initial sip giving way to a more complex tropical tone, washed down by more bright citrus. Ultimately better than the normal Sculpin counterpart IMO. These seem to hold up better, maybe it's the cans or because I stored the Sculpin bottles on their side a day or two, but very nice improvement to an already great beer."
"Wow, this is honestly an amazing beer. If you have had the Sam Adams Rebel Grapefruit, and enjoyed it, you must try this. It is like that beer, 10x better in every aspect. It is perfectly carbonated, and feels like a soft drink in your mouth, with the full body of the sculpin IPAs. I am amazed by this beer, the grapefruit comes in so well and it is just so easily drinkable. Expensive, at around 13-14 USD/6 pack, it is worth it if you enjoy citrusy IPAs, or just good IPAs in general."
A better version of the original sculpin. Grapefruit cuts through the bitterness
"This is the real deal. Bitter hops, a little bit of pine, and a slight grapefruit hint. Very organic tasting compared to other similar beers I've had."
"Wonderfully balanced IPA. Grapefruit dominates the nose and is present throughout, pairing beautifully with the hops. Wonderful beer, I can see my self sessioning this on a nice summer day."
"Had this poured into a pint glass. Pretty much everything good that has been said about sculpin holds true for the grapefruit version, just more citrus flavor as you might guess. Color is a little yellowish/light for my taste, but not bad. Flavor and aroma are strong on citrus, very nice. Mouthfeel is a bit string, but not bad. Great stuff."
"Ballast Point Brewing Co. ""Grapefruit Sculpin"""
poured into an IPA glass. small white head that fades in a decent amount of time. the smell: a mixtures of grapefruit zest oil & fresh hops will indulge your nose. the Taste: a bold flavored IPA with a grapefruity finish. Decent amount of grapefruit was used in the process...
On draft. Tasted great the grapefruit is a bit too much in my option but I get the grapefruit craze.
Just tastes like they dumped grapefruit juice in the bottle. Not for me.
If you don't mind grapefruit in your beer you're going to love this Sculpin. Amazingly fresh presence of grapefruit with combination of the great West coast IPA makes it truly unforgettable experience.
Very sweet front end with a very fruity nose. Strong hints of the grapefruit and citrus. Very balanced bitterness and malty. Great beer
"Bought a single 12 oz. bottle from Whole Foods in Arlington, VA. Poured into a tulip glass."
"Serving: 12 oz can (stamped ""16026""), poured into an IPA glass."
"Poured from 12 oz can into glass. Nice golden/orange colour with a off white thin head. Smells very similar to BP's regular sculpin IPA but with a stronger fruity/citrus smell, which shouldn't surprise. Tastes great, much like it smells. Goes down easy. I think I'll have another. Prost!"
Sculpin tasting #2
Look: Nice looking pour with a little over an inch of head. The beer itself is a deep golden color with a bit of murkiness which is nice.
"Poured from a non-freshness dated longneck 12 oz bottle into a wide-mouthed tasting glass. Orange-tinted clear golden color with a loose, settle 1/4"" bone white head, comprised of small island globs of larger bubbles, and a jagged halo of smaller bubbles. Moderate visible uprising carbonation. Lacework is broken rings that smatter all the way down the glass. "
"A draft pour into a pint, a clear yellow-orange color. The pour had a thin head but good lacing. Clear citrus signature in both taste and smell. Clear grapefruit bitterness and taste, also some orange and lime. Enjoyed it!"
This is some serious grapefruit. The taste os so in your face grapefruit that you almost forget its natural but then the beer taste rounds it out and you realize you're dealing with something really well done.
"Pretty much my favorite beer at the moment. The grapefruit blends perfectly with the hop profile, and smells absolutely amazing. I think my only complaint on this beer is the price. ~$15 for a six-pack seems a little high."
12oz bottle (bottle dated 1/11/16) - poured into pint glass
"Pours amber, hazy with a very wide white foam head, excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is citrusy, like grapefruit and resinous. Taste is very refreshing, fruity, citrusy, grapefruit definetely there, very nice. Great beer."
"Looks. Nice golden ale, tending slightly to Amber; medium frothy, light tan head. "
"L: medium gold with a tint of pink, light white head "
"Clear gold with a pink grapefruit tint. Smells like very citrus grapefruit peel, floral hops, and a little bit of light malts. Also, a hint of orange sherbet. Much less grapefruit and less crisp than anticipated; tropical fruits, mango and passion fruit, with strong citrus hops and a dry bitter and sherbet finish."
I really like this beer. Great flavor perfect amount of carbonation.
Pretty good
"From bottle, pours Hazey pale amber colour with white head. Aroma pine, grapefruit slight citrus light maltiness. Taste definitely grapefruit bitterness and tropical notes up front, goes down easy."
"A- Light copper in color, clear"
Look - Beautiful hazy golden colour in a glass with a fluffy 3 finger head.
"Pours a nice straw color, about 1 1/2 inch of head into a pint glass. Leaves a nice lacing after each drink."
"Bright copper orange in color with very good clarity. Poured with a short, white, sticky, soapy foam with good retention. Medium high pink grapefruit aroma with floral notes beneath and medium light malt aroma. Medium bodied with a light creamy feel and soft, medium low carbonation. Bitter, pink grapefruit flavor up front that seamlessly transitions to a bitter hop bite through the middle. Bitter characters are checked by a a brief malty sweetness before semi-drg finish. Finished with medium tropical grapefruit bitterness and a light malty sweetness. Not terribly complex, but amazing sensation of biting into a juicy chunk of pink grapfruit. Crisp, refreshing, and very drinkable."
"Poured into a snifter at about 45 degrees F. Bottled November 16, 2015. Look is golden straw colored, with about a finger of white head that dissipated within one minute to a slight ring around the edges and one very thin patch in the middle. Very little lacing. Smell is definitely grapefruit dominant with some mango and lemon behind that. Mouth feel presents moderate to high carbonation that has quite a bite. This beer has very little alcohol presence, covered mostly by the bitterness. Taste is grapefruit mostly, which is to be expected, and I can't get much past that. If there are any malts in this beer, I can't tell. Very hop forward, very bitter - I would have guessed higher than 70 IBU's as their website states. Overall it's decent, but not a whole lot of character other than grapefruit. A little malt presence would compliment the flavor nicely."
"Ballast Point came to Michigan and I couldn't wait to get my hands on some Grapefruit Sculpin. Bottom line, this one lives up to the hype. "
"It pours a golden orange with a foamy white head, which leaves behind a bit of lace. The smell is of grapefruit. A rather sour, but sweet aroma. The taste starts of with some hops before breaking way for a hearty serving of grapefruit. For feel, this IPA is great. It goes down smooth, without feeling harsh. Overall, wow. I really can't say I'm a fan of many IPAs, but this is a choice that makes me reconsider. Keep in mind, it still has that hoppy, bitter taste, but it's not done overwhelmingly. If you're on the fence about IPAs, or are an IPA veteran, give this one a shot. "
IPA has long been my favorite style and this exhilarates the taste buds big time. This beer is crisp with Grapefruit infusion for an awesome citrus balance that isn't cloying at all. I agree with others who've said it tops even the original Sculpin which says something as that's also a top-notch IPA.
A: [3.75] The beer is a very clear amber color. It has about 1/2 a finger of bright white head. The head settles out of the way pretty quickly. The bottle lists the ABV (7.0%). I can't find a date code but my man at the beer store says it's fresh.
If you like grapefruit this is for you. Beautiful golden color and nice tight foam head that lingered to the end. Smell is straight up grapefruit as is taste. Taste doesn't have that peel bitter flavor that some do. Very true grapefruit but not much else. I wonder if it is mostly centennial hops? Clean feel and goes down easy. Overall I 
"A 12 fl oz bottle with a bottled code date of 15225 (I think… as it is a little bit ineligible) which means 13th August 2015, and poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
"An absolutely great IPA, and living in san diego it is so easily to get that I drink it a few times a week, usually bottled. Outstanding aroma, of course of grapefruit and citrus along with the usual explosive pleasure that comes with original sculpin. The taste is unmatched by any other easily accessible single IPA in my opinion."
"Barely sandy amber with a thick bubbly khaki blanket leaving some reaching, creamy lace."
Look: It pours golden with an off white head. 
"Finally getting to try this offering... As expected, citrus is most prevalent here but not quite as much as I would have thought.... Citrusy aromas for sure but not like a fresh grapefruit.... It's quite delicious but still... Just doesn't have that major grapefruit kick in the teeth is hoping for i.e. Schlafly Grapefruit IPA.... That being said, it's still really good.... I'm not crazy about the price point at $16.49/sixer but will buy this on occasion....."

Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin.
Had a bunch of these in San Diego at a bar and at the brewery. Outstanding
"A - nice golden amber clear beer, no head and therefore no lacing"
"i thought that i would be disappointed since i liked the regular sculpin so much, but much to my surprise the grapefruit version is much better. the addition of the citrus flavor from the grapefruit makes this version much more memorable. overall an excellent beer."
A - Orange in color - with some haze yet also clear enough to see the bubbles rise. Huge frothy white / caramel colored head. Really nice cling and stick after each sip.
"Best IPA available, in my book. Hop heavy in your nose. Lots of grapefruit and citrus in your mouth."
Have to say I was disappointed after finally getting to have this on a recent trip to Florida. Guess I was expecting too much I guess. Wasn't bad by any means just felt like they were trying too hard
"Poured a golden orange body with one finger head and lace. Aroma is soapy, grapefruit hops with minimal malt sweetness. There is a bitter, sharp citric hoppiness intermingling with grapefruit sweetness and touches of sweet malt. Easy drinking, well-hidden abv and overall a pretty good IPA but I guess I don't believe the hype."
"Pours a copper color with two fingers of white head. Tropical fruits, mango, grapefruit, pine hit the senses. Taste is smooth and sweet upfront and ends with a splash of piney resinous hops that linger on the tongue. Medium body, smooth, light carbonation."
Poured from a 12oz can into a pint glass. Still one of my favorites...truly one of the best IPA's out there.
This is one of the greatest ipa styles in the world. Ballast Point is world class and Grapefruit Sculpin is a gem. A gushing fruit haven of a gem.
Appearance - Pours a light/medium warm amber colour with a finger width of bubbly white head.
"L: Dark blonde, barley any head, some bubbles"
A - Pours a clear amber with a one-finger fizzy white. The head fades fast leaving some light spotty lacing.
"Pours golden orange fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Smell grapefruit right away also has a sweet fruity smell. Taste sweet with a mix of grapefruit and peach, slight piney taste at the end. Very light feel smooth. Overall an excellent beer."
"P: Golden straw, white frothy head with a great lacing on the top of the beer and glass."
"First tried regular sculpin and really enjoyed it. Next I tried the grapefruit and was blown away. The addition of the grapefruit realty enhanced the aroma of the original and the taste was fantastic. Very similar to shorts freedom of 78, which is one of my favorite ipas. I really really really like this."
"Bought from Don Quijote 12oz. Clear golden color, grapefruit taste is noticeable but not overwhelming, smooth taste, slight bitterness to let you know its an IPA, overall really good."
12oz bottle into a pint glass
Bottled November 16th and poured December 2nd. $2.99 single bottle. Poured into a stubby 10oz I-don't-know-what-to-call-it glass.
"Poured into a tulip it has a crystal clear golden orange body with a 3 inch thick foam head of slightly orange off-white. Smell is grapefruit, citrus, biscuit malt, grass, floral, nice bit of lemon zest, and clementine. Taste is big grapefruit juice and lemony citrus, some orange, tiny bit of grass in the background, tiny bit of floral, a nice background of that biscuit-y malt that evens out the grapefruit, and just a tad bit sweet and not overly bitter. A moderate to full mouth feel that has a perfect amount of carbonation and a light to moderate body that makes it a dangerously drinkable beer deserving of it's status."

"With all of the acclaim this beer gets, I figure I had to throw one in my cart while I was up in the evergreen state. "
Definitely a tasty ipa. Grapefruit aroma and taste are strong. Not too bitter. Very refreshing.
Amber color with a thick one finger head with decent retention.
"This beer poured a deep gold, almost amber, with about a half inch of head that dissipated slowly. The nose was a little disappointing; I didn't get very much of the grapefruit. Flavor-wise, the grapefruit flavor merged nicely with the hops--neither overpowered the other and they have a nice combinatory effect. It's a tad bit too bitter for me. The mouthfeel is a bit acidic but overall it's a very pleasant beer."
355ml can bought online from the Brewdog shop
"Name says it all, if you like the grapefruit- you should enjoy this."
Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. This is a crystal clear golden colored beer with a medium sized white head. The aroma is big on tart citrus and hops. The flavor matches the aroma. An outstanding beer.
"Appearance is somewhat transparent golden orange/brown, with a large amount of light head and moderate lacing around the glass."
"Great beer, very bitter with a grapefruit taste; obviously. I like grunion better, but this beer is pretty delicious. Sold at whole foods sometimes, but the Barneys Beanery in Westwood near UCLA has it on tap"
"Pours a perfect golden amber, smells off cold grapefruit being juiced in the sun, tastes of great hoppy Amarillo , cascade, punch through at the beginning but then the surge of grapefruit sweeps"
"L: Fairly clear golden orange, with a large amount of light tan head."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep gold bordering on a pale amber producing 2+ fingers of frothy, variously bubbled, moderately lasting, slightly off-white head that leaves a nice webby coating of lace. Aroma is grapefruit juice, pith & zest, pineapple, orange, peach, pine resin & sweet caramel. Taste is grapefruit juice & rind, pineapple, peach, sweet & bready cobbler pie dough, vanilla & a hint of honey with the sweeter portions mid-sip through the finish. Aftertaste is bitter grapefruit & pine. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-high carbonation, slick, wet & juicy, drying after the swallow, with a nice peppery prickle. Very nice!"
I don't know if I'm partying with this one...while bringing 3 to a small party ain't bad at all...but I don't want to bring the other 3 to the next small party. 
Delicious. One of the best beers I've ever had. Crisp and refreshing with a kick!
l: light brown.
"I really enjoy this beer. It's the hot thing on the east coast right now. It'll be forgotten about in 6 months after the next popular thing comes out. That seems to be the sad thing about the craft beer industry. Something gets popular and then when it gets too popular it's not fun and ""good"" anymore. I know people are all about local beer these days but most beers I have that are local are garbage close compared to San Diego breweries and Colorado breweries."
This does not work for me at all.
Not my style.
Date is scrambled on bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Deep orange color with one inch head that recedes leaving coats of foam against the glass. Smell is heavenly grapefruit. Taste is grapefruit juice. Terrific beer! Cheers!
"We snap some can tabs back, pouring into our Great Lakes pint glasses. The color sits near that of apple juice, but with a solid one and a half finger tall head of soapy white bubbles. This retains nicely, with eventual rings of lacing as it goes. Reproducibility is high. A chill haze reduces clarity, but this is transient. No sediment is noted, and carbonation appears to be medium. The aroma gives immense notes of cloying grapefruit juice, both authentic and synthetic, along with bright citric and green grassy hops, stevia sweetness, gentle but fusel booziness, chrome, raw pale grain, plastic bite, crushed vitamin c tablets, lemon pound cake, buttercream frosting, and vegetal green bell pepper bite. The flavoring to follow includes the simultaneously most bitter and sweet fresh squeezed grapefruit juiciness, lemony citric hoppiness, oily lemon balm rub, softer soapy hops chemicaliness, fresh heavy creamer, dusty pale grain, washed caramel and cereal graininess, green onions, melted candle wax, apple pulp sugars, herbal thyme oils, black pepper, white sugar sweetness, holly, tangerine sweetness, soured orange pith, and plastic garbage bags. The body is medium but oily, and the carbonation is on the higher end of the prickle spectrum. Each sip gives excellent slurp and smack, with nice cream and froth on the back end. Pop is lost in the creaminess, but not missed. The mouth is left somewhat dried and puckered, but only after a granular coating of sugary bitterness. The abv is appropriate, and drinkability is superb."
Delicious. The 2015 is just not as juicy as I remember.
The grapefruit is far from subtle in this beer and distracts from anything else you can really enjoy with the beer. There is a lot of acidity that gets a little better as the beer warms up. The beer has what I perceived as a prickly carbonation but I blame that on the grapefruit again. Not an entirely bad experience but I won't be seeking it out again.
appearance- Copper amber in color with decent visibility to each side. Pours a fizzy three inch head.
UPDATE 2016-04-22. 12 oz bottle. Bottled on 2016-02-09.
"Very good, even though it was about 4 months old. I will edit the rating when I try it again, this time fresher..."
"Grapefruit Sculpin pours with a blistered but burnished golden colour and partially hazed complexion; my fingers on the other side of the glass appear but are lightly distorted. Its head, thin as a napkin, indeed sits like a flimsy place-mat and leaves not a crumb of lace behind. "
to tart for me tastes of grapefruit.
"At the risk of sounding like an asshole - I just don't see what all the love for this beer is about. I LOVE Sculpin, so I figured I had to try Grapefruit Sculpin. "
Clear golden orange with three fingers of white head. Retention is average for such a large head. Plentiful lacing.
"12oz bottle with no date code on the label. Only indication of any kind of date is on bottom of the bottle ""7 15""."
Poured from bottle to a tulip. 
"One of the best beers out there. Glad it comes in cans. Only downside, which doesn't affect score, is the fact that it takes a bit of time to get to the East Coast. There's nothing like wicked fresh sculpin!"
"12 oz bottle poured into a stone glass.Smell is very grapefruit up front slight hop smell.Nice ABV of 7.0 doesn`t get in the way of the great taste.Taste up front is grapefruit,pine but a very nice mix not over powering on the grapefruit.Got to say I really liked this beer and would buy it again.Very small head on this one.Nice orange color.Give it a try."
Poured a 12oz bottle into a 12oz pint size glass. I didn't find a bottle number or expiration date. I bought a six-pack of this for home consumption.
"Poured a golden orange. The smell is a tad bit more citrus than its brother Sculpin IPA. The taste is great. I think it has a lot more volume and crispness than the Sculpin IPA. You get a lot more of a sweet/bitterness of grapefruit, lemon, and apricot without a ton of grapefruit flavor. Cheers"
"Pours a clear gold color with a rocky head that dissipates pretty quickly. Big, sweet ruby red grapefruit mixes with classic Sculpin hop grapefruit, lemon in the nose – sublime. The additional grapefruit is less noticeable in the taste. Huge hop grapefruit, tropical fruit and floral hops mingle with an understated malt profile to provide something resembling balance. Long, high bitterness in the finish, with more grapefruit flavor."
"Before trying this beer I was not a very big fan of IPAs. I had seen all the rave about this beer so when it happened to be at my local store, I had to pick up a 6 pack. I was very impressed with this beer overall. Pours to a orange/gold color, produes anywhere from a finger to 2 finger head, smells exactly like grapefruit, and tastes like grapefruit as well. After having tried this beer, I've started to enjoy other IPAs as well, so far though, this has been the best one I've tasted!"
Canned about a month ago. 
A biscuity malt backbone accompanies a potent grapefruit-hop juicyness. Lots of grapefruit pith in the aftertaste. 
"Pours a bright amber with copious white foam. Smells strongly of grapefruit, lemon zest, floral hops. Pleasant balance of sweet malt forward with piney/citrusy hop tang midnote and an almost astringent end note leaving a very clean palate. Grapefruit and citrus notes predominate – but overall the sweet – hop- malt is incredibly well balanced. Light to medium mouth feel with plenty of carbonation."
"A: pours an orange copper color w a 1-1 1/2 foamy head, which retained well. S: grapefruit and other tropical fruit. T: grapefruit, lemon zest, pine. M: thin as expected."
TW here in NOVA took $2 off a 6'er last week...do you think it was overpriced? Now only $14.
"I couldn't believe that, based on grapefruit I'd tried in other beers, that I would even remotely like this beer. It was recommended to me by a beer geek friend and I've been avoiding it until I was able to buy just one today. Damn I am one hard headed dude at times because I should have tried this a month ago. It was wonderful and my grapefruit concerns were not an issue. Just enough. Light, very easy to drink. A perfect summer or maybe anytime beer to have around. Well done Ballast P"
Revisited 9/20/18
"I'm normally not a fan of grapefruit, either the actual fruit, or hops that present as grapefruit for example. But this was an awesome combination of flavors for this IPA. I think I like it better than regular Sculpin. Good job to whomever thought up the combination."
"7.21.15 @ City Beer, SF, CA"
"Pours a vibrant orange color, together with a big, fluffy white head, which turns out to be extremely stable, as it doesn't vanish at all."
"Poured a clear, copper orangey color into a pint class with a nice fluffy head. Smelled primarily of grapefruit with pine and hops in the background, not particularly complex. First taste was mostly piney/hoppy, but as I drank the beer more I tasted more citrusy and fruity flavors with grapefruit as the prevailing flavor. Body is a tad light but at this point I'm nitpicking, because it's an excellent beer. Supremely smooth and very drinkable. To those that are hoping for an upgrade to Sculpin, I'm not sure this is quite what you're looking for. They're both delicious beers, but the strong grapefruit flavor puts Grapefruit Sculpin as (IMO) a different animal from the classic Sculpin."
This was poured into a nonic pint glass.
"A damn good summer beer, not exactly a session beer but I like it with a bit of punch. The grapefruit really works well it's not too overpowering and is super refreshing. I'll still take 21st Amendment Watermelon Wheat on a hot day though!"
"We were reluctant to try this but I was a pleasant surprise. Well balanced IPA with a smooth blend of citrus. I'd like a little more hop and some more maltiness but overall, really liked it."
Very good. Great grapefruit after taste. Yummy.
Of the Ballast point Sculpin IPA's I'd say the Habanero Sulpin is my favorite with the Grapefruit Sculpin as a close second. (I have yet to try the original Sculpin IPA) 
The beer is a slightly cloudy golden orange color with great head retention. 
"L: Pours amber with a slight haze under a 1” persistent, white, dense, finely bubbled foam collar that takes over 4 minutes to reduce to a thick. Lacy film. S: Smells like Texas ruby red grapefruit. T: Rich fruit, especially grapefruit flavors that work very well with the hop flavors and bitterness. F: Very creamy and smooth with a medium body and refreshing medium carbonation. O: The extra grapefruit works well the the grapefruit hop flavors and enhances the beer. The added grapefruit does not dominate or overshadow what is already there."
"Fantastic summer beer. I have yet to try the original scuplin from Ballast Point, but the grapefruit has additional citrus and bitterness that complements the hoppy, crisp ipa"
As good as the original just with a citrus twist to it not overpowering grapefruit at all.
Very refreshing India pale ale. With nice grape fruits tones throughout.
"Ok, full disclosure. I'm not a grapefruit fan. That being said, this is a very original take on an IPA. The grapefruit is present, but not overpowering. Not my cup of tea (or beer) but nicely done."
12oz. Bottle
poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass
"12 oz bottle. Have had this one before, glad to get another bottle to rate. Medium orang amber color with a slight haze. Head retention is good. The smell is dominated by grapefruit which follows into the taste. Taste like a sweet ruby red grapefruit up front, very delicious. The hops that follow are more citrus peel and some dank syrupy pine. Finishes dry and the hops linger. Mouthfeel is clean and slick. Overall really tasty IPA that tastes as advertised, could keep on drinking this one, wish it was in distro here."
"Look: nice foggy amber color, lots of carbonation, good size head that dissipates quickly."
Grapefruit Sculpin is one great IPA. the grapefruit takes the hoppy edge off that regular Sculpin has.
"This is one of my favorite 'go to' beers. Slightly foggy amber color, huge grapefruit nose, and tastes like a slice of heaven. It took me back to my childhood drinking Squirt Soda. Big fan of this beer, and would recommend highly."
"As good as you would expect from Ballast Point, but it all comes down to whether you're a fan of strong grapefruit aroma and taste in your IPA. Solid malt backbone with a great citrus aroma, but I prefer more of a mosaic of citrus and flavors than a focus on grapefruit. Not tart, not overly bitter - good balance. It's still a great beer that's very drinkable, don't get me wrong, but not my taste."
"12oz bottle, no date, served in a Milkshake pilsner glass. "
"Very enjoyable IPA. Pours a bright, slightly hazy golden/orange color with a good size white head and some lacing. Head retention is good. Hoppy aroma, citrus hops with an extra squirt of fresh grapefruit juice in each sip. Flavor is more of the same, good Sculpin hoppy flavor with the extra kick from the grapefruit. The grapefruit could be easily overdone, but it is nicely balanced with a citrusy West Coast IPA."
I had to have this because it was in the BEer advocate 250. It actually was not that bad. I don't like grapefruit and I only kinda like India pale ales but this was very drinkable.
Pours a hazy golden color with a dense white head with some frothy big bubbles.
"Had a bottle. Was surprised at the nice tartness of the grapefruit. Hops takes over on the nose, but fruit lingers on the palate."
Poured from 12oz bottle into Pint Glass.
"Grapefruity, Hoppy, Zesty, Refreshing"
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a frozen mug.
12 oz. bottle.
"Nice, grapefruit not overwhelming but a nice compliment to the bitterness of the IPA. Felt more crisp and fresh than syrupy like some IPA's can be."
"Golden bronze color, nicely unfiltered. White head."
Very good
Best fruit beer I have had. Grapefruit flavor is fresh tasting and melds well with this delicious IPA. Outstanding beer.
The start tastes of a good IPA with citrusy grapefruit but finishes with off-putting bitterness and mouthfeel of the pith
Bought this on a recommendation. Very flavorful but not too heavy. Smooth with a crisp grapefruit touch.
"Look - golden/orange, one finger white head (poured from a bottle), disappearred quickly; light lacing"
"GRAPEFRUIT, GRAPEFRUIT, GRAPEFRUIT!!! Deliverous."
7/12 can. Good start but the finish is too bitter for me
"Previously gave this a 4.35 after getting a loaner from a friend who had left it in a hot car. Stated I would try again with a fresh one, which I just did. I'm joining the crowd, this is a world class IPA. Outstanding."
Serving Type: Can (Canned 7.10.15)
Definitely grapefruit on the nose. Nose and taste reminds me of a grapefruit slice candy that you get at the mall. The malty sweetness drowns out the juiciness of the flavor profile. The hops here are not complimenting the grapefruit level. Not sure if draft is better but this was from a can poured into a tulip.
"Very very good. Tasty and smooth. Tastes like Sculpin (an already amazing brew), but with a nice hit of grapefruit juice tossed in. Super refreshing. The only thing keeping this from a perfect 5 like Sculpin, is that it is leaning just a little too far to the sweet side compared to regular Sculpin. I am afraid the sweetness would be a little too much to make it something you could pound multiples of. Which is a shame."
"Pours a nice deep golden color with a touch of orange. Huge aroma of citrus. Has a refreshing citrus flavor. The grapefruit is perfect in this beer. Very easy drink, a little crisp finish but nice hoppy notes and a balanced finish wit a grapefruit aftertaste."
"Copper colour, clear liquid, compact off-white head. "
12 oz. can poured into tulip
Poured from bottle into Belgian tulip. 
12 oz can picked up at trader Joe's ams poured into snifter. 
"I've waited to try this for a while - tough to find in stock! Pours golden orange with an off white and puffy head. After it warms a bit you get that sticky, grapefruit juice smell with faint hops and malt. The taste is straight up Ruby Red grapefruit juice with a nice dry hop finish. I love juicy IPAs and this one is worthy of the hype. I much prefer this to the regular Sculpin!"
Exceptional IPA. Always have to have these stocked in my fridge. Preferably in cans so I can take to the beach because this is the perfect summer drink ( or anytime for the matter).
"CANsin Colby is on some sort of a South AmeriCAN excursion right now, which is odd, since it is also his anniversary, but as long as my cousin-in-law is down with it, so be it. This CAN came out of The Fridge's cooler and the spent CAN will make a beautiful addition to my wing of the CAN House."
A: Looks good pouring a straw gold with a thumb's worth of head that breaks leaving little lacing behind in its wake.
12oz can poured into tulip glass
"Pours a slightly hazy color with a finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Has a nice piney, resinous, grapefruit aroma. The grapefruit is strong. Very smooth malt to hop transition. Strong grapefruit taste, especially at the end. Nice piney hop to go along with it. Slight bready, malty flavor. Very well balanced and easily drinkable. Very good. Medium bodied with heavy carbonation."
"If you have been lucky enough to Have Tried the Regular Sculpin, [and loved it] ,then you will enjoy the Grapefruit Sculpin just as much,[or perhaps even more] you Still get All the other Tropical Fruit Tastes as well,the Mango,Pineapple,citrus rind,and more,but you get a hint more of that Grapefruit & Citrus Rind -just another Beautiful,Awesome,Top Notch and Stellar Offering From [what is in my Humble Opinion] one of the top 5 Breweries in America ""Ballast Point""-a MUST Try,Cheers!"
Wow!
"It's hard to rate a beer with a fruit complement, but this grapefruit twist is such a complement to the west coast hops citrus base that it is not possible to pick it apart. This is a great draft. If you a a fan of West coast citrus forward hops, this is solid. Ruins the taste of the others."
Ryan left one of these at my house for me. A bit too bitter for my liking
"Grabbed a bottle at Yellow Dog Eats in New Smyrna Beach. Poured clear and lightly Amber. Huge grapefruit aroma, nice balance to grapefruit and hops taste. Pretty mild for a BP IPA. Paired it with some pulled pork tacos. Nicely paired."
Had on draught.
"One of my favorite beers. Living in so-cal, I'm always getting a fresh batch. And this one is a beauty, full of sweet and bitter gulps. Beautiful golden pour, the grapefruit is indeed present with smell and taste."
This is on of my favorite beers. 
Very good Beer! Beer is Being sold in VB now.
"Quite a mild, pleasant IPA. Makes me want to try original Sculpin, only for the hint that it might be as nice as this without the grapefruit. Not that I don't like the grapefruit - quite the contrary - but it's always a good thing to try original versions of spinoff beers you love, and I really do like this IPA. Heavily perfumy and floral, like the fragrant spray of a grapefruit as you peel it. The flavor is more grapefruit zest, without the sourness or sweetness of the actual fruit, but it comes across quite noticeably - no reaching for the flavor of this one. This is a great example of how to make a fruit beer without being greedy. Glad I got to try it, though it's a bit overpriced for me to want to have regularly. But if it were cheaper and easier to come by, I'd be perfectly happy to add this to my refreshing summer beer lineup."
"The first thing I did when I got this IPA is smell it. Oh man prob the best beer I have ever smelled with the lingering Grapefruit. I'm not a fan of fruity or tangy beers but this one should be in a category all its own. A little taste of pine, a little flower then the grapefruit comes in but not too powerful like some citrus beers. Really good Hop flavor not overpowering. I could session this all day."
"I don't want to insult a complex brew, but this dry ipa with grapefruit does not replace citra hops for the CA ipa fruity flavor and aroma. It is literally, grapefruit added. I prefer the citrus from the hops. However, it has strong character, rich and full body that dances on your tongue. As long as you know it is dry and tart from actual grapefruit and you are not expecting the hop flavor that often quotes a citrus hop for the smell and flavor, you will be very happy. Certainly not bad, but very expensive to me for not using hops as the fruity flavor. Worth a bottle."
"Bought a single bottle from Beers of the World on 8/1/15 from Beers of the World. Served cold in a Duvel tulip. Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Hazy apricot, white head. Aroma is all grapefruit zest. Flavor is a thin white toast with a sharp, tart spread of citrusy yumminess. Mouthfeel is good. I really love this one."
Bought a single 12oz can yesterday ($2.75) at The Beer Store. Enjoying today out in The 'Zebo....
GRAPEFRUIT & HOPS all day! Year round beer (Hot or Cold) Almost Perfect
"The beer is an orangey amber color with a white head. Quite clear. Nice white head. Some lacing. The aroma is chock full of juicy grapefruit. It’s just a blast of perfect grapefruit flavor. Ruby red perfection. There’s a light floral note to remind you that there are hops in this beer and you’re not drinking a glass of juice. Taste is a lot less bitter than expected. Moderate bitterness, at most. Good grapefruit flavor. Mild pale malt character with a hint of caramel. Easy to drink. Gentler than expected with all of that grapefruit. Really nice beer to have easily available on the shelf."
"Tried a more fresh one after an older one (about 30 days or so; not certain about that as I already tossed the can) and got more of a pronounced grapefruit smell and taste. Great head on the pour, nice and thick/creamy with a nice light copper color in the beer. Taste is a bright citrusy grapefruit upfront with a dry, bitter finish in the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is fairly effervescent, pairing nicely with the citrus. Great beer overall and could drink a few but the bitterness would be a bit overpowering. Although, for enjoying one or two, it's a good balance. From what I recall, very similar to the original sculpin but depending on freshness, the grapefruit version has a bit more of a...grapefruit flavor."
"I was very surprised by this beer! Thought the grapefruit would be too much,but it goes so well together and really brings out a nice taste. Would definitely tell any ipa lover to try this."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever tasted. It was definitely hoppier than I had anticipated. I also expected it to be sweet, but it was just right. The grapefruit finish is absolutely phenomenal and complements this IPA perfectly."
"Clear, deep/burnt gold in body topped with a white frothy head that stays around. Awesome aroma of grapefruit sweetness, citrus, candy, grass, and mint. Tastes of citrus, fruit skin, grass, pine, grapefruit, somewhat salty towards the finish, booze, bitterness. Medium bodied and chewy. The grapefruit is well executed in this beer. It isn't overwhelming and plays well with the hop variety and the beer has a full body to carry it all."
L: pours a darker gold color and leaves a reasonable lace. 
"Grapefruit flavor prominent but not off-putting. Good base beer, but not a fan of the added grapefruit."
"Lots of hops and grapefruit character in the nose. Much of the same in the flavor profile. Finishes nicely, its if drinkable but probably not as good as all the hype implies."
"Reading the other reviews, I wonder if the bottles I've had (all from the same pack) were contaminated. I love the Sculpin and I love grapefruit in beer. That said, I struggled to finish the four bottles I had. They looked amazing, smelled like a good IPA, but tasted like someone took the sculpin and simply poured grapefruit juice in before serving. It tasted sickly sweet, with unblended flavors and I was left with the impression I'd just taken medicine. I'll have to give this another try though, based on the cult following it has."
"Dark gold to light orange. Very strong citrus aroma with a bit of pine behind it. I'm not a huge fan of regular sculpin but really enjoyed it with the grapefruit addition, which complements the citrus components of the hops."
Look: golden orange
Poured from a 12oz. bottle.
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a clear 8oz. Solo cup. Looks like it was bottled mid July 2015, very excited to find such fresh bottles of this while visiting Ohio. "
Pours a deep gold color with a high level of clarity. One finger white head which dissipates quickly. Some sticky lacing left behind.
Best grapefruit IPA. <-----Period
"Really really good. Sculpin, which is great already, with grapefruit? A win-win. Very nice & fruitiness is very subtle."
Look - golden fairly cloudy color with a great sticky white head
"This beer is excellent. Yes, it has an insane amount of hype surrounding it, but it lived up in my book. The perfect amount of grapefruit flavoring to make it ridiculously tasty and refreshing without giving up its IPA roots. Seek this out."
"A very well balanced AIPA. If You don't want to wait in those two hour line to get Your favorite Bitter,Citrus and smooth IPA..This is a perfect alternative!"
"Very drinkable, tastes like summer. Could be called Squirt Sculpin."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, tropical fruit and bready malt. Body is medium and crisp. Grapefruit juice, citrusy hops and bready fill the mouth. Finish is long, dry, and grapefruity. Too fruity for me."
Felt like the grapefruit diminished the hop profile quite a bit as compared to the regular Sculpin. Still very good though.
"A slighty hazy amber pour with a light white foam that dissipates fairly quickly. The aroma is spectacular with tropical, piney, dank hops. The grapefruit isn't as forward as I expected, but you definitely can smell it. The taste is very similar, juicy, hoppy, with a nice malt backbone. The grapefruit really pops on the aftertaste, along with some bitterness. Delicious."
Pours gold with a large white head.
"Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin IPA- 7% abv. $3.50 a pint at happy hour which goes until 8 pm on Monday at Kay’s bar in Sellwood. They have a $10 minimum for credit cards though so watch out. I went in wanting to get a cheap beer but I got more than I bargained for. They do sell food and cigs and hacky sacks though, because this is Portland."
"Just a wonderful smelling and tasting beer. TONS of grapefruit on the nose and taste buds. Ruby red grapefruit, grapefruit pith, citrus, pine. So clean....so fresh....so crisp. A wonderfully refreshing beverage. Can't think of a better summer beer."
"Without a doubt my ""go-to"" readily available IPA. The pour is a golden-orange with a beautiful, deep, foam head. The initial burst of fresh grapefruit and citrus hops is phenomenal and the piney hops that hit on the second wave of flavor are excellent as well. It's very smooth and easy to drink, full of juicy citrus hops. There is the perfect amount of carbonation and the mouthfeel has just the right balance of tart and bitterness. Hard to beat in this category."
What an excellent brew! I don't know why it took me this long to try it! Check it out!
"I guess I need to finally put a review down for this. Most recently on tap at D&T in Houston, TX."
"Pours a nice golden color. I didn't get much of a head out of the pour, but the thin ring like lace retained throughout."
Had this one at mattsanders tasting a ways back (from notes)
"On a scale of 0 to 1, I'd give it a 1. "
"Pours a hazy orange-golden, good initial head that fades to a ring."
"Was expecting citrus on the nose, but was very pleased to get an enhanced hop-based citrus and not something artificially grapefruit. Flavor was full-on IPA citrus with a very solid malt backbone. Juicy. Again, just enhancing what was already there and not a separate grapefruit flavor. Plain old delicious."
"excellent IPA. I'm not a big grapefruit fan, so I was skeptical, but you don't taste much grapefruit at all. It has the perfect amount of flavor. Very drinkable and delicious."
This beer/brewery has altered my perception of fruity beers. I am an IPA lover and with just a hint of grapefruit this brew is refreshing in this New England heat.
GF sculpin-can
This is like a summer beer with teeth. The grapefruit flavor makes it refreshing. But it's not sweet. The slightly sour flavor of the grapefruit is a perfect match for the light dryness of the IPA.
"This is delicious! The aroma is great full of floral, pine & citrus, the grapefruit is not overpowering a great summer beer. Very smooth to drink."
"Pour: 12oz bottle into a nonic pint. Appearance: Clear and light gold in color. Effervescent with a thick white head. Aroma: Immediate citrus. Bold grapefruit. Subtle and regular hops and malt. Taste: Citrus, big bold bite throughout. Aftertaste: Consistent throughout. big bold grapefruit citrus. very tangy. Overall: Ballast Point continues to put out taste provocative beers. This one doe not disappoint. Very good: 4 out of 5."
"Speed 2; Robocop 3: Superman IV: Grapefruit Sculpin. One of these things is unlike the others, and fortunately for beer enthusiasts the world over, Ballast Point followed up on their smash hit with a runaway success of equally epic proportions. Grapefruit Sculpin is OG Sculpin’s younger, hotter sister. She still has a bite, but tastes smoother and smells sweeter. Let’s get one thing straight: this isn’t just an IPA infused with the essence of a grapefruit. Instead, it more closely resembles a fresh grapefruit infused with the essence of an IPA. Seconds after popping open the 12 oz. can, a grove-fresh fragrance fills the room. The beer’s nose is clearly grapefruit-forward, but does not drown out the floral and piney aromas from the Centennial, Simcoe, and Amarillo hop varieties used in the brewing process. Its color, on the other hand, is no different than that of the original (an inviting copper). Throwing back the first mouthful, a few things become apparent: first— fuck, that’s delicious; second— I need more; third— could this version actually be better than the original? While I won’t quite go as far as to rearrange the traditional hierarchy in the minds of Ballast Point fans, Grapefruit Sculpin does avoid the ill-fate of a Keanu-less Speed 2. The brewer should be applauded for making the decision to fight bitter with bitter. Contrary to popular opinion, this act actually softens the final product’s overall bitterness and renders this easy-drinking IPA an easier-drinking IPA."
"Great beer. Thick foamy head with quality lacing and retention, looks pretty in the glass. Hopped to perfection - strikes a nice balance between pine and grapefruit in terms of both aroma and taste. Great mouthfeel and overall a super crisp and refreshing beer that keeps me satisfied and coming back for more. The only critique I have is that compared to other top notch IPAs, the citrus notes aren't as natural and can have an artificial taste at times, which takes away from the brew in my opinion. Still, I would drink this shit all day."
"Looks & smells the part, but falls short in the most important category - taste. Really a mess of a beer, strong artificial citrus & bizarre hop makes it sour - not at all what I'm looking for in an IPA."
"One of my absolute favorites. The grapefruit is just enough. Doesn't taste like a fruited beer. Just amazingly good in almost every way. If you're a hop-head, you have to try this beer."
Tastes like artificial flavor of grapefruit
Poured from can into IPA glass. 
A wonderful IPA with a burst of grapefruit in every sip. It had just the right amount of hop flavor with a malt bite that allowed the grapefruit flavor to shine. Enjoy this beer on a hot summer day.
Light ipa hint of citrus would drink again
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/19/2015. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, honey, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops, grapefruit peel, and light-moderate malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, honey, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon/orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops, grapefruit peel, and light-moderate malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible citrus spiced IPA style. All around fantastic complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops, grapefruit peel, and light-moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
Poured into a monic pint glass. Bright apricot/gold with an attractive three-finger head of frothy foam.
Sculpin is great beer. The grapefruit version is pretty much awful. It creates a weird fruity flavor that horribly ruins the final product. 
"Like great wines, great beers have a long finish that resonates and brings you round for more. Sculpin is in that class and in my glass. "
Very good brewski.
A total WTF beer like all Sculpins. Anyone who thinks this is a good beer evidently lives where good beers aren't available.
"Clear golden orange color with one finger high, white head. "
This is really good IPA. Can I honestly say it has a grapefruit taste to it? Yes! And the Grapefruit seems to go so well with this IPA. One of the best beers I have ever had. Considering it was $15.00 for a six pack which when shared went too fast I would be happy to buy some more six packs and not share them! Delicious.*
"A: Pale apricot in color, hazy with a medium amount of white head."
"Very similar to the regular Sculpin, except with more (gasp!) grapefruit."
"Way too much grapefruit flavor for me, but it's still a good beer."
"OK, so I'm about 4 months into this and continually read reviews where everything under the sun has an ester that is smelled and tasted. Besides the obvious grapefruitiness of Zombie Dust, I can actually taste AND smell the fruitiness in this Grapefruit Sculpin. It's not over the top but it's there and is awesome. Totally refreshing and great in this IPA!"
"I love Sculipin, and like that they have the Grapefruit and Habanero varieties now. I like them both. They each have a nice hint of the added flavor. It is still the great IPA that I love with just a little hint of something new."
Great fresh citrus aroma and taste. Love it.
"A- light gold, clear. Almost no head after rigorous pour from can."
"If you prefer grapefruit juice to orange juice, you'll love this. "
Had this at the Portland International Beerfest. A very well balanced IPA with grapefruit taste and smell all the way. Smells very hoppy and piney. Tastes refreshing and cool on a 100 degree day. It reminds me of Pliny the Elder; not quite there but still pretty damn good. Will be picking a 6-pack up at the local Bevmo to give it a more thorough try.
Bottled on May 29th. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip.
"As with Sculpin this has a nice hop grapefruit, melon, mango,tangerines and orange flavor from some very fresh hops. The added grapefruit, though, seemed to simply add bitterness and not the juiciness I expected."
"Great looking IPA with wonderful smell of fresh sliced pink grapefruit! Taste as good or better than the original, g-fruit taste is not over powering. A delicious, refreshing IPA with an extra zing to it."
"Its ten times better out of the can, had to change my review."
"12oz bottle. No code date. Appearance: Deep bronzed golden, clear, with a thick white head that lingers. "
"IN-FREAKING-CREDIBLE. I've ""lurked"" on BeerAdvocate for 2+ years, finally ""registered"" just so I could rate this brew."
It tastes like an ipa.
"One of the best tasting brews I've had the pleasure to experience! Although I'm not a fan of real life grapefruit, this beer is pleasing! #MustHave"
"Beautiful looking IPA when poured into a glass with a crystal clear brand new penny color. All the aromas of the original Sculpin IPA with an added boost to the grapefruit. Very refreshing on a hot summer day, the body is light enough to be an easy drinker. Not harsh at all, so smooth and quaffable (had to use some beer nerd vocab there). My beer crush of the moment."
This did not work for me. I was expecting/hoping for an ipa with grapefruit juice. Instead the only grapefruit flavor I noticed was the bitter rind. Not enjoyable.
Cannot say one bad thing
"The last of the sculpin variations. Fall in the middle for me, regular first and habanero last. Amazing smell, grapefruit for sure. Taste is good, tartness of grapefruit on the aftertaste. Still a great beer but not my go to from BP, can't beat the original!"
From a 355 ml bottle to tulip.
"L: Poured from a can to a pint glass. Had a copper color and a cloudy consistency. There was an inch of foamy, fairly long-lasting head. Great lacing."
"On tap at TRIA Taproom in Philadelphia. Served in their imperial pint glass. Nice head, great smell, better taste. So nice to have this draft on the East Coast. One of my favorite IPAs now with hints of grapefruit. I'm not supposed to eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice due to my cholesterol medication. Doc never said anything about grapefruit IPAs!"
Already a world class rating.... This review is a moot point. :)
Look: Clear Amber-Gold with generous frothy head	
I've had a problem with Grapefruit IPAs in the past but this is something I really like. The grapefruit sweetness isn't too strong in this drink and is balanced. I don't smell much on this though to be honest. That might be because I got the can and not the bottle. I need to have this on tap to improve my smell score. Besides that I want this again. I like it better than regular Sculpin.
"Live in Utah where this stuff is borderline impossible to get but managed to get a couple of cases. As close to perfection for my taste as you can get. Beautiful color and lacing, strong grapefruit smell. Taste is on point, this is no shandy, it's all the greatness of sculpin with a subtle grapefruit hit, executed perfectly. I've had lots of IPA including HT and Pliny, but if you love that grapefruit characteristic this is right at the top of the list."
This beer is awesome. 99/100. I typically don't like fruit in beer but that grapefruit really pulls out something in the hood of the regular sculpin.
A: crystal clear; copper colored; 1+ finger off white head that receded to a thin cap; nice lacing;
"Aroma is grapefruit, berries and hops. The flavor is grapefruit, citrus, hops, malts, fruit and a lingering bitter/slightly tart finish."
Very good. Just a hint of grapefruit. Not overpowering. Very enjoyable for the summer
"Nice IPA, good grapefruit with some bitterness, smooth and soft, good-but I'd take the regular Sculpin over it all day long"
"12 oz. bottle into a tulip. Very clear golden in color with great carbonation. An aggressive pour yielded a 2.5 finger head of sticky, snow white foam. Very interesting aroma consisting of grapefruit, citrus, and a tart bubblegum-candy like scent. Medium-light weight and very creamy. The taste brings amplified characteristics of the aroma, initially with a sweet-tart grapefruitiness. There is some hop bitterness and citrus on the back end, but it's more defined on the aftertaste. Finishes light and crisp."
12 Fl. Oz. Bottle
"One of my personal favorites. A perfect blend of citrus fruits and hop goodness without being overly sweet. So refreshing. I feel like i""m sucking on the world's tastiest mutantmango/grapefruit hybrid. It's hard to just sip this one."
"Pours a bright orange with a tan colored head that trails the glass and is not too fizzy. The smell was bursting with grapefruit notes and was delicious to drink. The flavors were excellent with a focus on the hops but a semi-sweet grapefruit finish. Really enjoyed this one, possibly even more than the regular sculpin. Will definitely be buying again."
"Pours a transparent amber color with an inch of off-white froth. Aroma smells of grapefruit/citrus with hints of bread, honey, and bubblegum."
"Great beer, will drink again"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Pours with a finger's worth of white foam that refuses to die. Honey orange in color. An abundance of bubbles continues to rise. Extreme Lacing! Very strong grapefruit aromas (as I would expect) that combine elegantly with strong piney hop and mild floral hop aromas. Mild orange (not a orange peel as I am used to sensing in beers) aromas are also present. Initial taste is a combination of strong grapefruit, mild orange and citrusy hop (weren't previously detected by nose probably because the grapefruit aromas were so intense and also that grapefruit is citrus, but there is a distinct difference in the taste) flavors. Initial flavors gradually decrease with the entrance of strong piney hop and mild floral hop flavors. End result is a mild grapefruit, subtle orange taste (citrus hops have died, so sad) with a strong piney and mild floral finish. Medium bodied, mild carbonation, somewhat creamy, with an extremely dry finish. This was an excellent IPA. I have had Ballast Point's normal Sculpin before, but that was two years ago before I wrote beer notes so I don't have a valid comparison between the two (at least for now). NOTE: As beer warms, mango and peach flavors can be detected in both aroma and taste giving this a whole new spin. The choice is yours. What will you decide?"
This is delicious but it very dry. Grapefruit is just right. Fought it at first but I'm sold now! Highly recommend.
"Everything you want in an IPA, with an extra grapefruit kick. Slightly better than oirginal sculpin, but this is not a regular purchase for me, with a 16.99 price tag in NY for a 6 pack."
"Unfortunately for this beer a review is an opinion and my opinion is I do not like the taste of this beer from a 12 oz bottle poured into a tulip. I will give it another try either on tap or can or both, because I obviously have to be missing something here or I received a bad batch. Don't get me wrong, if someone offered me a bud light or this, I would hands down choose GFS. Will change/add to review upon further consumption."
"If you're an IPA lover, then you'll adore this IPA. First off, the smell is intoxicating - very floral and citrusy. As for the flavor, it's bitter, piney, and citrusy. You definitely taste bitter grapefruit. The floral smell does through me off when drinking this beer, as I'm not used to that with other IPA's. I do wish it had a juicier mouthfeel, but that's really only a minor complaint."
I always thought sculpin was overrated. Grapefruit Sculpin strikes the perfect balance between fruit and hops
"A: Slightly hazy, orange, thin 1 inch head,"
Not much into the IPA's but I have to admit this was a good beer
"12oz bottle purchased at Huckleberry’s in Spokane for $3.29. There’s a freshness date, but it’s very hard to make out and my toothache ensures that I don’t give a damn about decoding a date using a different calendar than the one we all use."
"Pours clear gold copper with white head, smells of citrusy cascade hops and grapefruit no real malt or alcohol detection, tastes of bitter grapefruit and hops with a slight boozy tinge, mouthfeel is moderate with little carbonation with a dry lasting finish."
Pours pumpkin orange with a small island of head and fizzy lacing. 
"Wasn’t expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. The grapefruit is relatively subtle and gives it a light tartness behind the base Scuplin that is a solid brew, as many know. Overall, definitely worth drinking on a summer day, and leaps and bounds better than some of these grapefruit juice radlers that are on the market."
I think I like this more than the original. That's perhaps because I see Yellow Rose as my ideal IPA.
"This beer is my exception to my ""I don't like IPA's"" rule. The grapefruit notes kick the hops notes of IPA to at least the side of the road if not the curb. I find it refreshing and delicious. For me, this is a beer to pair with spicy foods. I had it from a bottle last night and paired it with Chimichurri chicken and hatch chili burrito. I would also pair it with fish tacos or even a salad that had a citrus vinegrette type dressing. A good hot day beer and it is hot in LA right now."
On tap at Blue Tusk in Syracuse. Literally tastes like Ruby Red. Yummy.
"Poured from a can dated 11/14/16. PS a deep amber with two fingers of white head. There is great white lacing left behind. The smell is grapefruit and those beautiful Sculpin hop profile. The taste is unreal. A perfect combination of hops and grapefruit. It's like biting into a fresh ruby red grapefruit, but without being sour or overwhelming. It's blends perfectly with the fresh, bright hops. There is a slight bitter, drying aftertaste. The mouthfeel is slightly oily with medium carbonation. Overall, this is almost perfect. I could drink this all day and be perfectly happy. The only reason this isn't a perfect 5.0 is the aftertaste is a little too dry and bitter for me, but that is being VERY picky."
"Look: Standard amber, faint pink hue"
Not as good as the regular sculpin.
"I had a taste of this recently and came away from it feeling like the hype was unjustified, and having it again leaves me feeling roughly the same. It's certainly pleasant, but I'm not sure why anyone would get actively excited about it, I honestly find that I much prefer the original version."
"Pours a light orange with a two finger off white head. Aroma is magnificent, with citrus, grapefruit, some more citrus, and more grapefruit. Taste is a little let down after the nose, but still very good with citrus, grapefruit, resin, citrus/grapefruit rind/peel, and some earthiness or dankness. Mouthfeel is medium with a slick feel and nice carbonation. Overall, a very good ipa and a definite improvement on the original."
"On tap at Ginger Man TX. Put next to Deschutes fresh squeezed IPA. World class both beers. Love the grapefruit, brings out all the love of an amazing IPA. If your a fan of IPAs get it. And if you aren't, get it anyway."
"Pours a clover honey orange with a quarter inch ivory, minor lacing."
"Fantastic take on an ipa, wish I could find it up in WA more often!"
Picked this up in ABQ NM
"I would never eat a grapefruit. Yet, it works well in this IPA. Very refreshing on a hot day."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on June 15, 2015"
"Was hoping this one wouldn't be overwhelming with grapefruit. You can ruin a beer really fast when you start to add juices and flavoring. When the beer is cool the grapefruit is super subtle, it comes out a bit more when warm but so do the hops. Ends up being very balanced and dangerously enjoyable. Body is a bit heavy and the sweetness can be cloying at the end, though. Well done mixture by Ballast Point, easily on the top of the list for me for summer IPAs."
"Solid beer, but not a personal favorite. Would rather drink regular sculpin or tons of other IPA's."
"I'm generally not a fan of flavored/citrus beer but I really enjoy Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin. The beer itself is not too sweet and not to bitter. You definitely can taste the grapefruit but it is very smooth from start to finish. I was handed this beer at a party and called distributors until I tracked down a case for myself. Now that I know where to find it, I've placed myself on a ""Grapefruit Sculpin"" diet. One of my favorites - although I see it as more of a summer beer..."
Delicious grapefruit IPA. Sculpin IPA is incredible. This is even better.
Love ballast point but not a true fan of the grapefruit sculpin.
"Gorgeous, shimmering gold in a Spiegelau IPA glass. Never have I see a more attractive beer in a glass. Whiff of grapefruit, and sure enough, tasting, there it is, an uncannily perfect partner to the robust hoppiness. Mouthfeel is a light oily delight. A stellar beer, one of the best out there in any style."
A moderate pour easily achieves a two finger light tan head. Body is an orange honey tone. Nose is super lush with tons of juicy citrus. Grapefruit and orange both play on the nose nicely. Man they hit this one on the nose with the grapefruit flavor. It is big and all over the tongue grapefruit freshness. Not as bitter as actual grapefruit but more like the pleasant pink variety. The taste buds keep screaming for the next drink to come. This is a very nice hot weather IPA.
Fairly hoppy and strong notes of grapefruit as described.
This beer is awesome for a number of reasons.
"Not as big of a fan of this as I am of the regular Sculpin, but it was still good. Here goes:"
"Love the original, one of my top 5 IPA's. This one is great too. Prefer the original but I like this one too."
"I fell in love with craft beer because I felt the product was supreme to the Macro alternative. A word I used to describe “craft” was “authentic”. A word that implies a truly superior product. As a big fan of Sculpin, I was excited at the opportunity to try Grapefruit Sculpin after reading the rave reviews. I was disappointed. While the nose is quite delightful, the taste is less than authentic. Too fruity. Stick with the original."
Come to the Florida sunshine tree........
This southern Cal cow pie was aight. Very strong grapefruit smell and taste followed by a slight malt after taste. Not a hop head but I liked it. Let's put it this way I'd chase a chubby girl around the bar after a few of these.♡♡♡
"This pours a clear tan gold with long lasting foam. Pow! Grapefruit on top of grapefruit--pith, peel and pulp. It's sharply bitter with a full grapefruits worth of piney citrusy goodness. Loved it fresh."
"Love the enhanced grapefruit note over regular sculpin, which itself is a wonderfully delicious and juicy IPA. I wish this beer was easier to find."
Crisp hoppy IPA with a citrus bite
12 oz can poured into snifter canned on 4/9 
Wow... that's all I have to say. May be my new favorite IPA. Perfectly balanced and hoppy. Crisp taste with a fantastic grapefruit aroma and finish. Mouth and liver are very happy.
"Nice big grapefruit aroma, with some other citrus in second fiddle. A touch of caramel. Taste is unsurprisingly similar, with a moderate bitterness. Grapefruit flavours work very well. Refreshing and bright."
Ok I love the concept. I like citrus/beer. A favorite of mine is blood and honey by Revolver Brewing Company. This one however is just off the mark. The aroma is fantastic but I think the bitterness of the hops and the bitterness of the grapefruit somehow do not mesh.
"This looked clear and golden in my tulip glass, with a nice head. Super refreshing beer - would love to have one of these on the beach. The grapefruit flavor is not overpowering."
"very interesting grapefruit, not flavor but actual grapefruit. so i guess this makes a first for a beer with fruit in it that i want to drink all the time."
Someone here called it a masterpiece and I wouldn't disagree.
A masterpiece. I wept while drinking it.
"I was a little let down by this, but that's only because I was expecting a lot. It was a beer that kept alluding me so maybe the anticipation got the better of me. I was able to score it super fresh, so that's not a question. To me, it seemed like a West Coast IPA doing a poor impression of a New England IPA. Still, it's a nice beer and has a lot of the qualities Sculpin has--look and feel--plus a perfect nose that really nails the grapefruit aroma, but the flavoring throws the taste off a bit, which knocks down the score for me."
Feel: like I paid way too much much...
Very good. I enjoyed it more than normal sculpin. If you like the taste of grapefruit this is the beer for you
Look: Clean and yellow/orange. Never sure why one rates the look of a beer…
A - Pours a very opaque golden orange color with 1 1/2 finger head. Great head retention. Carbonation very present in the clarity. Beautiful pour.
Great well balanced IPA ...not overly sweet
Very good I PA although it does taste quite a bit like an orange Capri Sun. I'm still deciding after a half a pint whether I like it as a seasonal summertime only beer or something I could drink at a restaurant during dinner. Overall I would buy again
Super fun out of a can.
julian date 15146 so 3 weeks-ish. from a can
A: This poured a clear gold with a little white head.
12 oz bottle. Pours clear golden orange with a huge creamy white head that retains well and laces the glass some.
Appearance – Pours a clear golden orange color with a nice head and medium lacing.
"there is very little grapefruit, this is the only ""fruit"" beer I would ever consider, a friend gave me some and now I keep buying it"
"Standard IPA. A bit overhyped. Everything that this beer supposedly accentuates is mild at best. Do not let the price and scarcity of this beer fool you. Hopheads, keep an open mind. In a train of citrus forward IPA's, this would be the caboose. Happy Hunting."
This Has a Great Mix of Hops & Citrus. Simply Superb Summer IPA.
Very artificial flavoring tasting. Least favorite Sculpin along with Habanero.
"Fruity pebbles in a glass, amazing beer"
Clear amber colored ale with a medium sized white colored head.
12 oz bottle.
"Served in a shaker glass at Nob Hill Bar and Grill in ABQ, NM."
"Not a hophead, but the grapefruit lends a really neat citrusy note that takes the hop to a different level."
"I don't know from where the grapefruit flavour is derived, but I do know that this beer is every bit the equal of the OG sculpin. Ballast Point is not to be trivialized, they are a serious player in the elite beer world. A massively overlooked brewery."
"As if the base Sculpin weren't good enough, the Grapefruit variant is really outstanding. It pours a lovely clear, orange color with a fluffy milk-white head and lacing. The grapefruit appears in the nose, along with the signature pine and resinous hops. The grapefruit taste is subtle but definite. It doesn't have the feeling of an adjunct. The base Sculpin kicks in with a bitter, biting hop finish. At 7% ABV, you don't feel the alcohol and you can enjoy a couple. Overall, an outstanding American IPA."
The grapefruit flavor in Grapefruit Sculpin IPA helps to lessen the the bitternes (70 IBU) compared to the regular Sculpin IPA (70 IBU). Excellent beer.
"Sweet smelling and tangy, refreshing flavor."
12 oz bottle pours a mostly clear gold color with a fair amount of off-white head. Retention is decent and lacing very nice.
"I like the way the beer balances out the grapefruit and the base beer. This is a nice, crisp, thrist-quenching beer that goes down great on a hot day."
Pours a hazy Amber with a white head.
The addition of grapefruit into this stellar IPA actually improved its refreshing qualities. The amount of fresh hops really blend amazingly with the grapefruit and it rides on a great malty foundation. Deliciousness! I will get this again.
"Instant Hop burst, with a citrus aftertaste.. quite possibly the only way to improve on Sculpin.."
12oz. bottle poured into a snifter
to bitter for my taste. I prefer regular IPA by sculpin.
Beautiful lacing
Pours a finger of head on a clear straw body.
"L- Dark gold, light heaed that fades quickly"
"Taste is juicy grapefruit, pale malt, and light citrus--like lemon and orange. I like this as it does not have some of the mouth puckering taste that some grapefruit has, yet the flavor is very much present. I prefer habanero sculpin over this, but I would have no problem getting several of these. Very very good ipa."
"Appearance: Clear dark gold with an off-white head that eventually faded, leaving little lacing."
Very heavy grapefruit taste (obviously). Great IPA but the grapefruit detracts from the delicious taste of original Sculpin IPA.
"If your into heavy citrus brews or west coast IPA's like the original Ballast Point Sculpin, then you should give this grapefruit infused India Pale Ale a try! I've tasted this from a 12oz bottle as well as on tap and both were great, but I think I enjoyed draft more as I usually do. Since I tasted this beer I've always personally preferred this version over the original BP Sculpin even though most people would disagree with me. Pours a light amber/carmel color with nice full head and heavy lacing. Full flavored IPA taste with distinct fresh squeezed grapefruit flavor shining through on the back end and gives just the right sweet-sour-bitter-hoppy mix that works out great! I love grapefruits and west coast IPA's so I can't go wrong with that mix!"
I really enjoyed the regular sculpin and I figured that this version would be even better.
Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a nice white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of intense citrus notes with light grapefruit notes. Taste is also dominated by citrus hops notes with light grapefruit notes with some residual sugar notes that are also perceptible. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Very pleasant IPA but I can’t say that I noticed the grapefruit notes coming out as much as I would have hoped.
"The grapefruit aroma coming from this beer is amazing. It is so aromatic and mouthwatering. The beer itself is light and crisp with some bitterness reminiscent of fruit rind. It's pretty easy to get and it tastes fantastic,"
"This might be better than ""regular"" Sculpin... The grapefruit addition takes the dryness out and adds a little sweetness... A delicious IPA!"
"Fantastic. Love sculpin, don't care for the price point but this is a treat, cost $17 a six pack...BUT considering what beer cost if you go out and get it at a bar I'm ""ok"" with $2.85 a beer as this was a really good beer and considering the grapefruit addition was done to perfection. Great job!"
Different. Love it! We'll done
"Grapefruit Sculpin pours a golden color with a perfect sized lacing head. There is a nice hoppy aroma, with hints of fresh grapefruit. The taste has a nice hoppyness, earthy undertones, and subtle hints of fresh grapefruit. Great body great feel. Overall the subtle grapefruit notes are very nice, its not overpowering."
Great raw Sculpin base with a great grapefruit infusion enhancing the already prevalent citrus notes. Love the grapefruit aroma and the balanced yet fruity alternative to the original. Perfect candidate for anyone looking to conjure up their own summer shandy with a grapefruit soda for those hot summer days.
Nice IPA - grapefruit is shuttle - not overwhelming - enjoyed with nice outdoor bbq
"Pours a clear golden-orange color with a tight, white head that leaves little bits of lacing."
This is a tremendous beer. The addition of grapefruit plays well with the bitterness and liberal hopping of the base Sculpin IPA. The scent is overwhelmingly tropical fruit - and yet the fruit does not take over on the taste profile but really adds to the complexity. A stellar offering from Ballast Point that is a great summer choice.
"This is a great beer. Don't let the ""grapefruit"" in the title put you off; it is very subtle and blends in nicely. When I buy a 6 pak, I make sure I hide it from my college age son. He wouldn't appreciate it anyway."
Very nice IPA. By far the best of the sculpins.
"So delicious, refreshing, not too sweet"
"There is something magical about this beer. It's all about the grapefruit, and it's fantastic. If you don't try this one, you will regret it."
"Look: Golden Clear. Lots of carbonation. Two fingers of beautiful, fluffy, almost purple-tinted head slowly dissipates."
"Perfect summer IPA. Not exactly cooler material due to price point, but otherwise absolutely stellar in every way. Also surprisingly common in my area, been a very common fallback for me this past year."
Poured from a 12 oz bottle.
"Took one of my favorite beers and added grapefruit. It's not better, it's not worse, it's equally as good but different in a great way. Very refreshing."
"An exceptional beer to begin with, it is only enhanced with the addition of grapefruit. This is as close as I have come to having the joys of Cigar City Citrus Wizard being reproduced."
"12 oz bottle from April 23rd, 2015 poured into a IPA glass."
"I can't imagine a more refreshing beer on a hot summer day. Grapefruit Sculpin is the perfect ""shower beer"" to crack open after mowing the lawn or other yard work."
"12oz can with a born on date of April 15, 2015 poured into a tulip glass."
"I love fresh Sculpin and I love fresh grapefruit. Thus, fresh Grapefruit Sculpin is a little piece of fermented heaven. I can see how those who don't necesarrily dig grapefruit might not be so impressed. But I do, and I am. What a pleasant surprise to find a 2-week-old 6-pack of cans for $14.99. Still slightly more than I prefer to pay for six beers, but reasonable for a world-class IPA, so I'll be buying more of this while I can."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. And that can came courtesy of the founding father of the canquest, woodychandler. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grapefruit, mango. Taste is hops, bitter, grapefruit, some orange peel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer, but I prefer the regular Sculpin."
"Firstly, if you're not a grapefruit fan, avoid this one. I've heard people say it's not grapefruit tasting enough, but to me it's grapefruit overkill. Decent head and nice lacing. The grapefruit enhances the piney notes and, as advertised, gives it a bite. Have to say it only became more appealing to me after I'd had a few Weyerbachers which mellowed it out a lot."
"Drank about 10 of these over the course of MDW, 12 oz. cans and bottles poured into a tulip."
Webby white film over sunset orange. 4
Delicious. Excellent. Unique. World class.
"This is better than regular Sculpin. The grapefruit takes most of the bitter hops out and makes it an amazingly juicy citrus ipa. Very smooth and supremely drinkable. Even at 7%, I could finish a 6 pack over a day long backyard barbeque. This is top notch!!!"
Nice IPA. Not a fan a fruity beers but the grapefruit is light and mixes well with the IPA. Overall good.
"I love Sculpin IPA and I was skeptical about this one as I am of any beer with infused flavored, but man oh man, this is really good. How Ballast Point got it right is by making the grapefruit really subtle. I taste it much more in the aftertaste then I do when actually drinking it. If someone how poured me a glass and told me it was a regular glass or sculpin I'm not sure I would have noticed the difference or at least not right away. It creeps up on you, but in a good way. All in all, a truly delicious beer."
"IPA's as a general rule are pretty brash, in your face hoppy and not much finesse. Grapefruit Sculpin takes hop bitterness, tart juicy grapefruit, sweet maltiness(is that a word?) and balances all three perfectly. If you are an hop head, IPA person you may be disappointed, but this is one outstanding drinker with no sharp edges just nice round, smooth flavors."
GF Sculpin
This is overrated...too much grapefruit flavor.
Pours hazed golden amber with a fluffy head. Lacing sticks.
"12oz bottle, thanks be to the good doktorzee for bringing this back for me. Nice label imagery depicting some cross-species genetic melding."
"Wow, grapefruit. But not the pithy kind. Bitterness is very present but the right amount to hold up to the abundance of hop flavor and malt bill. I can't stop smelling the aroma. Good stuff."
"My penultimate ipa, I can't recommend this beer enough. It tastes like straight up grapefruit juice, being both sweet and bitter and juicy. Smells like it tastes, looks like liquid gold. Awesome!"
even better out of a can!
"To me, this is a step down from sculpin. The base beer is great, but the grapefruit tastes very generic and impresses on me like something that BMC might do. I get the Bud Light w/ Lime feel. I'll stick with regular Sculpin."
"I can tell it isn't fresh but either way. Heavy grapefruit peel and hops. Taste is muddled grapefruit and hops, slight malt. Not a fan of this. I just don't like grapefruit also but I've honestly had better IPAs for all the hype behind this."
So many refreshing citrus tones. Tastes lighter than 7%. Very easy to drink.
"15 day-old bottle poured into a snifter. Slightly hazy medium amber color with a frothy white head. Nice lacing. Huge grapefruit aromas. Also some orange, resin, and dry bread. The taste followed suit with grapefruit up front and through the finish. Other flavors came along, including pine and orange. The grapefruit tasted hop-like, with no hint of fruit juice. A dry finish with a sturdy but subtle malt backbone. Bready and not sweet."
"I'm a big fan of the non-grapefruit sculpin, but this was a refreshing surprise. I really dig this too."
"This is a home run hitter! Some may argue that the grapefruit flavor is ""artificial"", but i'd say that it adds to the citrus flavor and overall aroma. This is a citrus bomb of a beer. Kudos to you Ballast!"
Canned on the 117th day of 2015.
"look: light gold, very clear. Fairly substantial and messy off white head and lacing. Looks like a Sculpin."
More IPA than grapefruit which is a bit of a disappointment
"Terrific citrus smell. The taste is good, but not liking grapefruit to start with the after taste is too grapefruity bitter for me."
"Wonderful, you see it. Get it, If your reading this you want it. Does not, can not disappoint"
Give me more!! And to make five words: Please Please
"Great IPA for someone who doesn't like IPA's this one is exceptional, a must for any beer enthusiast"
"Super clean and refreshing - Cheers to Ballast Point, as they surely are on point with the balance here. The extremely subtle hint of the essence of grapefruit delivers a slight citrus rush as your taste buds open up and get kissed with just the right amount of hops! Well done - I could drink this a few times a week or over my breakfast cereal."
"expensive (here on the east coast, at least), but worth it! i am usually leery about anything ""extra"" in beer, but the grapefruit really makes the hops explode. i would drink this all the time but for the price."
Was expecting Sculpin with an added grapefruit kick. Instead its like drinking ocean spray
A - Darkish golden pour with a bright body. Mild carbonation with one finger of off white head. Spotty lace and a half finger of retention.
Can't even get over how good this smells. My grandmother used to have grapefruit and sugar all the time for breakfast and this takes me back to those times I used to sleep over her house. Love this beer!!!
It's one of my favorites...even though it may be a bit overrated.
"Disclaimer: not a huge fan of reg sculpin, solid beer but def overrated. This smells like an IPA that was mixed with that sam adams traveler grapefruit stuff. Love when hops give you that citrus/grapefruit taste and smell in a beer, but in this case it feels very artificial to me."
"Nothing more one can say, other than this hits all the right notes of fruit/sweet/bitter/everything. The aroma is crazy good."
Honestly I prefer regular Sculpin to this product. I thing the grapefruit only serves to push the alpha acid into a bad range. The fruit itself is completely lost in astringency
Bought from Little's Wine and Liquor. I think it was around 3ish for a single (but I don't remember exactly).
"The grapefruit almost overpowers the sculpin base, however this is almost a good thing as the grapefruit flavor is spot on and provides a great citrus and bitter combination."
Disclosure: ipa's are not one of my favorite styles.
"Room Service - San Francisco, CA - 6-pack"
"got this brew by accident at Trader Joe's. Weird stuff. It tastes like beer with grapefruit added. Read the label and sure enough, it is grapefruit flavored beer! Not my style. Honestly, am going to pour these down the drain. Pity, now I am off my feed for Sculpin too. What is with the high ratings? Is Ballast Point buying raters?"
"Out of a 12oz can into a Spiegelau glass -- great smell, huge grapefruit hit and a smooth, easy finish. Light, but very flavorful this is definitely one of my all time favorites."
"Why mess with what is arguably the king of IPAs? That's what I initially thought, but I'm glad I tried it. Grapefruit Sculpin looks great, smells incredible, and tastes nearly as good. The grapefruit slightly lightens up the taste and feel, but retains the qualities that sets Sculpin apart in a crowded field of IPAs. Think of it as a summer version of a full-bodied IPA. Too bad Ballast Point costs nearly TWICE! as much as every other craft beer available in WI."
"A: The beer is clear yellowish amber in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that died down, consistently leaving a thin layer of bubbles on the surface, a collar around the edge of the glass, and some lacing down the sides of the glass. "
12oz can poured into a snifter. Canned on date is 04/22/15. 
I'm in the minority on this almost un drinkable initial grapefruit taste is amazing but quickly faded to a horribly dry and I mean dry finish
"12 oz. bottle, 12 oz. mason jar glass. Unknown best by date. I've had regular sculpin before, and full disclosure, was not impressed. Probably something lost in translation during the long trip from west to east coast."
"The expectation and hype was high for this beer - cult like. I went to San Diego drank a few of the first rate Sculpin on Tap and heard from the bar tender and crowd that the Grapefruit was worthy and their kegs sold old out in a few days. I like the beer, the grapefruit taste is classy and light, the hops fades. I bet straight off the tap it is awesome, but in the bottle after weeks? I want you to try it for yourself. Is it a chick beer? The flavor is light and refreshing for the beaches and summer weather of the Pacific Coast. So for a moment in time on the Beach it is a 5. I will stick with the classic Sculpin when the price is right."
"Definitely as advertised. This is Sculpin, with heavy dose of grapefruit. This is not just Sculpin with more citrus. This is indeed a grapefruit-flavored beer. The Sculpin serves this as the quality base, but beware, as I said, this is a flat-out grapefruit beer. I'll stick with regular Sculpin."
Smell is loaded with grapefruit. Taste is a nice balance of hoppy IPA and lingering grapefruit throughout. The grapefruit really compliments the great IPA flavor. Different and quite tasty. yb
"On tap, poured into a snifter???"
"Juicy grapefruit aroma jumps out of the glass. Huge grapefruit bitterness punches you in the mouth. Since I am not the biggest fan of eating grapefruit, it is a little much for me, but for grape fruit lovers this must be heaven. Worth seeking out."
"Ipa with grapefruit flavor? Yes.please! Very good, very tasty. Thoroughly enjoyable!!"
"Unreal nose on this thing: reminiscent of when I was a young shaver and mom would section a ruby red grapefruit, sprinkle on a little sugar, and I’d scoop it out with a spoon. Delicious, the grapefruit that is; and this beer too. The head is incredibly thick and hangs around forever. It looks like a beer. I’ve sampled this several times and keep waiting for it to be less spectacular than the time before. Hasn’t happened."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Belgian tulip. Bottled on April 15th. 2015 (according to the Julian date printed on the bottle), so not quite a month old. "
huge citrus and fruit notes up front and at the end.
Could smell some grapefruit and taste a lot but took too much effort still just Sculpin with some grapefruit flavor
I was ecstatic to find Ballast Point brews added to my distribution area. Picked up a six-pack of bottles at the local Trig's market. Poured right from the fridge into a pint glass.
"Tastes like a grapefruit squeezed into an IPA. I don't know what I expected but it wasn't this. If you really enjoy grapefruit, this might be for you."
7-10
"Did not like this one nearly as much as the original. Tasted a little too sweet, I think. And really no nose that I could detect."
growler was over a week old; grapefruit and light piney floral notes still nice but presumably weakened. Head was ok with some lacing but this was my bad for not pouring sooner.
Pretty good. Smells just like a fresh grapefruit
Too much grapefruit. I like when grapefruit flavors show in the hops but not a as an additive. I guess you have to be a grapefruit lover to appreciate this beer. I am not that. Tastes weird and I will avoid this beer in the future. Regular sculpin is a solid brew and this ruins it.
"Nice and fresh, canned 14 Apr so is just over two weeks old, which I've learned with several other IPAs and similar beers, is quite often where the ""sweet spot"" period for several highly hopped beers begins for me. "
To me the grapefruit adds nothing to this beer. Still good but...
"12oz can, poured into a hurricane glass. The aroma is a bright, fresh grapefruit with muffins (the muffins fade), an undertone of lemon lime soda, and a hint of grassy spice. The beer is a brilliant, effervescent gold with and off-white, big foam head that leaves good lace and has good retention. The taste is a bright, fruity, medium high sweet with a mellow, supporting medium citrus bitter. The beer is fluffy, creamy, and oily thin with a medium body. The initial palate is of bread crust, grapefruits, and crisp lemon lime that finishes with a sweet citrus zip and a touch of honey and leaves a mellow aftertaste that?s lightly cloying, astringent, and dry with grapefruit rind and pine notes that linger. It?s not so much a fruity beer, as a beer with fruit; and because it?s grapefruit, it serves to give the IPA a natural juicy kick. Very refreshing, very dangerous at 7%"
One of the best beers I've ever had hands down.
"Bright, clear gold body; very thick, rich and dense white head; plenty of fine carbonation gently rising from the bottom of the glass; sheets and globs of sticky foam coating the glass. Very fruity aroma; kiwi; grapefruit. Biscuit malts and light cereal grains; smooth, intense bitterness; fruity. Medium body; soft and velvety on the palate; mostly dry finish."
L:
Serving glass: Poured from bottle into IPA glass.
I think I would prefer normal Sculpin. I guess I don't like additives.
"I personally think the grapefruit gets in the way and subdues the hops. Wish it was the other way around. I much prefer the regular Sculpin. Still not bad per se, thus the reasoning for the reasonably high rating. Just very overrated"
"fantastic IPA, grapefruit is prominent. Doesn't disappoint at all."
Regular Sculpin is worlds better
"I'd rather have a citrus bomb from citrus hops, not some adjunct."
World class for a reason.
"L: clear Amber with a one finer head that dissipated into a thin collar. S: not surprisingly it is similar to regular sculpin with apricot and mango, but with more grapefruit. T: again, similar to regular sculpin but with more grapefruit. I get a lot of grapefruit pith and peel, as opposed to juicy flesh. Apricot, mango and peach as well, with a strong malt backbone. But the grapefruit pith predominates. Lingering pithy bitterness and some sweetness from the malts. A very good IPA, just not my IPA. I prefer the regular Sculpin."
more of a gimmick beer than something I'd want to drink very often.
"Crystal-clear golden in color. Fizzy carbonation. Smells hoppy and citrusy. Tastes exactly how I hoped it would... like a nice ipa with a real red grapefruit addition. Hops up front, quickly followed by (and sometimes overtaken by) a strong citrusy flavor exactly reminiscent of biting into a slice of cold ruby red grapefruit. Juicy red grapefruit. "
A: Pours an orange copper color with 2+ fingers of head that fade down to a bubbly ring of lace that leaves some spotty lacing
The grapefruit seeps from Grapefruit Sculpin from the nose until the end. Its quite refreshing.
Good hoppy taste and aroma
This is an amazing IPA. Nice grapefruit nose on it. Not an overpowering grapefruit taste...its just right.
"Good grapefruit flavor, more of a balanced IPA but good nonetheless."
"A: poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, orange amber colored with a huge white head that lingers leaving good lacing, clear"
Too strong of a hip flavor for me
"This beer really lived up to the hype for me. Great grapefruit flavor , great bite! Love it!"
Picked up a single from TW Arrowhead in early April for $2.99. Bottled on 15069 or 3-10-2015.
Appearance: Golden body shows some haze. Holds a very thin cover of white foam that doesn't look like it's going to lace or last. I'm proven wrong deeper into the glass as it holds and gives up a spot or two of lace.
"I don't like IPAs. I don't particularly like grapefruit. This beer, though, is tart yet fruity, strong, yet smooth. I don't have the palette to really appreciate everything about it, but I can taste it and know that this is a beer worthy of its acclaim."
"This beer initially caught me eye because it was ranked #3 in Paste Magazine's blind taste test of 100 IPAs - and I like grapefruit. It was more than I usually spend on a six-pack but I had to try it. And it did not disappoint. I am sipping one right now, slowly, because I am in no hurry to finish it - even though I have five more in the fridge! It's everything I like about an IPA but one-upped with the grapefruit. And - the grapefruit, to me, wasn't in your face. Will be a great special occasion sipping beer for me."
A-a clear orange amber color with visible carbonation bubbles and a fingers worth of white head
"Very very grapefruity. . similar to a lot of east coast IPA'S, just a lot more grapefruit towards the end. . Definitely recommended"
I have been tasting beer for less than a year. This is one of the best IPAs I've had. Grapefruit should've tried harder to taste like this. Other IPAs since have pale aled in comparison.
Great tasting beer especially on a warm day.
"I love this beer, its a huge improvement on regular sculpin. The beer starts out smelling super zesty, huge citrus part, with lots of hops just like the normal. Big grapefruit taste makes this just soar in terms of flavor and satisfaction. 10 thumbs up!"
"Smells of sweet grapefruit, tastes very grapefruity and then a solid bitter hoppy finish."
Great brew. The grapefruit is perfect in this beer. It is present without becoming overwhelming and doesn't taste artificial. Great twist on an already phenomenal beer!
If you love grapefruit this is a perfect beer for you. Even if you don't like grapefruit this is one outstanding IPA and doesn't disappoint. I do love grapefruit so this brew goes near the top of my list.
Meh just not my bag.
Look - Clear with just a hint of cloudiness
"Bought at Dunkin Donuts in Milton ($14.99 six pack) and poured into a teku glass. A beautiful completely clear golden-apricot color with a finger of almost pure white tight bubbles that leaves nice lace. Aroma was not really pronounced but contained nice citrus and caramel. Taste is wonderful and follows the nose, but more pronounced citrus, followed by a fair bit of bitterness. Mouth is good, clean, refreshing, makes you want more. Overall, a fantastic IPA and great to find in my small town."
I normally shy away from flavored beers but I love Sculpin and this version is an interesting variation on a great brew.
"Pours a nice orangey amber. with a frothy 3 finger head that leaves lovely sticky lacing coating the sides of the glass.. Smells of fresh squeezed grapefruit juice with just a hint of lemon on the end. Tastes just like it smells,very juicy grapefruit with a twist of lemmon and a bit of apricot."
The first time I tasted this I thought it was a novelty that would wear off. First thing I noticed was I didn't like the regular Sculpin as much. Then I noticed I started comparing every IPA I tasted to this one. Guess I'm hooked!
"This is all grapefruit rind, to the point of being unpleasant. An unfortunate miss for all brewery that puts out many other great beers. And everyone seems to be slurping this stuff up like it's God's cum, so at least it will make them a ton of money to make better beer."
Not more else to say but they took a great Sculpin IPA and added the grapefruit/citrus hint to the brew; most excellent!!
"Pours clear gold color with bubbles racing up the middle like champagne, leading to a foamy off white 2 finger thick head that faded slowly and left decent foamy lacing. "
Doesn't have much of an aroma. 
"Enjoyable American IPA. From the bottle, it pours an off-amber with a moderate head. Citrusy flavor that is well balanced and enjoyable. Find it and try it!"
"Wow, that stuff is sooo good! Just flawless. Appearance is great with the huge fluffy head, lots of lace, clear amber color. Aroma is a crazy mix of caramel and hop grapefruit that somehow works. Flavor's the same way and has it all in perfect harmony. excellent Palate. Drink the hell out of this beer."
Gorgeous beer. Amazing smell. However the taste was one dimensional to me and the grapefruit masked the hops and made it taste a little too much like a fruit beer. Highly refreshing and still very good.
"Quick review. This beer is pretty much as-advertised. Very similar to your regular sculpin with what I'd call a pretty natural-tasting grapefruit element. To my taste, it's maybe just a bit much grapefruit & throws things a bit out of balance."
Whoever decided to pair grapefruit notes with the IPA citrus taste is a genius. This is a outstanding beer and I suggest you try if you haven't already.
"Great grapefruit flavors, even the bitter from the grapefruit comes through. Hard to pick up the hops of this IPA, its all grapefruit and it works! Going to be a great summer fruity beer, glad to find it in the Boston Area."
I absolutely adore this beer - this will probably be my number one go to for the summer. 
Poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass.
"12 oz. can, julian date puts this at July 10. A little over a month old."
Review is a month old bottle
"Really enjoyed this beer. The smell is what stood out for me on this beer. I was able to pick up the citrus even before I poured it into my glass. Once it was poured the hops were also noticeable, it was awesome. Then I drank it and just as good. Huge grapefruit flavor up front then turns to hoppy goodness. I haven't had the regular sculpin in a while but after the initial grapefruit it tastes exactly what I remember the regular being like. Overall I loved it."
"A great introductory IPA for anyone who normally stays away from them. The initial notes of grapefruit balance the taste of hops. Good, but I prefer the original Sculpin."
I enjoy bitter beer but I found this undrinkably bitter.
After seeing all the good ratings I'm wondering if my bottle was old
"This is good, but regular Sculpin is better."
"Serving type: on tap at GraPow in Riverside, CA"
12oz into tulip pint
Grapefruit really comes through. Incredibly drinkable even with a 7% abv.
Light copper body with a thin head. Smells of massive sweet citrus with citrus/pine hops. Up front the flavor is grapefruit oil with citrus and grassy hops. Long lasting bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft. There's a mild carbonation and a medium body. Awesome citrus bomb.
"Straight pour from a 12oz pry-off bottle to an oversized wineglass (Jester King stemware); no bottling date, but this is from the most recent batch—which has flown off the shelves in the last week, since it finally hit this market. It’s been refrigerated the entire time, as far as I can tell, so this out to be freshhhhh. "
"Where's the grapefruit? No, seriously, where's the grapefruit?"
"Had this on 2015-04-12 in Columbia, PA from a 12 oz bottle"
"Not a huge IPA guy, but I picked this up in growler format, and now I snag 6'ers whenever I see them. Juicy grapefruit kinda mellows out the hops, which is a good thing for me. Bitterness doesnt linger, but is still strong. I think that my favorite thing about this beer is the aroma! Overall, a really solid, very balanced IPA, that might just start me on the slippery slope to becoming a hop head."
Appearance-4.0: Pours out a beautiful golden color. Nice head. Excellent lacing.
"Resiny, with grapefruit presence in aroma. Flavor is grapefruit pith, toasted malt, and moderately bitter finish. Wish the fruity hop character were more pronounced, rather than the resin."
"Poured into pint glass. Straw color, with a fluffy white head. Moderate carbonation. I'm not sure that adding grapefruit improves Sculpin which, in my opinion, was pretty damn good to start with. The extra citrus boost does give this brew a different character, but if I had a choice I'd stick with just plain Sculpin."
"Nice golden straw color pour into an ipa glass and just a very slight off white head that retreats to a layer of bubbles on top. Lacing is spotty and sporadically travels down the glass edges. Beautiful, grapefruit forward, sweetness arrives first with other citrus notes following. Citrus flavors help through the the hop bitterness and the grapefruit really shines on the taste buds. Decent bodied brew that is sweet and bitter but goes down so smoothly. I find that I enjoyed this variation more than regular Sculpin, but I am a sucker for grapefruit forward ipas so I'm not surprised."
"A beautiful, bright golden pour hits the glass and results in a thick and dense head. The head is slightly off white in color and both retains and laces very well. The body of the beer is just a touch hazy. When the scent of this beer hits the nostrils a fruit and hop cocktail is the overall impression. The grapefruit gives the beer a sweet note right up front before the hops bring in a citrus bitterness. Shortly after the hops bitterness hits, it is gone and the grapefruit returns and dominate the rest of the nose. The flavor of this beer closely follows the smell, with a flavor combo hitting the tongue up front of sweet fruits and bitter hops. The two components mix almost completely, making the drink both sweet and bitter. For an IPA, this has a rather creamy mouthfeel and is incredibly thirst quenching and easy to drink."
Didn't really like the regular sculpin but this was great. They should have just called it oceanspray - grapefruit really came through in a big way - and turned an otherwise good IPA into a great one.
"I can enjoy either a refreshing fruity beer or a good IPA, but this combination really didn't do it for me."
"Split this with some coworkers; thoroughly meh, mainly cause I'm not a big fan of the style, but more palatable than previous grapefruit beers and IPAs I've had in the past."
Been waiting to try this one for a while. It does not disappoint. That nose is amazing! Like a grapefruit in the face. Tastes quite refreshing with a nice hop bite at the end.
Appearance - clear amber color with white head
I much prefer this to regular Sculpin. Very distinct nose and the extra fruity tartness really makes this. Top 10 IPA for me for sure.
The nose on this beer... just wow. 
Not a fan of fruit beer but the fruit in this beer is an extension of the hop flavor/aroma. It totally works. Primo
I prefer regular sculpin. Chances are if like the slight bitterness of grapefruit then you will love the beer
"Every time I go to take a sip, I get a waft of grapefruit smell before my lips hit the beer. Nice. If you like grapefruit, which I do, I would recommend this. Is my buddy, who is on Lipitor, allowed to have this?"
"Take a world class citrusy and tropical, stone fruit backed, dry IPA and bury it under grapefruit juice and ruin the head retention. It's still good, but, I dunno, drink some grapefruit juice if this is what you want."
"Deep gold (6) with thin, off white head. Grapefruit nose. Balance between malt foundation and lemon grass and grapefruit flavors. Medium mouthfeel and a little tang on the tip of my tongue. Hard to make a great beer better. Congrats."
"A: Deep amber with some bubble streams- very pretty!. Pretty thin head for an IPA, or just about any beer for that matter. No lace."
"Dark straw to light amber appearance with a thin, full covering, fast breaking white head. Smell is off the charts incredible with pure ruby red grapefruit. There may be other aromas underneath the grapefruit but I can't detect them. Palate showcases a nice amount of citrus including grapefruit and lemon. Finishes clean and crisp with a nice lingering hit of hop bitterness. This is a great beer - I can't wait to try it on a hot summer day. I much prefer it to regular Sculpin."
A tad bitter in finish and a tad artificial flavored. Like some tang was spooned in and stirred.
Delicious.......I can't believe that BP actually improved Sculpin!!
"12 oz. bottle, with no apparent bottled on date present, but it does list a 7.00% abv three different times. My first encounter with this variant of the Ballast Point classic IPA, acquired the six pack from the local beer store."
Liked regular sculpin 10x better.
"I love IPAs particularly juicy tropical fruit varieties. So while I had high expectations I'm not a huge regular culpin fan. But I really liked this beer. Not something I would drink more than one of, but truly enjoyable aroma and flavor."
"I was sure that I wouldn't get to try this. Thankfully, found some downtown."
"Easily the best ballast point brew...way better than sculpin. Not fruity at all, just uses the grapefruit for the bitterness...genius. So glad this is a year round offering now."
I love the regular Sculpin but did not like the grapefruit bitterness in this one
12 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. 
"Poured cold into a tulip glass. Bottled around Feb 15th, consumed on 3/13/15."
"Every bit as good as its brother (Sculpin), but with a nice, refreshing citrus twist."
"Good, but I'd waited for it for a long time and wasn't that taken with it. I thought it would be a ""5"" for me and it wasn't. Smells great, though."
"Nice looking color. Surprised that there wasn't an extreme amount of either grapefruit or hop aroma. The taste was of a fresh grapefruit, not overly bitter. Maybe lacking just a little hop flavor."
Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a IPA glass.
"Nice clear copper color. Smells of juicy grapefruit and piney hops. Tastes as good as it smells, actually better. Got plenty of grapefruit flavor (and I mean real, juicy, ruby red grapefruit) in perfect balance with a strong IPA base. Smooth feel with character. Overall it is quite fantastic, especially if you're looking for a citrusy IPA."
Bottle from colonial spirits. 
It's a dream come true
This beer is the bomb.
"Nice golden color with good head retention. The arome was a fantastic fresh grapefruit smell. The taste was neither very grapefruity or a nice IPA flavor. Just the bitterness came through. Maybe the grapefruit and hops competed too much. Wanted to love it based on ratings and reviews, but not so great for me."
"No bottling date visible, but this came through the distributor just a week or two ago so probably reasonably fresh."
BOTTLE: 12 fl oz. Brown glass. Branded white & red pry-off pressure cap. Great label art & design.
This is by far one of my favorite beers. Possibly #1
"Sculpin with a twist. Without reinventing notes from my initial Sculpin review, I'll insert the opinion that I get more bite on the palate, from beginning to end, which can only be attributed to the addition of grapefruit. I also detect a fresh bread characteristic from the malt that adds to the overall balance of the beer. If you enjoy the original, you should appreciate the variance on this one, too. By incorporating grapefruit, Ballast Point did nothing to diminish the properties that worked with its predecessor. Although the original tasted better the first time I had it, I would be more inclined now to reach for this version as a result of the inevitable palate shift. Like Christopher Cross rocking an Earl Campbell jersey in the late 70's, this IPA has me ""Sailing""."
Pours a clear light amber (orange). Outstanding head volume and retention. Lacing is world class.
"Poured from a bottle into a Goose Island tulip. It pours out a dark gold color, quite clear with a slight haze and about a finger of fine white head. Wonderful nose on this one. I get fresh grapefruit halves like you'd eat for breakfast- I can smell the juice and everything - as well as a hint of fresh bread and the standard citrus-like hop aromas of lemons and oranges."
"Ballast Point's ""Sculpin"" has always been a fruit-forward IPA in its hop character alone. But hops can only take you so far. If the preferred character of grapefruit is what's so desired, then the actual grapefruit additions to the beer might be in order."
Too much grapefruit and not enough Sculpin.
"Way too malty for my preference, could've had some age on it, didn't know bottle date."
Gregorian bottling date that translates to 03/05/15
"Picked up a six pack of this delicious fruity ipa on a scorching hot spring day in southern California to keep the heat out my body. Dam good beer, definitely up there with BP's victory at sea. Try it, try it, try it!"
"If you haven't tried this, AND you like IPAs AND grapefruit, please try this. I happen to like both IPAs and grapefruit, and it is a top 10 beer for me. Perfectly balanced without that artificial fruit flavor your sometimes get from beer/fruit combos. Try it."
"A - Golden orange, clear, with a light, white head, major lacing."
Too much artificial grapefruit for me
I really enjoy this IPA... just the right amount of grapefruit flavor and bitterness. I prefer this to the regular sculpin
"I happen to think it's extraordinary. I have really enjoyed every ballast point beer I have had so far and this one is out of the park. The Julian date on the bottle reads 15057. Pours very clear and orange with a bone white head of foam that held well and left handsome lacing. Nose is so authentic with grapefruit. it's heady with it, then for perfume it has the scent of fresh orange. A bit of twiggy and woody pine. It smells so fresh and tantalizing. Drinks like a an ocean breeze. All that tantalizing citrus. The orange is bright and light. The grapefruit is something wonderful. It has all the flavor of a real grapefruit but none of the pucker or bitterness of it. it's like they took all that flavor and sweetened it just enough. The malt is elusive but a touch sweet with honey and so soft that it simply cascades over your tongue. Mouthfeel approaches medium but is still wonderfully light with just enough weight from that honey malt to satisfy the palate in a very sensual way. Right before the swallow is this breezy little spritz from carbonation that is so whimsical it made me laugh out loud. It's as though you got a little sea mist at the back of your throat. Perfect crisp finish that brings a little bit of the fruit rind a touch of bitterness to end this amazing beer. It's so good."
Grapefruit hits the nose up front and lingers on the back of the tongue. Delish.
Wowsers. Whomever thought to put grapefruit in this world class ipa is a genius. Heady topper with grapefruit???now that would be one hell of a head to head contest. Amazing beer.
"This beer is actually better than the original Sculpin, imho. It has a lighter alcohol punch and a noticeably fruity (grapefruit, of course) base. Look: golden with little retention; smell: grapefruit; taste: grapefruit and hops but without the hop bitterness of the original Sculpin; feel: light and smooth; overall: one of the best IPAs I've ever had!"
"Big grapefruit and pine smell, with grapefruit juice and grapefruit rind winning the battle. The grapefruit masks most of the bitterness to give the beer a dry, yet robust and fruity finish. Very smooth and the alcohol is hidden. This is a very well-balanced beer. It is excellent in the hot Texas summer while you're smoking a brisket."
Poured from a bottle into pint glass in March 2015.
"Hand-delivered from the west coast (thanks Mike) - been dying to try this. 12oz. bottle served in a tulip nonic. Pours a translucent burnt orange with a loose, quarter-inch, off-white head. Nose expresses bright citrus, candied fruit and a hint of zest. Flavor profile begins with a light biscuity character, followed by an earthy/herbal dank hops presence and finishing with a hint of sweet citrus and some medicinal notes. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to the light side of the spectrum, with a lively carbonation and a kiss of acidity. All and all, a great American IPA - well worth the wait."
A year later this one has lost the edge. I don't like it as much anymore. So many more better IPAs without fruit.
Delicious brew. Crisp orange color good head a lacing.let the grapefruit orange flavor roll around in your mouth and on your tongue. Wonderful. High price point but high class.
"Crystal-clear, filtered deep golden body with a frothy bone white head. Aroma is of grapefruit zest, citrus, pine, hints of white grape and tropical fruits. Grapefruit comes through way more in the flavor with crisp, tart, fruity grapefruit coming through in a big way. Really amazing how much this tastes like pure grapefruit. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean and medium bodied. A great take on an already great IPA. Extremely impressive."
"This particular offering was on my personal bucket list and thought I would never have the chance to enjoy it unless I went to California. Thank you World of Beer Viera Florida. One word says it all for me, Wow ! I am a big fan of West Coast styles of IPA's, if you are a fan of this style and like grapefruit seek this one out. Cheers!"
"This was a winner right off of the pour. It was a nice golden color with a fizzy white head. As soon as I poured it I caught the aromas of citrus and grapefruit. The smell was amazing. The taste was also very clean, citrusy, and hoppy. The hops and citrus combo on this beer is just about a perfect marriage. I can see this being one of my summer go to beers from now on. The grapefruit had a way of making this one of the cleanest feeling beers I have drank. Very refreshing!"
Yummy yum yum .. best grapefruit ipa
"Crisp, bitter, clean, nicely aggressive:) Cheers!"
Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for the bottle
pours a nice golden orange color with a thick head.
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Poured a somewhat hazy dark yellow color, with a half inch head that quickly faded to a very thin film. Minimal lacing. The aroma was big grapefruit (as it should be), with some flowery and piney notes. Just a tinge of malty sweetness in the background. The taste was identical to the smell - huge grapefruit -just awesome! I got a little sweetness in the finish as well. The body was pretty heavy for an IPA- very nice, with a nice crisp finish and good carbonation on the tongue. Overall, I like this better than regular Sculpin - damn tasty - wish I could find it as often in CO, ,would buy it all the time!"
Good. Had Sculpin and jalepeno before and slightly disappointed with grapefruit due to weird finish . I still like. It's almost like I got grapefruit seed sculpin. Still good but disappointed.
"I like the original sculpin, and if you are a fan of grapefruit you will love this beer; however, I am not a fan of the fruit."
"First a disclaimer: I've never been a huge fan of basic Sculpin. Heretical, I know, but of the many times I've had it, I've been pretty consistently underwhelmed. I won't get into the reasons as this is not a review of that beer, but I felt it was pertinent to establish a baseline considering this is a spinoff of another beer."
First sip at home with John via bottles JT purchased at Total Wine Redondo Beach.
"Half a finger of eggshell white foam, good amount of larger bubbles spread across the surface, below average retention, the lacing is broad but not especially thick. Unblemished, bright liquid of a coppery orange color, the random bubbles are fat and avoid beading. In the nose the citrus has more focus than raw sweetness, pink grapefruit supported by solid tangerine notes, floral with saline and pretzel accents, pineapple, nectarine and peach fruit scents likewise more apt to jab than give you a hug. Full-bodied, more dense than heavy, might benefit from more powerful carbonation. Still manages good crispness and the herbaceousness, pine sap and general savoriness give it more spine. For an element which is ever-present, the grapefruit shows restraint in that it willingly shares the stage. The finish displays the underlying caramel and toffee sweetness, particularly when it warms some. Apricot, peach, pineapple fruit there, again not a fruit-driven experience. As one might expect, and want, the grapefruit outlasts all else. Good drinkability, doesn’t wear you down."
Smell the aroma and you are hooked.
"I love this as much as Sculpin, if not more, due to my overindulgent love of grapefruit flavors. If you were to put a grapefruit and spoon in front of me, well... you could probably make a great viral vid of me consuming both halves of that grapefruit within the space of two minutes TOPS."
From a growler in a nonic pint glass.
If you have not had this beer you suck. Get your shit together and let the grapefruit IPA fairies dance upon your pallet.
"No idea as to the bottling date, it just has some code stamped on it. Hopefully not too old."
Appearance - The beer poured a golden copper color with a nice white head 
12oz. bottle into OEC stemware. 
"The perfect hot day beer. Smell is all grapefruit, taste is all grapefruit (with some sculpin) and it all goes down incredibly smooth. Try to get this guy within 2 months and I guarantee you won't be dissapointed. Really is one of the best beers ever."
Not a bad beer. But to me the grapefruit was overbearing. I think I'll pass on trying this one again.
"As the name says, it's the classic Sculpin with grapefruit. A very nice citrus aftertaste and aroma."
Outstanding Awesome Great Fantastic Incredible
"Grapefruit Sculpin was, for the longest time, only something I heard about through friends in the know, and lucky enough to enjoy it, whether out of bottle or on tap. I never even thought that I would have a chance to enjoy it... and boy, was I wrong! It would seem that the hype surrounding this beer has made it easier to find around here (in the middle of middle of nowhere Illinois) at some local shops. The minute I saw a 6 pack of it sitting in a cooler, I grabbed it without hesitation. Worth every penny, and I'll tell you why."
"Hops on the front, grapefruit finish...what's not to like? The grapefruit complements the beer, playing nicely with the hops that make Sculpin one of my favorites in this style."
LOOK: Amber gold and very clarified. Not all that much head retention. (Barely a finger's worth.)
This is becoming my favorite IPA
The flavor is way off for me. More of a strong grapefruit peel flavor rather than grapefruit itself. It was a big miss for me.
Good beer. Very strong grapefruit finish. Really enjoyed it.
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tumbler glass. The bottle is about two months old.
"Grapefruit Sculpin pours a brilliant copper-gold, with a healthy head as white as snow. Carbonation is moderately strong, and the head retention is excellent, displaying laced remnants of froth as the beer goes down. Absolutely incredible zesty citrus flavors come off the brew after a tentative breath. Quite literally smells like a thirst quenching grapefruit-orange breakfast juice, with some resinous hop elements hiding beneath the surface. A slight whiff of malty booze as well. Certainly seems like my kind of beverage! On to the tasting! Wow, I have to say, this really exceeds my high expectations based on the aroma. I can't believe how natural and fresh the juice aspect is, and how beautifully it is married to the resinous hop flavor. It's not unlike Hopslam actually, in its unique recipe and success in pulling it off. The finish has a nice bitterness to it, that is somewhat harsh and tart. Perfect. The feel of it is nice and light, almost like how you imagine juice to go down really, however, after a full gulp goes down, some warming makes you aware that it is indeed alcohol. Overall, this is sincerely a must try, not some novelty or anything of the sort. I need more!"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Purchased in North Providence, RI. "
"Pours a light golden amber with big billowing head. Aroma is a fresh cut grapefruit, sweet honeydew, bright floral hops. The smell is flat out amazing. Taste is very light and refreshing from the start. Not overly bitter but rather sweet to an extent. Notes of grapefruit (obviously), clean and refined hop resin, melon, with only a light bitter after taste. A very clean and fresh feeling IPA that I could drink all day on a hot summer afternoon. Outstanding. Feels like a session IPA despite being 7% abv. I only wish Ballast Point made this year round."
"Not many aspects of this beer that could be improved. The initial taste of this beer is so incredibly juicy it's seriously one of a kind. A must have. A step up from the original Sculpin, if that's possible."
I've been a stout/porter/sour drinker for a while now and tend to avoid IPA's. But this beer has renewed my faith. Excellent brew. Probably one of the best I've ever had.
A - Nice amber/golden orange color. Nice foamy head with good lacing throughout.
Wow...just awesome...so smooth and refreshing
"Nearly flawless appearance for an IPA. Big billowing white head with fantastic retention, sheets of lace over an orange amber beer. "
"Really surprised I liked an IPA as much as I did, but this is almost like grapefruit juice with a few fresh hops added. Crisp and refreshing."
"Brilliant light orange hue with a clean big white frothy head. The aroma is hops all the way, but in addition to the pleasant bouquet of resin, citrus and some grapefruit, this is abundant with grapefruit."
I've been waiting awhile to grab this beer! So glad I was finally able to land it! It really is grapefruit in a bottle! I highly recommend this beer!! :)
"12oz bottle, freshness date is difficult to read, but it was fresh on the shelves recently"
"I much prefer the original. Smells great but there is distinct difference between hop citrus and actual grapefruit juice. This tastes more like the latter. Still good but a bit more watered down, less hop flavor and resin."
"i should come right out and say that i prefer the regular sculpin to this one, it just doesnt need that fruit to make it interesting, refreshing, and memorable. that said, i love this edition of it. still crystal clear orangey in color with a bubbly lacy white head with superb retention. the fruit is so authentic, not sweet and sugary and concentrated like some of the shandy to hit the market recently, but true to the fruit, like the fresh juice of it, and it marries up excellently with the hop complexion of the base ipa, which has a lot of bitter citrus to it. the malt here i have always liked, honey malt seemingly, moderately sweet, lighter than medium bodied, but flavorful and fresh without getting into that caramel and darker crystal malt spectrum. it fits the hop profile brilliantly. i am surprised more acid isnt present from the fruit, but the acidity feels about the same as the base beer. cool accent flavor, as its real refreshing and not overly done. it also was one of the first ipa styles i have had my girlfriends parents actually like, so this was a hit in a number of crowds for us. my only critique really is that i cant buy this on the regular. nice brew, best use of grapefruit i have seen in an ipa, but i will take a sixer of regular sculpin still."
Very well executed. Much better than a typical shandy or radler.
"poured 12oz bottle into snifter. Bottled 3/4/15, so less than 2 weeks old. "
This was a let down. It was a little flat and watery. Hops were gone. Its clearly faded. I got this as an extra in a trade and I don't think it was fresh. It can't be that old because I don't think the beer came out that long ago. Wish there was a date on the bottle.
"Saw these beauties at the local packie and thought it was too good to pass up, as I had never seen nor heard about them before. No bottling date but tasted very fresh. Poured into an oversized wine glass left a nice two-finger biscuity head with a medium toned orange-reddish body that is completely translucent."
Had on tap at The Salty Pig
Look: Grapefruit Sculpin IPA had a medium amount of foam towards the top.
"Awesome beer. Prefer over the normal sculpin, although it is hard to find."
"A: Pristine deep tarnished orange, one finger, bready textured white head. Absolutely no carbonation from a tap pour. Multiple stratified ring lacing down the vessel."
"Full disclosure: Avid fan of the traditional Sculpin, and was highly doubtful you could improve upon that beer. All things considered, though, this variation manages to be incredibly excellent while also not taking away from the original. The grapefruit finish is not overbearing and complements (instead of taking over) the flavor profile that's already there. Instead of being ""Sculpin with some grapefruit,"" it's its own standalone beer. Too excellent and among the more interesting variations around."
This is quite possibly the most refreshing beer I have ever had. The way the citrus and hops come together is perfect.
12 oz. bottle poured into a Sam Adams Perfect pint glass. Amber orange in color with perfect clarity. At first there's an off white to creamcicle colored head with mostly small bubbles. Medium amount of lacing and glass retention. Good looking beer.
"Bottled on Jan 29, 2015. Poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
Bought a single at World Market in Round Rock. Love it when those guys do the 25% of build a sixer.
Very grapefruit. First taste was best.
Hope it's not too old. 
"Had this out of a bottle the other night up at the Cloverleaf, expecting this to not quite be like the original Sculpin IPA. What amazed me was that this turned out to be *better* than that, from the appearance all the way on down to the mouthfeel, flavor, and aftertaste. This was a doozy when it came to the grapefruit and how it enhanced but if a slow-sipping, mildly potent IPA is what you're looking for, this would be one of the best choices currently available!"
Pours a slightly murky orange color with a small white foam head. Recedes quickly. Leaves a small ring of lacing around the edge.
Delicious grapefruit and hops blend! Very refreshing with its grapefruit finish.
"A very good beer, but prefer the regular Sculpin IPA. Slightly sour grapefruit taste."
"World class, if you can, drink this, hoard this..."
2015-03-11
Finally found this up in Chico as my local East Bay spots can't seem to get it. Whatever.
Thanks to Orthodoxkardia for this one.
"Pours a nice clear tangerine with !a fluffy white head, nice lacing"
Not a bad beer. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass:
Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass:
"Nice variant of the original sculpin. I was concerned this would be close to a radler sweetness, but no just the original Sculpin with a grapefruit nose and bitter aftertaste (no additional sweetness)."
This is far worse than regular sculpin
Amazing! Aroma and taste had heightened grapefruit as I was hoping.
"Overall, a classic example of the sculpin ipa line. Good smell and appearance, but the flavor just doesn't keep up. I am not sure what I am missing here, but I expected more intense flavor from this."
"The fresh aroma of grapefruit peel remains assertive when tasted, though it leaves room for the IPA's hops blend to support it. Great malt balance. This beer would do well in flights, as I wanted a different style after having two of these."
Grapefruit there but still has the hop present of scuplin
The taste of this beer just doesn't do it for me. Kinda reminds me of sprite and soap. Regular sculpin is much better.
I really liked this beer. Had in bottle and I will buy again for sure
"Great beer. Just wish they would tone down the grapefruit a little, because it's all you can taste after a while."
Ballast Point Brewery - Grapefruit Sculpin IPA. American IPA (7%) . Ballast Point Brewing Company . Rated 97/100 on Beer Advocate 
Look- Deep amber color with slight red/orange tint. 
12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.
I've heard alot about the sculpin so when i came across the grapefruit sculpin i jumped to it.
"A - Ever-so-slight haze to the golden body. Large white head, fades quickly and leaves moderate lacing. "
Smell was amazing. First thing to really say about this beer. Didn't know I believed in the hype but boy I was wrong. An absolute perfectly balanced beer. Me being not a big fan of grapefruit I enjoyed ever last sip of it. Most grapefruit ipa are either way to bitter or taste to much like a hopped up shandy. But this beer is fantastic. Highly recommend
"Bottled Feb 27 ....... 9 days old.. Straight Grapefruit once you let this beer warm up a little, Amazing..... the 7% isn't present... its all hops/grapefruit with a nice medium carbonation and medium/low malt presence, in VA its 16.99 for a 6-pack steep but I would purchase this year long if made available............. BALLAST POINT GET ON IT!!!!!!!!"
"12oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer is yellow gold and crystal clear, with a healthy white head. Aroma is, despite the ample warning on the label, surprisingly grapefruity. Ruby red grapefruit zest, a morning glass of grapefruit juice. Flavor is directly inline, too. Tastes exactly like grapefruit juice. I wonder if they turned down the hops for this variety -- regular Sculpin is quite hoppy, and while the flavors match well, I have a hard time imagining the fruit flavor here holding up to the original's raw bitterness."
Serving: Bottle into snifter
Similar as the original Sculpin IPA but with more grapefruit (and bitter). Delicious but I'm satisfied with the original.
"Deep orange color with a big white head and tons of sticky lacing. Aroma is a wallop of grapefruit right to the olfactory. I mean it's deep with grapefruit aromas. Some light sweetness from the malt but the aromas are a bit one dimensional. Taste is much the same with a big citrusy grapefruit profile. Juicy grapefruit pulp, rind and pith with a touch of sweetness. Prickly up front carbonation carries through a bitter and semi dry finish. If I think of this as an IPA I appreciate it less as I feel the flavor comes from flavors not added by the hops. If I don't think about that I think it's pretty good at what it sets out to do."
Wow this is better than the normal sculpin. This is everything great about a WIPA. Subtle notes of grapefruit really mellow out the alcohol and compliment the backbone. Just a beautiful IPA. My favorite from them. 5/5 for me.
"There's been a lot of hype in the beer community about this one, and I've gotta say, I don't really get it. It's a fine tasting IPA - citrusy, but I'm not getting a ton of grapefruit. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer, but a rating of 96 needs to offer something a little bit more unique. Wasn't blown away by this one."
"Acquisition: Canal Liquors, Pennsauken, NJ "
The only caution is that your taste buds will be a bit overloaded after this one. Best not make it your first beer of the night.
Almost as good and sculpin. The grapefruit adds a very nice citrus flavor and odor.
"Wave of cloying fruit, but dominated by dry citric acid like biting into a grapefruit peel"
Pretty good but a tad artificial tasting. Great smell for sure. Could not drink more than one or two.
"The smell of the beer is amazing, loads of grapefruits and citrus."
"Great great great beer, not much else has to be said!"
12oz bottle poured into an IPA glass.
I guess I'm just not that much into grapefruit in my IPA's. Solid beer though.
"Super grapefruit taste, like biting into a grapefruit. This resembles a session beer with a higher, hidden ABV. In the end, this beer is refreshing for a summer day but relaxing at home...give me a less sweet, more hopped up IPA."
"Clear golden amber in color with white head. If a friend blindfolded me and then held this beer up to my nose, I would tell him to cut me a piece of that grapefruit. What a great smell for a beer! Since a lot of hop varieties already produce grapefruit-y aromas naturally, I would consider the use of actual grapefruit in the brewing process to be a bit adulterous, but in this instance, I don't give a %#%^. This is too delicious and enjoyable. I consider standard sculpin' to be the bee's knees but from now on, if available, 10/10, I'm going for the grapefruit."
"I knew that it was gonna be good, but I honestly have to say that this is the absolute best beer that I've ever randomly picked up without actively seeking it out."
Bottle dated early 2015:
I'll bet this beer is a 5 in the middle of a golf course in July
Look: Beer has near perfect clarity with an amber color.
"So excited to finally try it, as Sculpin is my favorite IPA."
Exceptional beer.. A must try for an IPA lover
"12 oz bottle, w/o any freshness indication that I can find."
12oz bottle sealed with pressure cap.
I don't want this thing to end. Ever.
This is fantastic. This is Sculpin taken up a few. The juicy grapefruit hits you from the get go and sticks with you to the bitter end.
Crystal clear and deep orange body. Minimal head and no lacing. 
"This is one of my favorite IPAs, much better than standard Sculpin and waaayyy better than the Habenero version"
"A: A nice bronze orange color, with a nice two finger off white head at the top, left a nice lacing around the glass as you drank it. "
"I may be one of the only people who absolutely hated this beer. All about the taste, it is just too overwhelming of grapefruit floral taste. Seems perfumy in taste. Mouthfeel and look are nice like regular sculpin and the grapefruit smell us nice. Could use more citrus and tart taste from the grapefruit and less fruit/floral."
Poured from a 12 bottle into a tapered glass. 
Outstanding fruit beer. The Grapefruit was up-front and in your face. Excellent for a change of pace from ordinary IPA's.
12 oz bottle was poured into a pint glass. 
Look: A nice light golden color with a short white head that leaves some lacing
"I wanted to like this more, but lets be honest here, it is Sculplin with grapefruit added...I love love love Sculpin, and Sculpin with grapefruit is nice. And as much as I enjoyed it, I almost felt like I was dupped. Kind of like when Tide went to 'special ultra fantastic' tide with added specialness...It was probably still Tide, but marketing and packaging wanted to make a case for a change that I was not convinced was there. Is this a good beer, yes, will I be disappointed when they discontinue it and just stick to Sculpin, not completely. Try and it and see."
"Ugh, why am I not totally wild about this beer? Pours a nice copper color, lacing was pretty but the head was a little light. The flavor is definitely grapefruit forward and it had a hoppy kick in the end. I tried to picture myself sipping this down the shore vs in the midst of another snowstorm, it helped. Cheers."
Impressed! Liked it better then the original sculpin. This is my go to drink since it readily available in my area.
"Clear golden orange color with a white head and thick lacing. Grapefruit and fresh cut grass dominate the aroma. Lighter taste than the aroma suggests, with grapefruit up front, hop bitterness at the end, and a not much of a backbone. It's good, but there are plenty of other IPAs out there that profile specific flavors just as well or better."
I wish there was a bit more grapefruit flavor. It mixed in too well with the hops.
From 12 oz bottle. 
"Great beer, nice change to a great ipa!"
"Purchased a 64oz growler from Whole Foods. Pours a nice copper-orange with a velvety head. The smell is heavy fresh grapefruit. It's incredible. Taste is more of that delicious grapefruit juice and all the normal awesomeness of Sculpin. This is liquid heaven. So very glad I was able to get this and will go after it again. Excellent job, Ballast Point!"
"If you like Grapefruit, you're gonna love this brew! I'm really glad it has been added to Ballast Points roster in GA."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with white head. Grapefruit, lemon, pine, and some coriander on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a nice resinous hop bite."
"Fantastic aroma, a bit too bitter for my liking"
Solid ipa for the person who is new to ipa's or seasoned its a good starter beer for the night not a aggressive hop profile but a tasty beer!
This must be the third of fourth time around for me on this beer. Two times it was rather great and one time it fell a bit flat but I think the keg was getting older. Bottled in early February.
Bought from the Richmond Bottle Shop. Poured into a tall tulip glass.
I was looking for citrus (grapefruit) can't get past the piney hops.
"Just had Pliny last night for the first time now Grapefruit Sculpin for the first time and I have to say aside from appearance, Grapefruit Sculpin has the upper hand. The flavor profile just dominates. Delicious."
"A perfect IPA. The original is amazing, but they have improved upon perfection. Bringing in actual grapefruit to accentuate the already, over the top, hop aroma is genius. What is left to be said? Amazing orange, slightly hazy appearance. Smell is malt and uhhhh, grapefruit! Taste is a sweet and bitter grapefruit hop bomb with a solid malt backbone. Some piney notes as well. Perfect mouthfeel. Very chewy and full. It's a perfect IPA in my opinion."
12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. I like grapefruits so this beer was great. Aroma and taste is all grapefruit. Sculpin is already a great IPA so varieties are just as good.
12oz bottle poured into pint glass
Enjoyed on tap at the Dive in Worcester. Poured into a standard pint glass.
12 oz bottle into a teku.
"Wow, very impressed. Best west coaster I've had to date. Really enjoy this. Fruit forward, tons of citrus and a remarkable nose on it. Incredibly easy to crush too"
"Citrus aside, a very grassy hop flavor."
I don't even think actual grapefruit juice smells this much like grapefruits. It's incredible.
"Delicious, easily the most juicy, citrusy ipa I've had."
Clear deep deep golden body with a smattering of white head. 
On tap at the bier stein the other day.
"Love fresh sculpin, the grapefruit flavor (lots in aftertaste) did not make this better, stick to the original"
"Bottle. Went down ok, but tasted like someone took a regular Sculpin and squirted grapefruit Mio into it or something. Grapefruit flavor did not taste natural. Still not a bad beer for a hot summer day."
"This brew just took an already excellent beer and made it that much better. The Grapefruit Sculpin has such an enjoyable freshness to it, a great IPA to trick in the sun while doing yard work, or practicing your shot"
Very good grapefruit ipa. Well worth a try. If your into that thing
Awesome twist on an excellent brew. The grapefruit and hops work so well together.
"Light yellow orange body. Huge grapefruit aroma. Smells basically like grapefruit juice. Really tasty. Lots of citrus taste, which is to be expected. Reminds me of a very good Radler style beer."
"Pleasant surprise At the end- a great twist on sculpin, very refreshing"
Ballast Point recently started distribution to Wisconsin and I am slowly but surely becoming a big fan of their beers.
Excellent! Sculpin kicked up a notch
I really taste the grapefruit omg
"Bottle. Grapefruit Sculpin is clear, brig orange with a fluffy, bountiful head. Plenty of lacing. A powerful grapefruit aroma. Not just grapefruity hops, more grapefruit juice. Almost too grapefruity for me to believe it's not artificially flavored. Also smells slightly bready. If I smelled this without knowing what it was, I would not think it was Sculpin. Flavor is also dominated by grapefruit juice. I think regular Sculpin is very tropical fruit hoppy. This is not much like it. Grapefruit juice with grapefruit hops solely. I can tell the hops are citru buying to the flavor because the finish is very bitter. The lightest malt profile. Bitter finish. Medium bodied. Crisp carbonation. Not much like the OG original Hopfish. I'm skeptical because I feel as though this brew is using artificial flavoring for such a concentrated grapefruit flavor. Regardless, it's pretty yummy."
Damn near perfect beer. Huge citrus and floral notes. An all day and warm weather beer for sure. I would love to see this in a double or imperial IPA format.
Good beer. Way too much carbonation but otherwise pretty good.
"lovin the addition of grapefruit. not overpowering like the habanero, works will with the hops"
"The reviews confuse me. Some people don't get much grapefruit while others say it smacks you in the face. I'm in the second group. The smell and taste are all grapefruit. Now, this is what I asked for with this beer and that's what it delivers! I've never gotten grapefruit taste from other IPAs, just the general citrus flavor. This one is pure grapefruit juice!"
"Very delicious. Enjoyed in a speigelau ipa glass. Grapefruit isn't immediately obvious, it blends in with the hop flavors very well."
Well balanced and great flavor. Some bottles have more or less grapefruit flavors though. Love this one
"Reminds me of Fresca with a nice malt backbone, would crush this on a summer day.. Cans soon ?"
"if you mixed a bottle of this and a bottle of the regular sculpin together you would have a great beer! lol. too much grapefruit in this one for me, overpowering and taking away from the original"
Great beer just it really accentuates everything I like about sculpin. The citrus notes really stand out and I can't believe it but actually make this beer even better
"Needs more IBUs and slightly less grapefruit. The grapefruit was very dominant, which alters this beer from IPA to Fruit Beer status. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the acidic tang the grapefruit provides. The taste of grapefruit is very evident when served cold and poured slowly into a glass, as to conserve carbonation, which helps to carry the aroma. "
"L - At the pour it looks good. White head, good lacing. Very clear body."
First sip.. Wtf! Excellent play of grapefruit and classic west coast ipa. Amazing beer.
"Are you kidding me ? This beer is unbelievable. As in unbelievably, ridiculously fantastic !!! If you love IPA's and the more citrusy the better then you will have hit the jackpot with this one. Thank you so much Ballast Point !"
Strong grapefruit smell. Solid IPA. Found at Flying Saucers.
"Nice golden-orange color with awesome head and lacing that clings and holds on for dear life. Had this last night and I was not disappointed. This beer is so grapefruit forward that it is insane. The malt, hops and citrus come together so well, one of my all-time favorites !!"
Wow.
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a crystal clear, bright, vibrant, orange-gold coloring with a foamy, clingy, off-white head that slowly recedes into a surface coating, leaving a decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of tart and sweet grapefruit all over the nose, with a backbone of subtle cracker, and a bold ribbon of hops resin. Very inviting for a hophead. Flavors are very balanced, with a tart and sweet grapefruit character forward, with some more subtle citrus notes blending in the background, all on a roasted caramel and cracker backbone. The hops characteristics come through towards the end of the palate, with a sticky bitterness of pine pitch, moss, and cut grass. Very balanced, all on a smooth, lightly effervesced body. The aftertaste is much more hop heavy, with the resinous notes really taking the main stage, and the grapefruit stepping back into a supporting role. The finish is dry and sticky with the lingering hops dankness. This is a truly fantastic beer!"
"If you like grapefruit then you will like this. Almost covers all other hops, but the rind taste is fresh fresh."
A - Golden clear; almost light beer looking
Huge citrus / grapefruit on nose (as expected). Hops are a bit muddled under all the grapefruit but still there
12oz bottle into SN hop glass. 
"12 oz bottle. Just delivered to my store today. Bitter and hoppy citrus. There is a nice grapefruit citrus that isn’t there initially but builds. I’m most impressed by the fact that the grapefruit doesn’t seem to be added, the bitter citrus is definitely there, but is so well blended with the hops that I wouldn’t have thought it was added."
Very similar to regular Sculpin with just a touch of grapefruit to compliment.
12 FL. OZ. bottle
This is an extremely delicious and interesting beer. If you like grapefruit (I love it) you can't go wrong.
"slightly hazy and bright amber, small head. nose; grapefruit rind, zest and oil, along with strong floral hops - no punches pulled here. taste; immediate grapefruit citrus and bitter piney hops, with spicy garlic, light caramel and mango showing in the middle, then finally more mango and grapefruit/lemon pith on the aftertaste. medium sweet malt and mouthfeel, and good carbonation. it's no secret what ballast point is attempting here with the name on the can - while the habanero sculpin was way overboard, this one manages to not be overdone. now, bring on that mango sculpin that you don't let escape your brewery just yet!"
Appearance: Crystal clear orange with a one finger head and good lacing.
Perfect marriage of bitter citrus and citrusy hops
"This is like sculpin on steroids. The sculpin is a bit muted while grapefruit is thrust to the forefront. It has large ruby red grapefruit goodness. It has a rich flavor of fleshy grapefruit without being too bitter or sweet. At times the big flavor is a bit obnoxious, but it is definitely delicious."
Amazing beer. Hard pressed to name one better.
Amazing nose smelled of floral citrus. The taste was spectacular and really numbed the tongue like a true IPA on the finish.
"Looks like grapefruit juice in color, smells like grapefruit and most importantly tastes like grapefruit with mild carbonation. Totally excellent!! 4.5/5"
A: Poured from the bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Body is clear dark golden with a half-finger whitish head. Nice presentation of rising bubbles. Collar of lace on the glass up top.
"A really delicious ipa. A little surprised of the super high scores it's getting. Seems to have an artificial grapefruit flavor going on. Honestly, it reminds me of Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. Like if they hopped up Sunset Wheat or something. I like both beers really."
"The beer pours a clear light golden amber with a loose white head. The nose is straight grapefruit candy, we're talking izze grapefruit soda level of grapefruit penetration. However, the taste brings in more grain flavor and a bitter hoppy bite to balance out the grapefruit soda-like sweetness. This is very drinkable, raddler-on-steriods kind of, but well carbonated and has a modest bitterness. I definitely enjoyed this more than expected, kinda sad that I passed on it so many times previously."
Poured into my Duvel glass. Little head despite aggressive pour (1 finger that dissipates quickly).
1820th Review on BA
"After being disappointed with the regular Sculpin IPA I was wondering if maybe I bought an old bottle that wasn't fresh. I heard this is a beer that you want to drink fresh. I just recently received this Grapefruit version in a trade and I'm definitely impressed. The smell is pure ruby red grapefruit and the taste is the perfect complement of grapefruit and citrusy, piney hops. The malt backbone that seemed to be missing when I had the regular sculpin has appeared enough not to make this beer a hop bomb. I would definitely want to buy more of this beer and would like to try a regular Sculpin again to see if I was missing something."
I've been trying to get my hands on this for AWHILE now and was worried I would be let down considering the hype I had built up in my own mind behind it. I was WRONG! This beer is amazing. The aroma is fantastic. Nice citrusy finish but not overly so. Perfect balance. And mine was bottled 5 weeks ago. I can only imagine how it tastes super fresh. Highly recommended.
"I maybe be one of the few people that don't like Ballast Point IPA. I mean I really don't like it at all!! It took me a looooong time to try this beer, just because I don't care for Ballast Point IPA. But this Grapefruit Sculpin is freaken fantastic!!! I love it!!"
"12oz bottle poured into 16oz Odell's snifter, no visible date code on the bottle, I assume it's fresh, just arrived in the area."
Everything about this beer works.
"On tap at Al’s of Hampden. Pour is transparent golden yellow with a bubbly off white head. Nose has a fair bit of lemon pledge, faint grapefruit, a touch of soapy hop. Taste follows suit, tons of lemon pledge, very light bitterness, grapefruit tones in the finish. Bitterness picks up through the finish. Light bodied, moderate carb."
"Unsure of bottle date, assumed to be pretty fresh | 12 oz Bottle | Good Dog Bar, Philly"
Great beer that is widely distributed and easy to get. Super tropical and very juicy. The only thing wrong with this beer is the price point. I don't buy it often because of that.
Good beer for hot weather
The beer comes in a dark amber orange.
Like cutting into a fresh grapefruit
"Huge grapefruit on the nose. Taste is more subtle with the grapefruit on the finish. Still give the edge to the regular Sculpin over this one, but not by much."
"Totally exceptional. Grabbed a sizer from bottleworks in seattle last week. Poured into my spiegleau glass. The aroma here is unbelievable. Gold, and orange in color with a light head. The flavor good be a little more bold but very good still. Grab some if you this. Yum!"
"Interesting twist on Sculpin. Strong grapefruit aroma. Not as much grapefruit in the taste as I had hoped for, but certainly present. Solid beer."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, slightly rusty, golden orange color with very lively carbonation that doesn't retain very well."
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a chalice. 
beautiful in balance...aromatic...fruity and hoppy....perfection in flow from nose to tongue....
Thick head with pretty good retention.
Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint.
"The grapefruit takes an already amazing IPA to a whole other level of sweet, citrus goodness."
The nose on this thing is incredible.
"Picked up at the COOP and B30 tonight... pretty similar pricing, but the COOP is a little bit less. Poured into my standard tulip.. Clear pale orange with a good enough white head, no real lacing. Nose is grapefruit zest and nice hoppy backbone IPA.. With the flavor, the grapefruit zest oil really mows down everything else (not a bad thing, just an observation).. Very zest forward, but not really ""pithy"".. Not nearly as ""bitter grapefruit"" as I expected. Light body for the ABV.. Good bubble, but seems a bit oily... Surprisingly drinkable for a midwinter evening, this would be miles better in a hot Boise summer."
I'm editing my review since I am soooo lucky to have this on tap at home right now. I've not even tried this until recently which was via bottle about 3 weeks ago at a bar. Now I sit here and know I have a small keg of it. Incredible. This review is from my tap.
As described. Grapefruit hop bomb. Admittedly I'm not a big sculpin fan. Or grapefruit for that matter. What was I thinking?!
12oz bottle poured into a Ballast Point Victory at Sea snifter.
"The perfect summertime beer, too bad it's February right now."
A great IPA in it's base Sculpin format. The grapefruit version is definitely a treat but not something I would search for.
Grapefruit. Love the grapefruit. Love the Sculpin. This is really well done.
Smells just like ruby red grapefruit juice. My bottle seemed under carbonated.grapefruit overshadows the IPA taste. It's ok but not something I'd grab if I was in the mood for a BEER.
"Drank it fresh within just a few weeks of being bottled. It's super refreshing, a dry finish with plenty of bite. If you like the taste of grapefruit, this is a choice beer. If not, maybe still worth a try. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers. Great summer beer if you like IPAs because it's not as malty or heavy."
"If you're like me and pull this app up while standing IN a liquor store trying to figure out what to buy, buy this beer! Grapefruit citrus dominates throughout, but also a gentle sweetness and a delicious malty dryness. Oh and hops, to lesser extent. This will definitely be my summer go to beer."
"Classic West Coast IPA look due to a clear, pale amber body and small, one finger thick, head. The smell was very clearly highly laden with grapefruit, and the citrus just dominated the nose. There were also hints of pine in the background of the smell. The taste had citric, sour, and tart grapefruit flavors up front and center, with a hop bitterness providing a second potent punch. Some sweet hard candy sugar poking through here and there. Medium thin and slippery on the palette, this beer was easy to drink. Alcohol was completely hidden, and the beer was very quenching. I was thinking this was going to be just a regular IPA with hint of grapefruit, but this was so much more."
"sculpin with a persistent grapefruit rind finish, which anchors the whole product brilliantly."
"I gotta admit I was excited for this, but I hear a lot of mixed reviews, some saying it's awesome, some saying it's too much grapefruit and not enough beer, but we'll see."
"If you are looking for sculpin with a hint of grapefruit then you might be displeased. This almost isn't even a beer halfway through the glass I say, it turned into straight grapefruit juice with maybe a hint of hop bite if any, very subtle. The aroma is amazing. I prefer the regular to this but it is tasty if you want grapefruit juice and not a beer."
Pours a bright coppery color with a bright beige head sitting on top.
Regular is solid and is with grapefruit as well worth a try
"Was nervous Ballast Point was fiddling with a VERY GOOD thing, but the extra hint and tartness of the grapefruit really works well. Still an outstanding beer."
"Wow, what an eccentric beer, in a good way! You need to be a grapefruit fan to enjoy it, however. The grapefruit flavor is perfectly strong. It leaves an aftertaste that tastes like grapefruit peel. But it works! Leaves very little lacing on glass. The smell is wonderfully, well, ""grapefruity"". There seems to be a theme here..."
"Poured a dull brass with a thinner white head atop.Obviously grapefruit in the nose but not overly sharp,some toasted grain is there as well.Not overly bitter and/or sharp on the palate just fresh and juicy frutiness from the grapefruit with a surprising toasted bready malty base.Love this beer,again not overly bitter but fresh and very drinkable for the size."
Wow. Fresh grapefruit aroma and taste with slight sweetness at the end.
"A great summer beer, this is an IPA you can quaff on a hot day."
"Drank from a 12 fl.oz.-355ml bottle purchased at Pemberton Market, Cambridge, MA"
Wow! The taste is the least bit bitter. The citrus makes a great taste. Best IPA hands down!
"sculpin with a straight grapefruit juice, too much candied grapefruit for me, tastes a little artificial. Would be nice on a hot sunny day, but I'll stick with the regular sculpin."
Solid beer from a solid brewery.
Bottle poured into a BarrelHouse Brewing Co pint glass
12 oz bottle served chilled into a shaker pint glass.
"Generously grapefruitted. Mine was bottled 1/15/15, poured into a pint glass 1/26/15, and thoroughly enjoyed. I suspect some of the reviewers complaining about lack of hops did not have this fresh, because the grapefruit & hops were beautifully balanced & neither one eclipsed the other."
12 oz bottle poured into a shaker pint.
"A bit of pine and an amazing citrus aroma. They improved on Sculpin, which was already one of my favorite IPAs."
Amazing fruit taste! Very well done.
Brewed in the style of an American India Pale Ale. Released in 12 oz.bottles and on limited draft.
Grapefruit in this beer is very potent... Solid beer..
12 oz bottle pour. Great lacing and retention sticking to glass. Smells of fresh ruby red grapefruit and hops. Taste the bitter hop and citrusy grapefruit marrying together nicely! Delicious! I want more!
"Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a clear glass tulip. No obvious freshness date. Purchased as a 2 bottle allotment at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA). "
"Looks great, smells great...that's about it. I've tried the Sculpins many times, draught, cans, bottles...I don't understand the ratings. Overly bitter and one dimensional, not much going on. Maybe it's better super fresh out in San Diego, but this isn't even close to as good as the best IPA's out there, never mind beyond outstanding."
"I love the regular Sculpin so when I saw the Grapefruit Sculpin, I had the buy a six pack. I'm glad I did, as this is delicious. A must try for the IPA fans who also enjoy the taste of grapefruit. I poured this into a Belgian Tulip glass for review. Small white head with generous sticky lacing. The aroma is outstanding. Initial blast of sweet grapefruit, followed by citrus hops. Great blend of grapefruit with a classic west coast IPA. Another well done beer by Ballast Point..."
It's just damn tasty stuff. Grapefruit is forward but not to the point of being gimmicky. Beautifully blended with the rest of the beer. Highly recommended!
12oz into a tulip. Pours a clear coppery color w/ a frothy white head.
The beer pours a nice white head that borders between foamy and creamy. The beer leaves a nice helping of lacing on the glass. The beer itself is a clear deep gold and looks very nice.
Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass.
"Spectacular IPA, perfect combo of grapefruit and grapefruit tasting hops. Taste buds will confused by two. And it still has the San Diego feel too. I've done a similar one myself, and this is exactly how I wanted it to be."
A quality IPA that I wasn't expecting
Great beer. IPA with s twist.
"I assume you've had sculpin. You know about its delicious fruit nodes and medium bitterness. You might have hesitated, then, to see its near-perfect flavor profile tweaked with the addition of astringent grapefruit. I hesitated, at least."
"Huge grapefruit juice, light bitterness, tangerine, light sweetness, pine"
"Really refreshing and surprising American IPA. Upon you first taste you get a strong citrus grapefruit taste that seems like it could carry through, but it blends and finishes with a crisp hop flavor at the end. Overall excellent beer."
Had this as part of a side-by-side with a regular Sculpin.
"Hazier than the original, with the same pale orange colour and a tinge of pink."
Poured 12oz bottle into snifter. 7% abv.
"Pours clear light amber, mostly golden in color with a good frothy white head that has great retention. Smell is dominated by fresh crisp aromas of grapefruit. More citrus, apricot and peach notes meld with the dominate grapefruit for a fruit bomb if a nose. Taste has a good hop flavor of reminicant of apriocots, blood orange and semi sweet grapefruit work nicely with a moderate sweetness light bitterness and dry pith feel to create an all around nicely balanced fruity ipa."
holy grapefruit batman! Sculpin wins again
"I can't decide whether I like this more or less than regular Sculpin, but it's a nice twist. The grapefruit isn't too prominent, and just lends a little fruity acid zest to the beer. Perhaps a little more refreshing than Sculpin, not quite as good from a pure hoppy perspective? Either way, if you like regular Sculpin, I highly recommend giving this a shot; compulsively drinkable."
"I love grapefruit and thought that the natural flavors would compliment Sculpin's hop profile nicely. For some reason this doesn't quite work for me. The grapefruit comes across as overly sweet and a bit artificial. Not bad, but not as good as I was expecting."
"I didn't think they could improve on Sculpin but they did...this stuff is fantastic! It is definitely a grapefruit forward IPA so to those who rated this poorly based on the fact that they don't like grapefruit...well, then...don't buy a Grapefruit IPA...pretty simple"
"Like candied grapefruit Sculpin, this is amazing. I would drink this 9 times out of 10 over regular Sculpin, and I love that too. Halfway between copper & orange with a gigantic off-white fizzy head, and nice lacing to follow. Nose is dominated by the candied grapefruit, but there are other tropical fruits back there too. Amazingly fruity flavor profile, more of that juicy, candied grapefruit on top of the Sculpin we all know & love. Not as aggressively-hopped, but very much in balance. Lip-smacking good."
NBS BIF #1 huge thanks to @2beerdogs
"Active long after the pour, this brew is crystal clear orange. All citrus in the nose and the taste follows the same theme. Grapefruit is unmistakable, mostly in the backend, which is suprisingly crisp. Heavier carbonation than my liking. "
12 0z very fresh bottle 
"This beer is hard to rate as Sculpin is such a great beer - but I can't justify a high rating based on that. Bottom line is I want to taste and smell grapefruit from the hops, not from an infusion of grapefruit - it's kinda like ""too much of a good thing is not good at all"". Based on the ratings, I'm a minority, but so be it. This one did not work for me - it did not taste artificial and it did not taste bad; it tasted like a fresh mixing of Sculpin with a solid shot of unsweetened grapefruit - it resembled a ""Shandy gone wild"" - and Shandies suck in my opinion. While I'm sure my overall take on this beer is dragging down the ""look, smell, etc."" ratings, I'm OK with that as a 2.75 taste rating for something I really didn't like is overly generous."
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass. 
"Big Sculpin fan but have not had yet in 2015. Picked up 3 bottles of Sculpin reg, grapefruit and jalapeño. Will be interesting to try all 3, but orig is very good. Will try not to be influenced by previous but I think that will be hard to do... Started with gf and it absolutely is (grapefruit) from start to finish. Aroma is nice and strong gf but more sweet and florally than bitter. Big foam that quickly settled to a good layer. Seems easier drinking than the reg Sculpin, milder hops that allows the gf flavor to come through. Obvious well made beer like a 2 hearted, super smooth bringing out the intended flavor(s). The aroma remains strong while drinking, as I was drinking from a tulip glass, and leads right into the mouth with the same flavor. The sweet gf fades and you are left with a (good) bitter taste, more gf than hops. I liked that the gf was imparted well but it def overwhelms any hop flavor. You need to have an open mind in this one to enjoy. I would drink again but prob not buy more than one at a time."
"For me this tastes a little fake, like fruity pebbles or fresca. Still tasty of course I'm just not sure how only real fruit would make this insanely sweet fruity in an almost chemical way. Definitely still drinking it but it's not as great to me as some think."
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.
Not a big grapefruit fan. This is over powered by grapefruit.
L: Great looking clear amber. Small white head but quite good lacing.
"Tasted in Brasil and really enjoyed it, perfect match of flavours."
Poured from a 12 FL.OZ. bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on day 363 (December 29) of 2014.
"Smells like a blend of grapefruit and fresh cut squash (butternut or acorn), so not exactly a pleasant smell. Taste follows the smell, squash flavor present, a bit of IPA somewhere in there. Not sure if I have a bad batch, but this is not good."
Truly fantastic. The smell alone is worth opening the bottle. Subtle hint at grapefruit at beginning pairs well with the sweeter hops towards end.
"Honestly, I'm not a huge fan on the standard Sculpin IPA. It's good but it's average to me so I was excited to try and actually find this beer fresh and close to me in MA because I love grapefruit and heard so much about this beer."
Was excited to try this beer. Regular Sculpin I love. Grapefruits I love. Grapefruit rind? Not so much. And that's what this beer tastes like. Disappointed.
"This beer was absolutely killer. Hop-forward Sculpin taste up front, followed by a massive wave of citrus. Seriously tasted like drinking fresh grapefruit juice. Amazingly refreshing and a must-buy if you can find it fresh. Will be seeking this one out again for sure."
"Personally, I find sculpin to be one my favorite ipas. That being said I was extremely excited to try this variation. Overall a very nice beer. The only negative I noticed was that at times the grapefruit overwhelmed everything else instead of complimenting it. However, I still found this to be a delicious beer that I'm glad I got to try."
The grapefruit nose and taste in this is simply amazing to go along with an already awesome base IPA. Summer in a glass.
"Pours a clear dark gold / light amber color with a one finger white head. As expected the aroma is strong grapefruit, which is more than alright with me. There is also some citrus zest."
"This is a strange one. I grabbed a sixer accidentally thinking it was Sculpin (which I love). I dove in anyway and enjoyed it... initially. The flavors are so expertly balanced that I can see why this gets props, but the grapefruit, while interesting for one bottle, was not doing it for me AT ALL by midway through the second. I would drink one again, but would never crack a second in one session."
Look - She's a beauty. Light orange-y hue with great clarity and lacing. 
Bit on the sweet side. Middle has mandarin/orange rind notes. Was expecting a bit more from this as regular sculpin is great.
"Artificial tasting, sweet with little to no bitterness. ""Natural grapefruit flavors"" certainly not working in this one."
"Grapefruit dominates at first sip, then settles down to a very nice, balanced, tasty IPA"
A nice twist on the original.
"On release, I was only able to get 2-12oz bottles from my craft beer store. Initially, I thought this was fantastic. Nice grapefruit flavor added bitterness to the already great Sculpin. I found another store later that week that sold me a six pack. After having 4 of these, I don't think it was as good as I initially thought it was. The grapefruit kills all the nice stuff that Sculpin is. A well balanced Sculpin now tastes like a grapefruit radler. While still well done, I've revamped my rating to 4-ish from 4.5."
"Clear copper color, poured with tons of head that went away pretty quickly. Taste and aroma are everything like Sculpin with a great upfront grapefruit kick. The GF balances very nicely with the hop bitterness. This one met my expectations quite nicely."
Poured into my teku glass.
"L - clear, amber/orange coloration. thin head, dissipates quickly. Nice lacing, or as I like to call it ""the sip story""."
"Tasted from a twelve ounce bottle on January 11, 2015."
Everything you love about Sculpin with immediate hit of dry grapefruit upfront. Awesome.
"Nice amber color with some haziness. A quarter inch of off white head is present. Brussels lacing. Nice citrus and grapefruit aroma is greeting my nose. The flavor is an intense blend of citrus and grapefruit. The mouth is moderately carbonated,crisp,and refreshing."
Pours reddish gold with nice head and lacing. Aroma is dominated by grapefruit. Taste follows the nose and a light malt finish. Mouthfeel is less carbonated.
Nice citrus flavor from this IPA. Very enjoyable.
"Clear gold with a dense head of creamy foam. Smells pretty much like pure, fresh grapefruit juice...vibrant and juicy. Some leafy, floral hop notes come through as it warms. Flavor has more depth - plenty of grapefruit for sure, but the hops bring some deeper tropical fruit, lemon, grass, and cracker-like grain. The grapefruit remain amazingly fresh and bright, bringing a nice zesty, oily aspect that seems to blend well with the hops. That being said, it is VERY grapefruity, going well beyond the limits of what hops can normally contribute. Medium bodied, bitter, and pleasantly dry. A quality IPA that really harnesses the fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice quality, but still lets some of the base beer shine through (if only slightly)."
Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a snifter.
"Clear as possible, amber gold color under a thin white foam head. Scattered lace strings remain on the glass as the head turns to a patchy sheet on the surface of the beer. Aroma is super juicy, fresh, dank, and zesty. Coniferous hops with ruby red grapefruit goodness over chewy white bread malt. Tantalizing aroma followed by fruity, spicy, pine hop flavor. Pleasantly clean malts underneath, bready and perhaps doughy. Very tasty.... Mouthfeel is fluid, festively carbonated, and hop resiny. Extremely drinkable as well."
The Grapefruit taste stood out but was balanced perfect.
"Consumed January 7th, 2015 from a bottle, poured into a Samuel Adams ""perfect pint"" glass."
On Tap
Appearance: Pours a clear amber color with a modest head; decent retention and a few shards of lacing linger
I love the regular Sculpin. The grapefruit in this version tones down the intense IPA taste of the original making it a bit easier to drink. I still prefer the original but will happily drink these anytime I can get my hands on one.
The grapefruit is very evident. There is a dryness to the ipa that the grapefruit adds. The hops are showcased more at the finish. Really interesting but not really worth the price
"Clear orange color with off-white head. Aroma has pungent grapefruit, a bit artificial though. Taste starts really balanced and juicy with red grapefruit flavor coming through. Finish has medium bitterness, dry and fruity. Medium body with soft mouthfeel. Overall it's a pretty good, fruity IPA but kind of over hyped."
I am pleasantly surprised by this. It's so fruity and somehow not as bitter as the regular octane. Grapefruit aroma is quite lucious.
"Sort of like if regular Sculpin had been aged for a week or two on grapefruit rinds. Still good, but not exactly, to my palate, better."
"Great beer, it's definitely pithy."
"12oz bottle from a sixer that cost the same as the regular Sculpin. Looks the same, orange with a good head. Aroma was all grapefruit like grapefruit juice. Flavor was super heavy grapefruit almost masking the hops. This was a cool beer but felt more like a novelty take and masked some of the flavors I enjoy in Sculpin."
I am a huge fan of the original it is one of my top IPA's. I was a little unsure of what I would think of this varietal and I must say I am very pleased. It has a nice citrus fruit aroma and a subtle flavor addition that makes the beer unique. The base beer is still very much in this beer so fans of the original should really enjoy this. I will not say it is any better or worse than the original but a very nice take on the beer and I would rotate this one with the original year round if it were available.
A- pour clean with little head retention. Slight ruby hue.
Not enjoying the somewhat artificial grapefruit flavor in this brew. I will gladly stick to the original.
"12 ounce bottle, Julian Date 14350 printed on label (bottled December 16, 2014). Served in a DFH IPA glass, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with about an inch and a half white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like pink grapefruit, citrusy hops, and a bit of bready malt. It tastes like citrusy hops, pink grapefruit, citrus peel, tropical fruit and bready malt. There's also a lingering bitter finish. Ballast Point was right when they named this beer, because it's all about the grapefruit! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and has a good amount of carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good brew, and if you like grapefruit then you'll really like this one!"
L - Poured burnt orange with a small head. 
A: Pours a crystal clear medium golden orange in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation and hints of amber highlights. The beer has a finger tall foamy beige head that slowly reduces to a mottled thick film covering the entire surface of the beer and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate to significant amounts of lacing are observed.
Poured from a bottle into a tulip 
"Poured from a 12oz into my Spiegelau glass. No date on bottle, but the guy at Vintage Estate (best beer store in eastern OH bar none) told me it came in on 12/29. I trust them. Deep copper hue, with 3 fingers of white head with pretty big bubbles. Mucho lacing. There was literally a 3 foot radius aroma of grapefruit eminating from my glass throughout the consumption of this beauty. Also some aromas of citrus peel, some dank notes, and overall very clean! Big huge, juicy grapfefruit on the front of the palate. Clean and bitter bite on the end of the palate. Some funky (mosiac?) in the middle. Very hop forward, though there was enough of a malt foundation to carry it. Refreshing and clean, no major lingering aftertastes/etc. but it really kept the palate fresh. This was delicious and juicy. Love Sculpin, Grapefruit might be a +1... can't wait to find Habenero! Ballast Point. Find this!"
Light color and thick white head. Huge hits of grapefruit on the nose and taste and then more grapefruit on top of Fruity Pebbles.
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear golden with nice transparency; fluffy eggshell white head that fades leaving nice retention and lacing. I'm blown away by the aromas simply because it literally smells like fresh grapefruit. The flavors taste like grapefruit juice. I'm not going to go on describing this beer because ""grapefruit"" literally says it all. Mouthfeel is nice. It's medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink. Alcohol goes unnoticed."
"Thanks to UncleJazz for the bottle. Wow, this is a big blast of grapefruit and hops all very sweet and dripping with oranges, tangerines, mangoes and,obviously, grapefruit! Very powerful precense in the nose through the finish, so much so it may be off-putting for those who do not care for sweet citrus-forward IPAs...but not me!!"
Not as good as the sculpin
"Golden orange in color and pours with a beautiful fine head. Nose is huge and impressive - brings to mind circus peanuts and grapefruit. While the fruit is apparent in the nose, it blows you away upon sipping. While the piney flavors are not very bitter, there is a pithiness to the grapefruit flavor. Quite pleasant but I don't know that I want to have more than a few as I miss having more prominent hop flavor. Mouthfeel and finish are very clean and refreshing. All in all a very interesting and tasty beer."
Bottle from Whole Foods. 
Superb - will buy again!
"Pours a clear light orange to yellow color with a large three finger white frothy head. There is some carbonation and a little lacing. The odor is indeed grapefruit, almost pink grapefruit, lemon peel, orange, some tropical fruits, slightly grassy. The taste is citrus, grapefruit, orange, herbal, grassy, resin, pine, slight bitterness throughout."
"A - Deep gold, clear, lots of near white head, lots of cling."
"I really enjoyed this beer but I did find it a little odd. There are notable IPA's where I get a grapefruit ""thing"" from, and most notably for me it's Two Hearted. I get the grapefruit from what the hops are doing, not from the addition of juice, like this one. Sculpin Grapefruit on the other hand is extremely pleasant (if you indeed dig grapefruit) but there is certainly more of a ""layered"" taste profile that is a little less balanced than the natural grapefruit expression of the hops. Still a fantastic beer that I could easily become addicted to, but just a different creature from say, Two Hearted. IPA - grapefruit shandy?"
Poured into an IPA glass from a 12 oz bottle.
"Exactly what I expected from a grapefruit IPA... has nice ruby pink color, grapefruit smell and taste... only downside was lost some of the ""bite"" that I enjoy from regular sculpin."
The beer is so well-centered around the grapefruit. The aromas are incredible
"Awesome grapefruit smell, one of the best looking beers I have seen, unfortunately taste is not great, lacking bite of regular Sculpin."
"Had on draft. Really nice grapefruit rind incorporation. I've heard mixed reviews about this, but I feel it worked nicely! The hops complement the Grapefruit which definitely takes center stage."
"Poured out as a clear orange color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer is pretty much all grapefruit, subtle hops but all grapefruit otherwise. The taste of the beer is a little sweet, but finishes with a decent bitterness. The feel of the beer is juicy, kind of refreshing. Overall it's a pretty good brew."
Really? 
Bottle poured into an antique Pilsner glass
Tastes and smells like Fruity Pebbles.
Love the taste and smell
The grapefruit aroma is amazing! All other aspects well above average. A unique flavor and very enjoyable.
"I'm in love! That is, I love grapefruit, and this is liquid grapefruit. Intense grapefruit flavor and aroma, nice creamy mouthfeel with added astringency from the grapefruit. I can see why some people don't like this, it trades off the depth and complexity of sculpin for pure grapefruit flavor. If you like grapefruit, you will love this beer. If you don't, look elsewhere"
"maybe it is just my palate but this was not as high on my review as it was for others. something about it was very good, dont get me wrong. But on the other hand, it just didnt hit that spot for me."
This was the best new beer of 2014... just perfect all around.
For a non-IPA drinker this is a very likable IPA. The grapefruit is just prevalent enough to smooth out the hoppiness.
"It's been six years since I had my first taste of Sculpin, and now Ballast Point has made two variants of that outstanding beer available. I was offered a few bottles of Grapefruit Sculpin by a friend, something which I would have to be out of my mind to decline. Thanks Joepeter! On to the beer:"
Very Hoppy with strong hints of grapefruit. Different. Awesome
"Finally a brew that implements the Grapefruit with balance. Such a great addition to this already amazing brew. 5/5 for me. This is however swayed being as I love grapefruit! Ah man, wish this was sold near me."
"This beer actually delivers on what it promises, grapefruit!"
Undated bottle at 45 degrees into shaker
"Smells sweet and fruity; as the name says, the grapefruit taste hits you right away and lingers for a bit after with a hint of hops in between. Flavorful and wonderful."
Like the name says - this beer is all grapefruit! 
"Rocky, bar-poured head. Great ring lace with streaks in between. Light amber color and clear. "
"Poured into a Stella goblet. Thanks, Darren."
"Like it more than the original, TBH, the grapefruit tasting very natural indeed. I notice some variation in intensity from can to can, but usually it's totally on point. Plus, you can still pick out the hops and malt in this brew. The grapefruit simply naturally heightens the citrus notes of the hops. Good stuff."
"On tap, into a tulip at the tasting room in Little Italy in SD"
"12 oz. bottle obtained on trade from Dr. N. Arres, unknown brewing/bottling date but certainly an aged beer as this point (will review from memory at its prime), poured into my FFF Teku glass, drank over 30 minutes"
Type: 22-oz. glass
Surprisingly great beer. Same Sculpin flavors with a nice hint of grapefruit. Ballast point rocks
Straight up Ruby Red grapefruit juice. Tongue tingling.............................................................................................................
"Hmmm. Wish I knew what was going on here. I have tried Sculpin a few times now and get little of what others are talking about. It seems too light bodied and subtle for me in comparison to like-style beers like Stone and Lagunitas. So, perhaps the citrus bite of grapefruit will enhance it? It did, but not enough. Still too light bodied for my personal preference. I really enjoy so many of Ballast Point's offerings that this baffles me. Chalk it up to individual palate issues..."
"Beautiful copper brew topped by a huge snow-white head. Great retention. Very clear. Tons of nice, fluffy lacing."
Serving Type: 12 ounce bottle/tulip glass. 
From tap to pint glass
Serving Type: 12 ounce bottle poured into a Belgian style tulip glass. 
12oz Bottle
"Looks: redish, amber hue. Light and bubbly. Looks like soda."
A: Pours a hazy amber with minimal head and thin lacing... Looks absolutely mouth-watering. 
Tartness of the grapefruit with the hops is an interesting combo.
"The grapefruit really works in this combination, and makes a great IPA even better."
"Poured from the bottle into a stemless wine glass, picked right out of the cooler at Healthy Spirits."
"On tap at the Basin Pub in Bushnell's Basin, NY."
A: Crystal clear golden/amber body topped with a thin pearl white head. Spotty lacing remains on the glass as it goes down.
Appearance: Pale golden with a nice frothy head. Good head retention.
"Bottle c/o the always generous daknole. Thank you my friend. Served side by side with regular Sculpin. Light golden body with a white head. Similar hop bill to the standard Sculpin with the addition of a huge grapefruit juice character. Fresh squeezed, tart, potent. Tasty beer."
Slightly sweeter than regular Sculpin. A bit more...Simcoe? Grapefruit comes thru in the aftertaste in just the right amount. 
A: Pours a light orange. Excellent clarity. Finger and a hlaf of white head. Dissipates to a thin bleached cap. Excellent lacing. Carbonation appears minimal in the glass. 
"Poured a nice, slighty hazy amber body with a thin cap of white foam. Exactly what I expect from an IPA, nothing amazing, but still quite nice. Scents of tropical fruit especially pineapple and mango, pine resin, grapefruit peel and flesh, light pine resin and indeterminate citrus. Faint malt is also present. Overall impression of aroma is of a fairy grapefruit forward aroma, fitting the addition of grapefruit, with the same pine, tropical fruit and citrus that we have come expect from Sculpin. A wonderful aroma. True to form and what I expect from Sculpin. Flavor begins with a nice flavor of grapefruit zest and flesh, far more fresh and fruity than the normal hop-derived grapefruit. A hint of pine resin complements the grapefruit. The middle continues this fresh, grapefruit rich flavor, along with a bit of indeterminate, likely orange zest, citrus peel and moderate pine resin. Finish is rich in grapefruit flesh, peel, pith and medium amounts of pine resin. A light malt sweetness balances the hops and grapefruit throughout. Aftertaste is grapefruit flesh, rind and a moderate level of pine resin. Overall impression of flavor is of a wonderfully refreshing IPA that takes a strong presence towards grapefruit due to the addition of grapefruit. It is wonderfully balanced and works well with the base flavors, particularly the pine resin, but also the malt. The fresh, bitter, fruity notes of the grapefruit peel are on full display and make the beer feel fresh and crisp. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with medium carbonation and a crisp, drying, resinous feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice, resinous IPA, the typical Sculpin, though notes of raw grapefruit also push through. Very nice. Overall this is a wonderful IPA. It takes the base Sculpin and adds a fantastic level of grapefruit to the base and balances it wonderfully in aroma and flavor. The resinous mouthfeel helps. Truly an excellent IPA that is full of fresh citrus and pine flavor. Highly recommended."
"I enjoyed this on tap at the fridge, served chilled in a pint glass. review from notes."
12 ounce bottle into a snifter.
"12oz to a snifter, no bottle date"
"Excellent, floral, and refreshing IPA"
12 oz. bottle poured into a 3 Floyds pint. 
12oz bottle. Dated 9/4/2014. Poured into a teku glass 10/6/2014.
12oz bottle poured into a snifter. The brew appears a crystal clear golden yellow color with a creamy off-white froth. Full patchy lace sticks to the glass and the head displays solid retention.
It pours a clear orange color and has a strong aroma of citrus & hops. The taste is sweet up front but finishes with hop bitterness & tart grapefruit. Good IPA with a refreshing twist.
"Pretty tasty, this would make a great summer IPA"
Delicious.... no further review needed.
"Bottled 8/21/14, poured into a tulip glass"
"A: Bright copper, highly translucent. Frothy, fine-bubble egg shell head."
"ive had sculpin, habanero sculpin, and now grapefruit sculpin. in my opinion, ballast point should leave the original recipe be. while habanero sculpin might make a damn good michelada, and grapefruit sculpin burps taste heavenly, nothing hits the (ipa) spot like the original. "
"Appearance: Minimal head retention, tiny spotted lacing, bright copper and gold. "
"Ewwwwww... looks as if I'm in the minority on this one. I know it says ""Grapefruit"" on the label but man oh man did they keep thier promise on that statement. Had a hard time pulling other flavors and such because of the overwhelming grapefruit quality in the beer. It was bitter (in a good way), the feel was good but to me had way too much grapefruit character going on which just lost me. I love grapefruit as well but I guess I thought I was gonna get an overload of grapefruit hops type of taste as apposed to an actual Grapefruit type of taste. It wasn't horrible but to me did not resemble the base sculpin in any way. To each thier own but I won't be buying again."
"Love dat fresh Sculpin. Didn't expect much from Grapefruit Sculpin but thought I would give it a test run. The aroma is dominated by a sweet candy citrus with honey and light floral hop aromas. The sweetness in the nose, thankfully, is the only thing that doesn't come through in the flavor. Grapefruit and orange citrus take center stage over a clean and smooth malt profile nicely balanced by a floral and citrus hop profile. While the candied grapefruit up front tastes a little fake, the perfectly bitter pith finish keeps me coming back. Crushable and refreshingly delicious, Grapefruit Sculpin is a great take on an already great IPA."
Bottle courtesy of Dan..thanks for making it out my way.
"A: deep gold and clear, couple of fingers of ivory head slimmed to a fine cap "
"Pours an orange color with a slight haze. Good retention and plenty of hops infused, sticky lace. The aroma keys in on the grapefruit and citrus notes from hops. "
Enjoyed from a bells tulip. 
12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.
"To drink out of the bottle, or out of the Ramada “Take A Break!” paper cup? How’my gonna roll? Let’s try the cup first. Don’t be judgy. "
Big fruit forward IPA. Not only the big grapefruit flavor. But a lingering cereal aftertaste. Similar to Fruit Loops.
"smells like grapefruit, no joke here. Absolutely killed it for the aroma."
A: Pours a clear gold with a finger of white head that fades into a frothy ring with little lacing.
Poured bottle into New Belgium globe
much more subdued than I was expecting. less bitter and more smooth than I was expecting. the grapefruit is literally tropical-fruit tasting more than it adds to the bitterness. very pleasant. nice variation on what I have come to expect from California IPAs....
Poured from 12 oz can dated 6/30/2015 into tulip. Enjoyed on 7/26/2015. 
12 oz bottle with no freshness date poured into a pint glass
On tap at the brewery – Old Grove location
"Clear golden body with a white head, good head retention and lacing. Grapefruit, tropical fruit and floral aromas lead to bright citrusy, grapefruit flavors that end with a pine finish that is lightly bitter."
"Enjoyed out of a 12 oz brown bottle with what appears to be a Julian bottling code of 14204, which I believe translates to 7/23/14. Poured into a Speigelau IPA glass."
Reviewed from notes. On-tap @ the Old Grove source.
"Very nice pour with a good finger of beautiful white head. Perfect amount of carbonation throughout the beer. Smells exactly like a Sculpin should, the perfect San Diego IPA with subtle notes of grapefruit zest or mist. First taste is Cali hops and grapefruit in the most wonderful marriage of flavor and aroma any beer lover would die for."
"Pours clear and golden with a minor half finger head of white. Decent retention and wispy bands of lace, good enough but I know real fruit really damages appearance of beers."
Served in a half-pint glass at Ale Arsenal.
12 oz acquired via trade. Poured into double-walled tumbler.
"I had this on tap at Ballast Point Brewery in Scripps Ranch. The beer looked alive. The body was bright bronze, clean, and clear. The head was white, dense, and soft. The smell of grapefruit was definitely apparent. For me, the original Sculpin has a richer taste. They removed the rich, and added grapefruit zest, and citrus. The base beer is still there, but the beer changed into something bright and zesty. A great summer beer."
Served in a Spiegelau IPA glass. 
"Ballast Point has taken a great beer and created another great beer. The nose is definitely grapefruit. The draw is sculpin ipa. The finish finishes clean, dry, and crisp with grapefruit notes. Ballast Point just bottled and released it today at all their tap rooms and breweries. Not sure if they will distribute it. All I know is that it was going fast so I had to buy a case to have on hand for this Fourth of July!"
20oz glass on tap
Doin' it well and good at Toronado (San Diego).
"On tap for The Full Pint 6th Anniversary Celebration held at 38 Degrees in Alhambra, CA. "
"Thanks to Schteve for turning me on to Ballast Point Sculpin a couple of weeks ago. My new favorite beer. I live IPA's the hippies the better, and normally not a huge fan if fruit flavors in beer (with the exception of M.H. #9)"
I have reviewed Sculpin so I'm not going to go into a complex review but this was such a treat I had to post. 
Supposedly this is just the Sculpin but with grapefruit peel added in.
"My FAVORITE IPA. The blend of Mosaic, Warrior, Columbus and Amarillo hops just does it for me...and maybe the fact that Beachwood is local for me, I’ll get this 16oz can/4-pak at my local bottle shop when it’s just a few days old!"
"Poured from the can into a shaker pint glass, boo hiss... canned September 24 2018."
This is an exceptional beer. Every time I find it I only wonder why I didn't get more.
Thanks Damon.
Canned on 5/7; consumed on 5/26 - poured from a tall boy into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. 
"Clean golden color. Aroma has sweet honey and pollen notes, quite floral hop profile. Taste has a sweet malty backbone with floral hops and medium bitterness on the finish. Medium body, crisp carbonation."
"Pours a clear goden yellow with soapy, fine foam."
From a pint can.
Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing Co pint glass
An excellent IPA.
3-16
"16oz can from a four pack that cost $13.49. Aroma is heavy Mosaic, berries and some sweetness. Flavor is more Mosaic, berries, a nice malt backbone, some bitterness, a great West Coast IPA."
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to a tall, narrow pint (Green Cheek nucleated flute). This was canned on January 31, 19 days before the time of consumption, according to a black ink canning date on the underside of the can (""CANNED ON 01/31/18""). Refrigerated consistently. "
"Beautiful looking beer! Crystal clear straw yellow pour with a huge pillowy eggshell head. Had to give the look a 4.5 cuz it’s that pristine! Nose is piney. Full of sap, must and resin. Slight notes of grapefruit zest. Taste is of sticky pine sap, pine needles, light floral and crisp grapefruit. Some grainyness shows through as well. Medium body to slightly thin. Nicely coats my tulip with a thin oily film as well as the teeth ;) If I was ever questioning my love for “west coast” IPAs which I wasn’t this beer reaffirmed the beauty of a brilliant pine bomb!"
"Ah! A crystal clear IPA. Almost a true gold body with a white head, about a finger and a half, that dissipates to a thin ring around the glass."
"Crystal clear golden brew, leaning toward yellow. Head production and retention are solid, and lacing is excellent."
"It’s body is a slightly hazy golden color. Coarse bubbles make up a nice looking head. It’s aroma is strongly influenced with grapefruit & pine tar. Grapefruit pith bitterness & a hint in sweetness. Flavor follows it’s aroma with tropical fruit & tangerine & grain flavors. Just a bit more bitterness than I like, but I’m not a fan of IPA’s. Feel is thin with plenty of carbonation. Overall it is excellent."
Bottle from ABV.
Appearance - Pours copper color with nice light fluffy white head with lots of sticky lacing.
"I gotta say, it seems like Beachwood is underappreciated, especially when it comes to their hoppy beers, I just never hear anyone talk about them, but they seem to get good reviews, so I dunno, just not resonating with much of the beer nerd public I guess. "
Bottled 091817. I've known Beachwood brewing for a long time. This is the first time I actually tried their beer.
Poured from a 12oz bottle with a bottled on date of 9/18/17; into a pint glass.
Look: Clear golden color with a small white head that stay awhile. 
Nonic pint at THG. 
"On tap at the Far Bar, Little Tokyo LA. I've been drinking IPA's before I knew what an IPA was. I drank IPA's before they become ""a thing"". This is simply a beautifully designed IPA that belongs in the pantheon of IPA's along side the Giants, the First, the Innovators. Liberty, Pig, Maharajah, ...."
Poured from a 6/6/17 stamped 12oz bottle into a tulip. 
"Poured into tulip. Hazy gold/orange color, not a lot of foam but healthy lacing. Tangy hop scent, know that there's definitely going to be some bitterness on the taste. There definitely is, with a mild happiness. A crisp and tangy feel to it, definitely a West Coast style IPA and a real winner."
12oz Stubby
On tap at Growler Guys the other day.
Bottle Date: 5/8/17
"These guys just ooze quality at every step, across so many styles, and here's another example. Really cool kaleidoscope of hop flavors here, juicy fruit gum, tropical fruit, some lightly dank undercurrents in there too. Great balanced bitterness to tame the fruity fun and super drinkable to boot, not too big to get weighed down, but enough heft to satisfy. Excellent stuff."
Poured into a Magnify 16 oz snulip bottled on 4/26/17. Pours a very attractive dark yellow with a 2 plus finger sticky white head that leaves thin wisps of lace all over the sides of the glass. 
"12 oz bottle dated 4-25-17 poured into a snifter! The look is classic clear west coast style with a golden/orange color. Half inch white head that fades and no lacing when consumed. Smell is lightly fruity and cracker malts, a little sweetness with light pine! The initial tatse is light fruits followed by light malts with some aggressive bitterness in the back that lingers. The feel is medium but dry! Overall its not bad but not my favorite, maybe i am partial to NE style IPAs. Cheers."
"Hazed light yellow color, highly effervescent, with three fingers of lasting white head that leave heavy lacing."
"On tap at the brewpub. It was my favorite of at least 5 different IPAs that I sampled there, so I settled on it for a pint. It was all about hops, hops and more hops. Strong in pine and citrus and bright aromatic spices, fresh, with plenty of notes to think about. Generally well made, but the bitterness was just a bit too high for me. I prefer a more balanced brew."
"This a fantastic beer. Slightly hazy gold beer with a white head. The aroma is tons of citrus and pine. On first taste I swore I tasted fresh, bitter peach skin but subsequent tastes washed that away. In its place I found fruit, flowers and pine. A pretty clean and bitter finish. This is a damn fine beer."
"This beer is blowing up with hop goodness and hop freshness. Citrus, tropical, resiny and dank. The malt is there but the incredible ""amalgam"" of hops steals the show. Buy it, drink it, love it!"
12oz bottle into a tulip appears a clear copper color with off-white cap a finger strong that fades leaving patchy lace.
"Great beer! Really well balanced, nice hop taste but not a hop bomb. Not a big aroma off the beer but the taste makes up for it. First beer from these guys but I am sure I will try a lot more"
"I will leave this review simple. This is a world class, clean, crisp, refreshing, bursting with aroma and flavor IPA, that makes me question why I bother with any others. Nice simple malt profile, with huge hop everything. Now that it in six packs, and somewhat more easily obtainable...this will be finding itself in my fridge way more often. Cheers!"
"On tap at Beachwood BBQ and Brewery in Long Beach, CA."
"Pours a brilliant clear golden color. Thinnish white head dissipates steadily. Smell is pungent and fragrant. Lots of peach, pineapple, mango and a hint of citrus. Taste followed the nose with the aromas coming through in the flavor albeit not as robustly. Still very good. Feel was a touch thin, but it made it very drinkable. Overall a wonderful classic IPA -very well crafted."
Gold with white foam.
22oz bottle dated 1/4/17:
"L: golden color, nice lacing "
"Bottle dated 11-28-16 into a tulip glass. Pours vibrant golden yellow with 2 fingers of medium density white head that left moderate lacing. Nose a bit faint, but very tropical,some bubblegum (more as it warmed), and just the slightest hint of pine. Taste starts tropical and finishes with a citrus punch. Plenty of astringency and some bitterness. Finishes dry and bubbly and lingers on the palate a bit. Mouthfeel is medium, just enough body, and the carbonation on the higher end. Thoroughly enjoyed."
"I didnt really care for this. Mostly bitter, dry, and just not a lot of other flavors. Lacked malt balance."
Damn good. Great balance slight confusing bitterness on the end notes
This one nails everything in balance. Everything fits perfectly in it's place. A near flawless west coast IPA. I can find no flaws with it...actually. The closest thing to Pliny the Elder you're going to get from SoCal. 
"Will I be accused of homebase bias? Selecting three or four breweries located in Southern California on my list? Is SoCal some sort of Napa Valley for beer? Drive through the vineyards of Napa and Sonoma and watch the hilly geography thrive on the NorCal sun, the NorCal temperature. The chill a wino gets must be similar to that of a beerophile in SoCal, in bumper-to-bumper traffic, fighting for a parking space, inhaling SoCal smog and smelling SoCal bum urine. There exists, spread out, quite a few breweries in Southern California, and while many capatalize on the location to serve lackluster beer, much praise is due for the ones that craft a great beer. Beachwood Brewing is rather small, located in Long Beach not far from more flashy, more trendy, and more well-known breweries. Sure some of what Beachwood offers can be as ""meh"" as the names they're given (Alt(ernate) Reality, That's What She Said, Tart Simpson, don't make me list on) but you get to the Amalgamator and you get to the goods. It's an IPA that is clean, goes down easy, but leaves behind a taste in your mouth. Not so much a taste, but the feeling you had when you first sipped. I think a bias towards finding bias would explain any accusation of bias towards me. As far as I can tell, I'm being pretty darn objective about my tastes."
"look is amazing, smell is of pine, citrus and mango. very pungent smell. initial taste is quite bitter. then after i get a slight pine taste. this sort of leaves the tongue numb. also my burps keep coming up foamy. there is no date on the bottle for me to figure out if it is old or not. i had high hopes for this beer taste wise."
"Very nice West coast IPA! Great color, great lacing, great aroma and Hop punch!!! Taste is mega bitter, but balanced at the same time. Multiple flavors touch your buds. Would drink this all the time if I had the chance."
A: clear golden light yellow thin but prominent bubbles 
I tried the Amalgamater at the brewery. It poured a clear orangish with white head that left some lace. The scent and taste had citus peel and pine. The Mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this was one of my favorites.
Beachwood at its very best! Their Single Ipa series is as good as any. This is perfectly dry with a touch of malt and a beautiful hop profile. Great Beer #donthazemebro
"First beach wood BBQ beer I've had. Pretty standard light IPA look and smell is ok with a mixture of citrus, herbal flowers, medicinal herbs. The highlight here is a stupendous mouthfeel, maybe best I d ever had on an IPA. Super luscious and smooth."
What another exceptional beer. Very dry hopped smell taste and feel. So crisp and flavorful. Whatever Beachwood does to their Ipas is fantastic. Another great beer from them
Love me some West Coast IPA's!
"Wham! A lot of pine and citrus, covered in candied dank. Hope that make sense. World Class."
"UPDATE: the January 2016 release was way dank and amazing- but this last batch 9/2016-present tastes watered down. Now it's real good and all, but it is 75% of what it used to be."
poured this into a ipa glass and it poured an amber color with a 2 inch white head and very nice lacing. the smell is of citrus and pine and it has a bitter finish. the feel is crisp and bittersweet and a bitter finish. overall this is a delicious and bitter ipa that is has a well balance bitterness with the citrus/pine flavor. simply delicious.
Type: 22-oz. bottle
"Westcoast IPA all the way. Too bitter for my east coast palate, but better than most others I've had."
best west coast I have had in a while.. nice pine and citrus on the nose.. mouthfeel is classic west coast.. I wish it was thicker... taste was great.. super fresh.. very great WC IPA..
"by far out ranks blind pig, just outstanding, alpine nelson/duet, sculpin, etc... personal all time favorite"
Clear orange with white thick head and lacing that sticks around and not planning on going any where. Very beautiful see through orange. The smell of Citra is amazing fallowing a hoppy taste that feels the mouth with tropical fruit. Love it
"From 09/18/15 notes. 22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip, thanks Dane!"
"I can always count of Beachwood to make a good IPA. Here's one more. On-tap at Beachwood BBQ, on to the beer:"
"The last bottle of a batch that showed up at Bine & Vine in San Diego. Lucious mango aroma. Label says this is brewed with Amarillo, Warrior, and Columbus as well as the Mosaic hops. Sharp on the tongue. Clear golden yellow with a fine cream of foam in the tall goblet."
Glad i live 15 mins from beachwood and have a beer store 2 mins away from me that has a beachwood account. One of my favorite breweries. Such fresh stuff all the time and this ipa is just like the rest of the stuff they put out.. Top Notch!! My hats off to you again beachwood well done!
"Bottled on 9/8, bought on 9/9, enjoyed on 9/10. The exceptional freshness definitely contributed to it, but this was one of the best IPAs I've had in my life and the best use of Mosaic hops in any beer that I can remember. It would probably be too much to ask to have it available in affordable sixers..."
Piney perfection through and through
"Had on-tap, on cask, and in the bottle. Review is for the bottle - bomber poured into shaker pint. Appearance is clear orange body with off-white head that has good retention and leaves some sticky patches on the glass. Aroma is super tropical with passionfruit and pineapple, solid citrus with grapefruit and orange peel, and finally some wet pine hop dankness and melon. Taste starts with some biscuit malt sweetness and then quickly yields to tropical fruit juice sweetness and citrus rind bitterness. Medium body, oily texture, average carbonation, bitter finish."
Grassy/Weedy hop front with a blast of passion fruit. Really bitter.
"On tap at Beachwood in Long Beach, CA."
Poured 22oz bomber into New Belgium globe
Appearance: Pours a hazy goldenrod with a decent head that leaves some splashy lace behind
"Poured a clear golden orange with an inch off white head. Plenty of lacing sticks to the glass. The smells is amazing. It consists of a combination of dank resin, citrus fruits, and a touch of passion fruit. The taste is very similar. Passion fruit, tropical fruits is followed by a dank resinous flavor and ending with a citrus bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy (somewhat buttery) with little (but some) carbonation. Overall, a great IPA and deserves do be up there with the best west coast IPAs!"
"absolutely world class ipa here, one of the best expressions of mosaic hops i have seen, and a true west coast style gem from beachwood. the color is a radiant orange amber, quite clear but with a bit of fuzz as the bottle pours out. heady, one inch plus of thick and permanent white fluff. the nose is the best part, and its immaculate. rich and fresh mosaic hops, high in alpha acid, but showing less citrusy and more of a tropical fruit bouquet. i get passion fruit and pineapple, along with tart peach. its complex and awesome, and the grain bill is just large enough to keep these flavors on the tongue for awhile, before finishing off rather clean with a lingering bitter kick. i wish the brightness of the hops in the aroma came through into the flavor just a bit more cleanly, but they are still there, and its so juicy and delicious. fuller medium body and only enough carbonation to keep it in motion. overall a very well refined west coast ipa, special, and more interesting than many of the ""throw it all in the kettle"" types. the artwork on the label is also gorgeous. top notch ipa that i wish i could drink whenever i wanted."
"Poured from a bottle, no date, after receiving in a trade..."
"22oz bottle purchased at Holiday Wine Cellar - Escondido, CA"
"Hazy gold pour nets a perfect, finger and a half of rocky stark white head. Excellent retention and lacing that coats the glass."
"This is one of the most florally aromatic IPA's that I have tasted. The first nose on this beer served in a glass is almost hibiscus meets grapefruit. The 22oz. bottles I had were bottled on 2/22/14 and the freshness definitely contributed to the fruity lead into a very subtle hop drag, through a smooth finish. This beer on a nitro tap would be the bomb. I hope to visit Beachwood soon! Drink this one as cold as you can get it!"
Thanks to a random guy at the bar who shared this with some of us.
"Grabbed a 22 oz. bomber within a week of bottling, poured into Golden Road Brewing pint glass."

"On tap at Beachwood BBQ & Brewing in Long Beach, CA."
"On-tap at Beachwood I,"
L - let's see how Sand City tackles single hops... pours a simultaneously light and dark orange. Vague haze. Minimal head. 
"Pours a hazy golden color with brown hues, a two inch, very well retained fluffy white head that left loads of lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of citrus and tropical fruits. Tastes of grapefruit, blood orange, pineapple, melon, a hint of pepper and citrus pith. Medium to Full bodied, smooth and slightly chewy mouth feel, well carbonated, slightly bitter and dry finish"
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (11 days old). Appearance is a fairly hazy orange brown with two finger thick head and decent retention. Smell is earthy hops, blueberry, spice (pepper), grapefruit, hay and a hint of resin and pineapple."
"Medium-pale gold body, faintly hazed; tall head of white foam left lots of messy lace behind... Aroma and flavor impressions of citrus, melon, grapefruit and pineapple... Moderately sweet, mildly bitter, amply carbonated... Soft and smooth, medium-light and fluffy body... Great showcase for Mosaic hops... 6/2/17 release date..."
"amber blood orange haze frothy white head. Strong citrus, mango, candied peach and honey on the nose. Resiny juice slightly malty light carbonation, melon and tropical fruit with a bitter smooth finish."
"Traded for this not too long while on line at Other Half. Heard a lot of good things about this brewery but given how far it is from here, it's not a place that I can easily get to. Thankfully, I was able to get my hands on a can of this and boy was it worth it! Certainly an IPA but not as dank or cloudy as other examples form this neck of the woods, as it was a sweet, smooth sipper from start to finish!"
"Drank on tap at Haymaker Bar & Kitchen, New York, NY"
"Overall a very nice introduction to Sand City and a very good DIPA. Lots of pine, citrus, and fruity malts, with no bitterness at all. Not my favorite hops strain but I liked this one a lot."
"Growler of Sand City Mofosaic purchased from the brewery January 2017. Poured fresh from the refrigerator into a 10 oz glass . Cloudy amber body with a pure white foam. Aroma of modern aroma hops. Hoppy bitterness, hop flavor (Mosaic, I assume) and moderate malt body are all present. The carbonation is smooth and gentle. Overall this is a very quenching brew."
Does anybody else feel that this tastes just like Maine Dinner? I do.
"Canned today 1/11/16. Pours merky gold with a nice two finger head that fades slowly and hangs on the sides of the snifter. Great lacing. Aroma is lemon zest, grapefruit, orange peel, mango, Carmel and gram crackers. Taste (super fresh)follows the nose with a touch of tropical fruit. Alcohol is hidden well. Very well made. Look forward to more from sand city."
"This is a delightful NE-style IPA. The smell and taste are both fragrant and pleasant. Importantly, the pillowy mouthfeel just feels great and makes this ale shine. Highly recommended."
"it is such a joy to have such a fine Brewery so close to home. Sand City seems to have blown up almost immediately but I guess it would be hard to keep something this good secret for long. Super pleased to see Sand City jumping on the can bandwagon so early in their game and this was a great selection for one of the first cans. Fairly resinous take on the mosaic hop, but the juiciness prevails and the sand city signature flavors support the hop so well. really a great beer and one of my favorites from my favorite local brewery. big bold chewy body and delicious sweetness on the finish."
"Growler pour, it's very hazy gold color with a nice 1-2 finger white head which faded slowly and left minimal spotty lacing. "
If you love mosaic IPA's you will love this shit!. Total juice bomb
On tap at Sand City 5/16/16.
"Gotta say I've been secretly waiting for Sand City to brew a Mosaic bomb since inception, and here it is. Killer. Spicy, resinous tropical fruits in the nose. Super creamy mouthfeel and that trademark Sand City mid hazy appearance. Tropical mango and stone fruits all day, some earthy resinous pine and a clean fleeting bitterness on the back end."
"This beer smells awesome. I think mosaic hops are one of the best hops out there, beers with mosaic always seems to be very good. Very tasty beer, a bit uneven in spots, maybe some wateryness, but this is nit picking. Sand City is about a 1/2 a notch from playing with the big boys. As time goes on, I hope their beers get even better."
"Fresh draft at the brewery. Pours like a NE style IPA should...thick and totally hazy. The color is a weak orange coupled with yellow. World class head volume, lacing and retention."
"elite level east coast ipa, as juicy and bright as any of the beers in here, insanely drinkable, and not just hazy to be hazy, the starchy grain base is awesome, almost creamy in texture, and there is so much hop character here, some residuals in suspension make a lot of sense. its still relatively low bitterness, although there is some balance to it, heavily dry hopped for sure though, so juicy and fresh squeezed tasting, navel oranges and meyer lemons and even green grape in the nose, a little more zesty lime and lemongrass character in the flavor, a cool mix of hop varietals i would think, but its hard to place specifically here, as its all so well integrated and unified and all of that, not separate or out of step at all. a really smooth feel, a little acidic oddly enough almost like actual orange juice, these guys are doing great stuff with the malts underneath the hops in these beers, this one seems to have some wheat structure too, but its also really dry, not quite biscuity but not one dimensional either, perfect for the hops. this has seemingly become one of their more popular beers, and rightfully so. downright delicious new school ipa right here!"
"First offering from The Fermentory...hopefully not my last. Aroma is off the charts floral! Taste is citrusy/fruity. Overall one of the best IPAs from the South. Put it up with Parish, Southern Prohibition, Civil, Heist, and Bearded Iris."
"Poured from a growler into a tulip glass (3 days old). Appearance is yellow brown in color and very opaque (1/2 finger thick head). Smell hits you with a sweet pineapple/honey/bubblegum flavor, which I assume is generated from their yeast, and citrus hop notes. Excellent, tons of floral hops."
A really solid NEIPA.
Growler obtained from Edmunds Oast Exchange.
"Honestly, have had all sorts of IPAs from all the big boys up north. This is easily one of my favorite."
This outstandingly juicy IPA is a beer which has no equal in the South. It is rich yet soft. Refreshing yet a decently high abv. The mosaic hops round the funk but this has such a pineapple and Meyer lemon quality to the nose. Truly a WORLD-CLASS UNFILTERED IPA
Had on tap at the brewery. Great aroma with a great taste. Has the hazy look of NE IPAS and stands out among Charleston breweries. Definitely recommend.
"I'm a Bostonian and regular Trillium drinker, and after a few pours of Sungazer, I can say this easily murks any IPA in the state and probably even in the Southeast. Hazy orange color, 1-finger head leaves copious lacing. Lots of tropical and dank notes on the nose, some cat piss and armpit twangs let you know what time it is. Taste is juicy, overripe peach and apricot dominate with starfruit, white grape and tangelo coating the palate. Nice carbonation, nothing outstanding but no flaws in terms of mouthfeel. It balances out as it warms and the hop resins really come out to play. When these guys release some DIPAs and start canning, they will take over. Full support!"
Pint can dated 10/26/18 poured into a tulip at 46F
16 oz can into IPA glass. Dated 10/4/18.
One of the best NEIPAs I’ve yet to have. Hazy orange with a dank smell and taste of papaya mango grapefruit guava. Great beer.
"Very nice beer, had it at the same session I was having a Treehouse Julius and preferred it to that. Smoother and more complex. That said, I wouldn't drive an hour to get it and stand in line for another 30 minutes, like the Julius experience. But if it was available with reasonable effort I'd definitely be keeping it in the rotation."
"Nice bright, hazy orange color, good head and retention."
Perfect beer. Can’t say I’ve had a better one. The price is awesome too!!! NEIPA at its best.
"Cloudy gray-hued yellow with a finger of white head. Sloppy lacing. Big dank aroma with weed and fresh cut grass. Maybe a hint of mint as well. Similar tasting with some subdued citrus (lemon, clementine) and a nice grassy, bitter finish. Medium to heavy bodied with strong carbonation. This is excellent."
"I can understand why people rate this beer high. It is very approachable and non offensive, but I don't find it at special as some of their other beers."
"Cloudy peach colored gold with huge fluffy white head; long cap retention; heavy lacing. Weak lemon rind earthy hop nose. Up front flavors of lemons, bitter citrus rind, earthy hops, mango, papaya, melon; and a raw doughy cardboard (house yeast?) taste. Almost full and fluffy body, somewhat juicy feel; moderate carbonation. Overall the feel is soft and not overwhelming like some other NEIPAs; it’s not very bitter for 80 IBUs; I like the juicy fruity hops, but there is a flavor/aftertaste unique to some Bissell beers that I’ve had that doesn’t taste good to me."
Easy drink. Good after taste of hops. An ale that has a lot of ipa qualities.
"Tasted at the Bissell Bros tasting room. Pours an opaque, almost milky light haze. Smell is a piney dank. Perfect amount of full bodied haze and light carbonation on the mouthfeel. A classic hoppy but slightly less fruity version of the NEIPA. Very solid offering that competes with the best of the NEIPA category."
One of the best beers New England has to offer.
On tap at Little Tap House in Portland. Success!
Can: Poured a hazy bright yellow color ale with a medium size white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of intense citrusy and tropical fruit notes with some dank notes and light residual sugar notes is quite enticing. Taste is a great mix of citrusy notes with light tropical fruit notes with some dank notes with some residual sugar notes. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. World-class NEIPA.
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Blue Session. Hazy golden color. Aroma is hoppy and dank with milky yeast notes. Taste is hoppy, dank, juicy and bitter on the finish. A really legit IPA with a good balance of flavors."
Feels and tastes like treehouse. Solid beer.
"Dank and murky. Extremely easy to drink, and finishes super clean. Could crush this in the summer."
"Likely the premier hazy NEIPA out of Maine, The Substance has been a staple of the movement since it was first released, and Bissell Bros. has ridden that wave for quite a long while. I haven't had many of their beers (no distribution in MA yet), but what I've had has generally been solid. I've only ever had this on tap in the Portland area, most notably at The Great Lost Bear, which is far-and-away one of my favorite places to grab some all-American food in Portland while slinging back a few high-quality beers while I'm at it. This two-and-a-half-week old can comes to me by way of my good friend and homebrewing partner, Pat. Thanks dude!"
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thin foamy head. Head retention is mild. Lacing is good. Citrus aroma but more piney resin than anything else. Aroma is a little weak. Not as juicy as I would like on the taste. Low citrus and heavy piney bitterness. Not typical of a NEIPA. Still good, though."
Nothing like it. Super!
Look - moderately hazy golden brew
"after all the good stuff everyone seems to be saying about these guys, i finally get into my first of their beers. this is cool stuff, neat to have it in colorado too, this one on tap at falling rock, of course. certainly of the east coast tradition, this pours hazy yellow from the tap, straw colored, sort of matte looking, and with several inches of airy wispy pure white foam on top, a very lively brew. its got an awesome and very well rounded hop complexion, both in nose and taste, which mirror each other the whole way. its not only juicy and robustly dry hopped, there is also a nice bitterness here, fresh and piney, northwestern and intense in the finish. its a nice way to follow up the more delicate grapefruit and pineapple notes that hit a little earlier. brightly vegetal and fresh, this has that slightly harsh pellet residual bitter thing going on, like a little more post fermentation refinement would make it a bit more drinkable, but i really like its boldness. the extra grains in the mash make it silky and even creamy feeling, nice with the fruity hops, and nice in the spruce tree bitter finish. i thought this was excellent beer overall, but it really isnt all that different than what a lot of their geographical peers are doing with these styles, maybe a little more bitterness here, but its juicy dankness is right in line with current trends and with what everyone hip seems to be doing with hops right now. i really dug this though, and i hope more of their stuff makes it out to colorado..."
"Pours a hazy golden color, minimal white head. Nice strong aroma of bright citrus, some earthiness, lemon zest, grapefruit. Taste has a semi sharp bite at first, very citrusy, lemon, orange, almost spicy. Thin mouthfeel. Overall an ok IPA, I feel it is unbalanced and lacking malt and is overly hopped."
"A new classic. Eminently drinkable and highly delicious IPA from a wonderful producer. Opaque yellow and frothy. Features an understated but diverse array of fruit aromas including orange, grapefruit, and passionfruit. The palate is generous yet dry and very nicely balanced. Not quite as dense or complex as their other offerings but excellent in its own right. [fresh 16 oz. can into pint glass]"
Dfinitely worth a trip to Portland.
Appearance: After a nice bubble show the head settles 50/50 on the cloudy honey colored liquid; great retention and a splatter pattern of lacing
"Pours hazy orange-yellow in color with half inch head. Taste is tangerine, orange juice, and light pine. Super juicy, slightly bitter, medium heavy bodied. Insanely good. Hmmm, may have to make a trip to Portland."
Enjoyed this beer on draft at a local Portland Establishment. They poured this into a Pint glass which i thought was a bit odd for this beer
Canned 2 weeks ago.
"A - Pours a light orange color with one inch of foamy head. The head never entirely leaves, and I got lots of lacing on my glass."
A: Poured from the can into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is straw-golden with a half-finger of ecru-colored head on top that retains well.
Bissell Brothers - The Substance
"Tastes a bit green, probably could have used another week or two but this is a really solid beer. Hoppy all the way through, nice malt undertones. Body is there but not overpowering, feels really good for 6%"
A - nice beautiful orange amber cloudy color with a white head that sticks and leaves a nice lacing
Pours a nice straw yellow with orange notes - tons o haze...thick lacing on a white head. Aroma is peach and melon goodness with juicy fruit gum. Super smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a tiny bitterness at the end...flavors of juicy hops travel from the nose. Well done NE IPA.
On draft at Bissell.
The flagship brew. Long lines waiting to bring some of these cans home to Keene. 
"16 oz can, a few weeks old"
All around superior. Tasted fantastic on its own and up against others. Had at The Pony Bar on tap 7/27/17.
Serving: Can
"Great IPA in any scenario, always a favorite to stock up on at the brewery"
Canned 500ml. Hazy bright yellow color with a decent white head.
"Pours a cloudy/hazy bright yellow golden color with white head. Light tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, some citrus fruits, orange, grapefruit, and some piney notes on the nose; follows onto the palate. Medium bodied. Finishes with a nice juiciness complimented by a light hop bitterness."
This was poured into a becher pint glass.
"Poured from 16oz can into tulip glass. This pours a really nice soft-orange color, mostly hazy with a fair amount of lacing from a medium-sized head. Lots of peach, followed by cirtusy hops attack the nose, along with some bitter hops, and a mildly sweet malt backbone. The taste more or less follows suit, with citrusy hops up front, some fizzy bitter hops in the middle, followed by a finish that is almost like bitter hops competing with malts. Overall this is a very solid beer, but the bitterness and malts seem to be a little off balance towards the end. Good beer, but I've had much better from Bissell Brothers."
"Lovely brew. Beautiful hazy yellow. Nice lacing. I get orange rind and other tropical goodness from the aroma. Taste follows but with subtle pine, blueberry- I'm surprised there's not Mosaic in this. Balanced citrus, too, with a warm, fuzzy mouthfeel. It's complex and reminds me of Treehouse's Alter Ego. I rated Julius higher but appreciated the Alter Ego form better when sipped back to back. I'm gonna get some more of this in the future!"
"Had this out of the tap at the brewery. Amazing color. Truly golden think haze. The taste has a sweetness to it almost orangey. Smell was a little light on the nose, but great mouth numbing feel."
"Light golden with a fluffy medium head and great lacing. Dank aromas. Notes of biscuit, dank, wet pine, light tangerine and grapefruit rinds. Medium to light, nice carbonation, crushable, crisp and dry. Very solid IPA with classic flavor, lacks a bit on depth."
"Another gem from Bissell, this has the look of grapefruit juice, and the aromas are in that general direction, but more rich."
Canned late March 2017; drank 4/21/17 @ the Yarchives. 
A: hazy pale oat white yellow with lacing hanging to my glass edges.
"For a less then 7% ABV IPA, this surely is one dank of a beer. Balance is the name of the game here. Citrus, pine and the bitterness. All layered into this flavorful sip which keeps on begging for redux!!"
On tap at the brewery today.
"My friend Scott went on a run and brought back a crazy haul...Bissell Bros, Trillium and Maine Beer Co. This was the one I was least enthused about so I am getting after it first. Very impressive head retention, poured pretty aggressively into a belcher and it built up about 2 and half inches of very slowly fading head. Left great lacing around the glass. Opaque orange with modest carbonation bubbles on the side of the glass that went away quicker than the head. Interesting smell, when I popped the can I got citrus burst with distinct dankness. I was having a hard time time placing what the most prominent smell was but i pinned it down...lemon juice, like from those little yellow plastic bottles. There is undertones of orange, pine and lemon grass though. Bitter hops and grass flavors are the first thing noticed with some grapefruit on a dry finish. There is still some head left, amazingly and the lacing is hold up VERY well (bumping up the look to 4.75). The perfect amount of carbonation and hair over medium body. Overall it's definitely an enjoyable beer to drink, not as refreshing as other NE IPAs from their contemporaries but close enough to be considered in the same class. Glad I have 3 more of these though may look to trade if something interesting comes up. Cheers, Scott! Thanks for muling this back!"
Pours hazy orange with a decent head. Good retention and nice lacing. Aroma is mostly citrus and tropical fruits. Flavor follows with an accent on the grapefruit peel. Fairly soft mouthfeel and nicely balanced overall. Very yummy and very drinkable. Try it if you get the chance
16 oz can - no date on can but picked up at the brewery on 3/12/17
Undated can poured into Belgian ale glass.
"Poured a hazy orange-yellow with fine carbonation racing up to form a pillowly soft white head that lasts a fairly long time and leaves a thick lacing. Aroma and taste is what you expect from a high quality NE IPA, tropical fruit, citrus, especially lemon and grapefruit. Some pine bitterness but juicy fruit dominates."
"Appearance is a light creamy butterscotch color. Nilla Wafer beige, with fluffy off-white head"
Poured on draft into a pint glass. Pours a filthy cloudy orange with a 1 inch white head that leaves behind some spotty lace.
"Pours cloudy yellow gold color with a 2 finger foamy white head that was packed with tiny bubbles and didn't budge for a while, looking like a cloud line outside of an airplane window. This head faded extremely slowly and formed craters in the cloudy foam as it dissipated into a murky layer on top, leaving great sticky foam lacing coating the sides and rings as it went down. Nearly perfect IPA looks for the New England style. "
"From can into tulip—pours a completely opaque soft, faded orange with a thick head which dissipates rather quickly. Lacing is strong, however, and a little scum of foam remains on the top for awhile."
Pint can to a nonic style glass – gifted from a coworker that is from Maine - 10/20/15
"pours a hazy/murky yellow, nice head that lasts a while and laces. smell is actually pretty balanced for recent IPAs: dry citrus, pine, resin, and a slightly doughy malt. taste is a lot heavier on the hops and less on the malt than the smell leads on, but pine and resin are the first taste notes, then citrus (lemon?) peel and that bready sweet malt round out the taste, but don't ever take away from this being a hop-forward IPA. feel is right where you'd want it with the slightly ""thick"" mouthfeel, it. this is a killer Flagship IPA, other breweries should take notes, i'm jealous that the locals can get this pretty much on command."
"Pours a super hazy bright orange with a lingering head. Smell is tropical fruit, citrus, pine dankness, and bread dough. Taste is basically all hop flavor with the malt serving as a backbone for showcasing the dank hops. Super juicy citrus and tropical fruits, with a strong dank presence on the finish. Dry finish, as well. Feel is smooth and carbonation is about just right. Overall, awesome stuff."
Drank out of TEKU. Huge thanks to wanderingpints for sending this beer. Awesome extra!
look is hazy 
"16oz can from the brewery in Portland, ME"
11/25/2016
"exceptional IPA, masterfully crafted to delight taste, feel, and aroma in a way a hop head can appreciate"
Hazy sunset gold. White head with lace. 
Straw in color and cloudy. A little bit of head that settles to nothing. No lacing.
I don't feel like writing a review so...
"Solid IPA but very different. Pear, pineapple, and some grassiness as the beer warmed. Great body and balance. Nose is slightly tempered. Clean and crisp."
"Well, after being shut out 3 times at the brewery I finally got hold of a few fresh cans. Overall, I'd say I was a bit disappointed adter hearing & reading and trying to get some. Not a bad beer, great color, love to clody orange pour, nice head, good smell, decent mouth feel not great, not as full as Julius or some others, close, but not quite at that level. A bit of a bitter end bite. Overall a good beer, probably would buy it again if it was easy, but probably wouldnt make the drive to Portland in search of. No ""desperately seeking Susan"" opps, I mean Substance for me."
"Densely opaque dark orange with a thick, chunky off white foamy head that visibly settles down like a reverse push pop leaving coral lace."
"Appearance is a hazy yellow. Fluffy white head. Smell is grapefruit, limes and pineapple. Taste is bitter rind with lemon, lime some peach."
"L: Very hazy, yellowish orange."
Pounder can into a snifter appears a hazy pale copper color with a darker tanned to khaki cap a finger strong that fades leaving stringy lace.
"Smell - Nice aroma as the can is opened. Nothing to blow you away, but certainly there. Also the same in the glass."
thanks to Brandon for sharing this enjoyed from the can in a glass.
16oz can from Justdoit1234 (thanks man!). No apparent canning date. Served in a Wicked Weed snifter. 
"Draft at the source. Hazy yellow body with a soapy, white head. Lovely aroma of tropical citrus and uber fresh hops. Similar flavor. Refreshing and easy. Teeming with flavor. So juicy. Terrific."
"such a beautiful pour! hazy, fluffy, creamy, orange-juice-y.... the evolution of the IPA, indeed! although i am beginning to find these brews sweeter than my palate wants to handle anymore.... old age? yeah.... probably. give me my Pliny back! but still a great brew! this is delicious! and AHEAD of the curve if it was added in 2013..... right?"
"From a 16oz can, undated, purchased at the brewery 08/13/16. Served in a spiegelau."
Pours an opaque burnt orange. A finger worth of off-white head cloud full of bubbles. Dissipates quickly leaving excellent lacing.
Re-review. Canned 11/12/16. Consumed 11/19/16.
"I know you'll think I'm crazy if you're reading this review, but I both smell and taste peanut butter in this IPA. That's a first! Probably the only one who ever said it but if you try it look for peanut butter and drop me s line if you agree. Otherwise. It looks good with a hazy yellowish gold color now considered standard for a NE IPA. Smells good with citrus and peanuts. Taste misses a little on flavor. A bit muddled and not making me want to drink more. Not the most drinkable IPA."
"awesome golden orange murkieness with a bone white head that is super dense, takes minutes to recede, and leaves nice fat patches of lace on the glass. this is how i like my IPAs to look!"
"Man, I got 12 cans from the brewery and after each one gets better and better. First few were almost too fresh but a week later they are on point. "
This beer tastes like an unbalanced murky hoppy homebrew. And that's why I love it! 
"Enjoyed this beer at Robert's Maine Grille in Kittery, Maine. Pours a very hazy light gold color with a very nice white head. Smells of grapefruit, oranges, and lots of pine. Some dankness. Taste is very hop forward and very juicy. Lots of citrus flavor with lots of pine. The slight dankness comes through in the taste too. Medium mouthfeel with very little bitterness. This is a quality beer. I would say it's just a notch below the New England IPA royalty."
"Doesn't lack substance that's for sure. Too dank, too heavy on the aftertaste to make me want to sit with this one. No head, haze for days, definite malt body but too hop heavy to balance the finish"
"Poured from a tallboy into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, opaque, yellow-orange coloring, with a fluffy, bubbly, clingy, tall, white head. Aromas of bright orange rind, subtle grapefruit, lemon zest, and a subtle caramel backbone. Very juicy, with a balance nose of pine and dried grass. Flavors are very juicy and sweet forward, heavy on lemon zest and dried grass. Wow! Super juicy and insanely balanced. Solid grapefruit and subtle tropical fruit notes in there, too, with subtle pine tassel characteristics, as well. Smooth, light body that supports the overall juiciness perfectly. The aftertaste is more lemon heavy citrus and tropical sweetness, again with a subtle grassy and piney component. The dank and resinous pine notes build as you drink, too. Solid sweet and bitter linger past the dry, slightly acidic finish. Great beer!"
"This beer is all hype. When it first came out, it was amazing. They changed their yeast and now it tastes like plastic. "
"Aroma=Dank with a the hop nose that we hopheads love. Pours with no real head to mention, but a hazy, almost golden honey look. The taste is one of sheer genius, BB hit the mark on the head. I love this beer. If I could get it in Kentucky that would be great!"
Pours golden and cloudy with a nice heady that stays until the end. . Nice citrus aroma. Has nice hops very smooth. Citrus with pine needle tones. Another great beer from bissell.
"Was in Wells Maine over the 4th weekend and ran into Tullys beer emporium (lol) and asked the woman working if she had anything that she felt rivaled Heady Topper....she went into the back and laid a 4-pack of these on me...the 4-pack had a post it not on it...she was holding them for her...but said she would sell them to me...I am glad she did, they did not disappoint!"
"On tap at Bissell Brothers in Portland, ME."
"Looks like orange, smells like mangoes, tastes like grapefruit. Pretty nice but loses me at the end. Closing flavor is closer to grapefruit pith bitterness than hoppy bitterness -- lingers too long. The aftertaste here doesn't work for me. Reach for a Swish instead. Just my thoughts."
Thick color is orange pink. Dank da dank dank nose. Sweet and piney. First flavor is a citrus Pine with a smooth pine flavor. Solid beer. Tongue lingers light but easily looked past.
16 oz can.
Pours cloudy orange and thin head. Smells piney and resiny and some sort of tropical fruit. Crisp mouthfeel slight bite and drys out at the finish. This is a really nicely balanced ale
"Appearance: pours a very cloudy pale golden yellow color with a 1/2"" head that breaks apart immediately."
"Gift from a trading budding. No date on the can, but likely fresh."
"Serving: On tap at Duck Fat in Portland, ME, in a Bissel Bros glass"
"Masterfully crafted beer, it's no Swish, but it's good!"
16 oz can
"Pour is a typical NE style orange hazy hue, excellent lacing and retention."
One of the best IPAs I've ever had.
"Very very solid beer. Haze, of the deep scale with hues of gold to yellow. Mellow but pleasant aroma. Bigger in the flavor department with smooth orange and melon up front to more of a bitter grapefruit finish."
This is a great beer all around. Glad it's in their weekly rotation.
"Canned on date of either 3/22 or 3/23, I don't recall which."
"From a 16 oz undated can, pours a completely hazy, dark yellow-orange. An inch of off-white head leaves a solid curtain of lace. I love the way this looks. "
"Hazy ""piss"" yellow with a small white head."
"This batch (3/1) is no doubt my favorite to date. Appearance is just the way I like an IPA, crazy hazy and a pale yellow orange. The nose on this batch is phenomenal! Tons of pine, pops of lemon, orange and nice dankness to it with a hint of biscuity sweetness hidden as well. The taste is rock solid ! Much like the nose, it's very piney with some nice fruitiness. The malts show up to the party towards the end of the party and as the beer warms a fair bit. The feel is just right. Very creamy and smoooooooth. It's so easy to knock these back it's silly. It coats the palate nicely, and finished with a nice clean dryness that wants your mouth beckoning for more. "
L - pale cloudy satsuma orange. Watered down OJ. Course frothy head that quickly simmers down. Nice lacing!
First Bissell Bros beer. Poured from a 16-oz can into a SN/Dogfish IPA glass.
Another great IPA by the Bissell Brothers
"Color is a pale, hazy orange. Pours a half finger of eggshell head that retains well, aroma is pretty earthy. There's straw, pine, subtle hints of citrus and mango. Taste is mildly citrusy and sweet upfront, slightly floral, lots of unexpectedly bitter hops in the finish and aftertaste. Texture is creamy and light, makes me think of a wheat beer, with a slightly chalky after feel in the throat. Overall this wasn't unpleasant but not something I'd seek out in the future."
at the brewery
From 16oz can bought at brewery labeled 02/10.
A: Pulpy OJ
"Whenever my buddies and I trek up to Portland, ME on a craft beer pilgrimage, we make sure to hit Allagash, Foundation, and (of course) Bissel Brothers. The Substance is one of my favorite IPAs. I've had it on tap and enjoyed it more than a Heady Topper, even. There can be slight variation between batches, but it is always very drinkable. However, that makes it hard to pick which one I like more... The Substance, or Epiphany from Foundation (next door). Both are nice hoppy, hazy, fruity IPAs. Bottom line? Good beer. Get some. ^ ^"
"A- poured from a 16oz ca into pint glass; hazy straw color w/ little carbonation, nice head"
This is a real treat!
Poured from a can into Spiegelau IPA glass.
Canned 10 days ago.
16 oz can into tulip. No date. 
"Definitely a solid beer. Very let down though considering all the hype surrounding this brewery and beer. Was like an IPA milk shake, had 2 and felt like I just ate a 20oz t-bone. You get the mango, pineapple and orange on the nose, similar flavors in the mouth but more dank and piney and resin than the smell emits. Would drink again but not going to wait in line 30 plus minutes in addition to the hour plus drive. Good beer but not nearly on the level of Tree House, Trillium, Lawson's, Hill Farmstead, Alchemist. That's just my opinion though."
"Was really excited to try this. Just didn't do it for me and perhaps it was because I drank it side by side with other NE hoppy IPAs. Leaves malty after-taste that lingers. Juicy IPA it is but don't think it's on par with TH, Trillium and VT IPAs."
"Pours yellow/orange haze, cloudy with a two finger head. Smells of mango, orange and pineapple.. sweet with a lightly spicy hop aroma. Taste is dank, herbal and juicy, but still with some noticeable bitterness. Hop flavor profile comes in after the dank juicy wave. Bready malts come through in the aftertaste. This is a really fun IPA that does a lot of things well. Really combines that east coast unfiltered juicy ipa feel with balance and a lot of flavor and character."
Look - Lemonade/grapefruit juice type color. Completely hazed. Just how I like'em 
"Outstanding IPA with a dank, citrusy aroma. Taste of pineapple, orange rind and pre-ripe mango and papaya. More bitter than sweet with a kiss of astringency. Clean, dry finish with a lingering bitterness the cascades into the next sip."
Big thanks to SomethingClever for this
"This beer looks like pineapple jucie, or more accurately, a cross between orange juice and sweet and sour mix. Fact. I put it between the 2. It has a decent white, whispy/soapy head that leaves some spotty lacing. "
"A - Very light orange color, like a belgian wit or lighter orange juice. One finger head which reduces quickly to lacing around the glass."
Wicked good
On tap at the brewery.
A: Pours a hazed light golden color with a thin white head. Looks pretty solid.
I don't get the hype. Average brewery at best and If they weren't across the street from Allagash.........I don't think anyone would bother!
"This is another all around awesome beer by Bissell Brothers. I loved it. The color is a beautiful unfiltered golden look. Nose is present with citrus, body is sexy. Finish is crisp and delicious. Drink Fresh!!"
"Had on tap at brewery during Beer Safari in Portland. Had gotten good nods from reading BA, and then heard big love about BBB from Trillium team when I stopped there earlier in the day. So went in with high hopes."
Look: Straw-yellow in color; completely cloudy and fully opaque. Pours with a 1 finger off-white head that dies down leaving a smooth thick layer of foam on the surface of the beer. Lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.
"Wow, this was an extremely good beer. Had while watching morning football from London - something about football and beers at 10am just can't go wrong. "
"Color not sure, I drank from the can but from the top I could see yellowy goodness. Smell, clean pine/fresh cut grass smell. Taste very balanced pine and citrus not over powering at all perfectly mellow and refreshing. Overall: Awesome! I wish I lived in the distribution area."
"Beautifully hazy, juice-like in its appearance, and loaded with citrus in the nose. Tons of grapefruit and orange zest press against a slight herbal kick, making for an outstanding aroma. The hit to the tastebuds makes me want to gnaw on a grapefruit rind for comparison. It's sharp, slightly acidic, but still not overly bitter thanks to a moderate, underlying malt sweetness. Fantastic IPA."
Draught pint. Very cloudy. Screaming grapefruit.
"Pours a straw colored, slightly hazy swirl that pushes up a bone white head. Smell is not exploding as some have mentioned, but does carry forth a mix of some citrus and piney grassiness. Taste is much the same with a slightly grainy tongue finish. This is a solid IPA. It's not blowing my mind like some have mentioned, but it's quite good. I'd like to try again to see if I'm missing out on a grander experience."
I love this beer. Five trips to the brewery before I got my hands on it and it live up to the hype.
"Just there to get my Me. Beer Trail stamp and I run into THIS. Wow! I'd never heard of this but I sure have now. Tastes exploded in my mouth, all on a good way. Wound up buying two 4 packs and am now wishing I might have bought more."
"Pours a cloudy, almost murky dirty blonde with white head and some hop residue. Smells of lemon and citrus fruits. The flavor is bursting with citrus, slight chalkiness, and nice resiny bitterness. The mouthfeel is terrific in that it evolves and doesn't carry just one note. Overall, this is a really solid IPA that I would love to have as a shelf canned beer. However, I'm not sure if the yeast change was a positive development as it used to have more citrus and looked better. Still a great beer."
"9.16.15 draft @ the bissell brothers brewery portland, me"
Poured from a fresh 16oz. can into a tulip glass:
"Poured from can into a tulip glass. Smells and tastes of piney, resin dankness. Very much like concentrated buddiness. This gives way to mandarin and other tropical notes and more piney, grassy delight."
This beer is outstanding on the palate and looks great. Very refreshing and an awesome beer that is available regularly!
A - Hazy ginger colored body. Minimal head with big bubbles and some light lace around the glass.
"I will take this over Treehouse Julius any day. Super drinkable, verging on balanced. At least as balanced as a hoppy IPA should be. Nice mix between citrus and floral hops. Nice enough body to let you know it's there."
Canned on 9/02/15. 
Looks like some sort of imperial Berliner!
"Thanks to Joe_Grizzly, i.e. “The Hop Santa” for this among other lusted after IPAs that arrived recently. 16 oz. can with some kind of weird Burning Man symbol. Probably not, but that’s what it reminds me of. "
"16 oz. can picked up from the brewery 5 days ago. This is the new recipe with a revised yeast. Poured into a Tree House Teku glass. Finger of white head with a golden orange body. The head diminishes quickly and leaves some lacing. Nose is mango, tangerine and pineapple, quite appealing. Some apple and grass is present too. Taste is more of the same. Fruity start, tangerine and citrus. Pine shines through in the middle and onion is on the finish. Quite bitter but it's a vegetal/floral kind of bitterness. Smooth, thicker feel. Finish is very drying. Overall this a tasty New England style IPA. As per the new recipe, unfortunately I don't remember the last time I had this well enough to note differences. I think I like this more than the last time I had it but I also had it on draft the last time. Similar body and smell of a Trillium beer but with a harsher bitterness. Definitely another great beer from these guys!"
"If the goal of the American IPA is to simply become a grapefruit juice with alcohol, then the Bissel Brother's flagship IPA would be end game. The review could simply say, ""grapefruit juice"" and be done with it. However, getting underneath the fruit there's an understated would of ale flavors that play out under the radar of the senses."
"Super balanced. Piney, dry, bitter. Tastes like of like berries and pine needles. Very good and LOVE that it's a solid IPA under 7% abv"
"Pours a hazy yellow, almost greenish tinted, tight head that sticks around. Smell is over ripe tropical fruit - guava / papaya - along with some definite spicy vegetal notes - wet grass, crushed leaves, freshly turned compost. I can see why this isn't some people's bag, but I love the earthiness. Flavor carries through, pungent with sweet tropical notes woven in. Finish is a bit flabbier than I'd like, particularly as it warms."
Different in a good way. Very strong nose and a light body with some bold hops.
"16 oz can. Hazy yellow-gold, thick fluffy white head and lacing. Smell is citrusy, more on the lemon peel side, and sweet bread with a little grass. Taste is a zesty combination of grapefruit, pine, and wood. Better and better as it warms. A little peppery at the end. Mouthfeel is pretty soft. Overall very good IPA, different than the typical hop or juice bombs."
Poured from a 16 oz into a pint
"Pours a slightly hazed sun-yellow color, with a decent, froth head."
Very good beer. Does remind me a lot of the global warmer by six point (which is also much easier to come by). Still an enjoyable beer to try.
"Looks a bit hazy, yellow like juice with a thin white head."
Fresh cans from the brewery poured into one of their snifter tasting glasses.
Appearance - Light golden yellow. 
"On tap, pours a bright yellow color. Smells of citrus and hops. The beer has a nice citrus taste, very refreshing. The feel is crisp and clean, this a great summer drinking IPA. Its the real deal!"
Had it fresh the day it was canned. Right at the brewery. It was tremendous.
A light gold to yellow color with minimal haziness and nice white head. Moderate citrus and earthy hop bitterness in the aroma. Aroma picks up a little dankness as it warms. Flavor follows closely with bright citrus flavor and good middle bitterness. Very smooth with a clean finish.
Picked up half a case while at the brewery. Poured into my Duvel tulip.
Enjoyed while on vacation in Maine. 3 different locations on tap. Very nice ipa.
"A fantastic IPA. Pours a bright straw color and the nose contains a sweet floral tropical fruitiness with some grapefruit, papaya and mangoes. The body is extremely refreshing and juicy with a restrained bitter finish."
"A billowy white froth weighs heavy atop this golden brew, setting itself apart from the get go. Aroma is bright with orange and grapefruit. The flavor is ocean deep with more waves of citrusy goodness, a palpable layer of peppercorn, a coating of orange peel and a squirt of sweet fruit juice. Light to medium bodied with little weight and enough alcohol bite to keep plenty of hair growing on the chest."
Tap at the brewery.
"Really good beer, best when fresh."
I need more of this in my life... wish it wasn't such a drive to get it.
"Easy drinking with big, bitter citrus aroma and taste."
"can to glass..golden yellow. nose is sick...soapy inviting hops. crisp and refreshing. burst of citric, little resinous while still being nice and easy...little sticky. very refreshing."
"Lighter in color than average, carbonation bordered on fizzy - lacey beyond compare though. Dynamite smell - grapefruit from out of this world. ABV was somewhat deceptive, drinks like a session IPA, but hits like a freight train."
"Dank, earthy, sweet tobacco, some subtle fruit esters, such as coconut. Falconer's flight of hops used."
"Out of the three offerings I've had from BBB, I think this one was the best. Still, like both of the other beers I've had from them, there is a strange off-putting, dirty vegetal-like aroma and flavor that I cannot get passed. Not sure what the hype is all about."
"Can, pour is yellow, big pine and citrus aroma, very dry and bitter finish."
"A - Clear, straw body. Large fluffy head leaves heavy lacing. "
"really excellent beer -- hop forward, great mix of citrus, pine and slight malt."
It's the dankest of the dank
"A- poured a slightly murky yellow with a huge, pillowy white foam. "
"Beautiful color, perfect mix of refreshing, subtle hops and citrus."
"Very good, strong pineapple overtones and just the right amount of bitterness."
"This is earthy IPA both in smell and flavor. Cloudy, light gold color. Nice ring lace. The aftertaste is lingeringly astringent and very dry."
16oz can. Served in a snifter.
Poured from a can into an antique German Pilsner glass
Impressive to get this much hop flavor from a 6.6% IPA. Reminds me of Zombie Dust in that respect. Excellent!
"Received this beer as an extra in a trade. The appearance is quite hazy with an amber appearance. The flavor profile was somewhat citrusy with grapefruit being noticeable. In my opinion, this was a well crafted IPA from Bissell Brothers. Cheers!"
Poured from a can into a tulip 
"From the can dated 4/30/15. Sampled on May 3, 2015. Only four days old."
"Pint on draft in a standard pint glass at Hunt & Alpine in Portland, Maine."
"Drank on tap at Bissell Brothers Brewing Co., Portland, ME"
"The pour is a hazy, golden orange color with 2 fingers of fluffy white head. Has pretty good retention and lacing. "
very solid IPA. Not world class but above average for sure
Another easy rider. Every crack of a new can throws hops in your face. Very drinkable its hard to tell its almost 7%. So glad this one is year round.
A couple cans from valdieu2.
This is really great IPA.. definitely seek it out if you haven't it tried it yet.
Big malt body and a sharp stunky hop bitterness.
"Picked up some fresh cans from the brewery, canned that day 2 hours earlier."
Another great IPA from the northeast. Nice lemony citrus flavors with some tropical and floral notes. Don't really get any pine. Very crisp and refreshing with minimal malt presence. Juicy. My kind of IPA.
"Amazing, hoppy ipa. All the flavors come together for great balance."
Revisit.
"Received this as a gift. IPAs are not one of my favorite styles. Not a bad ipa, but I don't see myself ordering this in the future, but wouldn't turn one down on a hot summer day."
"Pours a sightly cloudy golden yellow with a creamy white head that laces. The nose is mainly mild citrus fruits, nothing particularly distinct, followed by some grain sweetness. The taste is a delicious mix of flavorful citrus hops that have a creeping bitterness, biscuit-y malts, and yeast - all pulled together it's pretty balanced and drinkable. The beer potently hopped, but maintains balance with a creamy sweet malt backbone and a semi-dry and bitter finish. The alcohol is minimal, but there is something funky that lingers (wet cardboard-like?). Overall this is a tasty beer, nothing to stand in line for, but definitely something I'd try again in the future."
"Fresh can from Joe arrived today at my doorsteo. Thanks man! Pours cloudy bright yellow with a big fluffy white head on top in my Rapp tulip glass. Amazing aroma of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon rind, some pine, mmmmmm. Flavor is sweet pineapple balanced with bitter grapefruit, some light sweet malts and honey notes, interesting floral potpourri flavors linger (in a good way). Light bodied with medium carbonation, very crushable, yum."
"Well Brady, way to shit your pants there. Hopefully he shotguns one of these and gets his composure back. Third can of a six pack picked up two weeks ago."
"My last of the tall boy 4-pack bought at the source while up in Portland a couple weeks ago, definitely a purchase I'm happy with. Canned on 1-16-15, one day before we were there, nice."
"16 oz canned on 1/16/2015 purchased from the source on 1/17/2015 poured into a very elegantly shaped Bissell Brothers glass marked with what appears to be glow in the dark or UV-reactive graphics. Normally would have enjoyed from the can, but had to check the color. Lightly hazed straw. Eggshell white two finger head, velvet-textured bubbles. The nose is predominately pine and all things dank, suggestions of the West coast abound. The flavor brings it back home, perfectly balanced hop bite and what I want to call fruit punch, although no fruit notes themselves are identifiable, except in fleeting whisps on the exhale. Excellent buttery feel, nice and rich but always refreshing and several cans the beer definitely can be knocked back successively. Bb is a 'must try' if in the Portland, ME area."
"A - light golden color, clear to slightly hazy, white frothy head with minimal lacing. Lighter than expected for an IPA so clear. "
One of the best IPAs I have ever had. Shit review. Amazing beer.
"Top 3 beer for me. Will wait in line for it any day of the week. A great experience from the nose, the feel, the euphoria and the taste. Well played Bissell."
Great nose. An excellent beer
"My undying gratitude goes out to my current ""Character"", Justin Chlan, who knows to look for CANned beer for me in his travels. He brought this back from a recent foray up to Maine in support of The CANQuest (TM). Cheers!"
"Ah, a fresh delicious IPA in a can. We can never have enough. I'd call it West Coast-style for the lighter body, making all too drinkable. The big, juicy hops are rich enough — with pine resin, light pepper, floral spice, and tangerine — that it's satisfying in any weather, but still drinkable in the summer. More please."
Hop bomb to the utter max! Great citrus aroma and taste.
"Top 5 favs, best off the draft with a house made sausage at the Thirsty Pig"
"Canned yesterday, drinking today! Fresh is definitely makes a big difference. I don't smell or taste as much of the citrus that other people report but I do get a fantastic hop aroma and flavor - more herbal, dank and funky - very unique flavor - can't quite put my finger on it. Smooth and drinkable. Excellent lacing and carbonation. This one has really grown on me since I first tried it. Another great beer from Maine!"
16 oz. can poured into a snifter.
A wonderful treat received as an extra via @skinny_mcginley .. 
The beer comes in slightly transparent golden orange.
"Dry hopped, but not overwhelming."
"Correct its not a Heady, but it was very good and almost just as rare.. which always makes a beer better. more hype than hop though."
"Had this on 2014-10-12 in Columbia, PA from a 16 oz can."
"L - Pours a cloudy, hazy golden yellow color, opaque, thin white lacing."
On tap in Portland...
"Yeah, this is my 5 star beer. Not easy to get. Try the Great Lost Bear and keep an eye on facebook posts for can availability."
canned 8/27
"Beautiful pale orange brew, very thick and hazy. Pours with a big, strong white head, with good retention and soapy lacing."
"16oz can into two El Cat tulips with Lisa. Thanks to Rob F. Bright orange with some retention and really nice lacing. Pine-sol, lemon, fir nose. Taste is more citrus flesh with orange, grapefruit rind bitterness, and lingering pine. Really nice, fluffy mouthfeel. Great beer overall. "
Courtesy of SomethingClever thank you beer brother! 
I really like this beer. Big fan of Baby Genius as well. I really enjoyed the citrus aroma that this big IPA
Don't pour this beer. Drink it right from the can. It is the finest Maine has to offer in an IPA. Enjoy.
"Can from MrBarleywine, thanks for the opportunity Mike!"
From a can purchased yesterday and canned 3 days ago. Very fresh beer from these guys and I'm very glad to have it!
"Pours a sunny gold with a loose, off-white head that dissipates into a slick. Nose expresses citrus rind, a hint of noble hops and a slight yeasty character. Taste consistent with nose; however the flavor are a bit duller - there's more bitterness and less citrus than suggested by the nose as well as a suggestion of onions (Summit?). Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation and some acidity. Overall, I thought it was a pretty good IPA, but don't understand the hype - I was told it may have been an older can, so perhaps I'll revisit with a fresh one if the opportunity presents."
"On tap at the Thirsty Pig, Portland ME"
"A-The Substance pours a milky, cloudy yellow hue with a tight, skinny, white head that doesn't do all too much for lacing. It almost has an oily consistency to it when I look at it. I often find that hoppy beers that come out looking like this usually offer a specific hoppiness that I really enjoy, so I am quite excited."
"The trouble with under-the-radar IPAs is that they don't stay that way for long once word gets out, and there is no better example than The Substance Ale by Bissell Brothers."
"A Poured into a beer mug, the color is cloudy golden and a little dull, but the smell totally overrides appearance. The carbonation was perfect, with a two finger head."
"Pour is pale golden in color, clear, with a white head and some fairly large sized bubbles. Nose has a fairly strong citrus with a biscuity malt and a light herbal tea note. Taste follows suit, a bit of sweet malt, lots of citrus, doughy biscuit and a light herbal hop tea finish. Sweetness is a bit stronger than we'd prefer, carb is pretty aggressive and body is slick and oily."
"1 pint can was given to me by a friend who loves hoppy beers. I thought it would be unbalanced hoppsville, but it was surprisingly pleasant. Eighth of an inch foam staid with me till the end, which is laways a bonus. Smells with a hint of citrus, amber color, tasted like.... hmmmm, I just realized it has unique taste that I never had before. Loved it."
"Aside from a reference to hops and ""ale"", there is nothing on the label of this beer that expresses what style of beer this is. Well, I guess we know it's not a lager or a gruit..."
"16oz can: This one pours an opaque, bright straw yellow color. There was a small white head on it that didn’t linger long. Nice nose. Definitely hoppy, but I get a bit of pineapple rising out of the nose. Peaches, pine, floral and grassy notes also. The taste is very good. A bit bitter. Hints of the pineapple and peaches. A bit of the pine hops and grassiness. A fairly good malt backbone, but not too heavy. Smooth and well balanced. This drinks real easy. I’d definitely search this one out again next trip up to Maine. Thanks to the guys in the brewery for sharing a can with me!"
"A: Very light, bright straw. Strong carbonation flowing and thick foamy head that lingers a great while."
Served from a 16oz can into an Alchemist Wili Becher. 
"Poured a 6 day old can into a tulip glass. Amazed by the presentation. Massive white frothy head over a super light copper-ish colored ale, thick lacing all the way down. Smells of Pine, hints of citrus and melon. Tastes of delicious hoppy, dare I say, ""Heady-like"" goodness. Not super fruity nor spicy, kind-of a blend of the two. Super smooth, tiny-bubble kind of carbonation. Finishes easy and crisp. This is an amazing beer from a company that i'm so excited about. Hopefully they continue to push out beer as good as this. Cheers."
"A: ghostly golden yellow, I swear I saw smoke inside my glass"
I had this on tap at Frontier in Brunswick. It was served in a really cool pint glass. The beer was a hazy gold color with a good-sized white head. There was a fair amount of sticky lace.
A: Pours a lightly hazy golden yellow color with a fingers worth of head that fades down to a very thin layer of tiny bubbles
On tap at Great lost Bear in Portland. Finally able to find it and looking forward to grabbing some cans. I recommend buying whenever you get a chance 
"Tasted 1/11/14 at the Thirsty Pig in Portland. Overall a truly excellent IPA, strong hop presence, with a clean finish leaving very little bitterness after the beer is gone. To me this is the ideal IPA for summertime and a fantastic beer."
"Edit: Updated my previous review from possibly the first keg sold in Portland. The beer has substantially improved since then, at least my memory of it. I'll update this review further once I have another one, but I liked how it boarders on the fruity type of IPA that is so popular now without going overboard."
Tried on 12/7/13 at the Thirsty Pig (first night it debuted?).
"From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery two days ago. Served in an imperial pint pub glass."
"Wow this is a superemely well balanced and delicate juicy IPA. Plenty of tangerine orange, grapefruit, lemon, peach, some nice piney and green notes that bring a mellow bitterness and bready malts dancing in the background. Excellent mouthfeel light/medium bodied with some slightly creamy texture."
"Growler. Poured very hazy. Aroma was pretty magnificent. They added a really neat assortment of hops in here. I love the Nelson and its nuanced aromatics. Its very fruity and tropical but there is also a good dose of pine and greens. I enjoyed the flavor a bit less than the nose but both were quite delectable. The flavor was more straightforward and slightly less intricate. Still, the combination of fruity and green was pretty excellent. Slightly earthy hop finish which I liked. Had more body than I was expecting. Creamy feel. Another stud."
Poured from a fresh growler (1 day) into a modified tulip glass.
"Growler filled on 10/17/15, splitting with Goblinmunkey7"
"L - Hazy off yellow - nice lasting frothy head, looks juicy and delicious"
25.4oz bottle. Hazy amber color with a medium off-white head. Nice citrusy hop aroma and flavor. Slight aged note but quite nice. Medium+ body and medium carbonation.
"64oz growler filled Saturday 10/17, drank from snifter 10/19. Less than one finger head, some lacing. A good beer, did not blow my mind like I'd hoped."
750ml growler poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.
"Drank from a 750 ml (25.36 fl.oz.) growler purchased at Hill Farmstead Brewery, Greensboro Bend, VT"
"Probably the best collab IPA I've ever had. Just a perfect looking beer with an exception feel. Slightly bitter, soft, yet dry. Nice balance between citrus and pine. I wanna drink this forever."
"Poured a light gold or straw color, white head. Tons of citrus aroma, I get some orange and tangerine. There is some upfront sweet citrus character, but it is defined mostly by a sticky dankness. The feel on this beer is excellent. This is a very good collaboration."
Thanks to Chico1985 for sharing this over the weekend.
"Incredible appearance; a thicker and more steady head than most HF IPAs. Excellent lacing. Smell is juicy, citrus (sour orange and lime) and grapes, with a hint of pine forest.Bitterness is lingering but seems to sit in the back of the mouth with fruit and malt dominating up front. Incredible creamy and chewy texture."
"Consumed at Blackback Pub in Waterbury, VT on Saturday 9/26. Into a snifter glass, this pours a cloudy amber color with a smaller head that stays. Big hoppy aroma on this, tons of tropical fruit and sweetness. Great flavor profile, tons of stone and tropical fruits, papaya, middle is leafy and oily hop resin. Finishes bitter and the hoppiness lingers. Body is a bit too heavy and the carbonation isn't enough to clean the palate. Overall a very well designed beer showcasing these hops, very reminiscent of Tree House's In Perpetuity."
"I purchased this Growler at the brewery in Greensboro, shared with tb69 chilled in Hill Farmstead goblets."
Hazy golden orange. 1-2 finger foamy white head. Power lacing. Smell is quite nice. Started a bit timid but getting mainly orange and lime. Taste stands out much more. Sweet and bitter citrus punches you in the mouth. Medium high carbonation. Acidity really hits the tongue. Big fan.
"Pours a hazy orange color, this beer oozes aromas of orange, pineapple, piney hops, and sweet fruits. Taste is tropic, oranges and sweet fruits. A bit acidic also. Well carbonated and a long lasting tropic mouth feel, this beer is a great coming together of two fantastic breweries. "
"A great IPA. A great collaboration. Was it not going to be? I mean, obviously these guys know their business. A nice, juicy, citrusy IPA. Smooth mouthfeel, great body on it. Full-feeling, light carbonation. Just terrific."
Enjoyed at the Armsby Abbey.
This beer is terrific and everything I wanted out of a collaboration IPA between Hill Farmstead and Alpine. 
Growler from the source.
At the source. Tastes like 2009.
"An absolutely lovely IPA in the style of Size 7 or Surly Furious, Town Hall's Masala Mama has inspired many imitators, but few can compare with the balance, delightful aroma and subtle bitter taste of the original."
Long time want - thank you Chris P!
"Pretty average IPA, moderate bitterness, sticky sweetness, fairly malt forward."
"Was super excited to try this given the high rating, but really disappointed when the beer hit my tastebuds. Had it at the tap room, very avg IPA"
Growler shipped to Nebraska. #propertownhallipaglassware 
Malty woody bitter smooth
Poured on tap at Minneapolis Town Hall into a half pint (9 ounces).
Had this on tap at Townhall.
"4.5 represents the cask pull version... Also tried a standard tap pour, I'd give that a 4.25..."
Cask. $.
"Drank from a growler. Masala Mama is a hop forward IPA with a deep copper coloring and ample white head. The depth of malt flavor caught me off guard, but was a pleasant alternative to some of the 'malt light' IPAs that are all the rage these days. I'd put this more in the category of a 'West Coast' IPA with a bit of Midwest flare. Solidly executed and rather tasty - seek this one out for sure."
"Darker than average ipa, this one is almost light brown. Aroma is its sweet spot, those Amarillo hops are all up in this one. Drops lots of pine goodness."
"Masala Mama was my first ever IPA and my first craft brew that wasn't Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. The first sip blew me away. I never knew what beer could be until that moment, and that one beer kickstarted my love for microbrews. I will always consider this a perfect beer."
They very good local Midwest IPA. Thanks to a local training partner I was able to get a 64 ounce growler of this Minnesota masterpiece...very good overall IPA but slightly more malty then my normal IPA preference
Shaker pint at the brewery. Fresh.
A special treat. Let's check this out. Poured into the work snifter from a 64 oz. growler.
"Nice old school IPA. Easy drinking, but nothing special."
My friend brought me back a howler of this from her trip to MN. The beer pours a clear golden amber color. A white fluffy head quickly emerges and lasts through a good portion of the bee drinking experience. The beer smells mallty and sweet with some citrus on the finish. The taste is about the same. Very balanced malt and citrus flavors with a sweet finish. Overall a nice beer but the more IPAs I drink the more I realize that I'm a hop forward typ of guy.
Freshly filled growler (2 days old) poured into a snifter
Drank from a 64 fl. oz. growler
Pours a deep Amber color. Thick off white head that lingers nicely. Some lacing on the glass. Earthier hop aroma and malt present on the nose. Very well balanced hop-malt flavor profile. Starts with the sweet malt flavor and leaves you with nice bitterness on the aftertaste. Reminds me of a rye-style IPA with that crisp dryness. Medium feel with good carbonation. Overall a nicely done beer
"Clear red. Beyond amber. Beautiful and bubbly. Thick foam head that might not have ever gone away if I didn't start drinking it. Not much on the nose. More sweet malt than the earthy hops. Well balanced taste. Sweet flavor followed by a crisp bitterness. Very smooth, but carbonation present."
"Drank a 64oz growler of this over a day. Solid IPA overall, poured darker than expected but great head retention from a 3 week old growler. Hop profile was good but the beer was maltier than I expected."
Had on cask at the brewery. Silky smooth nice bitterness with a great hop to malt balance
L - Amber color about 1 finger thickness
"this is very good ipa, no doubt about that, but i expected (with all the hype and very high ratings) this to be memorable and world class, and i think its a league below some of the best ipas out there. that said, its also excellently made, and just a slightly different take. its more in the english style it seems, and not because it has any real appreciable yeast to it, but because of the richer grain bill and the focus on balance rather than hop explosions. this may also have been ahead of this time, if i tasted this beer however many years ago they first brewed it, it would have seemed a lot more unique than it does now. i say the same about pliny, the rest of the world has caught up to that beer a little bit, and the same may be true here. its got a clear shiny copper hue, with a full inch of white head on it. smells balanced, i get as much crystal malt sweetness as i do the hops, which seem well dosed but not insanely interesting as far as the aroma is concerned. in the taste, its familiar northwest hop varietals, with some resinous elements, but really quite reserved in terms of weight and bitterness. the balance is exceptional, but in my heart i wanted this one to stand out for flavor, not just for quality. still an excellent ipa, but i think its not all that distinct."
Very bitter but not very hoppy. Lots of grain flavor and not much else...disappointed overall.
"This beer was served on tap at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Arriving in house pints, the beer showed a reddish honey coloring. A one finger head of soapy, tan bubbles stop atop the liquid, and retained excellently. Cakey chunks of lacing were eventually left in its wake. No haze or sediment was noted, and carbonation appeared to be light. The aroma offered big fruity nectary, grapefruity, and herbal hops, amber and pale malts, chalked cornmeal, chemical phenols, spicy booze, light bubblegum esters, tropical pineapple and mango fruitiness, Juicy Fruit gum, raw ginger, black pepper, cherry flesh, Sprite lemon-lime sugars, cough syrup, vinyl plastics, and syrupy pear juice. Subsequent flavoring boasted pale and caramel malt toast, big bubblegum esters, juicy pineapple, heavy fruity hops and lighter piney and citric hop zing, tomato acidity, apricots, sweet creamer, bittering dried oregano and lemon balm, lemon and lime rind, mallow sugars, red apple juice, hairspray, and cucumber skins. With warmth and through the aftertaste, the hops took on a much more surprising herbal bitterness. The body stood on the full side of medium, which carbonation was medium to high, with wet and frothy prickle to the hard palate. Otherwise, slurp, smack, cream, and pop were okay, and the mouth was left puckered and dried of tannins. The abv was appropriate, and the beer drank more as a sipper."
"After a pretty disappointing seasonal flight at Town Hall last weekend, I opened this growler in hopes that this IPA would live up to my memories of it (5 yrs ago or so). Happily it was just what I remembered - very fragrant with a fine balance between malt and fresh hops flavors. Hints of grapefruit, pine and maybe bubblegum? Medium-thick body with smooth mouthfeel. This does seem more in line with an English-style IPA in my opinion - a bit sweeter up front, providing a good counterweight to the bitter yet fresh finish. One might argue that it lacks subtlety but the Masala Mama is a crowd pleaser with good reason."
"Pours a hazy, amber with a thick cream colored head. Grapefruit, pine, brown sugar, and floral hops on the nose. Pine resin, malt, and citrus zest on the palate with a hint of sour apple. Bitter. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Overall a bold IPA from Minnesota."
Stellar everything. Hops dominate and the Brewers had the awesome sense to not let the malts confuse anything. Hops hops hops.
"My favorite Twin Cities IPA. Always on tap and always outstanding. Best when available on cask. Plus, there's always a Whitey sighting at THB."
"Thanks to Tricerahops for a growler of this. Stamped Sept. 24, 2014 on the cap."
"On cask, this is my favorite beer of all time. I can't find a single fault in this beer."
"I have always had this on tap, cask-conditioned (perhaps that is the only way to get it). A truly delicious, very authentic IPA. Very well balanced."
Had this on tap at the brewery. Pours a amberish orangish color with a 1 inch finger of head. Has nice lacing. Taste is very bitter with an old school hop flavoring. Lingering dry finish. Not much malt character with this beer. Overall an ok IPA.
"On draft at the brewery, Minneapolis. "
"On draft at the brewery. Appearance is golden in color, a tad darker than a typical IPA. I don't get much aroma, maybe some pine. Taste is bitter - grapefruit, and spruce. Carbonation is medium-high and it goes down easy despite the bracing bitterness. Overall an enjoyable beer but nothing special."
"Gift from a buddy in Minneapolis when he came down last weekend. Brought me this and their altbier. Heard a lot about it, so pretty excited. First try - grossly underimpressed. However, I preceded that one with a Permanent Funeral, so it deserves a second, clean chance."
"A-Pours a mostly clear, glowing orange color. Thinner head. It leaves smaller rings of lacing."
Big thanks to yamar68 for this one.

"Masala Mama pours a deep cooper color with a small lacing head. There was an enjoyable mild floral aroma. The taste had a well balanced flavor, but then finished with a nice floral taste. Full bodied flavor, and finishes very crisp. Overall a very high quality IPA."
A - Pours with one finger of white head on top of a amber-brown body. The head settles at a moderate pace and leaves decent lace on the glass.
"Two finger dense head with scattered lacing on a clear deep amber body. Aroma is excellent with floral, toffee, grapefruit and orange peel citrus, earthy hops and subtle pine notes. Flavor also is excellent with strong hop presence with a toasted malt base. Hop character includes tart citrus, floral, pine, earthy and slightly herbal hops. Basically all major hop notes in one but the impressive part is how they are still distinct and well defined making this one very complex. Medium body and moderate carbonation. One of the best IPAs I have had. This one is up there with Pliny the Elder just more on the tart and pine side."

"Growler courtesy of beeranddogs. Pours a hazy reddish orange with a big yellow, creme head that has good lacing. Nose of red fruits, pineapple, unripe pear- overall dank tropical hops with a big malt presence. Taste is heavy, dry, bitter, cedar, woody, well-balanced. Pretty earthy but not piney or astringent. 8/4/7/4/14=3.7"
"This is a good IPA. I am not crazy about them normally but this seems as close to perfect as you ar going to get. very nice smell and very drinkable but it still has that dishwater IPA appearance. not overdone of over complicating it, tehy have a winner here. i would drink this again without question."
"Pours orange-amber with a half finger of creamy head. Light lacing. Smells of pine, pineapples and mangos. Taste is a bouquet of hops..pine, citrus, pineapple, mango..moderate bitterness delivered throughout, refreshing, wet, with a medium creamy mouthfeel. Finishes dry with light bitterness. No need for a long winded treatise, this is excellent from start to finish and a very very good IPA."
"Delightfully hoppy, this local Twin Cities beer SHOULD be the one everyone seeks out (as opposed to the similar but inferior Surly Furious). Very smooth pour and bitter taste, this has a hint of sour fruit to it that I enjoyed much. The Town Hall Brewery is also a very fine venue with lots of great atmosphere and beers to choose from on any given day. The piney smell of this beer previews a delightful tasting experience."

"Thank you to MBrausen for providing me with a growler of this. The growler made a nice, crisp, CO2 pop, which made me happy. Pours a clear, light amber color with a large, off-white head. Scent is nice and hoppy...very nice hop aroma with some floral hops as well. Not much maltiness going on, which is surprising since this isn't from the west coast. Taste is very well balanced with some dry hoppiness and a nice amount of hop resin. Floral hops with pine and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, I can understand the hype over this beer...as its drinkability and easy sessionability is ridiculous. I could have drank this whole growler by myself. Unfortunately, I feel like its fame will die off shortly, as there is nothing overly ""stand-outish"" about this beer. Very well done though."
Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for orchestrating this trade
Thanks IrishColonial for sharing this growler!
HUGE thankyou to biglobo8971 for sending this to me in round 3 of the growler BIF (along with a TON of other well thought out selections). Splitting this with my wife as the superbowl kicks off (GO BIG BLUE!!!)
"12/23/10. Huge thanks to DalzAle for this growler at the QC Christmas tasting! Growler. Nice orange pour with a fluffy off-white head. Huge tropical fruits, pine, citrus, and a dash of caramel in the aroma. Awesome sweet tropical fruits blended nicely with caramel and more. Stellar."

"A: Copper-golden color, with a fluffy two-finger head. Fine lacing."
"Growler received in trade from phisigben, thanks for the opportunity. Shared after a long day with HopasaurusRex. Pours a deep golden color with a decent bubbly white head that displays moderate retention and lace. Smells fantastic. Floral, pine, citrus and tropical fruity hops with hints of sweet bready malt deep underneath. Taste is resinous, fruity, pine, and citrus hops with a bit of sweet bready almost caramel malt. Fairly dry with a medium to light body. Moderate level of carbonation with a resinous mouthfeel. Nice flavorful hopification of a beer. If I lived in MN I would drink this all the time, but since I don't I'm glad I got to try it."
"Golden amber sunshine fades over a pineapple mango garlic forest. What mad scientist thought that citrus and garlic go together? Whoever he was, he was a genius. The captivating aroma gives way to a sensational dance of hoppiness on my tongue. I could drink pint after pint after pint of this. "
"Got this growler from biglobo as a warning shot, to which I say holy crap. This beer is beautiful. It is a clear amber color with a nice dense head which leaves sheets of lacing. The retention is outstanding as well. Aroma is huge. I could smell tropical pineapple other citrus hops the second I opened the growler. The aroma is extremely pungent with a bit of caramel balance to the huge hops. Flavor is again packed with tropical hops. Mild bitterness with outstanding balance. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy for me, but carbonation is on point. Overall this might be one of the best hop beers I have ever had. Outstanding."
Served at the town hall tap.
"Generally, my drinking tastes have always run towards stouts/porters, wheat beers, and recently, Wee Heavies. All these beers have in common is that they are not hoppy styles. Not that I disliked hoppy beers, I just wasn't acclimated to them. Back in January I paid my first visit to Town Hall tap. After trying a few things, I ordered a Masala Mama, knowing full well what it was. I finished it, would probably say I liked it, but my buddy got plenty of laughs at my many winces and cringes."
"Had this on 2011-11-18 in Minneapolis, MN. Our group bought a growler to take back to the Holiday Inn next door to the brew pub. Since it had been less than an hour since leaving the pub, the brew tasted the same as on-tap."
You had this beer. 
"A: golden amber color, clear, with a decent head that stays as a thin layer for the glass. Sticks to the sides of the glass very well. "

Enjoiyed on 8/22/11. Reviewed from notes. A huge thank you to BT for hooking me up with this one:
"Received this growler from skipanoka2, thanks a lot man I've wanted to try this for years. Split this three ways so I had a good 21 ounces of this stuff. Color is dark orange and the head is billowing and huge, no lack of carbonation here. Smells like caramel and a bit of hops thrown in for good measure. The taste is really chewy caramel with a bit of pine and a very strong bitterness on the finish, very bitter. Overall I liked it."

Big thanks to younger35 for the hookup on this growler. Split with angrybabboon. Filled 9/19/2011. Consumed 9/24/2011.
"Growler courtesy of dougofthefuture. Thanks Doug. Pours a reddish amber with a finger tall white head that has good retention and lacing. The aroma is bready malt, biscuit, a lot of mango, and a bit of pine. The taste is sweet bready malt, some biscuit, a bit of pine, with mango flavors coming in late. Nowhere near as much mango as in the aroma. The finish is bready with a decent bitterness. Light bodied and very drinkable. Medium-low carbonation. I really enjoyed the mouthfeel. Not the best IPA I have had, but quite good. Definitely one of the better malt forward IPAs. The aroma is quite awesome, but the taste is slightly disappointing."
"The Marsala Mama IPA was quite good. the Appearance was a nice copper color and clear. The beer had a nice white thick head that laced great. The smell was a combination of hop (four hops used - amarillo, cascade, centinnial, and semcoe (I think I have it right) and malt. the malt is used to balance the flavor and bitterness of the hops. The taste was very good, but not as nice as the West Bank. The combo of hops gave pine and citrus notes with some bitterness that was balanced by malt. The mouthfeel was good, but 1-3 per sitting would be sufficient."
Received this in a trade with biglobo8971.
"Thanks to theduderules for the growler! Technically sent to my girlfriend, but who's counting?"
Big thanks to beefmental for this growler... Been trying to procure this one for a while and he finally hooked me up!
Thanks Rich (phillybeer7779) for sharing this special growler.
"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one! Served from growler into a Mikkeller flute. Poured red-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, butter, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The caramel note I got on the nose did quite well with balancing out the acidity of the citrus notes I was getting and made it quite pleasant on the nose. The flavor was also nice with the butter character mixed in with the citrus acidity as well. Just a well done brew that I would enjoy having again and again. A definite must try even if you aren't trying to tick the Top 100 list."
"64oz growler thanks to UMNbeerhunter, this one was poured into my Duvel tulip."
"Note: Do not base a beer review off drinking it when you have an ear infection. Yeah, I was totally underwhelmed with this when I drank my first beer of it. 72 hours later, I was much happier (because the taste was back and my infection was gone)."
Enjoyed at the Town Hall brewpub.

This was my second beer at the brewery from a recent trip up to Minnesota.
Poured from a growler into a Deschutes snifter. Date on the growler was 6/17/11.
Had on tap at Town Hall Brewing. Nice white foamy head with good appearance in the glass. This has a perfectly subtle nose with nice hops presence. The mouthfeel on this never let's your down nor does the taste. Good mix of hops and fruit create a great balance in this beer. You can never go wrong with this beer.

A ~ Golden amber-copper in a color....with a slightly off white colored half finger thick head.... not bad for sittin in the fridge for about a week
"A - pours an amberish orange from the tap and puts on a fun show that most cask beers perform, akin to a Guiness on tap. When the storm settles, it left a really nice creamy head that never left."
"Well, I was eating & drinking and loving life. The Masala Mama was a world-class IPA. Quenching with a nice resiny bitterness of grapefruit. Super session-able at under 6% - now if they only put this gold into bottles the world would be a much better place."
"Having been wanting to try this for some time, so big thanks to Chriscrundwell12 for the growler. Greatly appreciated."

Pours a hazy reddish/orange amber with a great creamy meringue like head and super sticky lace. Nose of fruity hops both citrus and tropical notes, floral and piney hops as well as a good deal of caramel malt sweetness. The flavor is full of hops, lots of citrus and tropical fruitys, floral and pines, strong caramel malt, somewhat sweet with some residual sugars as well. Light to medium body with a good amount of carbonatinon and not much alcohol kick. Overall, one of the better brewery-only IPAs I ever had especially the cask version!"

"A large part of the reason I initially joined BA almost 2 years ago was to find new and exciting IPAs, little did I know the great appreciation this site would give me for tons of beer styles and individual beers. When I first joined this site, Masala Mama was the #1 rated IPA. After learning it was only available at one brewery in the entire country I pretty resigned myself to never trying it, yet, here I am with a fresh growler sent from arvjunk to enjoy. Thanks again Ankur."
"I've held off on reviewing this for quite some time, as it's kind of my go-to trade bait. That being said, after picking up a growler for hockey tonight, I figured it's time."
"Had this on tap at the brewpub. Pours a very pretty orange amber brown with medium tan head that sticks around for a long time. Nice lacing on this one for sure. Nose is where this rocks for me. Very fresh citrus hop aromas, with some leafy notes that add to the freshness as well. The flavor follows with a solid IPA, big citrus notes, followed by a good deal of bitterness, carried through over a slightly sweet malt bill. Assertive and well-done. A very good beer here. Nice body, and wayyy too easy to drink."
From growler to Bruges hybrid glass on 3/5/11
"I can remember wanting to try this beer ever since I joined BA over three years ago; this is my first time. I have to thank Nittanybeerfan for shipping a growler of this back home from his trip to Minnesota for the Men's Big Ten Swimming & Diving Championships. There is no way randawakes could tick this beer and not me, so he graciously shipped the growler back and hand bottled me two. As soon as they arrived they were put in the fridge and opened the same night. "
From notes:
I was excited for this growler while at Normyk's place for a tasting on 3/5/11.
"A - deep amber, amazing head and lacing. Great looking beer."
"Pours amber golden with a strong head despite being a growler. A good amount of lacing and the head sticks around for quite a while. Really solid aroma of hops and citrus. Some nice orange scents as well as grapefruit. Very floral as well. Tastes sweet and hoppy. Some really nice almost caramel malts backing up huge citrus flavours. Very complex and yet, highly drinkable. I see why this beer has such good ratings. Top notch"
A- light orange with a nice white one finger head that sticks around
On tap at the brewpub. Was lucky enough to be able to make it out to Seven Corners while I was in town for 2011 Big Ten Swimming and Diving Championships. This was served in a traditional shaker pint glass.

"Happy to have the chance to try this. Enjoyed on tap at the brewery. Pours a deep copper brown with a lacy beige head. Lots of bitter citrusy hops and sweet bready malts. Crisp, clean body with a lasting resiny finish. Great IPA, would love to have this at my local bar anytime!"
A- Neverending thick frothy head on a crystal clear dark red beer. Lacing is awesome and so is everything else. Step lacing on the sides of the pint glass.
Absolutely sexy beer. I got a little hard. Seriously. I'm in love. 
Draft. Poured into a big imperial pint glass @ Town Hall Tap a slightly hazed amber orange color wih a slight off white 1 finger head. The head is rather thick and leaves sticky lace on the glass. Aroma of sweet citrus rind hops. The taste is slightly sweet upfront that transitions to a long drawn out citric bitter hop flavor. Ends with a lingering bitterness. Medium mouthfeel. Super easy drinking. Zero alcohol notes. This is a pretty near perfect IPA for me being well balanced and easy drinking.
Thanks goes to UMNbeerhunter for the opportunity to try this. Great beer advocacy.

On cask at the brewpub today.
Thanks to joshuaseresse for the growler!
Had this on on-tap at the brewery. It is essentially a perfect example of the American IPA. My only problem was that it was its flavour almost one dimensional and predictable. 
"Had this at the brewery before my flight back home. Poured into a pint glass. Review from notes. Had this from a growler a few times and loved it, so I figured the cask version is a must try."

Had this one straight from the source while in town for Darkness Day. Reviewed from notes. 
"Enjoyed many times over the recent years. I can't decide which is better... drinking it on the Townhall patio or at home out of the growler, ah my dilemma "
"Orangish-copper pour with a big, loose, white head. Loads of mango, melon and citrus in the aroma, with notes of yeast, toffee, lemon zest, and orange zest. The flavor follows through from the aroma with lots more mango and melon dominating. There's a bit of resinous pine and a distinct dankness in there too. There is also just some slight perceptible alcohol on the finish as well. The body is medium-full and dry with soft carbonation."
"Thanks a million Brandon....This doesn't look like it was poured from a growler that traveled half way across the country just several hours ago. Aroma of citrus rind, grapefruit some bready notes from the malts and even some a slight touch of piney hops as well. Medium to fuller bodied with average carbonation and a slight bitter finish. Flavor of fresh floral hops, grapefruit, citrus rind and some earthy notes mixed in there as well. One of the most balanced IPA's I've ever had the chance of enjoying."
Many thanks to mothman for this growler! 
"A- Deep amber color, nice lacing, thick creamy head"
"Huge thanks to the world class Translucent for this one. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice amber color with a thin white head and thin lacing. The smell is great, nice piney hops with a solid malt backbone. A faint aroma of sweet caramel with a bit of tropical juiciness. The taste is upfront with hops and leaves a nice bitter finish. The hops compliment the rest of the flavor profile pretty well. The malt comes through nicely with a slight juiciness. The body is very light with good carbonation. Very drinkable beer, I'd love to get more of this stuff."

"Thanks to Ryan011235 for this growler, poured into a Duvel tulip (and speedily forwarded from a midwest BA). Seems to have survived the MN-&gt;OH-&gt;SC journey just fine; an initial 3 finger creamy head atop the slightly hazy amber body slowly reduces, leaving plentiful sticky lacing in its wake."

"After a day of toil, painting the walls/ceilings/trim of my wife's soon-to-be garage/pottery studio, a call for 'beer!' by my trusty buddy Barry was answered with 'Masala Mama!' by me.

"What a great beer! I really loved this one and would like to try more from the same brewery. Thanks for sharing, Lance! Pours orange with nice clarity, a great head and nice lacing. Pretty impressive from a growler. Wonderful floral and pine aromas- big and juicy. For me, the taste is perfectly balanced. Piney and dry with just enough firm malt to support the hops. long, delicious bitterness on the finish. In the mouth it's quite dry- almost asprin-like in its dry astringency. Superb beer."
"Orange color, somewhat murky. White, soapy head with great stick. Just had one of the tap, and the beer engine version is a little less assertive in the nose, but still fairly hoppy with lemongrass notes. Strangely woody as well. "

"I wish there was an easier way in these reviews to differentiate between the cask, tap and growler versions of this IPA because they are practically different beers!"
"Part of my trek to Minneapolis was to get this beer and the mango version on draft. Mission successful. Generally speaking, I enjoyed both of these IPAs but especially enjoyed the mango. I think it narrowly edges out the original in flavor."
Poured 6/19 from a growler filled on 6/17 into a pint glass.
Had to try this one on cask. 
Growler courtesy of markhvizdak into a Duvel tulip.
From notes- drank 5/17/10. 64oz growler into chouffe tulip.
"growler shared with Davolebomb and some Thai food, split and served in standard pint glasses..."
Growler poured into a tulip. Huge thanks to beerwolf77 for sharing this one!
bottled 5/31/10
"Pours a reddish to copper color with a nice tan head. In the aroma, piney hops. In the taste, piney hops and green apples, a touch of nice maltiness. A bitter and medium bodied mouthfeel, with dry, piney hops in the aftertaste. Bigs hops and very nice."
"How good do IPA's get (notice I didn't distinguish regular IPA's from Double IPA's), well I'll let you know in just a moment. I have extreme high hopes for this beer."
On tap in a pint glass at the brewpub on 5/22/10
"Had this on tap at the brewery, but drinking from a growler I got to go as I write this review. "
A - Clear amber color with a nicely soapy looking white head. Some chunk lacing as I drank which faded into some fine stick as time went on.
Growler sent to me by younger35.
Poured from a 64oz growler into three pint glasses. Thanks to Steve and Chris for the assist! Extra special thanks to Phil and Amanda for bringing this back from MN!
"Received a growler of this in a trade with cope0021, thanks man! Poured into my SN 30th Anniversary tulip."
Live review at Town Hall. 
I'd like to thank the mully..beautiful!
64 oz growler shared and poured into an American tumbler pint. 5-5 written on cap. (Tapped over DLD weekend and brought down).
thanks to FreshmanPour77 for bringing me a fresh growler in great condition.
About time I've rated this beer
Served from a 64oz. growler acquired from a trade with chixdighops and nbeattie (Thanks!) into my Brooklyn Brewery snifter at the appropriate temperature (03/20/10)
A huge thanks to GregMcQ for sharing this with me and some other BA's. 
Thanks to GregMcQ for sharing a growler with me and some other BAs.
Thanks to younger for this brew. Shared with my homebrew club out of the growler.
Was looking forward to trying this. Thanks Ipafool for sharing your growler. 
"A-pours a brilliant glowing reddish copper color liquid that has a nice op haze. the head is thick, pillowy, off white in color. Lots of head from an aggressive pour that has huge retention and sticks all over the glass. Looks so good!"
Enjoyed this beer while meeting other BA's. Had this on both cask and on-tap back to back. Either way a great beer. 
Spent the evening with friends at Town Hall and got to finally enjoy this beer.
A - Slightly cloudy burnt orange / golden color with a quarter inch of thin head that does leave a fair bit of lacing for as little as there was of it.
Poured from growler into Duvel Tulip.
Served in a pint glass on cask at the brewpub
"I've had this twice now at Minneapolis Town Hall on business trips. The first time I had this I had it with a burger after drinking a few other IPAs at a joint down the street. I didn't particularly enjoy it but thought this was due to my lack of palate from earlier IPAs and the food that I had. The next (and last) time I tried this it was my first beer of the day and I drank it without food at the same time; however, it was the same --- I just didn't dig it that much."
Fresh growler shared by mymrnngjckt at a recent tasting.
Tried this courtesy of barleywinefiend at last night's central coast BA gathering. Thanks Josh!
"Poured a light orangish color with good carbonation. Nose is outstanding. Fresh hops, floral, dry itterness and caramel. Taste is very smooth and subtle. Floral notes, just enough hop bittering, balanced, light booze. Mouthfeel is a bit think, dry and floral. Very drinkable."
Finally made it over to Town Hall to try this one this holiday season with family. 
Thanks to biniek13 for sending me a growler of this and crossing another off my want list. Poured from a growler into my Dogfish shaped pint glass. pours a dark amber color with a off-white half inch head. The head subsided but left a nice covering on top of the beer and left excellent lacing on the glass.
I've been waiting to try this for a while and a final thanks to mnjeff for this!
Huge thanks to BigDank for sending me this growler. Shared with my girlfriend's dad before Christmas dinner.
"Pours copper in color (""like a penny,"" as noted by bulletrain76 Senior), with moderate wet lacing and minimal retention. ""Meh."""
64 oz. growler into a glass pint.
"Growler shared by bret27. Copper colored with a lasting white head. The aroma has a nice spread of fruity hops: peach, pineapple, citrus. There is also a sweet floral side and a hint of caramel. The flavor is mild on the bitterness, which is a little more apparent than IBU numbers might suggest due to a strong bready, crackery malt side. Fruity and floral hop flavors blend in pretty well, creating a pretty balanced overall package. Lighter in body with smooth carbonation. Lots of malt flavors for an IPA, with just enough hops to balance them out, but it is not a sweet beer, adding to a very drinkable, almost session-like presentation for the style. I would peg this more like a hoppy pale ale, but a fun beer with an interesting mix of flavors for the style."
Growler courtesy of dougofthefuture
Received in trade from supercolter was looking forward to trying this one for ahwile and did not disapoint.
thank you to craig who brought this growler all the way back from the Minn.
"Made a special trip to Town Hall Brewery upon visiting my future in-laws. This destination beer, the rest of their quality brews and excellent decor make for a truly epic brewpub experience. "
"Growler courtesy of Faro, I've been itching to try this beer for a while, and I was a little disappointed. The beer pours a darker amber orange that I usually associate with imperial IPAs. There is a thick bone white frothy head that fades to a tight ring, leaving behind small traces of oily lacing."
"I got a growler of this brew in a trade with feloniousmonk, Thanks a ton Al!"
"Got this in a recent trade, wanted to drink it while it's fresh but slowly to savor it so I have been nursing it slowly the past couple days. Thanks again, Brad!"
Thanks to mistofminn for this one from the 8 Men In Baseball Playoff BIF.
This growler managed to make it all the way from Minnesota to Brooklyn in fine form. The pour is pretty. Fluffy white head and a deep amber color. Scents are punchy and lovely. Floral hop aromas with a mild sweetness. Hop flavors are mostly grapefruit which is not my favorite hop profile but I can't deny the tasty that lives in here. Plenty drinkable with an edge of a seltzer finish. I think I was expecting a bit more of an impact given all of the praise but this is indeed a fine friend. I would love to be able to get this on a regular basis fresh from the tap.
"Made a bee-line to Minneapolis Town Hall when I got into town for Darkness Day. First serving was a Barrel Aged Grang Cru that was amazing (another story). I've had this from growler thanks to maximum12. This one from one of the cask engines. Pours a surprisingly cloudy and a dark shade of amber with better than full finger stiff chalky yellow head that resists fading, leaving sheets of Belgian lace behind. The smell is aggressive and an amazing sweet lemon-orange citrus combo. Slightly less carbonated than my growler, the mouth feel is medium bodied and creamy smooth. Full flavored, the taste isn't as sweet as the nose; the presence of citrus mix is overridden by oily notes of pine that linger nicely. At less than 6% ABV this one is a killer session."
Poured from a growler....thanks Lordsloth!! 
"Has a beautiful amber orange color with an off white head with good retention.Smells like grapefruit peeling with some mango. The taste is the same, has a nice combination of sweetness from the malt and bitter hops. This is a well balanced beer, and is very smooth and easy to drink. This is a very good beer. I recommend trying it if you get the chance."
Had on tap at the brewpub in August 2009. 
"On tap at the Town Hall, one of those ""holy shit did I really just drink that?"" beers."
I drank this from a growler into a chalice.
"Enjoyed at Town Hall Brewery in Minneapolis, MN. Pours a dark gold body with a fluffy, off-white head. Aroma was of spicy floral hops. This beer was full bodied with spicy carbonation. The flavors boasted lots of nutty malts and a ton of hops that was a bit astringent tasting. My friend Bob got it as well, but on cask. The color was a bit darker with thousands of tiny bubbles making up the foam, like a nitro stout would have. Hop flavors were a bit muted from the original version, and it had this great creamy mouthfeel. I recommend the cask version over the regular version."
"This growler came courtesy of tytoanderso....many thanks for the opportunity. Pours out a red amber color (pretty dark for an IPA) and a one finger white head that lasts for quite a while. Very sticky and sweet hop resins lift right off the glass in the aroma, along with some honey and tropical fruit such as mango and pineapple. Taste is very interesting in that the hop profile comes through the palate in waves of varying sweetness and bitterness. You really get mostly hops with this beer as far as flavor in concerned, with some caramel sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation providing a nice prickly feeling on the tongue, and is well balanced. Drinkability is good with this one in that works as a session beer. Final thoughts are that this beer might not be entirely worthy of the hype. Is it good? Yes, maybe even great, but I am still sort of surprised that this one sits at the top of the class with so many others (Blind Pig, Sculpin) that are far superior in my opinion. Oh well, still an awesome beer that I would go for again and again if available. Cheers"
drank on 5.8.09 from a growler so generously sent to me by natasharai - thanks Tash!
"growler, Christmas in September! thanks again Noah!"
Received in a trade today from maxium12.
Growler thanks to deliriumfest.
"Re-review based on a growler shipped by Buebie -- expedited at my request. Thanks, Brian. "
Thanks to rlcnmeyer for lugging this one back for me. Growlered on 08/17 as per the cap on the jug.
Another big thanks to mothman for hookin me up with this growler.
"GROWLER TIME! Yeah, this was sent to me by BDLbrewster, who over delivered with this trade. He may be my favorite person in the world right now. Poured into a big Bordeaux Schott Zwiesel glass."
thanks to justn for the trade
Growler sent to me by mnjeff. Thanks Jeff! 
"I was in Wisconsin for a friend's wedding and decided to expand my beer horizons. I was able to convince my wife, sister-in-law and brother-in-law to take a side trip to the town hall brewery just after getting off of the plane."
Growler thanks to mnjeff.
"Thanks to FtownThrowDown for sharing the growler. I've had this from a growler about 4 times, draft once, and cask once... it's about time I review it :)"
Got this in a trade with mnjeff. Thanks Jeff!
Growler received through trade with younger35..thanks Dan.
"This is my first review, so apologies for form. I just bought this growler from Town Hall, which is in my neighborhood and which over the last 2+ years I've enjoyed thoroughly when I'm not slumming it at one of the other fine drinking establishments in the Seven Corners."
GLASS: Pint Glass
"A perfect pour from a growler results in a three finger rocky light tan head that almost creeps over the top of the glass. head has amazing retention for a growler pour and leaves tons of swiss cheese lace. Body is a beautiful amber tone. Nose dances with fresh hop feel, including orange rind, tangerine, and sappy marmalade. Lush, fresh and crisp with first sip as the hops are so smooth. Well presented citrus tones are followed by some mineral and slightly piney tones. Hops really run the gambit here in this brew. Citrus rind bitterness hangs on to the back of the tongue to create a hop lovers perfect mouthfeel. This is an insanely drinkable IPA. If this was available locally I would go through one every week."
I had the chance to sample a good amount of this from a fresh growler shared generously by BMan1113VR at The Lost Abbey tasting bar on the evening before Christmas in July.
"Growler, have had it on tap/cask as well. Pours amber with a thick white head. Strong pine hops in the aroma. Flavor has quite a bit of caramel up front, with some bitter pine hops in the background. A touch of citrus rounds it out. Finishes bitter, very bitter. This is definitely one for the bitter freaks. I could definitely use some more flavoring and aroma hops in the one, then it might be amazing."
Many thanks go out to Mothman...aka Ben. You totally rock with this LIF win beer.
Thanks to deliriumfest.
"I had this from both cask and tap on the same night, side by side. The appearance on both were relatively the same... mildly cloudy yellow-orange with a fantastic frothy head that lingers the entire time and great lacing. "
"Acquired via trade with younger35. Thanks for hooking me up, Dan!"
"On tap July 7th right before the Twins v Yankees game. Ordered 2 pints, each one about a 13oz pour with very little head well below the rim."
on tap @ Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery
"Dark amber in color with a white head. The nose is very hoppy and the attack is very much ""hops forward."" The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. The flavor is smooth and enjoyable. Despite the hops the finish is pretty clean. The hops seems to be muted a little bit in the cask version of this beer. It seems pretty straightforward as an IPA except for the transition from the finish to the aftertaste where you believe the flavor is done, but then it returns when your mouth dries. I prefer the regular variety of this beer, which is not the norm for me. "
Pours a copper amber color with a 1 finger off white head with great retention and leaves some nice lacing.
A--Golden/copper color with a finger and a half of off white head in my pint glass that left a thick web of lacing
had on tap at town hall.... pint was a nice brown/orange color with a smooth head and some good lacing it was really fresh..the smell was floral first then a hop/spice smell with malts..the taste was the same its very smooth and creamy with a nice IPA feel with grapefruits and hops and malts pretty well balanced...the mouth feel is smooth and creamy and really easy to drink..this is one tasty IPA that is not an over the top hop bomb but just really good there is something about this ipa its not the best or the most flavorful but it is one of my favorites that i will have again..ill buy a growler next time at town hall ..oh yeah its recommended
"Growler into Sam Adams lager glass, big thanks to MBABJJ (Jason) for the chance to try this! Growler is best-by dated on the 24th and arrived on the 24th, drank today, on the 26th."
Great color. Pours a deep orange/brown color that's just beautiful. There is some medium bodied beige head here.
"A nice copper body that is amber at its core with a big, fluffy white head that dies down to a ring that crowns the body. Lots of thick, sticky lacing stays behind too."
Shared a growler with thabobfater and degerbah.
"Light copper, light orange with an off white head. "
Hand pumped from the cask at the Town Hall Brewery. Taken from notes at brewery.
Thanks to CaptainsChair!
This beer certainly made for a great refresher after helping Eric move in - cheers for sharing a growler from your epic cross-continent trip.
"Poured into a pint glass from a Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery growler, courtesy of user0317, cheers!"
A- Pours a ever bit slightly hazy golden orange well maybe golden red color with an off white head. Head has great retention and leaves a tremendous amount of lacing.
Got this courtesy of StoutsnIPAs. Poured from a growler into a pint glass. It pours a nice copper color. A light tan 1 inch head forms and slowly reduces to a full coverage lacing with some islands. 
One of the stops on my cross-country tour.
"Finally got around to making it out to Town Hall to give this mammoth a shot. I've been meaning to for quite sometime, but never had time or company to go with. I finally made it today when my girlfriend picked me up from work and took me out for dinner and a brew."
Thanks for Justn for the growler!
Growler with BBD 6/4 courtesy of KeefD trade - thanks much! Poured into the Duvel tulip...cap pops with a nice little fizz....
"I must admit I went into the MPLS Town Hall Brewery with very high expectations for this brew, and I'm glad to say it didn't disappoint. "
"out of a growler into a pint, purchased at the brewery on 5-28"
A: Rich amber body capped by millions of tiny bubbles forming a fluffy head... great retention and thorough lacing.
Had on tap at none other than Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery. 5-17-09.
Thanks justn for the opportunity to finally try this beer.
"Finally, Sunk my growler into a pint glass. Nice orange-amber hue that catches the light nicely. Off white head that hangs out to chat. Nice soapy, lacing and there is some visible carbonation. The smell is full of grapefruit, pineapple and sweet malts with little pine detected. The taste is on point. Citrus, grapefruit peel and pine dominate. A perfectly mild bitterness finishes it off. The mouthfeel is in line with the taste. Not to thick and syrupy with the perfect amount of carbonation to be extremely drinkable. F-ing amazing, and perfectly balanced."
"First off, a tremendous thanks to maximum12 for allowing me the opportunity to try this highly rated IPA. Another great trade with one of BA's BEST traders netted me this gem; I have long looked forward to trying this given its relative low ABV and its top 10 rating. I expected it to be good."
Had this one on tap at the Town Hall brewpub on 5/11/2009 (all part of a great beer trip with BA roadhouse).
Big thanks to Buebie for this tremendous extra that was part of my 1st ever trade...
Had on tap at the brewpub 5/11 in a pint glass
Poured from a growler into a standard pint glass
"Scored a growler from brian23456. Much props. Pours out of the growler nice and carbonated. Great big head, excellent retention, lacing, great clarity and perfect amber color. Aroma of fresh and fruity hops. Dry yeasty esters. Excellent hop profile here. Nice and ripe - melons, apples, citrus fruits, yet a nice dry, dusty, English-style finish. A nice caramel maltyness rounds out the bitterness and makes for just about a perfect balance. This is definitely something I would drink all the time if it were available. Low (by US standards) ABV combined with lots of flavor and the perfect body makes for a very drinkable brew which isn't compromised in complexity. Excellent."
Big thanks to Buebie for sending this long time want my way.
"A- Pours a deep transparent orange color with a nice, thick, chewy, off white head."
From a growler into my nonic. 
Finally made it to Town Hall! And they have Masala Mama on cask!
Got a growler in a trade with Deliriumfest - many thanks! Poured into a pint glass after letting warm up a bit. Growler opened with a loud hiss. It was a slightly hazy copper color with some carbonation and slight lacing. It had an average sized off-white head that settled into a partial thin film and good collar. 
Growler 
"I've heard about this, seen a ton of posts about this and never figured I'd get to try a fresh growler of this. A tip of the hat to Justn for sending me a fresh growler of this fine American IPA! Over 300 reviews as of this posting so I'll just affirm that it's got an amazing hop nose and a wonderful balance between intense hop flavors and nice bready sweet malts. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance!"
THANKS TO SAM FOR THE GROWLER!!!
"Received a Growler threw a trade, thanks to maximum12!"
Huge thanks go out to br3wmeister for hooking me up with a growler.
Tried this courtesy of gford217 - thanks!
"Appearance is soft, velvety, seductive. A Nordic goddess if you will. Some piney notes on the smell, but subtle. Our goddess is into seduction and doesn't want to reveal too much, until you are in the web. Mouthfeel is amazing on cask. Creamy and smooth, this temptress is teasing you, but she delivers in the end. Taste is subdued yet powerful, we are not getting hit over the head here, like a west coast IPA. This woman is the total package."
"Cheers to justn for this one, been ready to try this for a while"
"Growler thanks to BDR (thanks Brad!). Pours a clear amber with a thick white head. Aroma of grassy hops, a touch of citrus, and sweet malt. Flavor is similar--mostly malty with nice bitterness in the finish. Sturdy palate. Not as citrusy as I like my IPAs, but I can't deny that this was a tasty one!"
Poured from 64oz growler to pint glass. 
"This is one of the best beers Ive ever had. It is well crafted, perfect for the style and supremely enjoyable."
go to townhall brewery at 7 corners and try this beer. it is very good and has a fruity and hoppy taste. full body and very refreshing. plus there is a couple good looking waitresses there to bring your wonderful beverage. they also have a mango masala mama that tastes great as well. very good hoppy beer give it a try.
On cask at town hall earlier tonight. I want to start by saying that this is one the best beers ever.
A= deep brown color almost orange but darker. Two finger head rises from it with great lacing all the way down. Good head retention is noticed as well
"Pours a perfect amber into my pint glass. Nice, creamy two-finger head that slowly recedes throughout the drink."
Many cheers go out to justn for this growler. 
Thanks to deliriumfest for the growler hookup.
"Many, many thanks to csmiley for generously sharing the growler. "
Many thanks to Justn for setting me up with this Minnesota gem. Almost makes up for what the Vikings did to the Packers this year in Minneapolis. Almost.
Picked up this growler today at the brew pub. Cap reads a sell by date of 3-11-09.
"First of all, let me state that I am trying this beer after a four day shipping period. It might have lost some of it's freshness, and I will try to be as fair as possible. Best by date is 2-26, so this one should be ready to tango."
Compliments to skinnyguy for the hookup...
Thanks to Justin!
Thanks to BgThang for sharing his growler. 
On tap at the brewpub while in town on business.
"I tried this last night during the SB. We had a growler and split it 4 ways. It pours and nice amber color. The scent is floral and citrus hops, with a hint of acid from the hops as well! It was a well balanced beer with a touch of honey sweetness to it. IT was good, but I like Furious a touch better. This is a good beer though and it's easy to drink for sure."
on tap at brewery a few times.
This is one hell of a beer. I got this in a trade. A fresh from the pub growler. About one week old. 
Thanks to tyroanderso for these growler. I am reviewing from notes as this was sent to me and consumed 4 months ago. 
"Sample from a growler at Capone's in Norristown, PA. Graciously poured by Matt from a growler generoulsy provided by Frank."
Growler: Poured a deep orangey color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and great lacing. Aroma of citrus hops with a nice mix of caramel malt and a nice bitter aftertaste. Taste is also a very well balance mix between some some c-hops citrus notes with some floral undertones and deep caramel malt. Full body with great carbonation. Very well done but I still thinks its lacks the grapefruit punch that I really look for in this style.
"From notes, summer 2008:"
"A- Pours a thick foam cap, 1/2 inch in height. Nice cascade effect in the body from the cask. The body is dark amber in color and semi hazed. As the body recedes, thick lacing coats the glass."
Re-reviewing my second growler gotten via trade.
There are quite a bit of reviews here saying essentially the same thing which I agree with so there's not much need for a deep review.
Picked up a growler of this in a an awesome trade thanks to MasterSki.
Just arrived today from deliriumfest! Thanks for the opportunity to try this awesome IPA!
A: Translucent copper-orange body with a beautiful 1cm ripply white head. Swirling the glass throughout drinking whips up a good sized head that retains for a while.
"Growler, courtesy of a ratebeer trade. Split several ways, but with a full portion poured into a cervoise."
"Fresh growler arrival, kindly shared by CrellMoset. Thanks, Chris! Came off a nice, naturally refrigerated FedEx truck so it is needing to mellow out and warm a touch"
Growler in the fridge lasted three days:
A huge thanks to beerbeagle for sending a growler my way. 
Thanks to a colleague who visits family in the Twin Cities I have a regular hookup for growlers. Anyone in the Chicago area should hit me up for a trade...
Thanks for the growler...
Pours a nice orange color with one finger of creamy white head.
"First off, a big thanks to my friend, mrandypandy, for bringing me this one back. Very kind of you, man...I owe you big time."
Poured from a growler into my Church Brew Works pint glass.
Big thanks to wankerweasel for hooking up this growler of the current #1 IPA on BA.
"Huge thanks to Jeff (Faro) for sending this my way. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy this, but I may have converted my father to the world of microbrews with this one."
"Enjoyed on tap and cask at the brewery as part of a sampler. The hop aroma from this beer made it seem like a grapefruit had been stuffed into the tiny sampling glass. As I sampled the brew I was overwhelmed by the brash tangerine pith and grapefruit flavors awash in a sea of creme brulee-like maltiness. The mouthfeel was very creamy smooth and the body somewhat full. The finish was quite bitter, but not harsh. Not much else to say other than this was quite delicious."
Big thanks to Alex (MasterSki) for hooking me up with this one.
"Thanks to awesome new trader deliriumfest for sending a growler of this westward. Because of you, several BAs were able to taste this otherwise pain-in-the-ass to get beer. After being shipped to me, I drove another 100 miles to meet with fellow BA's OlieIPA, Mauerhan, Aimstatus, and Pehlman whom I met for the first time. Kinda chatty."
thanks to patronwizard for the remainder of this growler. i drink this for anyone who has lost anything to these fucking fires. 
Thanks to PatronWizard...
"First of all huge, Huge, HUGE thanks to MasterSki for the opportunity to taste one of beer's holy grails."
"I have enjoyed this brew multiple times, at the brewery/restaurant and out of growlers at home and figured that I'd better submit a report in ""thanks"" if nothing else. I have not found another that compares. This is it. Fantastic. Can't say enough about it. This is consistently great ale. I am fortunate enough to live close enough to frequent the place or at least pick up a growler. Those of you who aren't, it's time to road trip!"
Thanks to packforever1976 for this highly prized nectar sent to me for Growling at the Moon 08-09. 
Growler into shaker pint glass on 11/6/08. Big thanks to Deuane for sharing this with me!
"Growler acquired in trade with Robertsreality (thanks!). I had this one a few times from Growler, but notes and rating from this one."
"Appearance: Dark amber, cascading bubbles from the cask form a thick head. Sheets of lacing cover the glass as I drink."
"A honey amber pour with moderate carbonation and the nicest creamy head from a growler of any sort that I've seen. Great retention and layers of lacing down the glass. Smell is very nice. Not the most hoppy beer I've ever put my nose to but it's inviting to say the least. Juicy, citrus hops with a solid malt backbone. Some orange, apricot, grapefruit, and a touch of pine. Some caramel sweetness and a touch of biscuity essence. Also a very fresh green hop presence, somewhat raw and gritty. Taste is superb. It's a pretty well balanced IPA but I love it. Again, great citrusy hops with a countering malt sweetness. They do the tango and they enjoy it, dancing on my tongue to my delight. Funny thing is no matter how balanced this brew is, the hops shine wonderfully, I think this is mainly in thanks to the balancing effect. This is a thirst quenching beer. Not extremely bitter in the mouth. Somewhat creamy with a moderate bitterness and obviously fading carbonation through the growler. One of the more drinkable IPA's I've had, that's for sure. Not excessively bitter, very well balanced, and a tasty treat indeed. I had three pints from this growler and could have had more if I wasn't sharing. Very thankful to have finally tried this brew courtesy of maximum12...it was great!"
"A huge thanks goes out to younger35, a great trader and a great friend. Thanks man!"
Tried on tap at the brewery!
Beers which I have given a Perfect Five (in descending order of tastiness)
Had a pint of this at Town Hall the day before the Darkness release. This will be my first brew from Town Hall and I'm really excited to try it. Drank from a Town Hall pint glass.
"It has arrived! Been to Minneapolis many times, but never made it to this spot."
wow. this is a brewpub. i'm not an IPA man but two in the same week really does it for me. this is a very solid beer. not too amber but almost there. great retention. had a strange zing to it. cardamon in odor. very subtle. lost in the hop. great hop though. fruity grapefruit and dry pine. can't wait to go back to minneapolis for that pub.
"After many trips to Town Hall I finally decide I will review this gem. I have gone to Town hall to pick up growlers for fellow BA's, and I always have a pint of this."
"YUMMM! Got a growler of this from a friend. I looked pretty good in my English Pint glass, little darker than most IPAs I thought. The smell was a real wallop of hops, beautiful, floral-like bouquet. The taste was explosive, hops, then malts, then more hops and malts, followed by hop notes that lasted until my next chug several minutes later. Amazing. The carbonation level was just right, and the overall drinkability was smooth and flavorful. The growler disappeared WAY too fast, and I didn't feel any worse for wear, so highly recommended if you get the opportunity."
Served cool in a Boston Lager glass from a growler courtesy of Scoobydank.
"It purs a deep amber or copper with a gorgeous head that refuses to fade away. Nice looking drink. There's a bit of malt in the nose, but no denying that the hops are the main course here."
"Received this well packed growler in an awesome trade with maximum12. Thanks, Corey."
"Appearance is hazy orange with a frothy and tight off-white head that lingers for the duration. Aroma is bursting with pine and citrus, maybe a little bit of mint and woods. Malt is definately taking a back seat in the aroma for the hops to shine through. Taste has bursting flavors of hop and more hops with a strong bitterness right up front. Malt flavors of apricot and marmalade are again taking a back seat to all the hops. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation help this beer but the hop bitterness is fairly harsh bordering on acidic. Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderfully flavorful beer if your a hop addict. I only prefer a bit more malt balance and a little less harshness in the hop flavor and bitterness."
Split a growler of mama with the wife on our summer vacation the last week of June after the kids went to bed. 
"I tasted this beer several weeks ago on the advice of this forum. I usually go mostly for Amber ales with IPAs as a backup. This IPA is amber in color and tastes much like a hopper Amber ale ... very smooth, just a bit of bite, has a great pour. "
Damned good.
"P: Presented in a 64 fl. oz. growler with Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery (Est. 1997) logo design. Again, thanks to ""Masala Mama"" for coming through in the growler-running-clutch. Poured aggressively into a pint glass. "
Very solid IPA
"This poured deep copper in color with some amber running through the middle and a creamy off-white head. The aromas were of citrus, pine and coffee. In the mouth it was medium-bodied with great balance of hops and malt in the midpalate and then fading to a lightly dry finish with crisp bitterness. The coffee aroma and flavors makes me wonder if there was a porter/stout in the growler previously."
Many thanks to esch for sending me a growler of this one. 
Growler thanks to MeLikeBeer shared at the BA get-together at the Brick Store. Poured into a tulip.
"Poured a clear golden amber color. Fantastic hop smell, nice malty sweetness in the background. Taste is of bitter hops, plenty of pine goodness and grapefruit, with an excellent malt backbone that keeps this one incredibly well-balanced. Fantastic IPA. So good in fact, I stopped back by Town Hall the very next night, after dropping off my girlfriend at the airport, to get a growler, which will be reviewed shortly. Fantastic brew pub and servings."
Huge thanks for Todd1 and his mad shipping skillz. He got me a growler of this (among other things) and I swear the thing was still cool!
From Growler
This beer pours a nice golden with a frothy head and the smell of citrus stands out right away. It was so much like orange juice I just kept smelling it to take it in. The taste was lots of citrusy hops but it wasn't as balanced as I would have liked it to have been. Nevertheless it was a joy to drink.
"Y'all sure this isn't a Double IPA? I mean, really?"
Big thanks to unclejedi for supplying this.
Thanks to DontCallMeSurly for this growler.
"Poured a clear dark amber with 2 fingers of frothy cream/light tan head, great retention and beautiful lacing. Smells of grapefruit, butterscotch, biscuit, grass, and pine. Tastes of butterscotch, biscuit, toasted grain, pineapple, grapefruit, orange, grass, and pine. Medium in body with medium carbonation, good balance between a sweet malty beginning and an explosion of hops in the back end. An excellent IPA that has loads of hop character but not too much thanks to a nice solid malt backbone. Very easy to drink and one of the best IPAs I've ever had, which explains why I went back for more on my second day in Minneapolis."
A : Pours a nice good orange/amber color with a good head which leaves some great lacing behind
Props to dontcallmesurly for hooking me up with this one.
A: Clear orangey-amber body with an ivory/cream-colored head. Left plenty of lacing behind.
growler received from MeLikeBeer. Thanks a million for this! Split it with a BA johnmichaelsen and my brew buddy Jared.
First growler trade via Lordsloth. Thanks!
"Pours copper with a creamy whipped off white head. Think lace left down my glass. Really big aroma of pine and grapefruit. A little bit milder flavor that the nose would indicate. Still great pine/grapefruit flavors along with some nice Munich-ish malt character. Medium body. A little oily. The finish wants to be sweet, but is smacked down to size by an enjoyable bitterness. Wow."
Shipped by my boy objectivemonkey. Man does this guy ship some wonderful Minnesota goodness. Can't wait to try this gem with my drinking buddy fishingnet from ratebeer.
Pours a golden copper with a creamy one-fingered head. Head retention wasn't that great. Heavy amounts of lacing is left on the glass.
Enjoyed this at the Catskellar during the May 1st BA gathering. Two growlers of this showed up and both of them were easily emptied.
Got a growler in a trade from travloh. Thanks again Travis for the opportunity to try this amazing IPA.
This is the beer that made me fall in love with IPAs. I make it a point to get to the Town Hall at least once a month to partake in this beer. The color is a darker shade of gold than most IPAs and the floral aroma is incredible without being overpowering. I've had it from both the tap and the cask and have not been disappointed with either.
Had this one cask-conditioned at the MTHB in downtown Minneapolis. Was very excited to try out what is supposedly one of the best in the country. I wasn't disappointed. 
"Pours a medium copper in color, clear, with a large light cream colored head that recedes pretty slowly with some major lacing. Aroma is a nice mixture of piney hoppiness with some soft sweet citrusy candy and grapefruit. Taste is more of the good piney hoppiness balanced by a good amount of softly sweet maltiness, decent amount of pepperiness dances on the tongue and a fairly drying, good sized bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body, malts are well proportioned to the large hoppiness and keep it slightly to the thicker creamier side of things. Decent peppery and bitterness as well. A great ipa, feels fairly full, but easier as pie to drink. Thanks Eben for the sample."
64oz Growler
"Appearance: Crystal clear pale amber with 2 fingers of dense, frothy foam from a gentle pour. The head on this beer is incredibly persisting, I've never seen anything like it. Lace consumes half the glass."
Poured from a growler into a pint glass. 
"Being fortunate enough that my first trip to Town Hall finds the Masala Mama on cask, I simply could not pass this up."
"64 ounce growler with a taped cap received in a trade from Lordsloth, drank about six or seven hours after receiving it from FedEx, freezed it slightly to get it cold quicker and then spent the rest of the day in the fridge, split with my girlfriend's dad last night who also enjoyed it very much, had about three servings that were poured into an old mug"
"poured from a growler into a pint glass, thanks to LordSloth for the trade (consumed: 2/15/08)"
"App: Pours from a growler thanks for GrassrootsVT. Beautiful white still, high thick head with nice lacing sits atop a deep orange copper colored beer. Golden colored edging."
"Tap, cask, and growlers of various ages, but this review will be based on the first grower, which was less than a day old-- or at least I think it was-- it's kind of annoying how Town Hall sells prefilled growlers out of a fridge."
"This beer is the definition of an IPA to me. It seems the trend in the IPA world is to go over the top, but this beer sticks to what it is. Pours a ruby red, with a nice white head that sticks around (even though it came from a growler). Floral hoppiness dominates the nose (as well it should). The taste is definitely hoppy, but the malt is not wimpy. Finishes dry."
"Pours a nice copper red with 1-1/2 fingers of off-white head that retains for a decent amount of time. Nice lacing throughout the entire glass. Smell is abundantly hoppy, which is what I prefer overall. Taste was very balanced and not overpowering for an IPA. Hops are obviously present but there was some caramel and citrus notes evident. Medium bodied mouthfeel with a good amount of dryness worked in. Goes down very easy and definitely an IPA you can enjoy anytime of year. One of my favorite IPA's, thankfully it is easily accessible."
"Got this of a friend who brought it back from the brewery. Have to say I was very excited to try it and it did not let me down one bit!! Poured a light caramel color with beautiful light tan head. Smel was of mild hops and with a nice finishing smell. Definitely not over done. First taste is hoppy, but not overly. Very clean smooth finish, not extremely bitter. Has a nice malt flavor that I have not noticed in any IPAs that I know of. Had two pints and can not wait to have more. Even someone (not I) who did not like IPAs could enjoy this beer very much."
L: Dark amber with a tint of orange mixed in. Thick off white head
On cask on 12/31
"Kingpin left me a growler of this on his last run through town. I've enjoyed this beer for over a year now, and each time I get my mitts on some, it's like the first time. What you get is a fantastic smelling pint, with gorgeous color and excellent body. Where this beer kicks serious butt is in the mouth though, with a strong attack of hops balanced just right with some nice malt, giving a brilliant start that explodes into a strong hop aftertaste that can last minutes. Masala Mama deserves its lofty ranking for being the most consistently amazing ale I've drunk."
what can i say? this is masala mama.
64oz Growler poured into several Pint Glasses and shared amongst friends
"Amber pour with a nice off white head that hangs on til it's gone. Aromas are dominated by the hops, nice citrus and floral aromas are completely enviting. Taste gives my carmel at first but quickly the hops smack you across the face, nice grapefruit and piney qualities to it. I could drink this smooth and well produced beer all day long, and love it."
This beer made my trip to Minnesota worthwhile. This beer had a brown color with a super creamy off whited head of foam. This left a huge amount of lacing on the glass the whole way down. It almost coated the glass.
"This beer pours a golden slightly brown color with a thick, fluffy, off white head. The head, with a slight orange tint, fades slowly, leaving a good lacing."
"A nice amber/autumn color with a rather large head that chunked up a bit. Good lacing, sticky. Looks great."
"I've had this one several times on tap, but I've never thought of reviewing it until now. I decided to grab a growler on the way home from work, so I could sample it in the comfort of my own home."
"Sought out and sampled at GABF due to the very high ratings here. I enjoyed it, but did find a few better IPA's there."
"Pours an amber copper color, with a thick and dense head that cascades upwards for several seconds after the pour is completed. The off-white head sticks around forever and the lacing leaves a series of rings around the glass."
Finnaly got to the brewery. Had the draught after the cask. See my cask review in the previous review.
"Acquired from bax72 courtesy of Birthday Club 2, so a big “Thank you” goes out to him. Poured from a 64oz. growler into a US tumbler pint glass. "
"Ahhh...I have spent so much time with tihs beer but have ne'er reviewed it. That said, this is the perfect American IPA. Hazy orange amber with a cloyingly beautiful head and lacing of the most sublime off-white color I have ever witnessed. Sublimely hypnotic. The smell is a sock-knocker-offer off the best kind. Delicious notes of orange, lemon, grapefruit, Ponderosa pine, earthy malt, caramel, green tea, and cannibis. A taste that eclipses the smell perfectly, a three dimensonal expression of the smell to be witnessed by the palate, beholder of its own beauty. The mouthfeel is such a second act to the magnaninous aroma and palate searing flavor that it almost bears no mentioning, but is perfect in its own right; the cloying candied stickiness of this brew may offput only the pitiful but always pleases the purest of heart. The drinkability depends not on the palatial experience of the drinker, but rather the surroundings, as a pool table surrounded by the best of friends begs for another imperial pint. A+"
Appearance: Arrives at the bar with a hazy amber color and a sturdy head that retains and laces well
"Pours a ruby copper with a huge creamy head that stick around and laces for days. Damn this looks good and already is obviously not your average IPA. Smells of huge hops, grapefruit, a hint of peach, pine, HOPS!! First taste is insane. I just took a Bruce Lee kick of hops to the tastebuds. Ive had weaker DIPAs. Some grapefruit, rind, intese citrus, pine and the most hops Ive ever had in an IPA. This is crazy good. I had no idea what I was getting till now. Feels medium to light in the mouth with carbonation tickling the tongue in a great way. Finishes puckeringly bitter and slightly dry. Wow, hopheads beware. One taste of this beauty and you will have your bags packed for Minneapolis. This breaks the rules of IPA in so many different ways. Your not a hophead until youve tried this."
Growler acquired in a trade with franksnbeans
Notes from 8-9-2007
Thanks to LeonTrotsky for this growler.
"Finally got to try the Masala Mama on tap, at the source. Glad to say that this beer does not disappoint."
A - Pours a deep orange light copper with a frothy off white head that leaves a ring of lace.
"A- this didnt have the cascading creamy look that the cask ale did, however it was still a heavy foamed, golden amber clear bodied ale with tan head that lasted a long time and left lots of lacing"
"Poured from a growler acquired from tavernjef, who is a great trader by the way!!"
A big thanks to objectivemonkey for this brew.
"Sent from a generous trader, this selection poured a crimson amber from the growler. The thick off white head holds well and leaves some nice lace. "
"Pours a nice copper color with some ruby red highlights. Thick, clumpy, off-white head. Leaves nice lacing on the glass."
Many thanks to BA JeffKrenner who was kind enough to bring a growler of Masala Mama to Madison on a recent visit. I believe the growler was filled 6-23-07. It was consumed on 6-29-07. The label seemed to indicate that it was good until 7-2-07. This was the first time I had seem a best before date on a growler.
"The appearance was a nice amber with the proper head and plenty of lace. Pleasant aroma and good initial taste balance. To me, the taste of the finishing hops was a bit too aggressive. I noticed a hint of grapefruit in the finish. The beer was good but doesn't quite have the drinkability of some tamer American IPAs like Dogfishhead 60 min."
"A - This beer was on draft and I didn't get to see the pour, but it arrived a cloudy golden color with a nice persistent head."
Thanks to tavernjef for a chance to try this beer in the Chicago area!!!
A - Pours an amber color leaving a moderate lace as the head diminishes
On tap at Town Hall
"This beer looks very syrupy as it pours into the glass. The body is a cloudy dark amber color with no head. The aroma jumps from the glass and hits hard with citrus and caramel. The flavor has a bunch of bitterness with grapefruit and caramel in the background. The flavor is balanced, but is definitely bitterness dominated. This might be a bit too bitter for my taste, but a great example of an American IPA."
Received in a trade from jeffkrenner. Big thanks to him.
"I don't know about #9 on BA, but then again, I don't seem to think anything deserves to be in the top 10. I guess I'm just stingy. Still, this is an IPA for the ages. If someone needed one example of the great American IPA, Masala Mama could be it. To me it has a deep, rich grapefruit hops flavor complimented by floral hops. There's enough bitterness to catch up with any good hop head. It's a shame this isn't bottled"
"Pours a hazy reddish amber with a creamy head that descends to a lasting thin layer, leaving a fair amount of lacing on the glass."
"Review is based on drinking from growler, but also had on cask and regular on tap from the brewery. First growler experience. Its like losing your virginity to a super model!"
"This has been on of my favorite beers for a while. My preferred serving type is definitely the cask. The beer appears golden yellow with a nice creamy head that remains as throughout the pint's duration. The smell is very hoppy -- hints of grapefruit, citrus, and pine. This is not a beer for someone who doesn't like hops. The taste closely follows the aroma but is nicely balanced with some malt flavors towards the finish. The cask conditioned variety exemplifies these qualities to a greater extent then keg variety and also provides a much smoother, richer texture. Without a doubt the best IPA I have sampled."
"Acquired at DLD. Thanks to WarriorSoul for the nod in the right direction, and to MeLikeBeer for the growler. Kick ass!"
"Big thanks to JeffKrenner for hooking me up with this for BC2 via Dark Lord Day! Served in a Town Hall pint glass from bax72 also from BC2. Thanks Chris and Jeff! Cap says 5-8 which I'm assuming means drink before May 8th, but I may be wrong."
Thanks to akorsak again for a great trade at DLD. Pours a beautiful honey gold with a slight head and moderate lacing. The first smell that leaps out of the growler is grassy hops. Nice sweet malts follow. 
Poured from a growler into an imperial pint glass.
"Typical IPA appearance with orangeish body topped by a creamy head, but with a bit more sparkle than you typically see. The characteristic haziness form the hops is absent. This beer screams "" I'm Special! "" Aroma has a nice bit of what seems like Centennial hops, along with some other hop notes. No malt sweetness to speak of. Flavor is very bitter up front, with almost a dry, dusty feel. Very little malt backbone is present to support the onslaught of hops. Finish is also very dry. Mouthfeel is a bit astringent, and also gets a bit drying. This hurts drinkability as well. Over all a solid offering, but not in the upper echelon of IPAs for me personally."
"Poured from a growler, thanks to Faro, into a pint glass."
A- Thick cream head that is very dense and has good head retention. Dark orange body that is very clear. Thick lacing that covers the whole top with bits sticking to the side of the glass.
"This is a growler, bottled yesterday and brought to me (a big thanks) by some Marshfield friends, including stoutsnipas. I am going to try and be fair and balanced, but keep in mind I am not a big fan of heavily hopped brews."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk - poured from a growler into my Victory pint glass. Appears a mildly hazy, dark copper color with a good inch of fluffy, off white head. Wonderful lacing on the inside of the glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells of oily, resinous hops, with a nice aroma of rich caramel malt. Tastes of bitter citrus fruits such as grapefruit, and lemon as well as pine and sweet malts. Medium in both body and carbonation. Very smooth and drinkable especially at under 6%. This growler did not last very long. I look forward to trying this fresh from the tap one day. I'm assuming it must also be amazing on cask. Very nice. Highly recommended."
"Poured a nice hazy copper, with an off-white head and lacing is lovely. Very good looking beer for sure. Aroma is a bit different from tap, but in a nice way I suppose. Nicely malted still, caramels, pines and fruits, grapefruit and peach, not as much of a blow to the nose as on tap, but wonderfully subdued I suppose."
"This is a delicious IPA. It ranks as the absolute highest on Beer Advocate. With American IPA being my favorite style I HAD to get my mitts on it, but Minnesota is a LONG way from Los Angeles. Thanks to beckje01 for making this happen."
Many thanks to fugazme for this growler.
Poured from a growler Fresh of the truck and a two day ride from the Great White North. It's 5'Oclock somewhere so here is goes. Goes it's nice to have friends. Thanks to both of these conspirators NFLMVP and Objectivemonkey
A - a beautiful golden copper with a lovely head and long-lasting lace
Thanks to darkerthebetter for bringing a growler home with him from Minnesota to share while watching the Eagles beat the Giants. This is the 3rd time I have had this brew and it is always top notch. Nice color for a IPA with a simple hops nose. Very tasty in flavor and extremely well balanced. The thing about this beer is how easy it is to drink and its smooth mouthfeel. 
"What a glorious and amazing treat; a lovely lovely brew. Much thanks is owed to akorsak for sharing this treat with us today. If Adam is going to keep sharing with us then CH3CH2OH, keep hookin him up =)"
A growler from a second trade with CH3CH2OH. It was shared with JohnnyM2002 and Phatz.
"Sampled from a growler, shared with Akorsak and Phatz. Selected as my 200th review."
Casked Growler
It poured a golden deep orange color with a thick very creamy white head that last for quite a while. Floral hops of pine with notes of light toasted malt or carmel hints.
64oz Growler received in a trade with RobertDwight
"On tap at the Town Hall BrewPub, Minneapolis."
Got this from Faro on his crosscountry beer road trip while he was in Atlanta. We had arranged a trade and he happened to have a couple growlers of this and I was lucky enough to talk him out of one.
"I have to say I was excited to try this beer, my initial reason for visiting the Town Hall Brewery. I was not disappointed with a great take on the American IPA."
My first growler! Opened Thanksgiving Day minutes before 3:00PM. No one want's to share it with me (yesss!!). Received in trade Tuesday of this week. It has been calling my name ever since. Kept in the fridge and warmed for about 15 minutes. Poured into my Gavroche mini-tulip.
This beer really is as good as I had hoped. Perfect coppery-gold color with a long lasting white head and lace.
"Go ahead. Be skeptical. Yeah, it is that good."
"Poured from a most-sturdily packaged growler sent straight from MPLS by Faro -- maximum respect to you, Jeff. Best before 10-13, consumed the very same day with lunch as Buffalo struggled to recover from massive power outages due to the craziest snowstorm ever to hit the city -- and that's saying a lot! The refrigerator had been off for about six or seven hours, so it was definitely time to open this one. Once it finally hit my nonic, it was a deep copper-orange color, slightly hazy with a few streams of carbonation steadily but slowly rising up to a clumpy, meringue-like, yellowed-newsprint head. An abundance of citrus aromas rose up to my nose, with kumquat rind, grapefruit pith, and piney Minneola tangerines being the most prevalent scents. A faint biscuity-caramel aroma was also detectable in the very back of the deepest of sniffs. The taste recalled grapefruit sections in the morning, with the caramelly flavors of oven-fresh bread crust and a slight hint of the butter that one might slather upon said warm bread. The mineral-based taste of the serrated-edge spoon one uses to liberate the grapefruit from its pithy origin also came through near the end of each delicious sip of this magnificently-crafted IPA, which, by the way, also featured an exceptionally smooth and juicy mouthfeel, a medium body, and the perfect level of just slightly peppery carbonation. I should also mention that from time to time my sinuses flared with the grapefruit-spruce flavor of the occasional Masala Mama-induced burps. In short, this is a nearly flawless IPA. I believe I rated Alesmith's effort just a tad higher because of its amazingly floral aroma -- a niche this IPA doesn't happen to fill. However, I believe that Masala Mama is more drinkable than that paradigmatic West Coast offering, due to its combination of exceptional flavor and unsuspecting simplicity. That is to say, there wasn't anything absolutely unique to the flavor, aroma, etc. -- but the overall experience of drinking a growler full of this beer was, in my mind, the quintessential beer-drinking experience. If I ever find myself in the Twin Cities again, I will spend as much time as possible procuring and drinking this beer."
A hearty thank you to Faro for trading this to me. I'd also like to say that the growler was nearly a week old by the time it reached me. 
Received from a trade with Faro
The first beer I ordered during my recent visit to Town Hall. 
Got a Growler of this in a trade with TastyTaste:
Thank you Faro for sending this to me in a trade. I shared this beer with my wife. Upon opening the growler a very audible pst greated my ears. The beer was poured into a pint glass.
served in pub glass. Pours a dark cloudy amber-copper color with large head. Large lacing.
"Dark amber in color with off-white sticky head that dissipates to a nice cover. Aroma explodes with oily hops. Grapefruit with other citrus notes dominates the aroma. Taste is bitterness on a malty, caramel base. I like hops, so I'll subjectively say that mouthfeel is great. And this beer is very drinkable."
"Simply Amazing!!! Had a friend bring it all the way from Minneapolis to Tacoma, WA for us. Poured in to Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery Mug. "
"This beer is hoppy, that's for sure. The color is a reddish brown. There is a thick, creamy head atop the brew. Lots of lacing accent the glass. The smell is like a hop vine. The taste is very bitter. No harsh bitterness and not too sweet. Balanced as far as hoppiness goes. The mouthfeel is very bitter and sticky. There is a sweetness on my lips. The drinkability is pretty darn good too. This is a good IPA. Certainly in my top three or four for the style. I could drink this beer again but the availability may limit that. If you like hop bombs this your ticket. "
Much thanks to beckjeo1 for the growler. I thought I would never have the oppertunity to try this one. 
"This is incredible from the cask. The bartender told me that some patrons call ahead to make sure MM is available from the cask and not just in kegs. I rate either cask and keg about equal, but they are radically different."
Thanks once again to Faro for bringing this on his journey to Dayton.
"I was pretty excited about trying this beer. It's a beautiful rusty brown copper, with a nice foamy off-white head, and exceptional lacing. Looks delicious. The nose is just hops, nothing too crazy here. Taste starts out pleasantly with piney hops and some balancing malts, but it's followed by a way over the top syrupy hop finish. This one-note hop taste sticks around in your mouth for a good 45 seconds. Nothing complex to the ending, just hop hop hop."
"I've had this brew on-tap, cask-conditioned, and I have a growler in the fridge. Cask-conditioned is undoubtedly the best way to enjoy it."
Thanks to JeffKrenner for the growler.
"Pours a rich amber, with a very light head sitting right on top. Color made me anticipate a decent malt backdrop to this IPA. Floral nose with fresh fruit. Flavor is most certainly hoppy with some residual bitterness in the finish. Tons of fruit at the end as well in conjunction with the piney grapefruit upfront. Malt backbone not as sturdy as perceived but suffient to support this very nice IPA. Lots of thanks to JeffKrenner for the growler."
Masala Mama- IPA
Thanks to JeffKrenner for the growler.
Appearance is fantastic. 2 and 1/2 inch head that is very oily and retains well. The ruby orange color tells me I must drink now... but I inform it that I must first smell the beer.
Poured from a growler into a pint glass.
"from a 1/2 gallon growler, this beer pours a rusty amber color with little life, but a plump, creamy two finger head. this doesn't retain, but leaves some flame-like lacing and an adequate bubble-specked cover of foamy velvet. grassy, piney aromas dominate here with a mere hint of the west coasty citrus profile. some smokiness is here also in the nose, nutty, directing this beer's second major towards english bitter territory. unique aroma but not overly killer on hoppiness. considering beeradvocate and the beers people usually hype, this appears rather tame for a one-time #2."
My brother brought 3 growlers of this with him from Minneapolis for the 4th of July weekend. I owe him big-time for the chance to try this beer.
I tasted and reviewed this beer with out knowing what beer it was. I was told after the review it was Masala Mamma.
"Medium tawny/copper color with a slight haze. It retained some nice carbonation throughout its long journey and presents with a full three-finger head of fluffy of white foam. Excellent retention and a nice spotty lace. Aroma of soft citrus hops is excellent, but could use a little more umph. The flavor has an intense malty sweetness throughout and a bitterness that rides high on the tongue, carrying on long after the finish. The grassy hops have a nice grapefruit tang and the malt flavor has a slight toasted nut character. A good balance of flavors overall. The mouthfeel is lightly creamy with solid carbonation. This beer went down well and thank goodness it did because I finished nearly the whole growler without much help. Very drinkable and sessionable. This is a fine IPA but I am careful not to overrate it based on its scarcity. Everyone should get the chance to have one though. Thanks goes out to MeLikeBeer for hooking me up..."
"4's all around... and an excellent take on the IPA... but (IMO), clearly a product of its limited availability. This doesn't even make the top 5 IPAs discussion... let alone bordering top 10 beers in the world."
Growler from a trade with tavernjef. Thanks!
"This, the first imbibation of my long-awaited trip to the West Bank's Town Hall Brewery, did not disappoint. The only unfortunate circumstance surrounding this drink is that we had settled for getting served on the outdoor patio area, and my Mama was served in a plastic Texas tumbler."
This one opens with a nice PFFFTTTT. Phew. Thank goodness. Lots of smoke like vapors leave after opening the top. MANY MANY thanks go out to MeLikeBeer for this fine sample.
This beer was tasted in a pint glass from a growler shared with me by timtheenchanta.
"This is a phenominal beer. Golden orange color, perfect off white head of millions of small bubbles that retained at about a centimeter for the entire beer and provided spectacular lacing. I have had this beer many times from the regular tap, but from the cask the hops are toned back a bit, eventhough their complexity is still there, which helps reveal a bit more of the sweet, fruity pale malt. At the beginning of this beer, it tastes atleast a little balanced in malt and hops, definitely leaning towards the hops anyway. The finish though is pretty much all hops, a very broad specturm of them that is just delicious, slightly oily resinous pine and floral like, a bit stronger towards citrus zest, orange and grapefruit, maybe even a bit of apricot. It just plain make you go mmm. the mouthfeel is great on this beer, especially from the cask, enough cabonation to retain the sizeable head, but it's far from overwhelming. Extremly silky smooth. This beer is so good, it is virtually impossible to get sick of it. They go through a lot of seasonals at Town Hall, so I usually go for those, but I try to have one of these nearly every time I stop in for more than one or two."
on tap into a pint glass.
"thanks goes to a trader from Minneapolis, Minnesota for this growler full of beer. had this earlier this month. poured a nice golen orange amber just like it should with a light tan head. aroma wow the hops jump right out there when the cap was twisted off like walking thru a pine forest, than got citrus leaning to the orange and. flavor, I am glad I didnt rate this on my 1st glass I thought that I might have gotten a bad batch this was so dry that I had to have a glass of water with it, so down in the ref. it went came back a couple of days later and I could tell it was starting to mellow so after drinking this for a little over a week a good portion of the dryness went away and it became a very enjoyable beer to drink, the flavors were hops, orange and some grapefruit"
"A big thanks goes out to grub for sending me a growler during his recent visit to the twin cities. After chilling for a day, I popped this baby open. Off the pour, I got a creamy 1"" head of dense, yet rocky, off-white foam. Things receded a bit, but plenty of head stuck around to produce thick, clumpy lacing. Very balanced aroma, with some malt sweetness providing counterpoint for the tangerine and piney hops (with a little grapefruit too). Solid bitterness with significant malt sweetness to start, along with some floral orange, grapefruit and pine. The bitterness slowly grew into the finish, where it became fairly intense. Along the way there were notes of toasted, biscuity malt and peaches. Kind of a sweet-tart character too. Medium bodied with medium/low carbonation. A bit creamy on the palate too, with some hop dryness. Overall, this has great balance. My taste buds were put through a work out but didn't get tired too fast, which let me enjoy quite a bit of this in a single sitting. I'd love to try this at the brewpub. Highly recommended and not overhyped."
Thanks to tastytaste for this growler. Poured into a pint glass. Shared with my IPA connosieur roommate BA PEF524.
"Finally, I have the elusive Masala Mama in my hands, thanks to an iFriend who send a 64oz growler to me in Florida. Thanks, Tip Top!"

Masala Mama departed the confines of its growler and now occupies my pint glass where its full beauty can be appreciated. The colour is a hearty orange caramel. Bubbles still lively up the liquid even after days in transit and untold idle time. A small tan cap emerged off the pour but fell away hastily leaving some frothy churn atop this most lovely glass. Lacing stretches across the vessel's horizon and grows in girth as the level drops with each sip. 
"When poured it has a cloud, not unlike a guiness, then it becomes crisp with a great foamy head that doesn't fall and a lacing that's unbelieveably stuck. It has a golden orange color. "
Enjoyed on cask.
"Poured from a growler supplied by Fugazme into a pint glass. The pour is beautiful, a nice copper orange color....crystal clear in appearance a nice two finger head rises lingers for a few moments and falls to a cap on the beer with nice spotting lace all the way down the glass. The smell is very aromatic, herbal and dominated by hops, some sweet carmels linger in the back and some spice as well probably as full of a boquet as I have come accross. The taste is phonomenal sweet, robust, with some fruity zest in the background....but of course the amazing hop rush. The hops come at you right in the middle and subconsciously you brace for the pucker effect in the finish....only to find that the hops have been balanced so that they linger in the back of the palette while a cascade of rich malts and cirtus rush in. Truly exceptional....I think my first 5 in the taste category. The mouthfeel is equally as impressive richly carbonated but smooth on the tounge and cheek. Hearty enough that it lingers in your mouth after the beer is gone. "
"Town Hall Brewery is a great bar at seven corners in Minnneapolis, Masala Mama IPA is just one of the few great beers they have available. With that said, this IPA is very good, the hopyness is not overpowering, yet the flavor is magnificant. The beer is definatley worth a try."
Appearance: Dark golden to copper color with a dense tan head. Light carbonation billows from the bottom. Slightly cloudy with slippery lacing sliding down the glass.
Poured from a growler 
"Let me begin by saying, I am not a hop-head. I generally find IPA's passable, and then only in summertime. That said, I couldnt stand this beer at all. And that's exactly why it's so good."
"Served on cask at the brewpub, this brew cascades beautifully and settles into a pleasing orange amber hue with a quarter inch thick smooth white head. There is a pronounced hop smell. While there is not the profound hop explosion of the cold version, this beer features a pleasing sustained resiny and piney hop presence perfectly balanced by a smooth malt backing. The creamy mouthfeel is exceptional. A classic American IPA."
On tap at the brewpub.
"This arrived with a big, fluffy, white head with a lot of bubbles coming to the top. I continued to note a beautifully floral hoppy nose. The mouthfeel was thicker and more effervescent on the palate. The hops were still up front and in your face, but tempered a little bit by the carbonation. The finish had that nice burst of malt that stood in utter juxtaposition to the combination sledgehammer/blind file of hops that slugs you, pulls your tongue out of your head with a pair of pliers, and begins running back and forth like a cheese grater. Waitress, another please."
This beer came a clear orange-ish brown. The head was a frothy light tan that left little lace. 
"This brew is bronze in color. The head is creamy, solid, and white, and stays about one-finger high until the glass in drained. The aroma is citrusy with pine and oranges peaking through. The taste is amazing. It is a perfect balance of citrus and pine flavors with a solid, but not too harsh, bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and extremely smooth. Overall, this is the best all around IPA I have had to date. All other IPAs seem to either be all citrus or all pine. Masala Mama is both."
"Pours an amber color with a nice head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is all hops - citrus and pine hops dominate. The flavor is much the same - lots of hops. The US hops in the flavor are countered with a decent caramel malt background, but it could use a hint more. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is pretty good."
"From the Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery located in the Twin Cities, this growler came to me via BA feloniousmonk. The seal had obviously held up, as the beer came out with a nicely swirling fine carbonation forming a lace bearing eggshell white head, which was thin, but rich. The beer itself was rather clear, with an attractive copper amber color, which was a shade darker than the run of the mill IPA. The aroma was very good at the time of the pour, and got better as the beer warmed up. The smell was that of flowery, spicy, and citric hops, that were strong without being over the top. The sweet honeysuckle smell of the underlying malt base was permitted to shine through faintly as well."
"Beer pours a deep copper color wit ha finger of head that falls to a half finger over top with a modest lacing as it falls. Nose is sweet sweet citrusy, resinous hops with a very solid deep sweet malty backbone. Flavor is a fine balance between sweet citrusy hop flavor, sweet caramel malt and a very modest peppery bitter that hangs on the finish, but very pleasingly. Feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation of fine bubbles. This beer would be in my fridge every day of the year if I could have it that way. I don't think there is a more balanced American IPA out there. Great beer."
"Deep brownish copper pour surprises by its darkness, but the generous beige head compensates any ill thoughts. Fully malty nose offers a broad range of varied dark malts aromas, caramel and fitting butterscotch being omnipresent. Strong biscuity feel. The hops, in that regard, are not the prime focus, but just a half of the couple, procuring mostly earthy, anise-like notes that evolve into leafiness in mouth. Quite sweet for an IPA, obviously rather round, more citric in mouth than the nose would let know and definitely less fruity. Expertly hidden alcohol and no astringency join forces to explain the desirable reputation. Reminds me of stuff like Nogne O Batch 100 for its sheer barleywineish malt orientation. Still very tasty and appealing though, a different take."
"Despite my really high marks for this beer, I can't help to feel somewhat underwhelmed by this beer's reputation. Don't get me wrong. This is a great beer. A great IPA. But it's quality, albeit high, has been outstripped by its reputation. Bell's Two Hearted, for example, can easily go toe to toe with this one."
Appearance: Pours a beautiful amber orange with a decent foamy head that leaves some nice lacing.
Sampled at the brewery in Minneapolis. Masala Mama had an amber color with a slight cloudy haze. About the normal color of a IPA if not maybe slightly darker. There was a big ofrothy head which left a good amount a lacing throughout the tasting. The head retention was excellent and remained the whole time. The smell was super hoppy with strong notes of grapefruit and pine. A big floral nose with no doubt of being an IPA. This really is very noticeable and even more impressive as its not an double IPA.
"tavernjef sent me a growler of this just in time for me to take it to NC to share with my brother. THANK YOU! Let's start by saying- wow, what a nice treat, and it held up very well against (in fact, shone brighter than) Titan IPA, HopHog, Alesmith IPA - all also sampled over the weekend."
"Slightly copper in colour with a wonderful nose of citrus (a combination of orange and grapefruit) and spice (somewhat peppery) hops. Very fresh hoppy flavor and a long finish. Not overly malty or heavy, but that was a good thing in this case. Medium carbonation and high drinkability. A fantastic IPA to say the least."
"Poured a dark, reddish amber color with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of light floral and citrus hops, light caramel malts in the background. Taste of mostly the same, with lots of fruity hoppiness, a really nice IPA."
Big thanks to tavernjef for a growler of this rare sighting in my neck of the woods.
"beautiful deep orange with a hint of red body. clear. frothy off white head. nice smell of citric like hops, freshness, kind of sweet, hops are not too faint, but not a killer, a bit bready. wow, this one is bitter. it's the first thing my tastebuds respond to, like the hops know exactly where to head to on your toung and they get there quick. then there is a second wave of hops in the after tase that seem to have orders to attack once all of the first wave of hops die. on the front side there is more than the normal amount of roasted barley, this one has some color and malt sweetness up front. just enough to give the beer some kind of ballance untill the hops do their thing. mouthfeel is slick and oily, but the hops oils are not so much that your mouth is left feeling sticky. very smooth. drinkability is good because as for ipa's go this one does it very well and i could down a couple of these in a session, especially after my pallet warms up to the hops."
Major thanks to jeffboo for this growler of glory...
"Growler shipped lovingly by mentor! Thanks buddy! I was very worried about the condition this would come to me in since it is at least 2 weeks old and has been driving around in 90 degree weather all day today, not to mention while in transit for the past 3 days. But the packaging was great and if this is any better on tap fresh at the brewery, I don't think I could handle it!"
Pours a clear copper color with a nice two finger off white-head that falls to a foam like iceberg and leaves nice webs of lace on my glass.
"I had Masala Mama from the cask pump today. I've had this beer before on tap, but it tastes even better at cellar temperature."
"For all the reviewers out there who only drank this in a growler, they need to try it in person, but only if its being served from a cask. Town Hall rotates their beers from on tap to cask every few days so its sometimes hard to get what you want. However, the Masala Mama is very popular from the cask, so it is there often. And that is with good reason, because even though it is good from the growler, its way better in the cask. Something about the exact temperature and the mouthfeel of the casked beer makes you stop caring that its one of the more bitter beers you've had. How can something be too bitter when it rolls down so smooth. The bottom line is that when its on tap, the carbonation gives it a sharp mouthfeel. There is also something in the growler that is sharp also. On cask, it looses the sharpness, which allows you to just enjoy the beautiful hops cascading over your tongue."
"This beer poured a pale gold color, with a frothy head of millions of teeny-tiny bubbles. The first whif reveals an intense hop aroma...American hops, citrusy hops. Little malt aroma can be discerned behind the hops. The hops dominate the flavor well into the aftertaste. Balance is tipped to the bitter side. The beer was served through a beer engine at cellar temperatures and you HAVE to try it if you are there. The only thing I think would make this beer better is a bit more malt."
"Ahhh...what could be better to come home to after a long day at work than a fresh growler of the infamous Masala Mama sitting on your doorstep. Pours from the growler a brilliant shade of reddish orange with a fluffly, sticky mountain of head...as it falls it leaves wonderful intricate patchy lacing on the side of my glass. My mouth is watering already. As I pick up my glass and bring it to my nose I'm instantly hit by a wave of ripe, succulent hop aromas. Rich, resiny grapefruit, peach, pineapple, mango and various other citrus fruits mix with a hint of pine sap. Sweet candy caramel maltiness mixes into my make this smell like a big citrusy hop candy. Sit....smell...repeat incessantly."
Much thanks to tavernjef for this growler!
"This review is from a growler courtesy of Stubob. Cloudy amber body with tall off white head that stand strong for the life of the pint as it slowly collapses. Huge clumpy rings of lace covered the glass. Wow, the insane hoppiness coming out the glass was evident as I was pouring this. Big citric and floral hops dominate this swallowing up almost all traces of malt. Flavor was very bitter upon the first sip with hops kicking the crap out of my tongue the whole way. Citric and some earthy tone hopes with piney notes were strong from the first sip to the last. Big dry bitter after taste lasted forever and left you feeling like some one dragged a rake across your tongue. Simply wonderful. Solid mouthfeel that was alive with hop prickliness. Very drinkable stuff in that punishingly bitter IPA kind of way. I made the mistake of having the last glass from the growler with some jalapeño pizza and buffalo wings. I dont think I tasted breakfast the next day. Great stuff and a big thanks to StuBob for the chance to try this."
"I received this from StuBob, thanks buddy."
"OK, let's get one thing straight before I review this brew. I have NEVER liked IPAs. I strongly stress, NEVER. After a chance meeting with a fellow BA from Minnesota (Fantome), I was presented with a growler of this brought from the brewery, kept cold in a cooler for the entire duration of the trip to Michigan, as a gift for my upcoming wedding. I readily accepted the beer, and was amazed at how beer can bring people together. Incredible. In anycase...On to the beer. As I have stated, I am not a fan of IPA's. Until now. This is the only IPA I have ever really enjoyed. Poured out to a slightly cloudy amber orange color with a respectable head that left a nice lace around the glass. Odors of hops and citrus were present, as were notes of herbs. Medium to low carbonation. Slightly malty presence is outdone by bitterness and hops, which were strongly present. Just a touch of honey or molasses sweetness on the finish, with a bitter-smooth aftertaste. Recommended. And that's coming from me, who doesn't care for IPA's. Damn good stuff considering. Thanks again to my newfound friend from Minnesota Fantome, and Proc for being such an awesome beer ambassador and introducing me."
"Poured from a growler, a ruddy reddish orange. The color and clarity and quite captivating. I would paint my car this color if I had enough beer and money. A rocky white head bobs on top and the lacing is oh so pretty all the way down. This is a gorgeous beer, prom quality all the way. Hoptastic smell, bitter grapefruit and dirty flowers. For a standard IPA this is hopped the hell out. Unlike alot of IPAs, the bitterness is straight up and isnt as complex in the way or citric or piney flavors. The malt is initially kidnapped by the pure slam of the hops but makes a cameo in the end lending a faint biscuity flavor. Underline the faint. A bit on the unbalanced side in favor of raw hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is oily and slick, i can almost feel the hop residue's legs dripping down my inner cheeks. Perfect levels of carbonation. "
"I've had this so many numberous times from growlers and fresh right at the pub, thought perhaps it was time to do a review for the tapped version as the casked version is different but just as good if not better on-tap. "
"A visit with friends led me to the Town Hall Brewery and a chance to sample this frequently shipped beer. Overall the beer was a decent IPA, above average for the Middle West perhaps, but nothing that blows the west coast made versions away."
"Growler provided by tavernjef...thanks so much! Reviewed the same day I received it. Growler opens with a gentle hiss and the beer pours a nice 2 finger creamy tan yellow head over a slightly cloudy amber liquid. It had a hint of the guinness-like carbonation settling to the top. Smells of gentle citrus with some rough grassy cohumulone character, too. Grapefruit and lightly lemony, with something of a cotton candy smell that I associate with Amarillo hops (at least that's how Amarillo comes across in my homebrew). It has a very oily and aromatic flower smell. Noticable apricot and possibly some other fruit smells. Tastes caramel sweet to start then quickly shifting to the hops. Bitter. Very bitter, but then I get distracted by a malt sweetness that emerges and the grapefruit of the hops. Great combination that leaves me chasing it and wanting more. I'd better oblige. The sugar in the middle/end of the swallow is very interesting. It's almost got a crystaline quality about it. The next gulp I catch the combination a bit more clearly and then realize that in my first few gulps, I missed a nice fruity and malty that comes in at the end. It's a dry fruity and is mixed with a grassy feel on my tongue and a great aromatic oily floral. Hey, this is two beers in one! Medium mouthfeel that could be medium-thick...it's hard to tell because the ending is dry and a potent hop bitter hangs around. It's grapefruit-like, but has a flatness to it. Some qualities of oranges, plus the sense that I sunk my feel into orange rind (like when you need a scar in the rind so you can start peeling it). Works well to announce the gulp is over and it's time for another, but I kinda like some dancing malt and fruit to make me ponder each gulp. Okay, deep into my second glass here and a sweet malt is winning over the sharp end as an aftertaste. Plus, pardon me, even the burps taste good. Md to Md-thick mouthfeel and with moderate carbonation. I think the carbonation adds a bit of an acrid that amplifies the hop bitter and a tang that I've just now detected. Hmm, what is that tang? I'd better pour a third glass and see. Please pardon me if my spelling goes awry. That tang is not entirely pleasing, but I can't get a fix on it, so I'm intrigued. Perhaps some green apples and straw? Okay, enough. I'm about three beers to the wind and done with this review. This was definitely a challenging beer to dissect. Even the less desirable characteristics had some features that kept me guessing and wanting more to put my finger on. I guess I have to take that road trip to Minneapolis after all. Maybe they'll let me fill a 5-gallon cornie keg rather than a bunch of growlers."
Growler filled and provided in trade by StuBob. Thanks for the opportunity.
"After a thorough palette cleansing, it is time to crack the growler of this legendary ale."
"My sister was in Minneapolis for a college activities planning convention and was nice enough to walk down to the brewpub, buy a growler of this, lug it back to her hotel (almost 2 miles one way), and bring home in her backpack. Im glad she did, its a tasty beer that has more malt complexity than youd expect from an IPA. The brown body is topped off by a medium-sized head. The aroma smacks first of hops, pine tip variety, but is followed up by a solid, sweet caramel and biscuit malt. The flavor is full, the malt thick in the mouth with the tingling carbonation and prickly bitterness lightening the load. Excellent."
"Sweet smelling nose with a note of honey, and the definitely expected floral behavior."
Package: 64 oz. screwtop Town Hall growler. Dated best by 8/23 (7 days from fill date I believe) and consumed 8/20 and 8/21.
1/2 gallon growler obtained from the monk and split with tikigodxxx
1/2 gallon growler.
"From a growler (best by Dec 12, consumed Dec 7 and 8), pours a nice orange-copper color. Smells of all sorts of fruits, namely peach and citrus. I love the taste. It's fairly bitter, but not so much that it gets in the way of the great taste. There's some caramelly/biscuit-like malt there, and it just explodes with fruity flavors, such as orange and peach. "
"Sampled from a 64 oz growler which came to me so generously from my Secret Santa 2004 (aka STUBOB). Poured a deep copper topped with soft & fading bubbles. Enticing aroma of citrus hops mixed delightfully with pine needles. Driving bitterness clearly takes center stage, but is complimented beautifully by immense amounts of grapefruit & pounds of fresh pine needles. Underlying malt profile present, but subordinate & hints at caramel & a touch of sugar. Amazingly long lasting bitter, citrusy finish. Medium to full bodied for the style, definitely a meaty IPA & one I'd like to drink frequently. In this case, frequently means every 15 minutes."
Review from notes.
"Pours a hazy full copper color that has some amber notes to it. The beer is well carbonated and forms a giant pale tan head. The aroma is all hops with notes of grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, and pine. Basically this has a proto-typical fruity American hop nose to it, as I sniff some more I might just sense some malt here as well."
"1/2 Gallon Growler. Received Friday, Novemeber 5th. Opened Sunday, November 7th. Finished Tuesday, November 9th. ""Enjoy By 11-11"" sticker on the back of the growler. (Would have been consumed earlier if it wasn't for a little get together the Bro's threw in Boston that Saturday)."
"Thick, sticky off-white cream is thick up the glass and flakes all over. Body is a dark copper. Nose held lots of flavor--sweet and fruity, lots of passionfruit and something that I could only call ""candy hops"". In the mouth, it's a little on the sweet side, with more of that passionfruit and candy hops--which this time seemed more like ""liquid hops""--a full mouth of fresh, liquid hops. Dry and chewy--but very fresh. Sweetness in the mouth reminded a bit of apple cider. Totally smooth and complex IPA. I liked this better than Hop Devil, which was my preferred IPA up til I had this."
"I was in Minneapolis the other weeekend and had the wonderful opportunity to try this beer, amongst many others from this same pub. This beer poured beautifully, with a gorgeous creamy-looking head and a reddish hue. Complex aroma: many citrus notes and strong hops. The taste nearly knocked me on the floor with its intensity, one of the most dense beers I've ever drank, so many flavours, where to begin? Very strong hop flavour, grapefruit, orange perhaps, very citrusy. Mouthfeel is very spicy yet smooth, making it a very drinkable beer. I wish I'd have been able to take a few growlers of this home, but then i'd have felt guilty about drinking it as it would have had to be a special occasion. No, I'll make this a reason to travel to the Twin Cities more often."

Growler.
"pours out of the half gallon growler a darker shade of amber, slightly hazy with a thin, fine, tan head. slight rings of sticky lace as i sip. aroma of toasted, biscuity caramel malts with an intense flair of lemon and grapefruit zest and spruce hopping. upon first taste, the intense hopping and bitterness are front and center...piney and citrusy...and unapologetically bitter. the malt profile seems to be balanced with the style; biscuity and toasted...sweet and sugary, with a caramel malt base not unlike a regional o-fest i overimbibed in this past weekend. this is a big beer, with a full body and rounded, oily mouthfeel. one can detect the alcohol after a few sips...it compliments the rest of the brew quite nicely...slapping you after having been punched in the gut by the resinous hops. the lingering, loitering hop flavour and bitter aftertaste is long and longer. this is a hop heads dream. what impresses me is the multi dimensional hop profile...covering every angle of hopping flavour and bitterness. more pine than citrus; more bitter than balanced...it's an assault upon your taste buds. very nice and very worthy of the praise it deserves...the best hop profile of any ipa i've sampled to date."
"A growler of the infamous Mama reaches me via GIF5. Cracked this half gallon open to start off the labor day weekend. Into a tall twenty ounce glass, this poured out perfectly clear. The color is a bright orange-amber and the beer is topped with a very frothy and assertive head of foam. The head looks like stiffly beaten egg whites. A spotty and sticky lacing was left behind on the glass. Generous carbonation. Light taps of the glass creates cascades of bubbles that rise up from the bottom and joins the creamy head. The aroma is appealing and pleasant. Light, fruity, bittersweet and a bit musty with sweet orange spices. The aroma reminds me of jumping into a freshly raked pile of damp leaves. The taste is fruity, musty and bittersweet. The alcohol is completely hidden behind complex fragrant malts and a solid body. This goes down very easy and is highly enjoyable. An excellent IPA."
"A Growler from the heavenly twin cities via toronto, ontario. I had made a special request from a friend to acquire this beer and the hype turned out to be truth. This is as good a beer as I have had this side of my pappy's homebrewed IPAs. A perfectly balanced all around beer; no grand slams in any one catergory but hits home runs in all, which pulls up the score for me and moves me to grant my first straight fives in my review history."
"An exceptional brew that I had the pleasure to try coutesy of wyllder at last night's beer tasting. Came in a 64 oz growler. Considering the distance and time involved in receiving this sample I can only imagine what it must be like directly from the tap. As a bonafide hophead, I was quite surprised to find an IPA with a relatively low ABV with such a fantastic balance of taste, mouthfeel and drinkability. First, the appearance was slightly cloudy with a great head that laced very nicely. The smell was superb. A lightly sweet apple and fruity essence, but with a hop essence that insists that you must drink...a definite 5.0. Taste? Mmmmm....Malts and hops start on the front and remain throughout...no harshness...grapefruit/citrus on the finish that makes you want another sip. Mouthfeel is balanced an medium in quality....easy...easy to drink...any chances they will open a branch in New England. Definitely one of my top choices."
"First of all: Crazy thanks go out to Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery's unofficial employee, feloniousmonk, for the chance to taste some Mama."
Growler (it Forward)
"Appearance  This was one of the most beautiful beers that I have ever seen. The color is a perfect, dark hazy, mysterious orange. The head is thick, not fluffy. It looks like you could stand a spoon up in it. It showed great retention and left some terrific lacing on the inside of my Ruination glass."
"First let me thank garymuchow for getting this fine brew to my doorstep served from the Town Hall 1/2 gallon brown growler with a plastic heat sealed layer for protection. Appearance: Pours a deep caramel amber crystal clear hue with an amazing tannish head forms thick leaving heavy intricate patches of lacing, very nice. Aroma: Copiously hopped lines my nostrils with aromatic grapefruit and pine cone scented hops, all topped off with a fortified caramel nut edge completely amazing. Taste: Flavor consists of a lucious juicy hop profile with a malty backbone to balance her out. Talk about hops, man the nut edge evens out a perfect amount of sweetness from the malts but the waves of grapefruit and pine swarm the palate with a rush of bitterness making the finish completely fantastic leaving me, the drinker with hop burps. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied resinously textured what a lucious body even perfect carbonation can't ask for much more, I'm satisfied. Drinkability: Wonderfully flavored with massive hops and a unique malt character holds a spot as the best American IPA I have ever tasted. The sessionability of this brew is unlike any other waxed off a growler with two fellow BAs (beergeek279 and cupbeerman) and wow I was yearning for another to exist."
"Served from a growler into a Celebrator glass. The color was a darker amber, with a solid white head and excellent lacing. The smell was a nice bouquet of grapefruit and piney hops. The taste was an amazing blend of hoppiness, with piney hops and grapefruit hops, with a bit of a nutty character to it, and somehow the malt managed to keep it balanced, and a welcoming bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was very resiny, with hop oil left coating the mouth after drinking. As for drinkability, one growler just for myself wouldn't be enough of this one...could drink all day long!!"
"Mildly hazy, tawny-gold-brown in hue, it was served with a slightly off-white head that was a finger in height. The head retention was very good, after a long while it faded to a frothy cap. The subsequent lacing was sticky and widespread. On cask, this is a beauty of a beer! The nose, on cask, is much softer but much wider. The malt is heard more clearly; still the pine and citrus from the hops are loud but far more balanced, not only in comparison to the malt but also to each other. The nose still says IPA. Inviting. The palate is lovely, the hops are so wonderfully blended, the piney notes are not bright but they are wide. The citrus notes are very sticky which seems to act like a spiders web that captures (okay, attracts) more malty flavors with hints of caramel and some sweetness. The aftertaste is lighter but, again, the pine is the focal point. This is amazingly tasty on cask; it is very relaxing; I mean what a great pint to chill with. There is ample flavor construction and it is complex for an IPA. Lovely stuff on cask (Ive I became a broken record?)! Medium in body with a creamy mouthfeel with typical cask condition qualities, it was served at the ideal temperature. This is amazingly drinkable and almost perfect on the palate. This IPA has received a lot of press, some good, and some bad, some utterly insane. Folks, live at the brewpub this beer is great and on cask, it is unparalleled. Highly Recommend (on cask)!"

"Poured from a genuine Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery 64oz growler which had a ""best by"" date of 6/21/04. Full to the rim and very securely sealed, MM was still fresh after nearly a week's travel and a three-day stint in my fridge."
"Yo' Mama has held up very well after a journey east from the Land o' Lakes and sitting in my fridge for a week. Opened a growler of this and heard a lovely, strong hissing sound. Poured from the growler a clear, medium-to-dark copper color; quite attractive. Scattered bubbles slowly make their way upwards. Head was tan, creamy and mousse-like, rising about 1"" above the bier, and later maintaining well at about 1/4"". Head leaves a nice lacing trail on the glass. Nose has a good bready malt lean to it surrounded by a pleasing citrussy hop presence. Body is a solid medium-plus, and it has a creamy, velvety feel on the tongue, with a smidge of bubbliness. Flavor has some toasty malt notes leading off, but they are soon engulfed by lots of floral, citrus notes, though the malt is not totally wiped from the slate. I get some grapefruit rind tastes and a resiny, oily aspect, too. Aftertaste is built long and hard on the citrus, finding all the nooks and crannies of the mouth and throat and sticking there. "
Growler
A very solid IPA.
Thanks to Tavernjef for this sample. I'm not sure why the Bros. gave this a sub-four rating. I really enjoyed it and so did everyone at the barbecue on Saturday.
Presentation: ½ gallon growler. A big thanks to tavernjef for the sample. Nice psst when I popped the cap.
"Having a fresh growler of Town Hall's Masala Mama in one's beer fridge for five days is either the ultimate example of self-control or is the very definition of insanity. Leaning toward the latter, I've decided that today's the day that I 'stop the madness'. Best by date of June 7."
From a Growler Bottled in May 04. Poured a slightly hazed copper with an orange hue and a huge frappy foamy head that completely resists gravity. I think its still growing as I drink. Nice big citrus like hop aroma. Medium smooth body. Flavor is a good balance of hops and malt. Hops providing lots of bitterness and good flavors with malt backing it up nicely. Unsure of the abv however it does have a decent kick to it. Overall a great IPA. Thanks Monk!
"A very, very fine brew. Thanks to garymuchow for allowing me to behold the power of the Mama. "
"Presentation: A brown Grolsch like, flip top, EZ Cap brown glass 'mini-Growler'. Simply has the letter M in black pen scrawled on the white ceramic top. A present all the way from Minneapolis. Hell Yeah!"
"Ahh, a growler of Masala Mama, sent from miles away from the great BA Feloniousmonk. Thanks Al, you have made a dream come true. I just finished 8 hours of standing in front of a broiler, waiting, knowing that this sweet treat was calling to me from home. What a way to finish a work shift. "
"Ruddy deep copper hue with a light murk. Dense, stiff, steadfast ivory white head leaves coating, dogged lace. Pungent waft of pine sap and grapefruit zest upfront in aroma. Medium lovibond caramel ensues and bolsters. Trace biscuit hints surface as it warms. Very enticing aromawise. Laconic snap of toffeeish malt upfront in aroma is readily overrun by an enveloping combination of citrus pith and quinine. Quinessentially ""Northwest"" hop flavor rushes in once initial bitterness partially subsides, and is of a spruce needle, lemon zest and grapefuit flesh mélange. Hop bitterness is mostly unyielding and melds with the subdued malt character to lend a burnt biscuit impression. Lightly bodied overall, but with ample dextrins for a soft, almost airy mouthfeel. Finishes with a resurgence of caramel sweetness secondary to a lingering sharp, alpha acid bite. An assertively hopped IPA, deep in hop flavor, heavy handed in hop bitterness and redolent of hop bouquet. Superb. One glass of this would bitter an entire tank of Budweiser. A sincere cheers to Feloniousmonk for sending the growler!"
"Served from a growler named Jamshed, which came to NoVA courtesy of the host with the most: feloniousmonk."
"Grapefruit juice with orange smoothie. Balanced for an IPA, not very hoppy or carbonated, which I liked. Maybe lost a bit on the trip down, and it did in the hours and couple days from opening. Was best in first few minutes, with extra head. Loved suctioning that cream on top. A six out of five in drinkability.. Excellent citrus grapefruit aroma. Beautiful appearance of hazy copper."
Masala Mama poured a beautiful copper red with a frothy white head from its 1/2 gallon growler. The glass was covered in thick multifaceted lacing.
"Thursdays at my house growing up were always reserved for family time. My father would sit and tell us kids stories about the Korean War, while my mother would sit in her chair knitting the ever-present and continually unfinished sweater. Tommy and I would listen intently to my father while occasionally looking over when my mother would mutter an expletive or two while missing a knit or pearl. "
"There are people up in the Twin Cities that worship this stuff. Not just the normal, sit-around-and-proclaim-how-good-it-is type worship, but full-blown, black mass, hood-cloaked, blood-spilling, chicken-sacrificing worship. "
"Ah, the highly celebrated and widely touted Masala Mama. I'd looked forward to savoring this brew for quite some time and I'm now pleased to report that the hoopla (hop-la?) surrounding this beer is well deserved. "
"Oh Mama...Mama I'm Comin' Home...Yo Mama Didn't Raise no Ugly beers...too many euphemisms to apply to this one. I received a super fresh growler of the Masala Mama courtesy of a trade with Tavernjef, and I am certainly glad to have tried it, and given that I'm most of the way through the growler, I must have liked it...OK enough banter, on to the beer."
"A beautiful deep golden color with highlights of red and orange, topped with a thick, creamy yellow foam. The aromas of pine and grapefruit rind are floating above the glass, citrusy and resiny. It is medium bodied with good malt structure finishing with a very refreshing bitterness. The texture is sticky with hop oils and creamy malt. The hops dominate the flavor with grapefruit/orange rinds that blend with the malt backbone to give it a bit of spiciness. among the best IPA's I've had. A true hop nectar."
Please allow me to boost this fantastic beer up the charts of the BA Top 50...
"To quote Christopher Walken in his SNL role as the continental,"
"All the west coast IPAs got together and met up in Minneapolis. They chatted, exchanged many pleasantries, but by night's end the weak were sent home and the strong fought to the death. We all know how tough IPAs can be; not one would concede defeat. They all died that night. The janitor, his name Pete, was left to mop the killing floor. Cascades here, Centennials there, Chinooks and their carcasses rotting holes in the floor. He sent everyone home, said he'd close up, and took the mop bucket in back. When folks came to work the next morning they smelled a bready funk in the air. There was a new brewery in town."
What we've got here is a bonafide hop bananza
"Sampled from a 64oz growler on 3/18 with a best before date of 3/22 fresh from the brewery via the felonious one, too who I am now indebted."
"Uncle Jimbo shared his growler that he received from a fellow BA, I am glad that I was able to try this much talked about IPA. The pour was a very cloudy light apricot. The hops were over whelmingly citrusy...a few discussions of what type they may be, but don't think we came up with any answers (hops beginning with ""C""). The mouthfeel is very nice, just medium. I found this a very balanced beer, one of the more balanced ones I've had. What I found intriguing was that the malt, while not sweet, was able to support the hops, which while present, were not bitter. It was easy to drink. I am glad that we had a nice fresh sample to drink."
Sampled from a growler back filled at the brewpub.
"Masala Mama, like the name. I had a glass of this out of a growler. It was pretty- a nice orangey amber colour with a small head. Apparently the first pour out of the growler had a huge head but I could tilt my glass while my boyfriend poured so the beer was calm. Yes, it was calm. The aroma was mild for what I would expect out of an IPA, but I found that to be a good thing. It smelled citrusy and hoppy. It tasted citrusy as well and hoppy, more towards the end. A bit fruity and malty and very well-balanced. The mouthfeel was lovely too, smooth and medium consistency. Drinkability is good, as I could've had much more of this beer and I dont think i would've gotten tired of it or sick from it. All things considered, this is one hell of an IPA, and one hell of a beer in general."
"This brew is fresh out of a 1/2 gallon grolwer thanks to all-star BA Tavernjef. So, I open the packaged, open the growler, and a loud ""swish"" sound ensues. This brew pours out of the growler with a medium reddish/orangeish copper colour with an ample head of foam that is as big as the rocky mountains. The aroma of this brew is huge. First there is the huge smell of freshly cut citric and floral hops. Than a lovely, English-like, buttery, biscuity, bready, malty aroma shines through. The taste follows suit. It is big bolshy hops up front, and lovely biscuity malts in the middle. The balance achieved in this brew is excellent. The hops hit first up front. They are bitter, but for a regular IPA, they are not too bitter. The hops are placed in the background when the middle of this brew comes through with the flavors of buttery biscuits, and fresh baked french bread. The hops come back in the finish of this brew, but this time they have been mixed in with the buttery flavor of the malts. The finish of this brew reminds me of the ""candy coated"" hop flavor in Weyerbachers Hops Infusion. This brew reminds me of what the Hops Infusion would taste like if Weyerbacher did it up right. The mouthfeel is perfectly balanced and reminds me of a pint of freshly pulled cask ale from England. The carbonation is soft, and luxurious, and really makes the flavor of this brew explode on your tongue and in your mouth. The after-taste is dry, but flavorful, and it produces some very heavy hop burps. Nice! The drinkability is perfect, as this brew has just the right abv, aromas, flavors, and textures to make it a reall ""all-night-drinker"". One hell of a session IPA, they really have to start bottling this stuff. The number one single IPA on BA for a reason, but to me, there are still a few IPAs and 2XIPAs that I like better. Still, if I lived close to this brewery, i'd be a happy camper!"
"Well I had heard alot about this beer, but I hadn't been to Town Hall since my beer appreciation really got going. Expectations were high for this one and they were met and exceeded. Simply wow. This beer is amazing. The hazy orange color and the citrusy aroma are spot on. The flavor is very hoppy but with a pleasant malt balance. It's just damn enjoyable. Very tempted to give it all fives. I can't wait to have another."
"Beautiful hazy orange-amber with a full white head.Fresh,bright,full hop nose.This is the smell of I.P.A. "
"I know about the hype from this beer, but it was simply fantastic. It was hazy orange-gold in color, with a white head. Smells of grapefruit, floral, and hops. Big hops and grapefruit flavor, with a nice finish that leaves your lips smacking. Most of the people I was with couldn't handle this, it is only for bona fide hopheads. This is definitely the best beer at Town Hall."
Received as part of the first GIF (Growler-It-Forward).
Growler from Tavernjef.
This beer pours a perfect shade of copper. A medium sized creamy looking egg shell colored head graces the surface. The retention is excellent. Lace patterns are intricate and web like. Eye Candy? Oh yeah. But it gets better. 
"This was my first cask-condition ale, and I gotta say it was amazing. The server brought it out to me and it had a huge cascading effect. My anticipation just grew watching it cascade. It eventually settled to a hazy orangish/bronze color with a thick, creamy tan head. It left excellent lacing while I sipped it down. The aroma exploded with a huge fruity, citric smell. The flavor was full of fresh fruity/citric hops. It left you with a nice bitterness, but not too overpowering. It was really silky smooth; very easy drinking. I would definitely drink this beer again."
On cask at the brewpub...
"A beauty all the way around. Strong sweet malt, spicy aromatic hops, big healthy body. I would definitely rank this up there with Victory Hop Devil, my all time favorite. I forgot to ask if they bottle it so I could take a sixer home. Definitely next time. If you are going to have one beer at Town Hall, make it this one."
"Beautiful bronze color, firm white head. Aroma is a bubbling, bristling bouquet of intensely fruity hops, just what I love in an IPA! Great citrus, grapefruit, peach notes, on the palate a huge bite of hops, but mellow thereafter. Tingly and tasty, this should please any hophead. If I was a teaching assistant at the nearby U of M and I just got away from the maddening throng, this would be my solace. If I was an actor at any of the nearby theaters and I got off the boards before bar close, I'd rush here for my relief. Heck, I'm going to make it my business to have more business in this neighborhood, just to enjoy this beer more often."
This beer smells great with a very natural fragrant peach. Tastes like it smells but the best part is that the peach is not overpowering and let's the original Jai Alai flavor come through. It only adds to an already great beer. I never grew tired of drinking it and in fact had two which is rare for a fruit adjunct beer.
Off the chain. Jai Alai made sexy time with a peach and this was their baby. God bless the parents.
Firkin fun.
A: This looks just like Jai Alai.

I had this on tap at the CCB tasting at Cervesas. Fun event!
"The pour is exquisite: a clear deep orange body is topped with a giant, yellow, ice cream, sheen and massively rocky whipped cream head. Amazing retention and lace. Aroma is really outstanding: fresh juicy peach, cooked peaches in dessert, peach cobbler. Very intense, full, and unmistakable. Taste is bitter, spicy, mild peach, sweet peach cobbler. Palate is soft, bitter, biting, and fairly intense. Oily and bitter rather than dry and astringent."
Poured on tap at the CCB tasting room. Beautiful dark golden orange with a foamy white head that revives with a swirl.

Thanks to theduderules for sharing this awesome growler with tasting group.
Set up on a trade from Afksports. Thanks Brendan.
"On-tap at the pub, tried next to the papaya. Theu look the same to me, dark peach, not much retention... The aroma is lots of alcohol with a peachy finish... The taste shows off the peach more in the taste, especially compared to the papaya. The finish is so smooth and sweet, great depiction of peach. Shows off peach well but doesn't prove to be a great ipa. An ipa with a with a peach finish, good, nothing special."
Thanks to Superstar North Babylon for hosting a Cigar City tasting and having this available.
"Cigar City smokes NYC at Rattle N Hum. Peachy aroma, it smells likethe real thing rather than extract. Dark yellow body, little head. Smooth drinker, though carbonation is right there. More of a pale hale in terms of bitterness tasted. A Nice novelty."
I had this one after the Kumquat Orange and Cigar City Brewing did a much better job imparting the fruit flavor from the name of the beer into the beer itself. Great strong peach aroma as well as flavor added to a delicious IPA. Like the original and want something different? Go for this sweet version.
"Had this at the CCB tasting at Beer City in North Babylon, NY."
Reviewed from notes. Thanks to Casey for this growler.
The favorite craft beer I had during NYC Beer Week. Probably one of the favorites I've had ever. Ever ever? Ever ever. Where can I buy more of this and how. Please let me know and I will. 
"A - Pours a shade or two darker than normal Jai Alai, but generally appears similar. The head and lace may not be as vigorous."
On draft at my house.
Growler poured into my CCB tulip.
"Drank from a 750 ml growler purchased at Steady Habit Brewing Company, Haddam, CT"
"Big time citrus nose in this one. Sustained white head. Taste is full of citrus notes but not too over the top as some citra-hopped beers can be. Not abrasive. It has a nice soft malty base to it, maybe that's why. My kind of IPA. Mild but lasting bitterness in the end."
"Really smooth and drinkable for a double IPA, really liked it."
"L: Hazy, a little bit gold, a little bit orangish. Nice white head that leaves a speckled lacing on the glass. "
"Delicious beer, hoppy, dank, citrus notes...awesome beer all around"
750ml growler into a Duvel tulip.
"Since my original review was a bit on the short side, this is a re-review done on 09/19/2015 with a growler filled about 12 hours ago. Poured into a Duvil tulip glass. "
"Citra, did I say Citra. The nose on this beer is amazing and the taste matches the profile. Smooth drinking and Jon keeps tweaking this beer for the better. The abv was once around 5 now stands above 7 giving it that extra punch. Seek this beer out if you love Citra hops."
"Aslin can hit home runs with their IPAs, but also has their share of so-so ones (for the price). This is a home run. Huge powdered sugar on the nose along with creamsicle and some vanilla. That same powdered sugar is in the flavor, but without the sweetness. Milky/creamy fruit, that creamsicle, and again that vanilla. Tastes a little bigger than 6.5%. Nice long finish with lingering fruity hops, this has enough bitterness that it doesn't just disappear like some NEIPAs. Maybe a little overpriced, but actually less overpriced than many of Aslin's beers. Great."
"Looks great - a hazy golden yellow with an off-white head and nice lacing. Smells like an orange creamsicle. Flavor-wise the vanilla is too strong, overpowering the oranges and hops. Slightly cloying which is not a good thing especially at just 6.5% abv. The slightly harsh mouthfeel has moderate carbonation. On the bright side, this might be the first IPA my wife enjoyed more than I did - she was a fan of the vanilla."
"Poured a light yellow-gold body with minimal head and no lace. The lactic/lupalin aspect dominates the aroma. Smooth, fuller body with a milky sweetness that I can’t quite pinpoint. Some hoppy dryness on finish with an earthy bitterness for some balance."
L: Poured from a growler to a pint glass. Had an orange-amber color and a thick and cloudy consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy head that quickly dissipated. Solid lacing.
super orange beer with tiny little bubbles at the top. Almost no real head retention at all. 
"16 oz. can. No date, but about two weeks old. Poured into Belgian ale glass."
On tap at Warpigs in Copenhagen.
Reminds me of a more citrusy Two Hearted. Smooth mouth feel (lactose?). Hazy orange color; completely opaque. Not the bet beer Aslin has put out but if I had it just about anywhere else I would be very impressed
Poured from a 16 oz can into a Willi Becher pint glass.
The beer is a bright orange that is cloudy and opaque. Strong orange citrus and rind smell with a slight sugary vanilla sweetness. Creamsicle. Taste is exactly like Creamsicle and a bright orange citrus note. Medium and dry finish. A bit acidic. Biting carbonation. Delicious.
Poured on tap into a becher glass at Chuchkey DC.
"On draft, served in a goblet glass. Pours a creamy hazy straw yellow body, one finger white head, great retention, lots of lacing. Smell is orange creamsicle, citrus, grapefruit, vanilla, lactose, a touch bit of caramel and that Conan mineral. Flavour is orange creamiscle made up of hops and orange addition, it's what I would imagine a such beer to be. Nice orange julius character, creamy lactose, minimal caramel sweetness, mild grapefruit bitterness that keeps the beer from being cloyingly sweet. Nice tropical fruit and citrus hop presence. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, soft and appropriately carbonated without being too cloyingly sweet nor too bitter. Really a nice beer, enjoyed this one a lot more than the counterparts brewed by the likes of Mikerphone and Untitled Art which are a few of my regional breweries doing this kind of thing."
"So, I may have found myself looking at real estate near Aslin. This was probably in no way related to this specific beer. Probably."
"I like a little extra sweetness in my IPAs, and this one delivers with the candied orange coming through from the (presumably) natural orange fruit addition. Any more pronounced and it might come off as cloying, but it’s right in the sweet spot (pun intended) for my palette. A lot going right for this beer, in general, and that little bit of extra honey-like sweetness just pushes it over the edge. A new favorite and real standout amongst the crowded NE IPA crowd."
"Nice yellow orange pour, very hazy but not soupy. The smell is perfection, strong citrus aroma. Same goes with the flavor. Great juice taste, some cracker base behind, minimal bitter that is perfectly balanced. Not sweet, not bitter, no linger from either. Nice mouthfeel, full but not overly creamy and no lingering bitter or cloying sweetness. Typically I prefer the bigger, thicker, stronger citrus IPAs but this one hit me absolutely perfectly. Took me about 5 minutes to roll through it. My new favorite offering from Aslin."
"L: Gold, transparent. Gorgeous head with nice lacing. Good retention."

This is a good Fresh Hop ale! Great dank taste and awesome hoppiness. Nice to sip for a long time. Looking to get a four pack toon as it is out on the shelf at present.

Bottled 10/09. Received in trade with an Ohioan. 
12oz bottle purchased as a single for $2.50. Stamped born on date of 10/09/2017.
"Yakima Fresh is a bright and clear golden yellow with a dense and foamy bone white head. Streams of bubbles flow from bottom to top, and rings form on the sides of the glass."
"Description: Golden, honey color and clear with only a small amount of head. Smell is dank, tropical fruit (mango) and hoppy; pretty well balanced. Taste is similar but with floral notes as well. Feels sort of like an East Coast IPA with a danker, more bitter finish. Feel is light to medium body and medium to high carbonation."
"I may be drunk, but this beer is damn good. The look is filtered, not hazy, but a very aggressive foam head that lingers. Smell of malt in a good way that is nicely balanced with the hop bill. The wet hop reminds me of MBC dinner in an odd way. Very sweet taste that is sugary yet citrusy, the only thing holding this back is the plastic mouthfeel in the aftertaste. I really enjoyed this one, a mix between Dinner and Pliny, as it should be (from from Ohio), seek this one out."
Yes finally a fantastic ipa.
"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a glass goblet. Light golden colored body, with a proper pour yielding a two-finger white head that left some pretty lacing. Big pop of citrusy hops on the aroma, followed by dark bready and caramelly malts. Not overly sweet despite the strong malt presence. Well balanced, with lots of bitterness and a clean, dry finish. Awesomely delicious and drinkable. Get it while it's fresh!"
Bottled on 10/17/2016. Enjoyed on 01/15/2017.
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/17/2016. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy medium golden/light amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, lemon, orange zest, light pepper, pine, light honey, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, lemon, orange zest, light pepper, pine, light honey, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/citrus peel/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, lemon/orange zest, pine, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately sticky/resinous, and grainy/creamy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 7.5%. Overall this is an incredible fresh hop IPA! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the balanced bitterness. Very bright, juicy, and pretty dank on hop character; with just the right amount of malt body/sweetness for an amazingly well balanced IPA. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Pours a dark orange color with decent clarity. About a half inch of foam leaves ample lacing. Aroma of pine and floral, fresh hops for sure. The flavor has a lot of pine, grapefruit rind and earthy bitterness. Full bodied, well carbonated and crisp IPA. Another nice hoppy beer from Columbus Brewing, this one was easy drinking."
I got this IPA in a beer trade and I loved it. It’s delicious and it goes down quick.
Glad this is in bottles finally!!
12 FLUID OZ bottle
"Appearance: Pours clear and amber, with a three finger head; nice stickage and spotty lacing "
"Wow, this beer took me by surprise. I've been very underwhelmed by the Columbus IPA lineup in light of their reputation (they're extremely strong IPAs to be sure, but astronomically overhyped). I anticipated another very solid beer but nothing world class. This beer though is among the best instantiations of a wet hop IPA I've tried to date."
12 oz bottle poured into spiegelau glass bottled on 10/17
Clear sparkling gold with a large fluffy white head settling to a blanket.
"Bottle dated 10/17/16, poured into tulip. Mild-medium haze, light golden color. Bright white head with a mix of fine and medium sized bubbles, that dissipates into an island in the middle, leaving soild vertical lacing. Smell is very strong, delicious hops. Taste is extra juicy hops up front that fades to a mild bitterness. Very, very tasty beer, almost perfect beer for me."
"On tap at The Brew Kettle Works in Strongville, OH."
"Really nice looking brew. Aromas are very decent and the flavors follow suit closely . . . Tropical, dank, resinous. Yakima, for me, is one of those hops that really stands out apart from many of the other more well know hops. This beer is just fantastic on all fronts. Similar to Hop Stalker but with a better appearance, better aroma and better feel. However, it doesn't finish as clean. Overall . . . Another good to terrific to great ipa from Columbus !"
Yakima Fresh Hop
"Half-growler filled at Rozi's Wine House in Lakewood, Ohio"
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow to orange with a fluffy white head. The nose is citrus, pine and a touch of grassiness. The taste is a great light biscuity malt, with the citrus, pine and tropical fruits. Overall, it's another great IPA from CBC, and I'll keep going back for more."
Growler fill from the Ohio Taproom. Take advantage while it lasts!
"Pours a hazed gold with 2+ fingers of whippy cream colored head. Clears a bit, very good lacing & head retention"
Slightly hazy golden color with a thick head. 
A home run
"Pale gold, really soapy enduring head, lively carbonation. Nose is pretty delicate with some bright, floral / citrus hop notes and some cracker malt. Taste has a light-to-medium hop resin underscored by some tangerine, nectarine and grapefruit. Finishes clean & bitter. Relies pretty have on Citra hops but well done regardless"

"Lemon gold with lots of carbonation, a hint of haze, and a finger of white head."
Beats Pliny
Great beer with a clean crisp finish. Very balanced and super drinkable but with tons of flavor and hoppy aroma. Maine has a great list of ipas and this is a great one
"Tasted from bottle. Pours gold with thick rocky white head. Cloudy. Aroma is lemony, tangerine, some grassy perfume notes. Very well balanced with lots of citrus flavor. Bready and caramel to balance the citrus bitterness. Lots of lemon notes. Awesome ipa."
"A really well carbonated, hazy IPA that just falls short in flavor. This one just showed up locally and I bought it right away, but it drinks like this one is 5 months old. I really hope that is the case because Lunch is a master piece but this is just not that."
"Beautiful, persistent lace, pale straw in color, slightly hazy, loads of tropical fruit & citrus notes, creamy mouthfeel, well balanced malt backbone and IBU. A very well made and tasty but spendy rendition of an AIPA. Like it a lot."
"Bottled 6/5/18, consumed 6/29/18"
Bottle poured into a Russian River Brewing Co pub glass
"Two month old bottle, consumer June 2018"
"Pours a straw color with very little head. The nose has light notes of pine and citrus. The flavor and body for are quite subtle - honestly, overly subtle. There is only a very soft hop bitterness on the finish."
"A brilliant straw color, very hazy, and a ginormous sudsy white head. MBC May brew the most beautiful beers I’ve ever seen."
"Pours a hazy straw-yellow color with a nice off-white head. Initial impression is extraordinarily clean, sharp-edged taste of lemon and pine. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Carbonation enhances the effect. Finish is dry and leaves a lingering pine bitterness. Quite drinkable; highly refreshing."
"Maine Beer Company ""Another One"""
"Whitish hued gold color. Very cloudy. Moderate head which settles to rim bubbles. It leaves two rings of lace, a few spots thereafter. "
Decanted from a 16.9 oz (500 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; bottled on 03/20/2018.
This one pushes all the buttons. Beautiful hazy yellow orange pour. The aroma bursts out of the bottle as soon as you pop the cap. Light citrus taste. Beautiful mouthfeel. I just don’t know how it could be better.
"Pours a cloudy medium straw color with an incredibly fluffy one and a half inch white head that left lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of citrus fruits, cracker-like malt, and a hint of spice. Tastes of mild grapefruit, apricot, lemon, cracker-like malt, floral notes and a hint of pepper. Dry mouth feel, crisp,light to medium bodied and medium carbonation."
"Light but excellent balance. Citrus, light floral, very slightly dank - grapefruit pith. Excellent ipa"
Wonderful light golden/straw opaque look with a thin white head from bottle. This one really looks nice in the glass. Great fruity with apricot highlights on the nose of this one without the normal sweet scents so prevalent with these IPA’s. Wonderful citric but light flavor with a feel almost like champagne.
One of the few somewhat under hyped beers. Better than Lunch IMHO and better than alot of other higher rated IPA's out there.
"It smelled really nice, but the taste was disappointing. I liked it better than Lunch, but I think Maine Beer Company's brewer just has different taste buds than I do. I find all their offerings rather ordinary, which I realize is not the consensus."
"On tap at Hollingshead in Orange, CA."
A: Hoppy with zesty citrus and light dankness with cracker-like malt sweetness.
"500ml bottle served in my Spiegelau IPA glass. Pours a hazy, pale yellow with a dense, four inch, bright white head embedded with bubbles across the froth. As the beer recedes delicate textured bands of lacing are revealed. Interesting nose - lemon, pith, spice, cat pee (thank you Simcoe) and crackery malts. Taste is fairly mild - lemon zest and more crackery malts. Pretty subdued for a 7.00% abc IPA. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation. All and all a decent IPA; however, given the price point and the influx of NEIPA's on the market, not a major market competitor IMO."

"1pint bottle dated 9/5/17 purchased at CBC in Plymouth. Nice straw color and citrus nose. Flavors are complex citrus that may include mango, pineapple and grapefruit. Very smooth and flavorful with only slight bitterness on the finish. Our initial experience with Maine Beer Co. was a very enjoyable one."
"About a 2% behind one of my all time favorite beers, Lunch. Great taste."
"Bottled ~3 weeks ago, picked up at the brewery for $6."
"A very nice IPA from a company which makes great beer. Pours straw coloured, very evenly cloudy. Very nice moderately mild citrus flavours; grapefruit, tangerine, a hint of lemon with a very pleasant finish with no bitterness. Not quite a full ""juicy"" mouthfeel but pretty darn good & a clean finish. I would certainly have it again."
"Pours a light gold. Frothy white head but no lacing. Aroma is a nice balance of pine and citrus. Nothing too overpowering. Taste is similar but it gets better with each sip. Feel is light-medium carbonation. Medium bodied. Overall, another fine offering from Maine Beer company, though a little bit overpriced."
"Had this on tap at the Hangar Pub in Amherst, MA. The beer came out with a hazy, straw colored appearance with a consistently thin white head and some thick lacing on the sides. The beer had a nice citrus aroma that was wrapped around a mostly floral smell. Taste was great; very refreshingly citrus without being too overpowering. Surprised the description says ""intensely hoppy"" since I found it thirst quenching and refreshing, not too heavy with the citrus hops. Mouthfeel complimented the beer well by making it crisp and well-carbonated. Overall, I dug this beer and felt it was a great IPA for a warm night."
Serving: Bottle
"Wow. I thought Maine Lunch was good, and this one is right up there with it. Multi-citrus notes and some grassiness in the nose, the malt is not overpowered by the four Hop varieties and both contribute to an exceptional beer. From a 16.9 oz. bottle at NJ's beer Mecca known as The Cloverleaf. $14 for the bottle and worth every penny. A World Class brew, for sure. If you can get it, do so."
"very light, cloudy look. smell and taste was super fresh and hoppy. after Dinner and Lunch, this is probably my next favorite Maine Beer Company brew."

Look is an opaque light straw with white head.
Had to have Another One after the first one. Great head on the pour again. Good IPA.
Bottled on 4.18.17
"The appearance had a nice light golden yellow-colored body with a carbonation seen rising at a moderate pace. One and a half fingered white foamy head that dies within a half minute, nice adequate spider web lacing sticks to the glass. The smell started off a strong citrus but bitter hoppiness coming forward through some nice sweet malts. The taste was bittersweet all the way through with more of a pronounced sweet grapefruit flavoring to it. It had a nice sweet citrus aftertaste and a dry bittersweet finish. The palate about a light to medium, somewhat sessionable for a 7.2 ABV - I like it. Carbonation hits ya like a good AIPA should - nice and harsh. Overall, this is a great AIPA that I would gladly have again."
"I had been passing this one by on for some time, glad I grabbed one and gave it a try. Very easy drinking, light IPA. Not as heavy on the fruit/citrus as a lot of other IPAs being produced in the northeast; very clean, little grassy. Hope to try it again soon."
Bottle: Poured a pale yellow color ale with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of floral grassy hops notes with light citrusy notes is quite pleasant. Taste is a great mix of citrusy hops notes with some grassy/green notes with light residuals sugar notes and minimal bitterness. Body is about average with good carbonation. Another super IPA from a great brewery.
"One of their best beers. Big grapefruit up front but doesn't completely dominate. Very tasty, can not stop drinking it. You would never guess it's a 7 percenter."
Bottle Date: 3/21/17
"12-day-old bottle. Pours a hazy pale straw, like a half lemonade half water mixture, with a huge white head that appears rocky at first but settles down to a very creamy layer that leaves a good amount of lace. Nose is crisp fresh hops...more of the simcoe and cascade than the citra to my nose. Taste is full of citrus and pine along with some stone fruit, but very much a dry take with only a bit of cracker backbone. The hops really do shine here with a faux sweetness up front that disappears and leaves a dry firmly bitter finish that tells you this is no orange juice NE IPA for sure. Overall, freaking great. Biggest downside is it is overpriced and I couldn't afford to drink it regularly even if I could get it."
"Huge foamy nano-bubble head rests lightly on a dark lemonade body. Poured into a tulip extremely slowly down the side and the head still shot up there. Opaque, but not solid when held to light; finely particulate. Lacing? 10/10"
L: A perfect hazy yellow with two fingers of white head. 
Damn I'll have another one!
B- / WORTHY
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. A hazy golden-yellow color with a rocky white head. Smells like grapefruit pith mixed some pine and straw. Tangy citrus up front on the first sip. Some earthy notes but not dank. The pine is there, too. Medium-bodied but dry and light on the finish. Moderately bitter and assertive, unapologetic. I enjoyed this."
"Had this one at a bar in Portland, ME and again from growler station in Greenville, SC. Hoppy citrusy smell...fruit forward taste includes hints of pineapple, mango, and pine. Dry, crisp and somewhat earthy on the end. Very good."
"It is, in fact, another great IPA from MBC. Pours the classic Maine clear yellow, with some visible carbonation. The nose is absolutely unbelievable. Citrus fruits and hops explode out of this beer. The palate has the great crisp, clean Maine feel, though the notes aren't quite as prominent as the nose would lead one to expect. Solid mouthfeel, though a touch watery. A great beer on the whole."
"500ml bottle, about 10 days old. "
"This was a new “advertised” at our local craft beer merchant; my Another One was special delivery from Freeport, Maine. I purchased a 22 oz bottle dated 02.21.17 but it was pricey. If you’re in the Freeport area you may not feel that. "
"Had on tap. Pours hazy, light yellow in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is lemon, tangerine, cracker and a touch of pine at the end. Bitter, light bodied and moderate carbonation. Makes for a tasty IPA. One of the better beers I have had from Maine. I will get this again."
"Bottled 01/03/17, so about 3 weeks old."
one common trend i'm finding w/ all of Maine's beers is that they must be had on tap! i find a complete night and day difference in taste between their beers coming out of the bottle vs when having on tap. this one is no exception to the finding and IS a world-class ipa. only when it's on tap though.
Great stuf
Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle dated 9/20/16 into a tulip glass. 
"Pours golden with white head. It's as advertised, dry and bitter, but super clean. It doesn't have too much sweetness like some West Coast or Midwest IPAs and it's not overly bitter. It has nice balance. Another One is incredibly refreshing and to me, this is the best IPA in the MBC lineup."
Had this one on tap at the taproom.
Poured out of a bottle into a speiglau IPA glass. 
"Yet again another fantastic beer from MBC. Someone recently described it as easy drinking like MO, but with the hop profile of dinner. I wouldn't go that far, but it is close. It appears lemony with ample white foam. It smells of a fresh flower bouquet and the taste is similar with some tropical fruit. The mouthfeel is smooth with some hoppy bitter bite. Overall, this is just fantastic and I wish I had more."
"This is a wonderful lighter IPA. It is smooth, more fruity than flowery. The hops are there, but not overpowering. It comes across as a session, but the ABV says otherwise... :)"
"Look: hazy, pale/straw."
"Bottled 7/12, poured into nonic pint. Super cloudy gold yellow, very foamy and very active with milkshake style lacing. Lemonish hoppiness scents. Hoppy and citrusy taste with slight malt notes and a very mild bitter tang in the back. Nice refreshing feel. Great beer."
"Tons of tropical fruits and grass on the nose; mostly papaya. Taste is a mix of citrus and pine with some floral notes; there is a little bit of the tropical character you get on the nose but not much. Quite dry and very bitter finish. Medium body with great carbonation. Overall, very good if you like bitter beers; drinks like an old school east-coast IPA with a fruity twist."
"22 oz bottle. Pours golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head, nice lacing and lively carbonation. Aroma is of citrusy hops, tropical fruit and bready malt. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Citrusy hops, bready malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long, dry. Another great brew from MB."
"My favorite Maine Beer offering (I've yet to try Dinner). Pours a beautiful golden/yellow color. Smell is intense pine. Great balance between pine, citrus and bitterness on the palate. Love it."
"For as hoppy as this beer is, it lacks the punch it should have. The smell is light and it tastes the same, but at 7%abv it shouldn't taste this way. It just lacks body, doesn't taste like a fully developed beer. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it tastes like a session or pale ale. I expected a lot more from another one"
"Bottle dated June 21, poured into Lawson's tulip glass."
Bottle to tulip. Straw colored with very little head. Almost a fresh-cut grass nose. Well balanced and tasty as all MBC brews are. Hoppy yet somehow crisp and refreshing.
Poured from the bottle into a snifter. Enjoyed a week after bottling.
The Citra hops are amazing. This is better than lunch.
Bottle dated 05/24/16
poured into a snifter from bottle. looks nice hazy yellow with creamy foamy head that lays for a while. nose is nice lemon. pineapple some lemon rind and floral notes. mouthfeel is medium and compliments the beer well. seems to be nothing much going on front end here. by mid to end palate I seem to be getting more intense lemon and some floral notes. overall a good beer but lacks in overall punch from start to finish. I prefer lunch tenfold. I would not seek out but would not turn down. I guess I like my ipas a little more harsh. this is easy drinking and refreshing.
"On tap. Nice bathtub suds, lacing and light amber color. Clean taste with a distinct lack of floral notes."
"The best beer I drank at the brewery (Dinner was not available). Made the 20 min out of the way drive worth while. Would definitely drink again, but all Maine Beer Co. beers are overpriced, can get better beers elsewhere for much less."
"All the MBC IPAs, besides Dinner, look so similar. "
"Had at Moxie in Madison on Friday night on tap. Into a pilsner-like glass it comes out a bright yellow color, very subtle haze, and a thin white head that fades fast and doesn't leave much lacing."
"Very good, but immediately wished I had ordered the Wormtown Be Hoppy. This just didn't pack the flavor punch. Sure is hoppy. At $10 for a draft, expected more."
Amazing beer. Better than Lunch in my opinion (and Lunch is great).
"Extremely light in color, yellowish gold with ample bright white head. Excellent retention. Aroma is citrus, grass, hay, earthy. The taste follows, with bitter, resinous qualities as well. The body is medium-light with moderate-high carbonation. One of my favorite IPAs."
Yum! Maine can do no wrong.
"I shouldn't be surprised by this after Dinner, but wow. I need to try all MBC offerings because this once again blew my mind. Beautiful, glowing, light haze, fluffy head. Aroma of hay and melon. Taste just levels of citrus, melon and stunning hops, puckery finish."
"Not a fan of the light yellow / straw color, but the thin white head is sticky an laces up nicely. Aroma is phenomenal - citrus and tropical fruit with a hint of malt. Flavor is really nice - not a hop bomb - with a delicate bitterness that's very flavorful, again with the tropical fruits, and some resin that magically doesn't wreck the palette. Finish is fairly clean, slightly bitter. Hope I can try again on a hot summer day."
Pours light yellow with a large head with medium retention and lots of lacing. It's downhill from there as the beer has limited flavor and is thin and overcarbonated. A poor example of an ipa especially given the price.
"Long awaited. Poured into a teku, very fresh."
"Pours a light yellow. Not much foam on top. Smell is hard to describe - but doesn't match the slightly bitter but smooth, lightly fruity flavor. Leaves a nice lace on the glass. Definitely going to have ""Another One""!"
Super refreshing IPA out of the bottle
truly great MBC offering often overlooked due to Lunch. clean tropical and fruity hops with balanced bitterness. very nice mouthfeel and truly a remarkable brew
"32oz growler filled at Heinen's in Mentor, Ohio"
"Bought a few bottles at the brewery on 4/27. Pours a very light color with a slight haze...head disappeared almost immediately after pouring. Very mild citrus and hop floral aroma barely coming through...unfortunately not much else going on here. Taste follows suit leaving me wanting more. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and thin :/... I'm not sure whats up with this batch but I remember this beer being much better when I first tried it. I love Maine brewing so I will have ""Another One"" next time I visit the brewery."
Excellent IPA full of flavor.
"Pours a pale straw in color with a hint of haze and a finger of short lived bone white head. Aroma is subdued; grapefruit, floral hops, bready malt, and a touch of pine. Taste is lightly citrusy with floral notes and a decent bready malt presence. Finish is fairly clean with and subtle underlying bitterness. Light-medium body and moderate carbonation."
"Look: Hazy golden color, inch of white head, nice lacing, head dissipates but always leaves a film and a halo."
"Fourth in a line of five Maine brews, this pours a light yellow, again with a designer's closet full of lacing!"
A good beer to drink nice and slow. Tastes a bit earthy. Drinks a bit heavy at 7% abv
"Easy drinking beer with lots of crisp hops, nice finish too."
"Pale straw color draft pour into a tulip glass. Small tight bubbles quickly turn into some spotty lacing. Smell is citrus fruits, white grapefruit and light malt. Taste is fantastic grapefruit and citrus. I am not getting any pine in this one. Finishes super clean. Mouthfeel is light. I have heard great things about this beer and I have to say, it lives up to the hype. Super clean and very refreshing. I could hammer a ton of this if I had better access to it. Highly recommended."
"Picked up 2 bottles at halftime bevs. Pricey stuff. But worth it. Pours hazy, citrus and pine notes. Drinks amazingly. A fine IPA, if spendy but grab one if you see it."
"16.9 oz bottle in a nonic glass, very fresh."
"had this on tap at Manhattan Pizza in Burlington VT. about a finger of head, nice retention, beautiful lacing left behind, probably the prettiest of any beer ive seen."
"Hazy, lots of suspended yeast, crisp and dry initial hoppiness gives way to the dankness of Simcoe andMosaic, and the lemony spiciness of Citra. A big YUM on this one..."
"Beautiful bright and vibrant golden orange. Hazy, and with a nice contrasting white, dense head. Great retention and sticky spotty lacing. "
"This beer is heaven in a bottle! The best IPA I have ever had, certainly better than heady. If you see this, GRAB IT!!!"
"A truly mellow but world class beer that's quietly beautiful and very delicious. Like it's close cousin Lunch, the beer has pine, grass and citrus aroma. Nothing bombastic but it fills the air around the bottle. Balanced. Taste cascades from tropical fruit to citrus to earthy hay in a single sip. Crisp, dry and slightly bitter finish that doesn't linger a second longer than you'd like. Man, this is good. Subtle in its greatness."
"Pint ish bottle. Pours straw gold with big foamy white head that lasts a long time, globs of lace. Orange citrusy aroma. Taste is very light and citrusy, orange peel, no maltiness to speak of. Medium mouthfeel. Easy drinking IPA that goes down way too easy for the abv, refreshing."
"L - hazy yellow straw, medium - big head after being poured into trillium tulip. whenever i see this kind of color in an IPA I start to get super excited. I know it's going to be floral and citrusy. so excited. 4.75"
"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle dated 10/20/15, today being 11/12/15. Pours a slightly hazy yellow-green-gold with a finger of dense white head that never completely goes away. Nice attractive lacing. It's a good-looking beer. I'm so used to a big piney/grapefruit initial smell on IPAs that this one took me by surprise. The first thing that hit my nose was a lovely floral scent, specifically rose petals, which I can't say I've ever encountered before. As it warms the smell becomes more tropical fruits and earthy herbs, but I still get the rose notes with the addition of lemon. "
"pours a golden/yellow hazy color, head dissipates quickly but leaves a good lacing. bubbles seen floating up the glass. smell is very light but fruity, oranges, pineapples, tropical. taste follows the smell to a T, just more intense. tropical fruits, oranges, pineapples, mangos, but very crisp and dry. sweet, but not thick or sugary. carbonation is perfect, per usual with Maine Beer's bottle conditioning. great brew! not better or worse than Lunch, just different, comes down to whatever you are in the mood for."
"Really good citrus nose and taste, but not as impressive as I was expecting. I prefer Maine beer on tap definitely. Nice fluffy mouthfeel."
Better than Lunch!
"I liked Weez a lot, but I always figured this would be more up my alley. Judging from the hazy straw color alone, it really looks promising. And it smells promising, too! This offers a great tropical fruit quality (like papaya and mango), yet it never fully sacrifices a balancing pine surge or a touch of malt (even though it's really faint at best here). The flavor easily lives up to the nose: it opens with healthy mango and papaya flavors and ends slightly bitter. As I drink more of this, some of the malt sweetness pops up, giving a nice sugar cookie character the blends with the hoppiness beautifully. And also as I drink more of this, it just seems to get better and better with each sip. It feels damn-near perfect on the palate - creamy, soft, dry, yet devoid of harsh bitterness. This might even be better than Lunch, and that's very high praise coming from yours truly."
"Look: cloudy, yellow, thin white head"
"Amazing nose, drinkable and refreshing. Wish it came in a bomber though. Would buy again in a heart beat."
"L: Hazy gold with a full, creamy white head. "
A: This poured a clear light gold with moderate white head.
"A very nice brew from Maine. Being a hophead who leans more toward the ctrus type hop flavors I found this to be nice and flavorful, but not having quite the hop punch that I typically revel in. This brew was remarkably balanced and very drinkable. Being that they are rather pricey, more than one in a great while is an expenditure I cannot reconcile. Definitely a special occasion type brew for me."
Poured from a 500mL bottle dated 9/08/15.
Solid beer. I give er a 97/100
"From a bottle that has 082515 on the label, so I'm drinking this a little over three weeks after it was bottled."
"Nice and bitter up front with a smooth feel at the end. Smells better than it tastes, but still tastes great. Had a real nice head to it."
"I probably shouldn't try to add anything to the brewer's description because it is spot on. Bottled on 08/25/2015, poured into a cool nonic, it's hazy sunshine with an honest foamy white cap and lots of sticky lacing. The smell is predominately hoppy, with pine, straw and flowers and a decent hit of sweet maltiness. Taste follows the nose with apple and mineral, as well. Lightly carbonated and resinous. A classic IPA, dry and crisp as advertised."
Poured from a 500mL bottle dated 6/30/15 into a Duvel glass
Appearance: It has a nice light golden/yellow color to it. It has a nice thick white head that dies down moderately and leaves some nice lacing.
A deliciously piney and citrusy IPA. The taste follows the nose better than most IPAs out there. Better than Lunch IMHO. Seems as though this one is getting harder to find on the shelves.
"Yellow, golden, goodness. "
Excellent IPA! A slight maltiness to start with a strong hoppy finish. Great effervescent mouth feel.
"Pleasantly light golden-yellow haze with a fluffy two-finger foam; head hung around for a while and then left a thin layer throughout. First sip felt like there was an intense hops carpet bombing campaign being executed against my mouth (seriously, it was pretty awesome). Smell is full of floral citrus hops. Big citrus and slight peach taste with a nice bitter finish, but the type of bitter you desire in an American IPA. Incredibly clean and fresh overall, excellent experience."
Excellent beer... The fresher the better. Heavy citrus and peach notes... Awesome.. I prefer it to Lunch which is another of their very good offerings
"Two plus fingers of bleached white foam, very delicately constructed and airy, uneven surface and no more than average retention, the lacing forms wide, mottled streaks which stick well before dissolving in place. Brightly yellow colored liquid, transparent, lots of active bubbles but dispersed and not in beads. The nose displays a genteel directness, focused tangerine, lemon, white grapefruit citrus neither sweet nor sour, lowkey florality yields to more peppery, biscuity, and piney notes, not especially leafy but hops dominated, the apricot, pineapple, mango fruit scents have tang and assist the general oily texture in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, remarkable smoothness given its overall dryness. Loaded with orange, tangerine and lemon citrus zest. Here the floral side spreads out further, at times comes close to being minty in addition to the piney qualities. White pepper, ginger and clove bring dimension, there’s really no overtly “sweet” element to be found. The carbonation is fine and pinpoint yet no wimp. Shows balance in a graceful, Fred Astaire like manner. Refreshing for how it does not seek to impress you with all kinds of fireworks."
L: nice light yellow
"Pale yellow and clean, clean, clean. Not the nose I expected but this is a top five IPA in my book. Citrus shows perfect and finish is fantastic. Best Maine Beer Co. in my opinion. Best in Maine period!"
"You hear a lot about lunch but this guys not trailing too far behind and is typically more available though allocations have gotten tighter of late. Grassy and herbaceous with light citrus notes dancing in the background. Perfectly carbonated and stupid easy to drink, can't believe this one clocks in at 7%. "
"Another very solid offering from Maine Beer Co. This is my next favorite so far just under Lunch. Color is pale yellow with some cloudiness. Taste is light, crisp, with a perfect amount of character. A great beer to drink on hot days."
"This is a spectacular IPA. Bottled 7/14/15. Tasted fresh and looked great. This was a surprise get and an even bigger surprise taste. As good as Lunch, I think. Pricey for sure, but worth it."
Very nice and fruity
"Pours golden and clear, with decent carbonation and a two finger head. Smells citrusy, floral, and fruity. Taste is balanced and crisp. Citrus and hops shining through. Highly drinkable with a peppery finish. Really great showing from Maine Beer Company.. this beer deserves all the credit."
Great beer love the smell and taste would drink it every day if I could afford it!
"Great alternative if you can't get ""lunch"". Just the right hops. Great flavor. Excellent and smooth."
"Snagged a bottle in Swampscott. Don't know what it is about Maine BrewCo, but for some reason I never balk at spending too much on one of their 16.9 oz bottles. Maybe because they're all so good? I dunno."
Home run! Buy as many as you can...it's as good as lunch IMO!
I'm going to get straight to the point with this beer. Must have . What a beer!!!!
"500 ml bottle, 6/9/15, poured into a snifter"
"A clear pale yellow body showing tons of carbonation holds a thick fluffy white head. The nose is awesome - fresh citrus hops with a lingering sweetness can be smelled from 3 feet away. Flavors of potent, but perfectly balanced citrus hops ride on just a small amount of cracker sweeteness. The feel is bright and vibrant, given away by the visible carbonation, with a clean finish."
"Light color, lighter than Lunch, hazy. Big head with small bubbles sticks around."
Bottling date of 05/12/15
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a 2 finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. Nice, fresh, citrus, hoppy, resin aroma. Grapefruit primarily. Very nice. Very nice, fresh, piney grapefruit taste. Great malt to hop transition. Light bodied and refreshing. Mild carbonation. Reminds me of Yellow Rose here in Texas. I have to thank my family for bringing this back down to me from Maine."
"I loved MO, but Another One was little to ""catty"" for my taste."
Another new beer from ACBF in Boston. Excellent overall. Can't wait to try with a cleaner palate.
Happy to get my hands on this today in Albany NY. On par or better than Lunch. Some tropical notes. Bitterness is not over the top but it has a strong bite. Beautiful cloudy appearance like a wit beer which makes it very appealing. Really enjoyable
"Drank from a 1 pint .9 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Portland, ME"
"Plenty of the Maine Co. beers around DC, but this was the first time I saw Another One here. Grabbed it today--bottle has a 4-7-15 date on it, so it's pretty fresh. A tad of a bitter bite on the end, but this pretty much lives up to the hype of the Maine IPAs."
My favorite from Maine. So happy we found it on tap tonight
Outstanding IPA. Maine beer co. Never lets me down!
"Honey colored body with a large foamy, white head. Body has a slight haze to it, but light comes through. Aroma is dank, citrusy, simcoe comes through a lot, with a dash of herb. A lot more citrus comes through in the flavor than the nose. Resiny, citrusy, hoppy and tasty. Mouthfeel is crisp, light, with a lingering hoppy taste. Overall and nice IPA."
Had this beer on tap on 4/9/15
"Bottle dated 3/10/15, poured a hazy yellow, one finger head. Smell mixed bright citrus and a mild pine/earthiness. Taste followed suit, slight bitterness, slight dankness, really delicious. MBC is a favorite and this is among their best."
"Wow is this a great beer. Easy drinking IPA, that's is full of juicy flavor. Maine has done it again. Can't wait to try the 2015 Dinner."
"A little lighter and less cloudy than I usually like, but what an easy-drinking beer. It is clean, flavorful and delicious. Marketing may not get its own category, but the bottle and label are so appealing that the drinking experience truly begins when you are lucky enough to spot a (fresh) Maine Beer Company product on the shelf."
"A truly great IPA. Much less aggressive than comparable 7% versions like Racer 5, Two Hearted, etc. Great smells of citrus, almost light on body compared to heavier competition, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. This is dangerously drinkable at 7%. This is also the kind of IPA that non-hop fans could love. If more readily available, this would arguably become my regular IPA. Well done."
3.15.15
Another excellent MBC beer. This brewery knocks it out of the park every time.
Phenomenal all around. I havn't had a beer from MBC that missed the mark and this one continues the trend. Well balanced cereal grain taste along with the well balanced hop profile.
Like all MBC beers awesome. Had in bottle. 7%. Delicious IPA
Pine on pine! Excellent taste. No bitterness. Curiously crushable.
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.
"The second pale ale I've had from Maine that exceeds Lunch, the first being MO. Granted this is an IPA and as such is much more comparable to Lunch than MO is. Really hard to say anything bad about Maine Brewing, they definitely have their act together. The best way to experience their ales is side by side, where I feel that you will get a strong impression of the nuances of each."
Prefer this to Lunch. Solid
"A personal favorite, this one is worth it every time. Hazy orange with a big three finger fluffy tan head with awe inspiring retention that leaves pretty lacing all over the glass. Big juicy tropical notes with some delightful dank floral stuff. Sweet citrus a la tangerines and ripe oranges. Aftertaste is delightful. Med to light body, smooth swallow, bone dry finish that leaves that delightful juicy aftertaste."
"Color is an awesome hazy gold - like a wheat field. Grapefruit nose, but with a little bready malt. First thing that hits the tastebuds is a citrusy grapefruit hop note, which fades slowly. The end is smooth, clean, sharp. A sweet white-bread malty taste is also present. Mouthfeel is light, but it coats the mouth nicely. Overall, really well balanced. Very tasty - and at 7.0% I could session this (for a little while)."
"Grabbed a bottle at Astoria Bier & Cheese, 11 days after the bottling date. Mmm, fresh beer. Reminds me of brand new Sculpin IPA and Other Half IPA, a couple favorites. There's a great balance of drier, spicy hops flavors and juicier mango and pine. The body is relatively light, but just big enough to support those awesome hops."
Notes from 1/29/15
"Look-color is a slightly hazy gold, pours a gigantic, sticky, huge chunks of which remain for the duration, die stream of bubbles rising from the surface reinforcing the head."
"Poured a clear, golden body with two finger head and lace ring down glass as I drank. Aroma is citric hops with touch of sweetness, whether it be grape or other fruit or touch of malt. Smooth, light bodied, real citric driven hoppy taste with balance from some fruit sweetness (malts kept minimal) and overall just a simple but well brewed IPA that is just great to relax with."
"A bit catty on the nose, but juicy taste. Pretty good."
Good stuff. I really like this beer!
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a eggshell white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of grapefruit and pine and some sweetness on the finish, almost a toffee scent. The taste was delicious with a well balanced take between the citrus of the hop in the beginning and the sweetness of the malt being throughout. Uncomplicated, but it doesn't have to be. A very good beer by anyone's standards."
"Second only to lunch. Excellent IPA, all the way around."
"Could be my favorite beer of all time. Love the pop of the hops, the citrus notes and the great finish."
500mL bottle with a 12/16/14 date. 
"Maine Beer Co. has a solid grasp on IPAs. Excellent head and retention; super citrusy; extremely balanced; a pleasure to drink. If you like Lunch, seek this one out. You won't be disappointed. Bottled on 12/16. Nothing beats a fresh IPA."
very good... every time I see it in a store I am picking up a few...
3 week old bottle poured into my IPA glass
"Pour is lightly hazed peachy yellow with a tight white head. Nose has a nice grain bill, bread crust and light dough. Hops are strong behind with a nice citrus / tropical note aroma. Taste follows suit, doughy malt with some toasted grains and a tropical hop punch behind. Extremely low bitterness making it very drinkable. Body is light and airy, a bit prickly in the finish with softer carbonation."
"Tons of grapefruit and floral notes. Malt backbone is solid but light enough. Intensely hopped, and it shows. Beautiful beer, well done."
"Nose offers intense citrus immediately. Palate is tremendously balanced, with fresh, piney hops and light maltiness to round out the mouthfeel. Juicy and refreshing. Not huge or intense, but a very tasty IPA."
Poured into a snifter from a bottle. 
"A great IPA. A little expensive at around $6.99 for a pint and .9 but worth it. Poured into a pint glass as a hazy dark gold color with a nicely carbonated medium size white head. Head retention is pretty good, fades to a covering of the glass. Thick bands of lacing remain on the glass throughout."
Poured into a Dogfish Spiegelau glass. Label says 092314.
"Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with a thick white head. Huge tropical fruit in the nose. A little pine and citrus. Taste follows the nose. Maybe a little caramelized onion in there as well. A nice malt backbone barely makes its presence known. This ""One"" is all about the hops. Very dank. No alcohol whatsoever. Just very clean and extremely drinkable. Reminds me somewhat of Alpine Bine & Vine. Mouthfeel is just super crisp, maybe slightly watery, but overall a great, easy drinking brew that goes down smoothly. The bitterness isn't harsh at all nor does it overpower the aroma. Overall, a fantastic IPA. It's obvious that the east coast is putting out brews just as good as the west coast."
Look: Transparent gold with a thick white head lots of pretty pacing and carbonation. 
"Pours a cloudy light orange with a bubbly, pure white head that leaves some uneven lacing down the glass."
Generous velvety head. 
16.9oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Yeasty bits left in the bottle. Bottle says 092314 17 on the side. Brought home in luggage after a friend's vacation.
"Look is clear golden with a 2 finger head when poured into a pint glass. Smell was almost all grapefruit. Taste was smooth, flavorful with grapefruit leading the way. I really liked the crisp mouthfeel, which is unusual for an IPA. This is an outstanding beer from Maine Beer Company, which seems to deliver time after time."
"This beer has the perfect balance of citrus and pine. Enough bite up front with a delicious and clean citrus-pine finish. Not a fan of the pint format, but I'll still be buying many more of these."
"This beer's color and clarity are those of burnished gold. At first, it seems to be hazy, but it reveals itself to simply appear to have more thickness as it goes closer to dark gold in its depths. The head is just barely off white, reaching a thick, heavy full finger and gradually falling to a chunky layer on top while leaving patching from the top of the glass down."

"Found one bottled dated 9-23 while in CT. I gave lunch a pretty harsh review last year based on their inflated price. But I actually really liked this beer. Beautiful, cloudy light colored pour, subtle yet fantastic nose. First sip or two very dry in the finish but I soon worked through that. Overall: delicate, balanced and delicious stuff. Still not sure I'd spend $75 for twelve 16.9 ounces but this was a real treat!"
bottled 9-01-14
"Appearance: Straw yellow to gold in color. Slightly cloudy, but translucent. Huge off-white"
Bottle shared by myself last night.
"Had this nine days after the bottle date, so it's decidedly fresh. Pours a cloudy straw color, aroma is citrus and sweet malts. Taste is clean and crisp,mwith just a hint of bite that fades to a sweet and dry finish. Fantastic."
Purchased at the brewery a week ago. Bottled 9/2/14 so less than 2 weeks old.
The nose on this one really runs the gambit in terms of citrus notes. Everything from mandarin oranges all the way through to grapefruit rind. The nose itself would score a 5. 
"16.9oz bottle received via a trade with ShroudOfDoom. My first beer from this brewery. According to the label, this was bottled on July 29, 2014, part of Batch # 14 (at least I assume that’s what the second 14 means). "
"03/22/14 From bottle a Home. This is my kind of IPA. Thick creamy head. Pale as a pilsner, full bodied as a Belgian, very little lingering bitterness & a perfect balance in flavor. It doesn't get much better than this."
Bottled 7/29/14 Poured from the 16 oz. bottle into a Tree House tulip pint.
Poured into a Sam Adams glass.
One my favorite non-VT beers!
Wow this is good. My first Maine Beer and I'm very impressed.
fucking awesome beer. really smooth and incredible taste. nice citrus flavor with a dry finish.
Nicely balanced with hoppy nose and slightly dry finish
"Is there such a thing as a damn near perfect IPA? Yes there is, it's name is Another One!"
Bottle opened on 6.18.14
Bottle Date: 7/29- tonight is 8/10. Quite fresh! 
Poured a hazy light brass hue with a one and a half finger frothy white head. There was very good retention and sticky lacing.
Bottle dated 6.24.14 poured into a Sam Adams glass
"On-tap 8/1/2014 at Track 84 in Warwick, RI served in a US tumbler pint glass."
Poured bottle dated 6/24/14 into Lost Abbey teku
"appearance - pours a hazy hazy bright gold, with almost no head. "
From the well-labelled bottle into the MBC ale glass.
A- Hazy yellow with a large frothy head. Head lasts awhile then leaves nice rings of lacing down the glass.
"A- hazy golden yellow, with a 2 finger pillowy head."
"Enjoyed out of a brown 500 mL bottle with a bottling date of 06/03/14 stamped on the side of the label and instructions to pour carefully due to the fine layer of yeast on the bottom of the bottle. Poured into a Speigelau IPA-specific glass, so while my first pour was careful, the glass wouldn't fit all of the bottle. But rather than throw away the final 3-4 oz of a bottle this pricey, I dealt with the fact that my second pour was going to unavoidably have yeast in suspension."
"Pours very cloudy bright yellow color with yeast sediment floating in it and active carbonation racing up to a 2 finger foamy white head that was full of bubbles; the head faded very slowly, leaving really good foamy lacing and rings as it went down. "
"A: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a yellow color and a cloudy consistency. There was a large, foamy, long-lasting head. Great lacing."
A: Poured into an IPA glass from a six day old bottle. Very cloudy as no settling has occurred. Light golden color.
"A beautifully balanced IPA with a nice piney and herbal bitterness, some graininess, and a dry finish. It pours a little cloudy, like many of their beers, but that doesn't really affect anything. A nice white head as well that sticks around. Tastes very fresh and clean, and perhaps a tiny bit grainier than I usually like, but it's also dryer than many IPAs and that makes the grain less obtrusive. Everything works here. Excellent beer."
"A - Translucent, light golden color with a snow white head that recedes slowly. Leaves a crown and a very sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Typical MBC beer look."
1.9 pint bottle? into pint glass
"A: cloudy; sediment suspended throughout the glass; an almost glowing yellow-orange coloring; with a moderately aggressive pour, got a 3 finger white heat with bigger bubbles that stuck around for a whole; moderate lacing;"
"Poured into a Tulip. Another solid offering from Maine. Dry, hoppy, grassy, and very smooth. Mild bitterness. Looks absolutely beautiful in the glass, with a hazy orange-yellow color, and 2 fingers of thick creamy head. Taste does not overpower you with citrusy flavors; instead, it tends to be dry and spicy. Yet, the silkiness is present and makes the beer go down well."
16.9 oz bottle was poured into a pint glass. 
"A: Bright yellow with a little yeasty haze. Soft, pure white big foam head."
"Yellow orange and hazy, bits of sediment in the pour, nice glow to this beer. Big pillowy head that settles to clouds atop the beer. Big chunky lacing. This is one pretty beer. Big citrus nose of orange, tangerine and grapefruit. Bright and juicy nose. The taste brings a wave of grapefruit and then some background notes of tangerine and orange. Malt sweetness stays out of the way on this one. Finish is bitter citrus and hints of pine with an herbal spicy ending. Overall another great beer from Maine Beer Co. Big citrus hop flavors and a bright nose make this a top tier IPA."
"Aroma: low sweet saltine malt aroma. Medium high tropical hop aromas: pineapple, mango, guava. Some creamy vanilla notes. No DMS, no diacetyl. "
"1 pint 0.9 fl oz. bottle, with bottled on date 05/06/2014 printed on the label. So this is some pretty fresh beer right here, considering the source was from Maine. My fourth beer from Maine Beer Company. Expectations are good based on this beer's high ratings."
Poured from bottle into a Jester King goblet.
"IMO, it's better than Lunch. Great hop character, really light on the palate. This is really good beer for the pale ale lover. I love the haze when I poured it in to my Teku; great golden with a little orange in color. The hops bitter bite hits you first... In a good way. I'll be drinking this again really soon."
"16.9oz bottle poured into IPA glass. Date on the bottle prints 05/06/2014. Golden-yellow in color with a pretty big frothy head that slowly reduces to a thin layer. Lacing is quite sticky and adheres generously to the sides of the glass. Aromatic bouquet of multiple types of citrus with grapefruit taking a front row seat. Tastes of grapefruit, other citrus, and the hops have a real nice bite on the tongue. Smooth, quite hoppy, and the palate is coated well. I enjoyed indulging Another One and can't wait to pick up another one. Another hit by the Maine Beer Company!"
A: Very light for an ipa. Pale yellow color with a big thick head that fades slowly and great lacing
500ml bottle (bottled 5-6-14...3 wks ago) poured into a Bruery tulip.
"Pours a hazy golden color. Nice fluffy head that lingers thru most of the beer. Grapefruit dominates the smells in a great way. Some pine as well but mainly fresh citrus. Taste is also quite citrusy. Juicy grapefruit hits up front and a nice soft bitterness lingers. Maine Beer Co has ""Another"" hit on their hands in this one. Very good. Will be heading to Maine in June and will need to stock up."
"Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint. This beer is hazy like chunky, fresh-squeezed lemonade. Only a little more golden. About a finger of head. Lovely to look at and admire. Then you realize it's beer, and you should be drinking it."
Pours really hazy straw like goden in color with a big fluffy one and a half finger white head that retains nicely.
Bottle dated 4/15/14 poured into Long Trail pint glass.
A: Pale straw in color. Typical Maine Brewing with a huge pillowy head that lingers around for quite some time.
Bottled 2/18/14
"I first had AO in the summer of 2014. Since then, something has changed for the worst. This new version of AO might as well be Peeper (it tastes, looks, smells, and feels identical). Hopefully I can bump up this rating when I reevaluate it in the future."
"No surprise, another hit from Maine Brewing. Very lively, citrus nose; I get oranges. A bit lighter coloring than what I would expect from an IPA, and the head was relatively thin and dissipated very quickly. There was moderate lacing left over. Perfect carbonation, medium body, citrus up front balanced perfectly on the back end by the hops. This is a very easy drinking IPA. If I could buy more than one (when it is even available), I could easily see myself having a session with Another One."
500ml
Aged lemon yellow cloudy pour. Brilliant generous white head and sticky spider lacing all over.
"A: Pale pastel yellow in color. Mostly clear with just the slightest haze. Forms a large, fluffy and relatively stable head. Excellent retention and copies amounts of lacing. "
"Appearance- Pours a hazy, pale straw colour with three fingers of foamy white head."
Thanks eagles22 for gifting me with this. 500ml bottle poured into a tulip. The brew appears a hazy pale yellow color with a big billowing white cap. Fluffy retention leaving patchy lace as it fades.
Bottle &gt; Sensory Pilsner Glass
"Maine Beer Company round 2, entering this with lofty expectations after MO. Poured into an American pint glass, this is a cloudy dark yellow brew just grading into orange territory, with a milkshake-like creamy white head that retains form admirably. Quite light in appearance and this carries over onto the palate, where the malts are concerned. But the hops? Bold and flavorful all the way, with a tropical gummy nose of mango and papaya, along with citrus peel and slight green pine notes. Very fresh and vibrant. Taste also skews towards the tropical, but there is an assertive grapefruit/tangerine/lemon rind presence and some gooseberry and longan as well, with a smooth bitterness that builds to rather high levels, some faint onion, pepper, and pine accumulating and coupling with the malts to yield a pleasant toasted effect. Moderate body and oily smooth mouthfeel. Juicy but bitter. Finishes smoothly bitter and clean, a bit tangy and citric with minimal heat. Zoe and Weez, you are next. Fantastic brewery and with any luck we'll get the other IPA offerings here in Alberta as well."
It pours out in a hazy yellow gold color.
Pours a hazy golden color with a two finger billowing white head.
500ml bottle into 4 hands tulip glass 
500ml bottle poured into tulip 12/4/14
Appearance: a golden to straw yellow color. great clarity until i dumped the yeasty dregs into my glass. a small white head that fades slowly and leaves behind a fairly strong lacing. 
A-golden color with a nice white head and good lacing
Bottle dated 03 24 14.
"Glorious, golden did float and flow! "
"16 oz. bottled purchased in the greater Washington D.C. area (Franklin's Pub and Brewery), bottled on 01/25/2014, poured into my FFF Teku glass, drank over 30 minutes"
"Slighty hazy golden-yellow pour, with a half inch or so of foamy white head that displayed good retention and lacing. Hops dominated the nose, earthy and pithy. Very well-rounded taste, citrus pith, pine needles, earthy undertones, with a distant bready malt base. Nothing new or exciting here, just a solid IPA overall. Crisp, dry mouthfeel, medium body, easy drinkability, with a lasting but manageable bitterness. Another nice one from MBC."
"500mL bottle with a Bottled On Date of 030414. Pours a mukry yellowish, brown with an inch of head. Good amount of lacing. Nice sweet hoppy aroma of citrus. Grapefruit, orange, and maybe a hint of sweet lemon. The taste is more of that great grapefruit flavor along with some sweet orange and lemon. Light bready notes but the grapefruit is the main flavor. There is a fair amount of bitterness but the overall sweetness may take away from it a tad. Moderate alcohol presence with a creamy mouthfeel. I love grapefruit so this one speaks to me. Overall, it's a really good IPA but just like about every Maine Beer Co. brew the price is too high to justify buying it often. Still worth having at least once."
"Bottled March 25, 2014. Opened April 3, 2014."
"500ml bottle. Given the child-related themes of the other Maine beers, I kind of thought that this one's name was right in line. I guess it's actually more beer-related than that - mea culpa."
Poured from bottle into a pint glass

"Picked this up as a consolation prize for not finding Lunch yet again; plus hey, it's an IPA from Maine Beer Co. and it was pretty fresh. Excited to try it."
"Appearance: pours a slightly hazy yellowish orange color. Big 2"" head lasts a long time. Nice lace paints the glass."
Drank from a Samuel Smith Nonic Pint.
Pours a golden orange with big fluffy soapy white head
"considering I have had Maine brewing beers in the past - i was very dissappointed with this one. I xpected something much better after having ""Lunch"" and was completely let down. It looked great when poored but that was completely ruined by the initial taste. Smell was actually decent, but obviously a huge let down."
"After tasting Maine brewing's LUNCH I had high expectations for this beer, and I have to say it was a disappointment. Solid golden thick coloration, but the mouth feel was chalking and the finish left and odd aftertaste, mild hop flavor. Small dragonfruit mid, did not match the tangelo aroma."
Bottles 1/21/14 and consumed on 2/14/14. $6.49 for 500ml. Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass.
"A: The beer is very hazy yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger and a half high off white head that gradually died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface, a collar around the edge of the glass and lots of lacing down the sides."
Bottled on 080613.
"Big, fluffy, snow-white head from a turbulent pour. Fantastic retention. Brew is a bright and pale lemon/straw gold, transparent, and lively. Beautiful lacing."
"A very crisp offering from these guys. A tad lighter than the others I've had- peeper and lunch. Another one is much more approachable and quite frankly is a better beer. Super floral and clean bitter nose. Pungent taste of grapefruit and clementines. Crisp, crisp, crisp. Good, good, good beer."
"notes from the other night...bottle picked up locally, enjoyed from a MBC wine glass."
A: hazy gold body under two fingers of fluffy white head; moderate lacing down the glass
"A big thanks to angrybabboon for sending this one out. Poured out of a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. Bottling date is listed as ""08/06/13,"" so a little old at this point. I still believe this will shine fully, however."
Since when did they go to Freeport?
On tap at Max's (from notes).
A - first pour is a clear and bright lighter shade of orange with a massive mouse like white foam. Tight bubbles linger while i pour the rest of the bottle into the large wine glass. The color changes to a completely cloudy coppery amber. The white foam leaves rings of lacing the wrap around the glass.
Very similar to a beer that I've brewed. I'm guessing there's amarillo in here.
Dang this brewery makes good beer! 
How fitting that Another One would be my 900th review.
Bottled 09/03/13. (same as Weez)

"Bottled August 6, 2013"
"A-Pours a cloudy straw color. Big, doughy head. The head retains mightily. Lots of lacing left from the rising-bread cap."
"Poured from the bottle to a tree house snifter. Smell is nice and earthy. Pours with a nice 2 finger head, great retention and lacing. Taste is very nice, bitter but not overly so. Definitely a more piney IPA instead of the citrusy Lunch. I might even lie this a tad better than Lunch, but that's just personal preference. Not sure if they'll continue to brew this, but definitely seek it out!"
Pours cloudy gold with a big foam head and big chunky lace rings. Decent rim of retention. Structure is wonderful. I nursed this and this held a skim of foam for almost an hour. 
"Cracked open a 16.9 ounce bomber brewed on 8/6/2013 and poured into an aptly sized pint glass. Nice two-finger head that lingered for quite a while. The smell instantly reminded me of Juniper and when I say Juniper I really mean Gin. I haven't noticed anyone else mention it but it was the most peculiar part of the pour. I was amazed at how easy it is to drink, it doesn't have the complexity of Lunch but it's near perfect for what it is. I'd drink it daily if I didn't have to trade a child to get it. Cheers."
"Subtle tropical fruit hop character. Super clean, biscuit malt finish. Not too bitter. Supremely drinkable."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled on 8/06 fresh! Pours a hazy yellow orange, with a 2 inch white head with loads of a lace. Smell is pineapple, passion fruit, mango, tangerine, and some grapefruit. Taste is a little more bitter than the nose, the grapefruit is most assertive, with the other flavors in a supporting role. Body is medium, plenty of life, not really dry, and easy sipping. Really an excellent beer, way more bitter than the nose would have you expect. The nose made me think of the gems in Vermont."

"Another beautiful looking beer by Maine Beer. Hazy golden peach body with thick and creamy white head and amazing lacing. Aroma is oranges and tropical fruits upfront (mangos, bananas, pinneaples), some earth and flowers. Taste is tropical fruits and earthy hops. Very smooth palate. Very good IPA."
16.9oz bottle poured into a Pilsner glass.
"16.9 oz. bottle poured into Allagash. Bottled exactly one month ago, 6/11/13. Purchased from the brewery."
500ml bottle poured into a Maine Beer Co Wine Glass.
Appearance: Slight chill haze on a bright gold. Head is super bright-white and starts off pillowy and massive. Drops to a creamy clumpy wispy cap. Some splotches of lacing. 
"A: Pours a lighter yellow with a full, thick head. Chunks of lacing present on the glass."
"Poured a hazy yellow orange with a decent head that quickly dissipated. The aroma was a lot weaker than its cousin ""Lunch"". Faint hints of citrus and a medium hop floral smell. The taste was not as hoppy as I like, ... disappointing in fact. Slight pine flavor, some citrus, and a weak hop bite. The aftertaste was smooth but uninspiring. I will not be spending another $6.25 for a bottle of this average brew. With so many great beers available for a lot less, Maine Beer Company beers sit on the shelf at our local store for weeks."
"Another One pours a hazy straw yellow with a big, rocky head on top. The foam fades away slowly leaving a thick coating of lace on the glass."

Thanks to BenTenison for the bottle. Bottled 6/11/13. 500ml bottle served in a Bell's tulip.

"Poured from a 500 ml brown bottle into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass. Born on 061113 on side of label. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA)."
"A - Pours a light glowing hazy yellow/straw color. Monstrous 3 finger white head, fantastic retention and perfect lacing. Heaps of mountainous head remain 10 minutes later."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, hazy, caramel-yellow coloring with a tall, frothy, chunky, bright white head of a solid inch and a half. Aromas are abundant, and you can smell this thing right off the initial pour. Wow. Very pungent with resiny hops profiles, with mango and tart citrus highlights balancing. Richly sweet and very well blended. Flavors are roasted initially, with tropical fruit sweetness forming a backbone to support a toasty, slightly char highlight and peppery, bitter hops. Hops are first and foremost in this bad boy, but there is a subtle biscuit profile throughout the brew, as well. Smooth and robust, with a dry edge from the carbonation and hops level. The aftertaste is a bitter sweet blend, with grapefruit and mango providing the sweetness to the roasted, toasted, and bitter hops. The finish is bitter and tangy at the same time, slightly drying, with a citrus linger. Solid IPA."
"Huge thanks to smokeypeat for sending me this one - the guy hooks it up like no other. Another One pours the color of honey and is almost completely opaque, though the haze appears softer than typical for an unfiltered IPA. As the stark white, pillow head slowly settles, it leaves very nice rings of lacing that traverse at least half the glass."
"Pours a hazy dark straw color with a huge fluffy white head that persists forever. Smells of earthy pine and citrus with a faint sweet bready malt to back it up. The flavor is lemony grapefruit with a resinous bite to it. Light bready malt barely peaks out to show any balance. Medium to thin body with a moderate level of carbonation and a resinous watery mouthfeel. There's not much body here and its a hint on the astringent side. I could drink it, but I'd rather reach for a lunch or peeper."
"a clean golden/copper pour with lots of foamy white head creating an ice crream like top to this. lots of lacing from the slowly dissipating head. the smell is of a citrus hop bomb (much like lunch).. lots of pineapple, mango, grapefruit.. some caramel from the grain bill. again, like with lunch, there is a mint-like grassy bitterness (very herbal, maybe warrior hops?) up front.. there's plenty of citrusy flavors that are subtle in the backbone (pineapple, grapefruit rind, mango). the bitterness isn't as harsh as it was in lunch. it's a medium creamy body with moderate carbonation.

Appearance:
Bottled 06/11/2013
In my snifter: Another One IPA from Maine Beer Company. 17 ounce bottle poured into a New Belgium snifter. Seven percent ABV. Bottling date of 6/11/2013. 
Bottled 061113
Poured from the bottle into a Dogfish Head Ale glass.
Poured into a stemmed taster. The color is cantaloupe orange with some haze. There is a nice fluffy white head; lots of sticky lacing.
This is a new IPA that was bottled and released earlier today at the new Freeport brewery. It features the same hops as Weez (which was also released today) but a different malt bill. The beer was chilled when I bought it and has been in my fridge for since I brought it home. I'm serving it in my Maine Beer Co. flute.
"Pours a bright yellow color with a quick, fizzy white head leaving slippery lacing."
"This is a beer that intends to showcase the distinnct aromas of the Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand. Indeed the beer has a nice citrusy and grassy aroma and taste to it, supported by some solid and tasty malts. Medium mouthfeel."
"Pours hazy, orangeish yellow. Thick, foamy, tall white head that Fades slowly to a long lasting rocky head with good lacing."
Pours a super hazy/ cloudy light mango-color. 1 finger of fluffy head with amazing retention and lacing.
"650ml bottle, freshly packaged, purchased at the brewery, poured into a Toppling Goliath teku glass. Enjoyed on 1.20.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a small, white head of foam. It smelled of citrus, pineapple, toasted caramel and hints of resin. Bitter and hoppy bite with a sweet caramel backbone and citrus finish."
This was the best beer at Omaha beer fest. Great hop profile.
"Earthy, spicy, citrusy. Definitely brings something different to the table; they manage to coax out a unique flavor profile from the Nelson hop. Pours an opaque orange-ish hue that's becoming a hallmark of the brewery. Pungent and earthy aroma of tropical fruit, fauna and freshly dig earth. Taste is citrus, nut, pith and spruce. There's a snippy peppery spice to the taste that's unexpected but not unwelcomed. Finishes with a crisp pop and a good amount of bitterness."
"I'm not an IPA guy, but this stuff is great!"
"Refreshing, bright, mild citrus aroma. Very turbid (as is typical for TG) with a dull burnt-orange color (as is also typical for TG). Mouth feel is substantial for the style. Taste starts with the citrus, but transitions to be dominated by bitterness in the middle, and lingering into the aftertaste. Good malt presence to balance the hops, but definitely it is the flavor of the hops and the bittering that is the star of this beer. An enjoyable, if bitter, IPA. Well done."
"Pours a turbid amber with 2+ finger of cream colored head. Never clears, great lacing & head retention"
"Cloudy juice like yellow gold with thick fluffy head and lacing. Well balanced malty bitter citrusy hop smell. Hops are on the forefront of the taste, but it's not a hop bomb. Crisply bitter and tasty. Great beer, better than I hoped."
Pours cloudy with a large head; notes of citrus.
"One of the more overlooked hoppy TG beers, most shoot for the stars and hype up sue and its variants but I'd say this is TG's second best hoppy beer, behind double citra sue. Delicious citrusy hop notes but not overwhelming, does so much for so little ABV."
22 oz bottle was poured into a nonic glass. 
"big thanks to 350z, hugebulge, scott...whatever you call it, very much appreciate the kick down so I can git down. enjoyed from the massive 53oz tb chalice. not sure non he date but definitely tasting fresh. classic ipa drinkability w a iipa taste and feel. toppling kills it in the stout deot, but no slouch in ipa. can't believe only 5.5...so full bodied. wouldn't be so impressed except that 5.5 abv. so.low...but souch balls and flavor. WOW!"
"Taste: big herbal, grapefruit, citrus hops, earthy yeast notes, piney finish. Same for the nose. Golden honey color, unfiltered near end of bomber, large head of ringed lattice of lace. Medium/full body. 80 IBUs"
Was very lucky to have a chance to try this beer....i have a great neighbor who has a colleague whom has family near TG. This beer poured an unfiltered copperish with white head that left a spotty lace. The scent had tangerine like notes. The taste was evenly balanced and very easy to drink. It reminded me of the Tazmanian IPA from Schlafy. The Mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it's an excellent beer!
Bomber bottle poured into a snifter.
Opaque yellow-orange with a large fluffy white head leaving tons of spongey lace and a permanent fluffy blanket.
Received from @Josholson666 in NBS BIF #4 – Thanks man!
Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter... Twice.
Pours a cloudy orange tinged color with a nice two finger white head that dissipated leaving some lacing and a thin film on top of the beer. 
Bomber dated 5/17/2016 poured into snifter on 5/29/2016
04/08/2016
Poured a hazy orange with a thick white head. Looks a lot like a Belgian wheat beer. The aroma is strong dank and apricot. Taste is grapefruit and orange peel at first followed by a mellow bitterness. Perfect carbonation with a medium texture. Overall this is a very solid IPA. Quite different from a Citra citrus bomb but very good.
"This beer pours a super cloudy cloudy dark golden orange. Reminds me of dark white grapefruit juice or light apple cider. The head is big fluffy and white. Excellent retention and lots of spotted lacing. Smell is very complex. Grape and candied orange are most noticeable, with a slight hint of lemon and pine as well. Taste is similar with not much bitterness. Feel is light side of medium, smooth and almost creamy. Overall an awesome beer. Nelson hops continue to amaze and mystify me."
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 22 oz bomber on January 13, 2016. Tasted again from a 22 oz bomber on January 8, 2017. Look is hazy orange with a thick white head and lingering lacing. Smell is bitter citrus, orange blossom, fresh cut pine and earthy scents. Taste is grapefruit, mandarin, pine and bread malt flavors. Feel is full in body and while initially bitter, the finish is smooth."
"Poured very hazy orange with 2 finger white head that had good retention and lacing. Scent was grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Very juicy mouthful with nice carbonation, flavor is very grapefruit with lingering pine and malt to balance."
"How can something this low in ABV taste so flavorful. The Nelson hops seem nicely featured. Slightly earthy taste and a nice light bitter finish. Could drink this all day, especially in the summer."
Grabbed this on my last trip thru Iowa.
Poured from 16oz Bomber
"Had at the source, received in a pint glass."
Drank from a 22 fl oz bottle acquired in a trade with Oldskool47
"Wonderful stuff. Look, smell and taste were spot on!"
Bottled on 10/30/15.
Bottled 10/30/15 so relatively fresh.
"Bomber dated 10/30/15 making it 3 weeks old, poured into a tulip glass. Looks pretty gorgeous, a deep golden orange with a 2-finger white head that drops down to about a half-inch and never quits. Nice lacing. Hazy but it's bottle conditioned, so I probably stirred up some yeast on the pour. "
"appearance: cloudy orange decent head that leaves decent lacing. Smell: tons of tropical fruit and hops, typical smell of TG IPA's. Taste: not as much as you get on the smell but still great, fruits, hops, light and easy to drink. Great! wish i had more."
Interesting ipa not typical to my liking but a good beer.
22oz bomber poured into a tulip glass. Looks a hazy yellow with a one finger head. Very hoppy smell upfront that has some very citrusy undertones. Taste is all hops upfront and then mellows out. Absolutely amazing beer!
"No bottle on date and pretty hazy... too bad, because there is some really good flavors/smells coming out around the slight off flavors. Will update score if I'm able to get a fresh bottle. Prost!"
from a month-old bomber into a Spieglau IPA
"Smell is heavily of tropical fruit - passionfruit and pineapple, along with orange. Taste mirrors the smell - strong passionfruit flavor up front, orange juice, a hint of pineapple, and just a slightly bitter finish. An absolutely delicious and refreshing beer!"
9-10
"A little disappointed in this one. Shared by a good friend 22 oz bomber. Also consumed directly after sip of sunshine, so may be an unfair rating. "
22oz Bottle.
"L (4) - Nice orange color. A little cloudy. Not surprising, but a little too much. Also very little head and no retention. Disappeared quickly after pouring"
Burnt tire taste
"So this is probably purely coincidence, but last night I tried Three Floyds Gumballhead, and if you gave me one, then the other right after each other, I don't think I could tell the difference. That's not a bad thing, they're both amazing. So, if it's for bragging rights, whichever one came out first wins. Maybe I'm nuts, or just don't have the ""beer tasting"" taste buds yet, but this is my opinion. Great beer nonetheless."
Bottled 7/31/2015
Juicy. Mango/tropical. A touch of spice in the finish. The kind of beer you don't want to drink because you want to keep sniffing it. Cloudy. Bit of heft in the body. Really good.
Edit after having again. Was 4.1
"Poured cold into a glass at Beth’s place; bottled on 5/28 I think it says, so pretty fresh."
"A very hazy, deep golden orange color. Medium level of citrus, tropical, and pine aroma. The flavor is very similar with a little additional spiciness. The spiciness increases and a little dankness appears in the flavor as it warms. Finishes clean and starts very easy to drink but becomes a little less smooth towards the end."
"I just don't think I can get behind Nelson beers. I thought I liked alpines, and while they are well made beers, the hops just aren't top notch. This looked like heady. Ugly as sin."
"Pours an absolutely gorgeous pale, cloudy orange color with a small cream colored head. Dissipates quickly, leaving a white ring of lacing around the edges and a very small amount around the sides. Has to be the most one of the most beautiful colors I've seen in a beer; reminiscent of landscapes of Monument Valley."
L: beautiful hazy bright orange. 
Pretty much follows the brewery's description. Appearance is good. Body is spot on. Super drinkable.
"Steasy66, cheers bud."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a creamy white head. Leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Smell is on the sweeter side but then you get that Nelson coming through. Orange, grapefruit, grapes, dank, grass, hay. Taste follows the nose pretty well. Quite sweet for a <6% beer, and very full bodied. Very different from what we're used to on the West Coast where everything is crisp, clear, and dry. Mouthfeel, like I said, is pretty full bodied. Carbonation is a bit low. Overall, a very good IPA. It's a bit different than the ones I'm used to though. Instead of relying almost solely on the aroma and flavor from the hops you get a lot of fruity sweetness from the yeast as well. This isn't exactly what I would call a ""showcase"" of the hop, since there's a lot more in there contributing to the flavor."
L: Pours hazy gold under a 1” white foam collar that leaves very fine lace. 
"Pours a hazy darker orange gold with off-white head. Citrus, light fruits, a little pine, and some grass on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with floral and citrus notes."
"Fairly aggressive pour into shaker (all I had access to at the time) yielded less than 1/2 finger of just a bit off-white creamy, chunky head. Pours a cloudy golden orange color. Really quite opaque. "
Poured from the bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
2015-05-30
"Appearance: Cloudy orange, good head."
Citrus and sweet tropical fruits on the nose and on the tougue. Nice smooth full feel. Another good one from TG.
"Very tasty. First TG beer for me, looking forward to trying others!"
L - cloudy deep orange with good head and lacing
"Somehow never had this one, shared with rudzud and thanks to irish-hawkeye (Reddit) for this one."
Thanks to JLindros for sharing.
Not sure when this beer was bottled but it did not hold up well. Solid but nothing spectacular.
"Lots of fruit aroma and taste, this beer is delicious!!!"
Look: Poured a hazy orange color with a finger of white head. Leaves behind excellent lacing on the glass.
These dudes are beer magicians.
Had on tap at TG during Beer Safari trip.
"The MoZee, same label as the regular ZeeLander. Preferred it to the regular release."
"Big fruity aroma. I pick out orange, pineapple, apricot, grapefruit, and pepper. I expected more fruit forward flavor, but all that fruit is joined by a spicy, bitter flavor in the middle of the mouth and in the finish. Lots of carbonation combined with the bitterness gives this one a real kick. Its very complex, but maybe a little too much for me. I like the strong bitter aspect, but wish there was a little more room for the fruit to come through in the flavor."
Pours golden with a thin lasting head. Lacing sticks.
"Very malt heavy IPA. Good flavor, nice full body, citrus and earthy."
Appearance - The beer was golden in color with a bubbly white head crowning the glass. 
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with an inch of white head. Smells of pineapple, citrus and a bit a pine. Tastes of pineapple, lemon, oranges and resin. The bitterness is there, but it's fairly mild. Medium mouth that's a tad sticky. They have developed some unique and decent flavors for an IPA that's' practically sessionable."
Beer poured out as a yellowish gold color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer blasts you with hops. The taste of the beer has a lot of hoppy goodness as well! The feel is pretty drinkable. Overall a great beer!
"Pours a hazy pale orange, with a one finger white head from an aggressive pour. has a floral aroma with oranges, citrus zest, melon, and some onion. "
"Hazy yellow/orange. Smells of spicy peppers habenaro hops. Grassy , earthy , very flavorful but not overly robust. My first run in with just Nelson Sauvin it kept growing on me after each sip"
"A - Opaque ruddy orange color. Creamy beige head, small bubbles, excellent retention. Small bits of lacing stick to the glass."
The smell and taste of this IPA just are not your classic fresh IPA taste and smell
Sculpin on steroids in a good way
Pours a cloudy straw orange with a nice white head.
One of my favorite from the Hop Patrol Series.
"This brew was served on tap at Toppling Goliath Brewing Company in Decorah, Iowa. It showed a pale but darkened straw coloring through the tasting glass, and held a strong two to three finger head of cream colored bubbles. Classically stitched laced and patterned lacing was left around our glasses. A chill haze cut clarity, but no sediment was noted. Carbonation appeared to be mildly active. The aroma smells like a freshly cut and drippingly sappy Douglas fir. Otherwise, nosable notes include intensely herbal and piney hops, marijuana freshness, wet oregano, pencil pseudowoodiness, toasty rye, amber, and pale grain, peach and strawberry fruitiness, Triscuit crackers, orange zest and watered juiciness, pickled ginger, iron and sand, paper mache, boiled oats, table salt, and raw popcorn kernels. The flavoring perfectly showcased those piney, herbal, and earthen Nelson Sauvin hops, bubblegum esters, both toasty and raw pale and amber malts, fresh honeycomb sweetness, buttered popcorn diacetyls, resinous grassy saps, cold bamboo shoots, dill weed and dandelion, bittered mineral and slate, moist cereal grain, garlic airs, copper, well-water richness, distant and washed cherry skin sweetness, clay, and dried autumn leafiness. The body was medium, and the carbonation was moderate. Each sip gave fantastic slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop to the finished body, with wetted pucker felt around the mouth. The abv was appropriate, and the beer drank back very quickly."
"22 oz. bomber a little over a month old (so probably considered expired by BA standards). Pours into my glass a hazy golden-orange colored body with a rocky nearly-white head. Excellent retention and like most TG IPAs/APAs, wonderful chunks of lacing everywhere."
From a fresh growler into a pint glass. Nice Head with great hopp smell. Great with cheese and meat tray.
"ZeeLander - Toppling Goliath Brewing Company - Decorah, Iowa - IPA - 5.80% ABV - This tasteful IPA poured a hazy, light orange color with a stiff-white head that leaves excellent lacing on the glass. The nose featured aromas of papaya, ripe pineapple, citrus, resinous pine, and bready malts that leave a lasting impression on anyone that enjoys this brew. The mouth was great; hop forward flavors of juicy pineapple, fresh mango, grapefruit peel, pine, and zesty malts burst in your mouth with each sip. The mouthfeel was medium, with a tasteful finish that coats the palate nicely. Once again, TGB did a wonderful job on another great brew. Thank you, @billylightning, you know how much I love this beer! 97/100"
"Pours hazy gold-orange with a nice one-finger frothy head. Massive citrus - lemon combination in the nose, so fresh! Taste is of dank, citrus bomb - grapefruit, oranges, pineapple. Very hop forwardly sweet the malt presence is neither noted nor important. Medium bodied and sticky. Finishes bittersweet, in excellent balance between the two. Excellent IPA for it's low abv!"
Fantastic Nelson showcase. Nose is all tangerine. Citrus dominates at the beginning followed by a dose of white pepper. These guys do no wrong.
"Beautiful noonday sun in the glass. This one is dank: Potting soil, sticky bud, pine and rosemary herb notes. Overall a really nice beer, but doesn't quite reach the level of some of TG's other amazing hoppy beers."
Excellent body coupled with bittersweet citrus. I was very impressed with how refreshing this IPA tasted.
Pours cloudy orange
Poured into a teku. Slightly cloudy. Great fruity aroma. Great taste!!
This bottle hit shelves less than two weeks ago. 
Really cool hop profile. I could we falling in love with these if done well. I have to assume they aren't gong to get much better for 6.99 a bomber
I'm not very failure with Nelson Savina hop variety but it's definitely worth trying if you want to know what this hop is all about. The aroma and taste are unique. Can't say I'm a big fan of the hop but I think this beer was put together very well.
This was really good. smells hoppier than it is!
"16 oz. pint poured at the brewery, unknown bottling/packaging date (but allegedly retired according to the listing), drank over 15 minutes"
"22 fl oz brown glass bottle with unbranded pry-off pressure cap and attractive label art acquired in a trade with the very generous Duff27 and served cold into a snifter in me gaff in low altitude Austin, TX. Reviewed live. Expectations are high given this brewery's reputation."
"Pours an orange-golden straw. Brilliant color, but hazy. Lacing and legs are tremendous on this beer. The nose of this beer is complex. It's get some fruit, some hops, but the single note that steps up an takes over is an earthy, dank truffle. Kind of off-putting at first, but just like truffles keeps getting tastier. Taste - hoppy bitter, earthy, hoppy bitter, earthy truffle. For a beer, I'm glad the earthiness was more balanced or at least tamer than the nose. I'm super-glad I rated this beer over time as my palate adjusted. I am really impressed with the depth of flavor this beer gets off a single hops. Granted it's singular, but impressive. I dug it"
"Bottle as an amazing trade extra. Pours hazy yellow golden with a big fluffy creamy white head. Incredible aroma of pineapple, mango, pine, and hay. Just perfect aroma. Flavor follows with big juicy pineapple and tropical fruits, medium bitter, juicy. Wow. Medium light bodied and incredible flavor for 5.5%. These guys just need to replace every other brewery on the planet so I can drink it all the time. This hit the spot."
"Appearance: Has the Toppling Goliath APA/IPA look - clear amber, bubble show, nice retention/lacing"
22oz Bottle 
Appearance: a golden orange color. forms a finger or so of a white head with decent retention and leaves some strong legs along the side of the glass. Fairly hazy and almost opaque but lets quite a bit of light through.
"Phenomenal IPA. Full bodied, but incredibly drinkable. The Neslon Sauvin hop has a wonderfully delicate presence of passion fruits and citrus. The finish is very nice. It is not as juicy as a Pseudo finish, but rather subtle dance of citrus and dryness. The nose almost hints a Pseudo/citra hop. A really nice beer. And, super fresh might I add."
From notes on 2/8/14
Reviewed from notes. Twenty-two ounce bottle shared by Richard - thanks.
"Nose is dank grapefruit and somewhat floral. Taste follows, but more intense. Like going into a dank basement then discovering a second, danker basement under your feet through the finish. When the bottle is a couple months or older, it tastes more onion, which is still interesting, but different. Best fresh. Probably my favorite TG IPA!"
Appearance: Hazy orange. Sediment abounds in this beer. It almost passes for orange juice but does have a brown hue that is keeps it from looking world class. Nice white head dissipates quickly.
22oz bottle from IAmJacksHopTongue (thanks man!). No bottling info. Served in a Burnt Hickory snifter.
"Appearance - murky orange yellow color. thin head, but fun lacing. "
A big thanks to Jeff who knows I can't get enough TG for this one. Bomber into Tired Hands stemware. 
A-golden amber color with a nice white head and good lacing
A: Really thick and bubbly creamy two finger head. Thick orange and copper color that has a thick haze. 
A. Hazy golden amber in color. Stiff pour yielded a 2 finger head. Nice Lacing and head retention. Beautiful 
"Awesome bomber from laymansbeerfan (thanks!), into my Hill Farmstead tulip."
A - Super hazy light orange color on the body with a stiff head. Lacing is bountiful.
This is a beer rated high on appearance and mouthfeel for me. 
This is a tasty beer. A worthy comparison to Nelson from alpine. 
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a Surly Darkness chalice.
"Light hoppy flavor w citrus, refreshing. Makes me want to drink the whole bomber when I know I shouldn't."
"A - Gorgeous golden amber, and clear which is different from the other TG beers if I remember right. Nice 1 finger head with good retention. Keeps bubbling for a far bit once poured."
just bottled days ago
Zeelander doesn't quite measure up to PseduoSue; Topping Goliath's world-class pale ale but I did realize tonight that this brew is pretty damn good when compared to most other beers in this category.
"Slightly hazy, orange yellow. Maybe a bit over-carbed. But, honestly, most of TG’s ipa’s and pales look the same to me."
Appearance:
"Bomber of Zeelander, booty from a pillage-and-loot raid over the border. Maybe next time I'll bring back a quarterback. 22 oz. bomber split with my wife. "
22oz bomber poured into tulip.

Golden color and short head retention. Good looking and clear
"22oz bottle, freshly delivered to Madison today. Poured into a Toppling Goliath snifter today, 1/29/2014. "
"a huge thanks to to of my closest friends for literally driving denver to toppling goliath to pick this up, along with a couple of other gems. this pours a thicker hazy matte finish goldenrod color, with a lazy but frothy white head that sits around three quarters of an inch tall. the nose, oh my goodness the nose. this beers best feature, and one of the best aromas of any ipa ever brewed. its all nelson hops, which are so tropical and dynamic. i get orange and lemon zest, i get sweet melon, and i get hardly any bitterness. the malt is almost an afterthought here, with such a beautiful fresh fruity aroma, this rivals vermont ipa. the flavor is like the nose, just a little less pungent. i get all the same fruity notes, and this does an excellent job of getting that great aroma into taste, but its not quite as bright. some bitterness creeps in around the middle, reminding me that this is in fact an ipa. light body and light alcohol are enjoyable in a beer with such unique flavor, sessionable forever this one is. splendid use of the nelson hops, like nothing else out there. this is a total winner."
"on-tap, Alchemy in Madison"
"Hazy orange in color with bright white head. Amazing, complex Nelson nose, with grapefruit, mango, passion fruit, and a dank earthiness. Taste pretty much matches the nose. Very minimal bitterness. Just an awesome, juicy, easy drinking Nelson showcase."
First tasted on-tap at the brewery. Rating based on growler enjoyed now.
"Draft serving in a footed tulip glass, review from written notes. "
"Growler filled two days ago at Casanova Liquors in Hudson, Wisconsin. Tasted 26 July 2013, reviewed from notes."
"Pours a light golden, finger of white head, nice lacing"
Served from a growler the initial pour yields two fingers of soapy white head. The retention is quite impressive. Some lacing is left. Light golden straw color that I find very inviting in IPAs.
"Growler pour, thanks Mike for the supply."
Growler from Casonova in Hudson. drinking 32 hours after the pour and carbonation is strong...perfect actually and if I were to complain I would say slightly too much head on the pour...
Growler courtesy of Chris (steepH20)...thanks kindly!
Growler shared by Todd. Served in a Russian River tulip.
Appearance: translucent pale yellow almost orange bodied beer with 2 full fingers of white head.
growler poured into a duvel glass
A: very cloudy yellow. Pastel yellow. Forms a a moderately large foamy white head. Very minimal lacing. 
On tap into pint glass.
Poured from growler into Tulip glass. 
Poured from a growler into a tasting glass.
Poured a light and murky yellow with a decent off white head.
Had on draft at Red's Alehouse. I did not take notes on this beer so forgive me for the less-than-descriptive review. But I feel I have to rate it because I liked it so much.
"Very intersting IPA. One of the most interesting ipas I've had in a long time . The appearance is very cloudy orangish/yellowish. The smell of pine hit my nose before the beer hit the bar. Like being in a fermenting pine forest with some flowery hints and a touch of pepper. And the taste! the taste is just like the smell. Lots of peppery pine notes with a touch of grapefruit. Good lacing. Got everything. Not a 5, but pretty damn close."
"This was had on tap at Sanctuary, brought to the table in a pint glass."
Poured from a growler into a Sam Adams pint.
"A - Very cloudy/hazed straw gold color. Good sized, soft, fluffy, light white head. Good retention leaving a decent lace."
"Picked-up up a four-pack of cans at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for $20. Have had a few brews from these guys before. Good brew, but very dank, w/ pine/grass, would not buy again at this price point."
Canned 4 weeks ago.
"L: opaque, matte honey lemon "
Canned 23 days ago.
"On tap at the brewery. Hazy orange. Smells of tangerine and some pale malt. Tastes of orange and then bitter pith. Aggressive bitter pith that kinda ruins it. I'm all about bitterness, but this tastes funny. Medium body. Not Trillium's best."
can received in trade
Consumed 4/3/18
"The Juice Bomb executed at pretty much the highest level imaginable. Pale, completely opaque yellow-orange color. Tons of fluffy foam that, for the most part, sticks around. Super intense aromas and flavors of orange, lemon, cantaloupe, fresh mint, and a touch of vanilla. Medium-bodied and creamy while still extremely refreshing and light on the palate. Clean, delicately dry finish. [16 oz. can dated 3/14/18 into Becher glass]"
Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.
Pours a matte orange color. Completely opaque and hazy. Bubbly white head dissipates steadily leaving a thick ring of sudsy foam along the outside of the beer. No lacing. 
16oz can dated 11/14/17.
"Canned 11/14. Bright orange/yellow, mostly hazy. The slightly above modest head faded pretty quickly but there is nice and thin layer of foam across the surface and ring around the glass, sparse spotty lacing. What a nose on this one! Bursting with citrus, pine and bubblegum, got some passion fruit and guava notes to it as well. Taste is similar to the nose with a slightly less citrus presence. There is a little astringency on the finish but nothing intolerable, decent carbonation. Hard to argue with this one. Very impressed with the smell/flavor."
"A- Tallboy pours into a pint glass with a very hazy, floury yellow-golden body and a thick creamy white cap. The frothy head rises to two fingers with good retention leaving thick sheets of lace after each sip."
Look- Very thick. Hazy with the hue of pineapple juice
"A: Pours thick orange/yellow with a rich white 1"" head and very sticky lacing. "
Fresh can poured into a snifter.
"Can shared by Matthew. Thank you, sir!"
"Pours a creamy white-orange with a short one finger head. Tight tiny lacing on the head. Smells is dank, a little boozy, strong of citrus, fruit snack candies, white grape, slightly earthy. Taste is sharply bitter then quickly fading into juicy, grape-y again, with a dry, bitter and lasting finish. Fits right in with the other DDH ____ Street line."
"Pours a hazy golden, not murky, but no attractive. Tangerine aroma. Some white wine. Lychee. The nose carries through to the nose. It's like a juicy clementine, but it has a nice jello-like character that I find lacking in a lot of Trillium's Streets. This is my taste of Farnsworth and my god, it's delicious. Everything good about Trillium's hoppy beers."
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (2 weeks old). Appearance is yellow/orange in color and opaque with two finger thick head (decent retention). Smell is tons of tropical hops with notes of tangerine, pineapple, peach, melon, mango, and honey."
16 oz. canned on 11/14/17
Tasty stuff
This one pours a very hazy orange- looks like orange cream. There's a small head and lots of lacing.
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is tangerine, starfruit, cracker and guava. Medium-heavy bodied, moderate carbonation and bitter. Makes for a really good bitter ipa. Regular Farnsworth is one of my favorites of the streets series. While I prefer regular Farnsworth Street, this one is solid. Would get this again."
"From a tall boy into a willibecher, dense hazy pulpy orange juice, a little head that subsides quickly. Best part is the nose: lots of passion fruit and fleshy guava...fruity and juicy and a bit chalky...not at all sweet. Taste is good but not quite like the nose...rich and full flavors but a bit one-note and not layered. I think at the end of the day, i’ve just got limited love for Vic’s Secret...the finish is far from ideal for me, it both dries out and has a kind of medicinal herbal note that is half great and half overdone. The finish knocks the overall score down for me."
Swung up to canton today w the fellas. This is canned 3 days ago. Always been a fan of the street series and had heard great things about this beer. Did not disappoint! Juice bomb but bright tropical fruit side of the spectrum. Huge melon and noticeable creamsicle. Solid brew from one of the kings of the NE juice bomb. A new favorite for sure!
16oz can poured into a pint glass shows an orange juice colored body and briefly floats a fluffy 1/4in yellowish foam that disippates to an edge hugging ring with a whispy island.
Can. Hazy sunset golden orange. White head with lace. This is first brewing project beer that I haven’t really enjoyed. It’s good beer but not up to BP standards for me. 
Very hazy orange juice colored beer with a off white/very light orange color. 
L_Hazy glowing tan/yellow
"Look: Full on Haze, deep murky golden brown. One and half fingers off fluffy white head. This looks the part. "
"If you like murky IPA, then this one fits the bill. OJ in a glass; full on haze; myriad lacing. The nose is insane with citrus aromatics, belied by underlying hints of mango, peach, and orange sherbet. Taste follows but isn't as pronounced as the smell, which isn't a bad thing, it's just not quite as impactful as the nose. Is it delicious? F*ck, yes! Citra hops are on point in this one. The finish is nice and creamy; my only gripe would be that it's not as chewy as I would prefer. All that said, this is an incredible beer worth seeking. I almost feel compelled to give the smell a 5.0, but I'll go with my initial reaction. Thanks, Micah!!!"
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pint can on February 3, 2018. Look is hazy orange gold thick white head and sticky lacing. Smell and taste is juicy citrus fruit and a hint of sweet malt. Feel is creamy and smooth."
This is a Citra bomb. Huge orange peach nose with orange rind and light dankness. Would be perfect but rind taste stays a tad longer. Don't get me wrong this is killer.
Pours a very hazy golden yellow color with an eggshell white head. Smell is citra all the way very tropical and fruity. Taste follows nose loads of citrus mixed with fruity tropical hops. Soft mouth feel with medium carbonation very little bitterness in the finish. A great NEIPA that showcases Citra.
"16oz can, served in a willi becher glass. Pours a hazy, nicely cloudy copper and orange body, one finger thick fluffy white head, good retention, lots of lacing. Smell is juicy citrus, caramel, grapefruit, pineapple, touch of grain. Really nice, juicy aroma that befits the style. Flavour is a moderate juicy grapefruit and citrus, orange peel, light caramel, mild-moderate grainy sweetness on the backend, mildly bitter. Good juice quotient, and good balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, working nicely in terms of the light bitterness and the hop aromatics. A very good execution of the NE IPA, and I think this is probably the best IPA to come through the state in years."
"Poured 16oz can into Snifter. Very turbid and dirty orange color that looks like OJ with a 2 finger white head. Thick webs of lacing all over the glass. Smell is big on fresh, juicy citrus notes like grapefruit and blood orange. It almost seems like fresh squeezed juice was added to it. The hop flavor hits hard and is packed with fresh grapefruit and blood orange. There is probably malt in here, but it is straight juice flavor. Nice mouthfeel with excellent carbonation. Very sticky and juicy with a light dry finish. This is the #1 NE IPA brewed in WI. Very few know about it, but that will change soon."
"Appearance: light yellow, totally hazy-opaque, like a hybrid between yeast slurry and lupulin. The head is an off-white 1/8 finger of fine bubbles."
"16 oz can, canned on 3/22/18. Pours very murky light yellow with a small creamy white head that quickly goes to a thin film that laces the glass."
A growler purchased at the brewery on 09/23/17 poured in a Storm Peak 'Dogfish Head style' IPA glass. 
Excellent east coast IPA. Love the cans
"Great color and awesome citrusy nose. A very smooth and refreshing drinker for any time of year. DDH all citra makes for great tropical and citrusy flavor, crazy hazy with a clean easy finish!"
This is the best NEIPA in the state. I've tried as many as I can get my hands on and I believe this is the only one that can compete nationally. I hope we can get this easier in the future.
"this is a wonderful ipa, my first from these guys, and really well ahead of expectations. someone told me their brewery used to brew at other half, which, if true, makes sense for this ipa, which is decidedly east coast in nature, super juicy, and absolutely delicious, as good as many i have had from the more popular regions for the style. soft hazy yellow but bright still, with this amazing hop nose thats juicy and tropical at the same time, pineapple and white grape come to mind, likely some southern hemisphere varietals at work, but maybe also some mosaic, which i taste more than i smell. the grain base is cool, very light but also interesting as they go, some wheat i would suspect, pils malt too, maybe even some oats, as this is sort of round and smooth on the finish, fluffy feeling, and pleasingly dry. nice carbonation and just a little bitterness to let me know its still an ipa, despite the dry hop aspect dominating more conventional hop layers. really excited about how good this is, for a along time colorado was lacking in great ipa. the hoppy beer scene has improved drastically with some of these new guys pushing out some great stuff, and i will be stoked if we see more from outer range that taste anywhere near this good. one of the best first impressions from a brewery i can ever recall, this beer is awesome!"
absolutely perfect hazy ny style ipa. one of the best beers i've ever had.
"On tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY."
"LUV the Soup series and Galaxy doesn't disappoint, great NE IPA look, nice smell w citrus notes and great taste and feel."
Undated tall can
"Pours a hazy golden color with a one inch, fluffy white head that left a little lacing. Smells of citrus and tropical fruits. Tastes of pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon, tangerine, pine and a hint of pepper. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, mild bitterness, smooth mouth feel with just a minimal amount of dryness."
Incredible single hop (galaxy) NE haze IPA! They absolutely nailed this one!
Smells like nug after a few weeks!
"Medium-pale gold body, hazed to opacity, with a white head a couple of fingers high that left lace lines behind... Impressions of grapefruit, white wine grapes, and pale melon on the nose and tongue... Bright and light, but rounded with an earthier edge to keep it grounded... Mildly sweet, mildly bitter, creamy smooth, and easy-drinking... 10/1/17 release..."
"Had on tap at the brewery last weekend, but this review is from a can: pours cloudy yellow gold color with a 1-2 finger thick white head that's full of tiny bubbles, fading very slowly and leaving excellent foamy spider web lacing and rings as it went down. The lacing really sticks to the glass and is another masterpiece looking NE style IPA by Sand City, who have these looks nailed down."
"Pours golden and hazy. Nice one finger white head. Aroma of pineapple and mango. Taste follows the nose with light grapefruit juice, dank and an orange peel finish. Great addition to the family. My favorite of the three. Sand city does no wrong."
"The original Soup Citra grew on me. Just a real solid brew. So I was pretty psyched to see a galaxy variant on the scene. And it doesn’t disappoint. Great juicy dank nose, and smooth mouthfeel. Lots of pineapple and mango with a solid pronounced malt backbone to round it all out. Not much bitterness, finishes all juice w a bit dank peppery galaxy note. Loving it. Nice job."
"can from this mornings suoer chill release. this one tastes a little green vs the others and the can seems a little more peppy than the draft pour in the carb dept, but still a killer. I'm not a huge galaxy fan so this is my least favorite of the 3 but it's really just which hop you prefer since each beer is well executed and shines the hop in it's tastiest way. friends at the tasting room were digging this the best so to eacheck tiger own."
Had this beer on draft at the Brew Cafe.
This is a very nice and hoppy IPA with just about enough fruitiness to make it complex and refreshing. Smooth mouthfeel and a nice and long bitterness.
"Enjoyed at the 2016 Copenhagen Beer Festival in Boston, MA. Reviewed from notes."
Poured from tap at the Brew Cafe into a pint glass.
"SUPER cloudy and golden/straw color, peachy whit head. Smell is mango and maybe a hint of pineapple, definitely ripe fruit. Sharp bubble up front followed by a smooth, creamy, luxurious texture. Taste is mango and juicy, a little bubblegum on the back, some rind bitterness. The bitterness gets sharper as you work your way through, it started out tasting better than it does at the end."
"L - oh man, all I did was crack the can it it looks like liquid mangos. Can't wait to pour... wtf this is the yellowist I've ever seen beer! It looks like straight puréed mangos! Incredible! An absolute brick of solid milky hazy yellow. Sticky lacing dissipates quickly but desperately grabs at the sides of the glass. "
Pours a very cloudy yellow. Grapefruit Mango juice. Minimal head and lacing. 
"16oz can poured into a teku glass. Pours a smoothie-like yellow-orange. Nose is strongly mango, with a faint underripe mango, almost chemical, background on the nose. The palate is at first, somewhat Julius-like: lots of tropical fruit (predominantly mango) resting in a smoothie-like mouthfeel. The backend of the palate (for this batch particularly) has been causing controversy, with this release having been dubbed ""MagoTagoGate"". There's a strong, chemical burn, like a way-underripe mango on steroids. This Campden-tablet like flavor mars what would otherwise be an extraordinary beer. So much so, in fact, that Tired Hands offered a refund on this batch (the cost of the can + 50c). Given that, and given that Paperhouse - the release of MagoTago aimed at correcting this - was a homerun, I don't feel I can adequately review this beer based on having tried an off iteration. As such, I will be reviewing this similarly to Paperhouse, to be more consistent with the flavor that has represented the majority of this beer's existence."
Poured 16 oz can into snifter. Looks like a glass of pulp-less OJ with a 1.5 white head. Thin collar and small beads of lacing. Aroma is very mango with some grapefruit and citrus notes. The flavor is good mango and some grapefruit. It kinds loses me on the finish with very green bitter hops and pine sap (classic Simco). Feel is medium with good carbonation and a dry finish. A true hop head that enjoys mango should love this beer. I would have enjoyed it even more if it was sweeter and less bitter.
"Aside from a slight burn at the end of the sip, this is an exceptional brew."
"From a 16oz can purchased at today's release at Fermentaria. Pours a dense, opaque yellow and looks, well, like a glass of mango juice. Delightful fruit-driven nose, but a very bitter finish which detracts from an otherwise pleasant brew. Perhaps too high an ABV for this style? Under-ripe mangoes used? Too hyper-fresh in terms of hops? Maybe this will mellow with some age. Possibly also just a poor batch."
"Vegetal fruitiness, pungent hop bitterness. Clean, long finish. Dry, earthy, not much sweetness. This is good, but I'm looking for a touch more sweetness."
"Poured from a growler, chilled well and opened less than 3 hours from being tapped into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
On tap @ Monks Café in Philly
Review from notes with help from a growler of Mosiac Mago Tago.
wow super duper awesome ipa. juicy. fruity. mango and citric hops. yum!
"Medium straw-colored body with a slight bit of haze, but mostly transparent. Bone white head that settles quickly and leaves a thin ring of bubbles. Aroma is tropical fruit, unripe mangoes, citrus, fresh grass. Mango comes through very nicely in the flavor. Big juicy mango and tropical fruit, citrus in the middle and finished with some citrus and danky hop flavor. Feel is medium carbonation, very juicy, sticky lingering juiciness on the tongue. A really solid fruited IPA. I was expecting a little more ""in your face"" mango, but this one has get flavor and a really great hop profile."
"Batch 2, which I understand has more mosaic hops than Simcoe. Poured from a 750 swingtop into a Tired Hands taster. "
"Fresh mango - like biting into a barely ripe mango- some fresh grass, hint of pink peppercorn."
"Arugably top 5 DIPAs ever. Bursting with juicy mango and intense hops that leave you begging for me of this perfectly composed beer. Absolutely perfect, super hazy and dripping with fruit."
Pours a beautiful light Orange juice color with Mild carbonation. Nose of fresh mangos. Very easy to drink. I wouldn't change a thing about this brew! Lots of mangos!
"Nice mango flavor, balances well with the hop profile. Mild hop bitterness, light malt sweetness combines well with the mango. Solid IPA"
This beer is radical.
"this beer is unreal. incredibly fresh, highly drinkable. I could drink it all day. Get this when it is on tap, you will not regret."
"Sooooo juicy, tons of hops and balanced mango"
32 oz. growler poured into a snifter.
32oz growler poured into a Tired Hands teku glass. 
Served on-tap at the pub.
A: Pours a cloudy yellow orange. Loose bubbled bright white head. Lingers. No real lacing.
Awesome growler want hit by Al....man thank you so much! Growler opened within minutes of landing on my porch.
I had this on tap at the brewpub served in an 8 oz stemmed glass chilled. 
2-liter growler into a matching Tired hands oversized wine glass. Cheers and thanks go to Eagles22 for sharing this one with me. The brew pours a clouded golden yellow color with a frothy white head. Some sudsy lace clings to the glass. 
"Tired Hands Brewing Company is a small microbrew pub just outside of Philadelphia that was just rated as the #2 new brewery in the world by RateBeer.com. I had to check it out and give their lineup a try to see if it lived up to the hype. I was not disappointed! They don’t bottle and have little, if any distribution, so good luck getting your hands on some of this unless you get out to the pub. The beers were all well above average and the food, atmosphere and workers were great too. Check out their website, and I encourage a visit anytime you get out towards Philly."
"Decide this was a must half after MJMaden's Instagram.. Luckily a generous BA coincidentally recently banned for saying ""mead"" had an extra growler available since it had kicked at the pub. Thanks Matt!"
"Pale, pastel, yellow. Incredibly cloudy to the point of being opaque. Forms a modest fizzy white head. Light lacing. Smell is pleasant: lots of biscuit malt and lots of ""dry"" citrus hops with mango to a lesser extent. Also citrus, mango, and tropical fruit, but very light, crisp, and almost lemony. Taste is very crisp and dry. Citrus, grapefruit, grapefruit zest. Very light on body. Very dry. "
"From 03/24/13 notes. Had a 16 oz. pour of this at the brewpub in Ardmore, PA and liked it so much I got a growler of it as well."
"Pours a beautiful cloudy apricot yellow, solid frothy white head."
This amazing beer and phishphorce inspired me to write my own review. 
This one is good enough that I had to write a review.
"Poured out as a cloudy yellowish orange color with a thin white head on top. Good sticky lacing but not much retention. The smell of the beer is hoppy, subtle sweetness and citrusy. The taste is sweet and fruity with a pungent bitterness I the finish. The wheat softens the mouthfeel of this beer while the hops dry it out. The carbonation is good. Overall it's a very good beer, well balanced and very refreshing."
"Poured in a tulip very cloudy orange. Smell-mangos and more mangos with also some very faint rye malt. Taste -very bitter on the tongue with a good dose of pineapple,grapefruit peel and loads of orange peel nobreally mangoes in the taste ..bitter at first but one of the best smoothest IPA's I ever had the mango works very will the this brew no 7.8% at all"
"On tap today at Tired Hands, 8 oz pour."
"Poured into a tulip. Pours an extremely hazy...well... mango color. Bright white and fluffy heady after the initial pour. Leaves decent lacing throughout the tasting,subtle globs of goodness. But damn this is some hazy stuff."
First had: growler from TH
"This is delicious, the mango is there, but it doesn't overpower anything. Still some solid grassy hop flavor as well is a lighter citrus like lemon showing up."
"This is my first review, so I wanted to make it a special one. I think this is my favorite Tired Hands beer. It was absolutely delicious. Had on tap at the Brewery in an 8 oz pour. "
On Tap at The Brew Cafe in Ardmore.
"Pours a opaque yellow with a thin white head that faded quickly leaving some fine lacing. Aroma of citrus, passion fruit. Taste is passion fruit, lemon, lemon grass. Wheat grain bill is evident. Not really bitter at all more tart. Light body. Clean finish. Crisp and refreshing. Would be great on a hot summer day."
"Pours opaque golden yellow. Smells of stone fruit, yeast, and malt. Tastes intensely of bitter fruit and hops. Feel is thick and chewy with minimal booziness. Overall: not my favorite from Tired Hands, but pretty darn good. Light and refreshing compared to a lot of tired hands' beers."
"Golden straw color, hazy, small white head, great lacing. Grassy, herbal, passionfruit nose. Notes of passionfruit juice, lemongrass, lemon and herbs. Lighter side if medium, crisp and crushable. Solid and fruit forward IPA."
Very hazy gray-hued yellow with a thin bright white head that leaves heavy lacing. 
"Lovely hazy yellow with a nice head. Aroma is insanely tropical, with fruit being very prominent. The flavor profiles reflects very faithfully the nose and is as complex as any IPA I've had from Tired Hands. Very chewable."
8 oz. pour on tap at the Fermentaria.
"From a 16oz can purchased at the TH release two days ago. Pours a cloudy straw/gold with a minimal head. Passionfruit definitely comes through on both the nose and palate, with other citrus notes. Plenty of hop bitterness on the quite tart finish. Excellent IPA."
"Definitely bright citrus first, then the passion fruit which is really balanced,. Not so sweet you couldn't have a few in a sitting. IMHO, better than the milkshake."
murky light yellow. real nice singletter ipa. real good ipa.
Growler share by Darrell. Thanks man.
Served on tap at the Fermentaria.
Beer was growled on 12/20 and poured Xmas eve. 
This juicy beer goes down way too easy
"I don't know if they are still dialing in this recipe, but this latest batch blew me away. I had enjoyed previous batches, but this one went to the next level. May be the best Tired Hands IPA I have had and actually enjoyed it more than the last batch of Mago Tago."
Poured from a growler into a Tired Hands mini wine glass. Thanks to Hastur23! 
"First things first, love the 1L glass from Tired Hands. Definitely a sweet looking growler."
From 04/12/14 notes. 8 oz pour in a tulip at the brewpub.
"8 oz. pour on tap at the brewery poured into their flute-like glass, unknown brewing/kegging date, drank over 30 minutes"
On tap at TH. And then in a growler at home.
"Great inbetween NE/West Coast style here. Really ripe fruits with a good pine/citrus rind backbone. On the very clean side with a sharp bite on the finish. I do prefer a bit more mouthfeel, but a good clean beer at the end of the day."
16 oz can into 7 oz cup 
Opaque orange-yellow with a large white froth that persists as a thin blanket and clings in a coral-like fuzzy wall.
"Can* dated 8/1/17 into pint glass. Pours a cloudy gold-orange with a thin off-white head. Initial impression is citrus/grapefruit, hints of pine, and a sweet malt backbone. Mouthfeel is mediuml as is carbonation. Finish is slightly sweet and tart. Quite enjoyable."
"This was poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was a glossy semi-burnt orange to yellow color with a quickly dissipating foamy head. Semi-thick messy lacing weaves around the glass. The smell starts off with bitter citrus rind, sharp bitter pine, pretty unyielding and aromatic full of the bitterness. But as it warms, a gentle amount of a citrus to grapefruit edge makes an effort to invade becomes balanced nicely. The taste pretty much follows the smell nicely. Bitterness of the pine and citrus rind hit in the aftertaste and follows right on into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation feels low enough to allow normal AIPA harshness character to hit appropriately. Overall, this was a really nice AIPA that I would have again."
Brief impression from my first visit to SingleCut in Spring 2015 (served on-draught):
Poured from the bottle into a snifter.
"Pours hazy orange. Thick, medium, white head that lasts a while."
LOOK - Hazy light brown color 
"Good color - light haze and good carbonation. S: grapefruit, pineapple, floral. T: dank, bitter not too floral, more piney. Viscous mouthfeel. Overall very good."
"L: Looks like I just stopped at Treehouse. Brillant orange colored beer, very hazy. Originally poured a monster head silky, frothy, whispy, and dense."
Bottle from Partysource Syracuse NY for around $12 canadian.
"On-tap 3/19/2017 at Natty Greene’s Tavern in North Attleboro, MA, served in a tulip glass."
500ml bottle about a week old
"Bottle dated 10/5/2016. Poured into IPA glass. It pours a turbid hazy golden-orange color with an enormous, fluffy, snow-white head and lacing with excellent retention. It smells of grapefruit, tropical fruit, onion, grass, pine needles, and floral hops. It's quite dank. The fruit is subtle but the blast of bitter, biting hops is not. I'm not tasting the tropical fruit I smelled but the grass and pine is pronounced. The aftertaste is decidedly bitter. This ale is medium-bodied, moderately carbonated, and the 7.4% ABV gives it a punch without being overwhelming. This bottle is two months old but it remains very hoppy and bitter. While I generally prefer a more balanced American IPA, Mo' Shuggie is very well-crafted and a pleasure to drink."
"This beer is very underrated. By far best hoppy offering from Singlecut. Awesome Southern Hemisphere hop aromas as usual, but with an almost perfect soft, creamy mouthfeel that isn't far from what Tree House does. Pretty great stuff."
"A: Poured from the bottle into a Duvel tulip. Body is hazy - this is one of those NE ""milkshake"" IPAs in appearance - golden that appears more golden-yellow when backlit. A 1-finger foamy white head sits on top, receding to leave behind nice splotches of foamy lace. "
Moderate head that settles slowly and leaves chunky lace on the glass. The broth is orange-dirty gold in color. There is plenty of yeast pieces floating in the liquid. Not attractive but harmless.
"Had on tap. Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is grapefruit, orange juice, and lemons. Medium bodied and well balanced. Is right up there with Tree House levels of juiciness. Delicious beer. One of the better ipas I have had recently."
16oz. capped bottle into a Surly teku. 
"Yooo real talk this smells like some fire hash. Taste is literally just hops, aftertaste reminscent of pepper. One of the most intense beers I've ever tried. I like Softly Spoken Magic Spells better but this is some crazy shit... next level IPA."
"I searched high and low for this brew after a friend told me that he thought it was superior to Treehouse Julius. By the time I finally found a bottle I think I forgot what Julius tasted like. Now, with these Single Cuts more and more available in South Western Connecticut and several trips to Treehouse later, I can sanely say that this beer really doesn't compare to Julius. It's quite different in taste; similar in that it's cloudy, unfiltered and very juicy, but the taste is not quite there. Something is a little off in this beer for me. A previous reviewer suggested a sort of emptiness in the middle of the taste that he or she attributed to, perhaps the water quality used for the brewing. I'm not experienced enough in brewing to know but I do agree that the middle of the taste is where the problem is."
Poured into a teku pint. Label says 7 06.
"Poured into a deep seidel because it's been a long time since I drank from a seidel. Pours a pretty, deep yellow with a a nice white head. Filtered, but a bit hazy."
Picked up pretty fresh. 15 days from bottling date. 
"Super fresh, bottled 7/06."
"this was tasty, will drink again, it is a one beer night beer due to bottling and price point, unfiltered and is one of the better unfiltered presentations and believe it or not was clean as unfiltered. plenty of citrus and great carbonation."
2016 release
"Thanks, Xenoreactive!"
Looks like hazy apple juice with a billowy white head. Smell is off the charts good with loads of tropical and citrus. Taste trends toward grapefruit with plenty of hop bitterness. Little bite on the finish; wonderful beer.
A bomber with a bottle date of 3/08 poured in my Weyerbacher tulip for the grand occasion. 
"first time trying this was not great. after the first experience i did not revisit but recently got a can in a trade. totally different beer this time. bright notes of pineapple, peach, and orange, mango, bubblegum, grapefruit, doughy malts and slightly spicy hint of pine on the finish. great stuff!"
L-The beer pours a hazy pale gold. The head is white and fluffy standing 2 fingers high. Lacing is excellent.
16.9 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.
"Pours a pale, hazy gold. Aroma is somewhat faint, just a bit of juicy hops and cracker. It starts pretty thin and crisp with a almost czech malt style, then the hops really come in. A bit of that citrus rind juice style transistioning into a pretty bitter vinuos at the end. True to the name it is a streamlined IPA focusing on specific hop varieties, I just didn't find those strains particularly interesting."
"pours a gorgeous hazy yellow, almost murky but not quite, for some reason not that big of a head. lots of bubbles sticking to glass. smell pretty light, but it's grapefruit, pineapple, and dankness. taste is HUGE. big juicy tropical fruits: mangoes, pineapples, little bit of peach, big dank bitterness at the end from those NZ hops. mouthfeel is almost perfect for an IPA. holy crap I'm blown away by this beer, need to make a stop down to NYC for some growlers."
"hazy orange/pineapple color, its beautiful and looks delicious. can't wait to dive into this. Oh god, the nose is garlic and onion and all amazing. reminds me of heady topper. high IBUs but it still gets a little juicy and gushing with tropical aromas, if you've had Sosus... that's where I'm at. its awesome. Tastes full of the nelson/mosaic tropics and bitters, yet it really well balanced, there is very little hop-bite. smooth and fruity, this is damn good. Feel is full for an IPA, it's a big full/rich beer that I am falling in love with. Overall you need to enjoy this and take your time with it. its a heat hitter and with any amount of good distribution should create some buzz around the beer community. Enjoy!"
soul-bending - good stuff!!
Poured from bomber dated 3/8/2016 into snifter. 
"great smell right out of the bottle, hazy lemon yellow color foamy head that dropper to a thin cap with great lacing. Nice balance of taste, I was surprised how less bitter it was than expected. Really smooth mouth feel, nice flavor of hops and citrus ends slightly dry. Easy to drink down, best beer I've had in a while."
16.9 oz. bottle
3/24/16 DE home
This beer is phenomenal!
"Poured from the bottle into a teku glass, pours a nice hazy yellow light orange color with a little white head and great lacing. The aroma is very bright and fresh, juicy, zesty. I get some bready notes, orange and maybe lemon, grapefruit, slight pine. "
"Poured into Tulip glass .. Nice golden yellow with a finger of foamy head. Smell was delightful, lemon, earthy and dank. Taste was much of the same , starts citrus and then finished with that Sauvin dankness with no bitterness. Will certainly buy again and confirms that I need to take a ride to singlecut SOON"
Color is a hazy golden yellow color with about a fingers worth of white head. Aroma is of lots of citrus 
500ml bottle poured into a pint glass. 
"Poured from the 16.9oz bottle into a snifter glass, bottle date indicates this is less than a month old. Pours very hazy and bright gold, nice rocky white head develops and leaves chunky lacing. Very pretty beer and I guess NY is trying to copy that New England haze look."
My girl just surprises be with some MO Shuggie
"Never heard of SingleCut and randomly saw it in my local beer store and decided to try 16.9 ouncer. Beautiful beer. I would have given it a 5 but the smell was so spectacular that I couldn't help but be slightly disappointed by the taste, even though that was amazing as well. Appearance was straw around the edges with a deeper orange in the center. Decent head and lacing that disappear quickly. Aroma is amazing! Peach, apricot, citrus, white wine, oak and a mild bit of funk at the end. The taste is all of those up front with a nice dry finish. Beautifully balanced, wow!"
L: Hazy gold body with a bit of copper tone. Super creamy white head that leaves behind a ridiculously great lacing.
pours awsome hazy yellow with nice foam pillow lingering for a while. nose is just in your face lemon and orange rind. wow it's strong. taste is big time Aussie hops and the sauvin typical flavors are abundant. this beer finishes well and leaves a nice dry hop boquet all over my palate. overall this beer is great. pleasant surprise from a new brewery for me. kind of like kiwi rising. if you see this one get it.
Bottle into snifter. 
"Let's start with the fact that I love Singlecut. Until now I have been in love with everything they offer. I have heard amazing things about Mo'shuggie and I don't know if I got a bad bottle. But, the flavor was sour and and funky. I could not finish my tulip. This made me sad."
"Dank and tropical. Grapefruit pith and zest. Comes correct with the tropical fruits in the mid palate. Mangoes, papaya and pineapple. Has a light body, good carb. Tongue tingling bitterness but it never becomes overwhelming. Super solid."
"L - medium-orange, nice and hazy, head dissipates fairly quickly, lots of lacing"
"First beer from Singlecut. I schlepped up to Cable Beverages in Rockland County and filled a growler. Pours a beautiful light gold, nicely carbonated. Smells intensely of hops. Fantastic taste, bursting with bitter citrus hops. Tastes like it's dry hopped to the max. Excellent brew. Can't wait to have more from these guys."
"500 ml bottle. Pours murky light golden orange with finger white head, fades leaving lots of lace. Big juicy hop aroma with some pine tree in there. Taste, wow, there is some taste in this brew. It's juicy like the Treehouse IPAs but then the pine and grapefruit punch you, and you like it. The bitte hops take over for the rest of the ride, and last well after a semi dry finish. Medium soft mouthfeel, glides down. East coast juice meets west coast bitter, tons of flavor for a hop head. Really glad I got to try this one, Cheers to @zid!"
"Have had a few Singlecut beers sent to me lately and while impressed, I had not been blown away. Well that all changed... Closest beer I have had possibly ever to classic OG Alpine Nelson danksauce. Poured a hazy straw color with great nelson on the nose. Dank and resiny with a creamy dry finish. This blew me away!"
"this is really saying something, but its true, that this might be, and im pretty sure it is, the best ipa i had in 2015, and one of the best i have ever had overall. heady topper and pliny be damned, this is next level beer!!! i loved all the single cut stuff i had, but this was hands down their best in my opinion. i was floored by it really. on tap at one of the coolest little bottle shops in central new york, the thirsty pug. a little bit of color to it, not amber, but pushing caramel i would say, with a tall white head and more clarity than some of the other highly acclaimed east coast india pale ales. it smells like a slice of heaven, slightly woody like centennial, but with a ton of hop layers. tangerine perhaps, pineapple yes, christmas tree, spruce tips, passion fruit but not tangy, and confectioners sugar but not sweet. just amazing. the taste is like the nose, but all the depth is impossibly well integrated, hard to pick out varietals and such, but i sure wish i knew, i would love to take a stab at making an ipa like this. nothing really like it. it lingers long in the finish, somewhat fruity, but not sweet or bitter, just modest lingering bitterness there. so so good, my mouth waters for it again. i must have had it super fresh, people dont seem to be going crazy for it, but mark my words, this will become one of the most sought after ipas in the country before too long. its as god as any out there. A+ amazing!"
Very good solid IPA
This beer is insane. Hard to find too many that are better. Came across several bottle in Massachusetts and managed to grab a number of them.
Served in a pint glass at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth. 
L: Pours a very murky hay-like color. Very nice lacing and decent head retention.
"Pours a hazy, luminous golden-yellow; about a finger of electric-white head. Very much in the east-coast mold."
"pours a beautiful hazy apricot flavor, great nose of hops, flavors are pretty intense with hoppy pine and citrus flavors, and a nice funky aftertaste--much better than billy half and full-stack IMO, and more intense than OH beers ive had...definitely the best of NY IPAs and very close to TH and HF offerings...."
A-hazy orange body. Fluffy white head. Leaves little lacing.
"Very good IPA, really reminds me of Jacks Abby Kiwi Rising DIPL. But more of a hop bomb. Excellent Smithers!"
"In typical Singlecut style, this is a hop bomb, with tons of grapefruit citrus and pine, and bitterness lingering for some time. Unfiltered for sure, this looks and tastes like grapefruit juice. Really good ipa. Drinks like a west coast double with a Vermont style feel and body."
"Ok fabulous citrus floral on the nose. Peaches, tangerine. Pours an amazing opaque straw haze. This is where it drops a bit: First sip is pineapples tangerine lingering on the palate. Not the pounce I expected but quite good. Nice long lasting aftertaste. A good brew but not sure I'd spring for it again"
"Bottle, not sure on date. Pours a cloudy dark orange to peach color with a think foamy white head. There is quite a bit of a soapy lacing. The odor for me is very honey, grassy, pine, dank, resin, fir balsam, slightly floral, tropical fruit, pineapple, slightly spicy. The taste for me is honey, floral, grassy, herbal, dank, spices, clove, lemon, grapefruit, resin, long lasting dry bitterness."
Poured into a pint glass at Good Beer in NYC.
"Gorgeous hop nectar with massive tropical nose, beautiful orange/straw color and outstanding flavors. Getting third 64oz growler of this magic brew."
"This beer pours an opaque tropicana orange juice color with a huge fluffy white head with good retention that leaves nice sheets of lacing. The aroma is very strong mango and grapefruit with orange, green grapes, and a touch of floral, pine and dankness. The taste is very strong grapefruit and citrus and not nearly as much mango as present in the nose. There is a nice bitterness on the finish and a bit of hop spiciness. Feel is medium and very oily. Drank side by side with Billy Full Stack and 10/10 times I'm taking the full stack. Overall an awesome beer, but not on the same level as full stack."
"Amazing brew by one of my favorite brewers. Tremendous flavor. Great color. A wee bit heavy for a summertime brew, but perfect for autumn. Sit back in a nice comfy chair, fire up the firepit and pour yourself a cold one of these and you have a perfect session of relaxation ahead of you."
L - Deep cloudy orange with a hint of amber at the center. Completely opaque with a fluffy white head that dissipates to leave thick lacing. Fine particulates suspended in the beer - hazy as hell and probably half hop cone still in the bottle
"Great beer! I couldn't smell very much but perhaps that's me. Hazy, copper in coloring. Really enjoyable taste. I get a hint of maple sweetness but it works really well. Very well balanced. I definitely recommend seeking this beer out."
"Wow, this is pretty dang on point. I could drink this every day. Draft or bottle this bad boy holds its own with the best."
"I was surprised by it's hazy pour. Soapy but minimal head atop a deep golden body. Smell is absolute white grapefruit juice. Taste is similar with light pine, honey, pepper and bitterness. Finish is drying. "
"Bottle opens up with a dank, citrusy aroma. Pours a nice shade of gold with an average amount of carbonation. Great hoppy flavor that isn't too overpowering but manages to completely mask the ABV. Tropical juiciness that results from the papaya, pineapple, mango profile. Taste of orange and lemon balances the humidity. Stickiness coats the tongue like most dank IPAs and it leaves with a beefy bitterness. Great beer that I look forward to having again...despite the 16.9 oz bottle which makes it a little pricey compared to other great 22 oz offerings."
"Pours hazy and brown. Slight carbonation. One finger head. Smells piney and floral. Some citrus, but not too stand-out-ish. Tastes like real hop flavor, with some very faint sweetness. Peppery/spicy finish. Overall - Pretty solid. I'm not going to be too sad if I don't come across it anytime soon, but I'd drink it again."
"Excellent, very New England like. Orangey color like many of the New England beers. Excellent smell. As it warms tastes better. If this one was in a Trillium bottle this one would be higher rated."
"Nice beer recently being distributed to MA. I saw the 3.01 rating and was confused. 1.5 given for look. The beer looks like hoppy gold, and no it is not malty, if your pay for hops don't you want to taste them? If you want a brown ale do not try this beer, but if you want a good IPA must try."
On draft in a 12 Ounce snifter at Oliver's Astoria.
"Thanks to my friends Val and Steve for grabbing this for me on a recent trip to the Big Crapple. Hated 22oz format bottle poured into 10oz goblet. Poured an orange juice orange, completely opaque, and with only a thin cap of white head that had low retention and light lacing."
"I wanted to like this more. Nothing bad about it, just nothing special either for me."
Looks like I am in the minority here.
"Drank from a 16.9 fluid ounces bottle purchased at Pemberton Farms, Cambridge, MA"
The beer comes in a beautiful hazy rich golden orange.
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy honey color. Thin, whipped head. Mild lacing. Aroma is based on sweet, pastry malt and a good amount of my favorite regional hop- New Zealand. Musty, tropical, citrusy, unique hoppiness. Not exactly enamored with the malt. Very sweet and sugary. Reminds me of Night Shift Brewing near me. Love the hops but don't love the other elements. Medium bodied with plenty of bitterness. A ton of positives but just as much to nitpick."
No bottling date that I could find but this was just released.
Cloudy as whoa. Citrus smell. Delicious tropical flavor. Slightly bitter finish.
Pours a cloudy yet bright straw color. Creamy eggshell head that has good retention that left a wall of lacing. 
"Picked this up a while back at the Whole Foods on Houston St. in New York after having been thoroughly impressed with Singlecut's Bon Bon 2X TNT IIPA and was hoping that this would measure up to it. It was strong for an IPA when it came to the hops but like their other offering that I enjoyed, this one grew on me and was deceptively easy to drink, while standing out from other IPA's and the typical flavor profile that I associate with them."
Hazy golden beer with 2 fingers of thick head
"A: medium gold, just short of clear with a vague haze; fat head high as you want will leaves drapes of lace down the glass"
A - Pale orange color with soapy white lacing ring.
"A: The beer is relatively clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles on the surface. "
bottle picked up locally enjoyed from a singlecut snifter. just came off finishing a bottle of billy half-stack
"Bottle purchased at AJ's Beer Warehouse in Henrietta, NY."
Growler fill from DeCicco's
"Poured into snifter. This one is quite bitter, 123 IBUs. Beautiful to look at, hazy dark orange. I was blown away last week when I had Singlecut's Full Stack IPA, this one isn't quite that awesome but it is super high quality nonetheless. A very solid beer, price point is rather high (around $8 per 16.9 oz bottle) . Other Half gets a lot of the NYC attention, but Singlecut's IPAs are killing it right now."
oohhh so mango
"This beer is freshly bottles and quite wonderful. Super super hoppy, and the New Zealand hops come barreling through like a ton o' bricks. Very similar to hop ranch, but a bit dryer more bitterness on the front end. Gosh darn it I'm happy I picked this one up and you should too if you're in the NYC area"
Growler filled at the Green Growler Grocery in Croton on Hudson NY
"Growler fill at Craft Beer Cellar in Warwick, NY. "
Holy holy what an amazing beer. NZ hops FTW.
16 oz can dated 6/14/18 and purchased at brewery. Poured into Belgian ale glass.
"L: Poured from a growler to a pint glass. Had a bright, golden yellow color and a slightly hazy consistency. There was a small amount of foamy head that quickly dissipated. Pretty good lacing."
16 OZ can
"Home is a bright and light American IPA from Ocelot Brewing. I do like that it has details about the ingredients used right there on the label, even though I don't have enough knowledge to judge them individually."
The beer pours a nice white and foamy head that dissipate pretty quickly. The beer itself is a nice clear pale gold color that looks pretty nice. It has a nice golden metallic hue to it.
Love the contrast of the bright white head and the opaque orange yellow beer.
Fresh growler into my Teku. Appearance is light yellow with foamy white head. Aroma hit me from a foot away. Tropical and citrus notes. Very smooth mouthful. Hops up front following a little spicy and bitter bite at the end. Very Nice though. Overall top notch beer here. Ocelot is definitely a contender.
Nice crisp IPA a little hoppy
"From a fresh growler, pours a slightly hazy orange-gold. A finger of white head leaves spotty lacing. Smell is ruby red grapefruit, white grape juice, oranges, tangerine and some savory onion, I assume from the Nelson. Bit of piney mango as well. Taste follows. Feel is a lightish medium. Overall, an exceptionally tasty IPA from one of my favorite local breweries."
An exceptional beer! It has a great aroma! It goes down very smooth and leaves one with a great feeling of wanting to have many more! It is one of their best beers!
A: This poured a cloudy gold with a little white head. 
"From a growler, pours a hazy gold color with a wispy white head."
32oz fresh growler pour into a shaker pint.
"Excellent IPA from Ocelot. This beer smells fantastic with strong citrusy smell to it. The taste delivers more of the same, but is balanced with a little bit of pine taste plus a strong malt background. Yet again, Ocelot delivers and seems to be getting better and better as time passes."
From growler pour 2 hours after fill:
"Here we go. Described as a sort of homage to Alpine Nelson. Rye malt, Citra, and Nelson."
Love this combo of Nelson & Citra hops. Ocelot now bottles some beers and I'm happy to report that this tastes just as good from the bottle as it does on tap.
"This is hands-down one of the best IPAs I've ever had. I just got back from a week in Vermont drinking Hill Farmstead and Lawson's every day, and this beer can hold it's own against that competition. "
"Cloudy peach colour, with little carbonation and a finger of off white head. "
12oz. capped bottle into Night Shift stemware. 
"Pours golden. Smells of tropical fruits and pine. the taste is amazing balance of the tropical fruits (lemon, tangerine) and some hops. I agree that this tastes like an IPA. The feel is refreshing, clean and crisp as is Alpine's style."
"Advertised as a pale, I get how one can get it confused with an IPA. Intensely hopped it has aromas of chive and cannabis mostly. The resinous herbal character can also be found in the taste with a nice malt backbone. The carbonation is moderate and permits a full drinkability. "
"Holy shit, 69 IBUs in a 5.3% ale?? Now that's a session IPA. Pure Hoppiness was so damn amazing, I had to try this one too, although I rarely bother with light beers. I usually am not a fan of such nonsense."
12 oz. bottle poured into willibecher. 
Active brew. Very bubbly. Hard to tell if its the bubbles or there is a haziness. Smooth white head terrific lacing. 
"Smells tropical, pineapple mostly with some sweetness on the nose. Grapefruit pith and pine bitterness after slight initial sweetness. The slightly astringent bitterness sticks with you. This beer reads out more like an IPA to me with less attention to the malt. Well put together feel like a prickly IPA."
"Hoppy Birthday pours a light, clean amber color - carbonation is fairly minimal. Not much of a head, which dissipates rapidly."
12oz draft pour into snifterloudy boasts a golden orange hue and floats a fluffy 1/8in head of white foam that quickly disippates to a little more than a few isolated whispy islands and an edge-hugging ring. With agitation sheets of lacing leg it down to the ring.
Fantastic hoppy delight! From smell to taste and aftertaste the experience changes throughout the drink.. many different hop flavors and refreshing end was amazing!
Golden orange color with a thick thin head with good retention and leaving good laces.
"Pours a hazy orange gold with a small white head. Smells of sweet malts, pine, hops, and citrus. Tastes of pine, bitter hops, some sweetness, and grapefruit zest. Medium in both body and carbonation. Overall it really is a pretty incredible IPA."
"Very good IPA, I am somewhat surprised at how high this is rated. Pours a slightly hazy orange/honey yellow color with a medium sized fizzy white head. Head retention is slightly better than average and there are some thin rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma and taste are both piney and floral hops with a little citrus (orange) in the flavor. Good strong smell and taste. Nicely bitter but some balance with biscuity malt. Mouthfeel is crisp, rich and nicely bitter. A very good IPA, but not necessarily a world-class brew."
"DATE: August 8, 2017... OCCASION: celebrating forty-one years of life and thanking God for them all... GLASSWARE: Brew at the Zoo pint... pours a sizzling copper body teaming with effervescence... the white head is thick with bubbles as well, stopping at a half-finger and holding resiliently... grapefruit, pine, mango, light caramel and tea leaves, with the promise that this is indeed well hopped but also concerned with a balanced profile... the first sip is smooth, balanced and lively enough to elicit attention... creamy as it curls around the tongue, an embrace that causes one to pull back and savor--definitely bigger than its 5.25% ABV!... the back end is memorable, with a lingering malt sensation... the body is substantial but not weighty, as a session should be, and its hops announce nicely at the teeth... the six-headed hop monster is put in its place by a caramel backbone, lasting and ringing in its strength... welcome bitterness bites at the tongue and teeth, with grapefruit, pine, lemon, bitters, and that unmistakable hop punch that makes me wish more than one of these was in the mystery mix pack I found it in... I would buy a case of this, gladly, and rank it above the last few sessions I've had--and they were good, too..."
"Pours a golden yellow color, clear, with about a finger of fluffy, white head that retains fairly well. Smells of citrus, pine, and a little malt backbone. Softer feel to it, medium body. Citrus is predominant, some floral notes, nice malt backbone, and a little bite to it. Pleasant beer, nothing overpowering about it, just a nicely balanced beer."
"This one pours solid gold with 1/2"" head ad minimal lacing. Smells of hops, citrus, and floral. The taste is bold hops up front, very nice mix that is not to bitter and just right. Getting nice citrus notes, some floral, a decent dryness and minor bite on the finish. Overall this is a well done IPA that is refreshing and loaded with nice flavors. Finish is a little dry with mild bitterness but leaves you wanting more, very nice beer."
"Golden orange in color with near perfect clarity. Poured with a moderate dense, bright white foam with excellent retention. Medium aromas of fresh mint and light citrus with medium light malt beneath. Medium light bodied with soft, medium high carbonation. Despite the lighter body, nice creamy smooth feel through the middle. Medium high minty and under-ripe orange citrus flavors with medium malt flavors beneath. Medium high, tangy bitterness, through the middle. Minty and herbal flavors from the middle to the end. Finished dryly with lingering mint flavors and bitterness. Well balanced aromas. Flavors are more IPA like than pale ale, but who cares....great flavors and feel and easy drinking."
"May have been an old bottle, tatsed like the yeast had taken over. Solid malt backbone but no hop lift ..."
"12oz bottle into a pint glass. best by 9/15/17, so guessing about 6 weeks old. "
Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Best before May 20/2017.
12 oz. Bottle
"It pours medium hazy amber (SRM 8) producing a 1/2"" off-white foam cap with moderate retention. Continuous streams of bubles rise from the bottom of the glass. Big tropical fruit aromas of guava, orange and passion fruit greet the nose. Fruit over bread crumb starts the palate with bitterness advancing in from the sides. Alcohol flavors are low and alcohol warming is minimal. Hoppy birthday has a clean fermentation character with the hops producing most of the fruit flavors. The malt character is slightly less than medium and the malt sweetness is medium. Hop flavors are medium to medium high and hop bitterness is medium high. Hoppy birthday has a medium body and medium carbonation. This is a very flavorful and easy to drink beer that is not over alcoholic. The big hop flavors and bitterness are especially appreciated"
"Pours a bubbly gold color with a small white head. The smell is intensely hoppy, and the taste essentially stays the same as the scent. There's so piney and citrus undertones to the flavor, as well."
L- Pours somewhat of a translucent gold color with sticky lacing but not much of a head.
"Pours dirty golden in body with frothy white head on top. Strong aroma of pine, citrus rind, lemon, mint. Tastes of pine, citrus rind, some sizable bitterness, lemon, and grass. Dry mouthfeel. Light in body with medium carbonation. The body is probably too light to carry such a hop wallop but it is still good."
Appearance: Pours slightly hazy and honey colored with a one inch cap; splashy lacing abounds
"It pours a slightly hazy golden color with a hippy citrus smell of it. The taste is of a citrus note with a dry bitter taste. Body is medium with a dry finish. Overall a good example of a pale ale, maybe a bit more hippy than I like but still well done."
L: Clear golden color with a white foamy head that lasts.
"First off, let me say that normally session IPAs do not appeal to me in the slightest. Normally, I find them weak and watery. This is not the case with Hoppy Birthday! This piney, flavorful beer holds its own with even the best of IPAs. Very strong aromatics and bitters on the front end with a nice lingering citrus finish. Well done Alpine."
"Serving: 12 oz bottle (""best by 08 Feb 17"") poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
"Alpine Beer Company ""Hoppy Birthday"""
"Near perfect pale ale - hits all the notes I come to expect in a well constructed west coast hoppy brew. Golden pour with a puffy head. Leaves a nice trail of lacing as you drain the glass. Aroma of fresh cut pine and ripe citrus. So inviting. Taste is orange rind, grapefruit, melon, pine layered on a crackery malt chassis. Nothing too acidic or tart. Moderate carbonation and crisp citrus combines to end each sip with a pop. Perfectly imbalanced pale ale."
A: crystal clear; copper colored; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a thin collar; OK lacing;
"Herbal pine needles, slight peppery dankness"
"This is a solid IPA, but the smell rubbed me the wrong way. I loved the taste, which I believe was nicely piney, but I could not get past the smell. It's likely a me problem."
"Got this at Globe, and beyond it's best by date. 2nd time I've had it, and although this one is over a month beyond it's best by date, it is still really good. It has a very nice piney character in the flavor. To quote a previous review @SFC21: ""In the context of session IPAs ... this is at the head of the pack."""
"Probably the most flavorful ""session"" IPA that I've had to date. I generally don't care for the style as session IPAs tend to taste more like hop water, but this brew manages to avoid that problem. "
"Hoppy Birthday pours a foggy fire-orange with a finger of off-white head. Head retention is solid. Lacing spider webs around the glass, at least at the start. Aroma is all hops, while remaining more on the subtle side of IPA hop aromas, perhaps that's the ""session"" part of the label. Hop notes include orange, tangerine, and grapefruit. A little resin hop stick is also there. Flavor profile is hops throughout, but all in a muted, tuned-down version. Orange, citrus, lemon zest, and biscuit malt all come through. It's a well-tamed birthday party, with not one note sticking out much more then the others. Combine it's balance with it's simplistic notes, and this would be an easily sessionable beer. It is on the bitter side of the spectrum, so that should be accounted for. Mouth feel is medium-thin, and not very filling. Overall, an easy drinking IPA, but it is on the bitter side of things. While it does have somethings going well, it isn't something to go googly-eyes over. "
ALPINE can do no wrong in my beer book.
"12oz bottle, Best by 14 JAN 17"
"Hell of a West Coast pale ale. It's bone dry and damn bitter, but fun to drink. The hops are a little fruity, but mostly floral citrus rind . I want more."
A - Pours a clear golden brown with a fluffy head. 
"Appearance: pours a clear orange color with a 1/2"" head that lasts a while."
A light pinkish orange with a thin cap.
Nice clear light golden color with moderate white cap and lacing.
"A: Copper-gold color with a moderate, fluffy head."
I'm loving that label art! That cake certainly looks pungent! From the bottle it pours a nice golden amber color with a moderate head and ring like lacing.
"Pours a light golden with a decent head and retention. Not much lacing. Great beer. Nose and palate are a ton of resinous, piney hops. Clean, crisp mouthfeel and finish with a lingering resin."
"Single, twelve ounce bottle copped from Cloverleaf Tavern. Pours a copper, ruddy hue with minimal frothing. Pines, pines, pines, sums up the aroma, with an equal mouthfeel and flavor to match. Citrus florals and slight lemon spice thrown into the mix. Good stuff. Recommended, but does not make for the perfect session beer."
Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a nice large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrusy hops with light earthy notes is enticing. Taste is dominated by citrusy notes with some earthy flavours with more bitterness then I was expecting. Body is full for style with good carbonation. Good but bitterness was more apparent than I was expecting.
"This is the real deal, plain & simple. For a session it's a little high abv, perhaps it's the grain profile. The malt to hop ratio is exactly where you would want it for a beer showcasing 6 hop variations and they are just phenomenal. First smell and swig are like a carousel of flavors. A+"
Just straight hops and nothing to balance. Hoppiest beer I've ever had and that isn't a compliment. Extremely bitter.
"Clear, golden in color with a fluffy white head 1 1/2 fingers in depth. Taste is citrus, earthy hops and biscuity malts w/ a mild-moderate hop bitterness at the back end."
"Pint purchased from Growl Movement in Salem Oregon. $4.00 Clear golden ale with a small white head. Good hoppy fruity aromas , some biscuit malts. Very nice hopped fruity taste..the malts try to balance but no match. Great medium mouth feel..so easy. A great APA...."
"Big off-white crackly head on top of a slightly hazy orange pint. Leafy, resiny bitter hops explode in the nose. Floral, subtler elements follow suit. Bitter, citrusy hops dominate the taste. Minimalist malt backbone (barely) provides balance. Light carbonation and mouthcoating bitterness makes for a great mouthfeel. Long highly bitter finish."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of 02 Dec 2016. Sampled on August 18, 2016."
"Starts delicious, finishes very dry with a departing bitterness opposite of how it shows up. Not bad, but probably wouldn't buy again given other options."
L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a copper color and a clear texture. There was about a half inch of foamy head that quickly dissipated. Pretty good lacing.
Pours a copper orange color. Good amount of of white foamy head. Smell is of citrus and C hops. Taste: citrus is the first thing to great you but it is followed by grass and fresh cut hay. A little sweet malt in there too. The perfect amount to support the 6 different hops. Which honestly I don't know if I could pick them out. But like I said I think I am tasting a lot of the C ones in this with all the citrus. Medium to light mouthfeel that finishes crisp and dry. Good beer!
A-stayed in the bottle...hotel drinking 101
Really smooth sessions IPA. Full of citrus notes with just the right bitter bit. Would drink again
"L- Clear golden body, nice fluffy white head with low retention."
A: [3.75] Beer has a clouded apricot appearance. It forms about 1/4 finger of white head with some irregular bubbles. The bottle lists the ABV (5.25%) and has a best by date of (07/12/2016). So it is slightly past prime - but I just got it.
"Zack's house spring 2016; Deliciously fresh, pungent, fresh cut grass, a little too much bitter lingering on the finish; needs a smidge more balance for me..."
Pours a hazy amber color with a thick frothy white head that dissipates somewhat but sticks around.
"A - Slightly hazy amber. Very thick creamy head that holds well, with big bubbles. Minimal bubbles from carbonation."
Looks good. smells pretty good. Full bodied taste. Feels good. Good beer
A very dank hoppy brew. 
"Pours a clear amber color with a 2 finger width foamy head. Head retention is decent. Lacing is good. Big citrus aroma with some piney resin. Big and juicy taste. Hop forward with some aggressive piney hops and a nice citrus edge at the end. Overall a good beer, especially for a session IPA, which I like but not as much as your regular IPAs. More of an astringent aftertaste. Light bodied with moderate to heavy carbonation."
"Poured from a freshness dated 12 oz. bottle: clear, deep golden to orange hue with a quickly dissipating head. "
Poured into a Creature Comforts nonic pint glass. Label says Best By 01 OCT 16
"May 29, 2016"
"Pours a lovely golden hue with a robust and frothy snow white head. The aroma of this beer is its money maker. Tropical fruit, pepper, lemon, earth, citrus. Basically, name a hop note and you'll find it here. All working in delectable assonance, like a choir of Kazoos with perfect pitch playing the ""hallelujah chorus"". The flavor is quite refreshing. You get a mild malt sweetness up from, but this quickly gives way to a lingering bitterness, not unlike the rind of a grapefruit. The only aspect where this beer begins to fall flat is the mouthfeel, which like every session ipa I have ever had is watery and weak. That being said, this is by months, yards, years, and bounds the best session ipa that I have encountered."
Lightly hazed deep gold color with about two fingers of white that stays for close to ten minutes. Better than average lace.
A - nice golden Amber colored clear beer with a. White head that dissipates quick 
Hoppy birthday 2 me.
"355ml bottle bought from Light House Wines, Jordanstown"
A lot of astringency.
Ordered a 10 oz. draught at a local beer place. Came to my table in a snifter.
"Deep gold to pale amber in color, a bit hazy, a good amount of head."
Finally broke down and got one. Pretty much in my wheelhouse for beers: can taste the hops without thick annoying booziness. Just a good drinkable beer that actually tastes like beer and not some sludgy over alocholed mess....Will definitely get again. Solid stuff.
nice light option
"Thirst-quenching, crisp, and hoppy. It's what a session IPA should strive to be."
"By now I think I've tasted 4 or 5 session IPA. I've disliked them all. They were all watered down version of a real IPA. This isn't. Finally someone who does a session IPA and does it well. The smell is very powerful, very tropical, fresh. It's similar to the Omnipollo Zodiak, except instead of ginger it's more lychees. The taste is all West Coast IPA though, very malty and piney. If no one tells you it's a session IPA, you probably will never guess unless you're told beforehand it's an Alpine. It's less powerful than other beers from the Californians, but I find their other beers TOO powerful... So in the end, it's my favorite brew from Alpine. It reminds me of what Modern Times is doing: nothing too harsh, just a complex mix of hops in order to get interesting flavors. Other Alpine beers are too simple, just guns blazing, hops and no surprise. This one is different. Nice job."
First Alpine offering and I have to say that I am very impressed. I had been searching for this one for over five years and finally had the opportunity to try it yesterday. Here goes:
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Nice clear yellow gold, weak head, decent lacing. Nice piney smell with some floral notes. Taste was nicely hoppy and piney, with a bit of bitterness. Good beer!"
"Poured 12 oz bottle into standard pint glass. Amber color with decent head that diminished to a thin film. The aroma is pine and pungent hops. This beer is full of that same flavor, bold hops with pine and the grapefruit. The mouthfeel is resinous and full. A great IPA, especially for a session"
"Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a slightly murky golden color with a medium sized off-white head. The aroma is pine, citrus and malt. The flavor is world class and it is full of citrus."
"Deep golden/copper hue. Lots of carbonation on the pour. Small off-white head with decent retention, fading to a pool of foam. Lacing is minimal."
"bottle dated best by aug 16/16. drinking it like 4 months before the best by date, but i wonder how fresh it is!?!"
"Clear golden yellow with a decently rocky whit head. Smells of pine and tropical fruit. Taste is similar, along with a thinner body than expected and a bitterness that barely edges out balanced. Great ""hoppy pale ale"". Cheers!"
"Served 38F from the bottle into a 14 ounce goblet. No bottling date, just an enjoy by date of July 12th 2016 (F15424)."
"12 oz bottle, with ""Best by"" dating on the label."
Found this in the mix and match section at the Local Carnivores. Score!
Clear gold with a moderate head and some sticky lacing.
"Thought this brew was slightly overrated, I expected great things and only got good things. Pours kind of meh, orangish amber body with an off white head, left good amounts of lacing. Smell is both floral and citrusy, lots of orange rind, grapefruit juice, and some lemon. Taste is unbalanced, in my opinion. VERY hop forward with little to no malt to back it up: very bitter tropical juice flavors and just a hint of biscuit. I only bought a 12oz single of this, but I'm aware it comes in larger format bottles...it was a fairly pleasant sipper at 12 oz, but can't imagine drinking more than that in one session. Way too bitter and unbalanced to be truly sessionable, as far as I'm concerned. Definitely not a bad beer but didn't meet my expectations. Would drink again though."
"Maybe I am spoiled by living in New England. This offer from Alpine would be about #16 at my local 20 tap craft beer bar. The look of this beer reminds me of my youth. Very similar pour to Budweiser or miller. Clear with no head and some effervescent bubbles rising up. The flavor is fair. Little too much bitterness. No sense of hops on the palate. If I wasn't drinking Th Julius, Green etc. along with Trillium and NEBCO on a regular basis, maybe this west coast session would resonate higher, but it doesn't."
"This would be the GF brewed version, on draft."
"Really pleasant golden orange color. Smells wonderful with citrus,pine and tropical fruit notes. Tastes follow with a really big hop flavor that just explodes on the palate. Alpine always is on point with their hoppy beers. Really flavorful for 5.25%."
"Really well made beer, great robust hop aroma. West coast all the way. Love the depth of flavor here, the hops are a heavy hitter with a decent malt presence. Punchy hops all the way through. This is post Green Flash and damn good."
"Not bad, pretty tasty. Slightly fruity, mainly bitter. Light. Sort of like a really good Session IPA, if that makes any sense. Not usually a fan of Session IPA's, but this is good."
"Golden color , substantial clarity to it, 1/2"" white head. Plenty of aromatics, not over the top like some of the other bigger ipas from Alpine, but this is the session. . . "
looks just ok. nose is very faint floral and head is minimal. not much on the front end of the palate but mouthfeel is nice and by the mid to end palate the flavor really comes through. nice blended hop flavors and very easy drinking. this beer is more than a session and to me doesn't have that watered down session flavor. nice finish makes this beer very good but not as good as alpines other beers imo.
"Mostly floral hops on the nose, though the aroma was fairly faint to me. This was a pretty pedestrian session IPA, mostly citrus notes (grapefruit rind, orange) but watered down for the most part to make it easy-drinking. Fine for what it is"
For the style.
Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass bottled on 1/27/16. Pours a beautiful light orange with a nice 2 inch sticky white head that leaves behind some nice lace.
Pours a crystal clear golden straw color with a short airy khaki colored head that quickly settles into a small ring. 
"Big citrus, and grapefruit in the aroma and taste. Some pineapple comes in the taste."
"this is a very tasty Hoppy Pale ale, I did not get to try this before the Green Flash acquisition so I wonder how much the recipe has changed, but this has a lot of hop flavor and bitterness for a beer of only 5.25% very fresh tasting with almost no malt in the taste, excellent drinkability"
"As a session IPA the alcohol level is borderline, typically I look for 5% or less. That said, this beer is just a touch over that and as an IPA it is quite delicious. More resinous and hoppy than I was expecting but pleasantly bitter in the finish and imminently drinkable. "
"From a growler, pours a clear honey-gold with a 1.5-finger buff-colored head. Fair amount of lacing. Looks quite good. Smell is primarily an earthy, oniony dankness mixed with grapefruit and pine. Underneath that is sweet oranges and subtle lemons. "
"I noticed that a lot of the reviewers mention citrus and tropical fruit when tasting this beer - I am not sure how they getting this from Hoppy Birthday. In my opinion the hops are overbearing. This beer is very one dimensional, all hop no malt backbone. So if you really love super bitter unbalanced hoppy beer you won't be disappointed with this one."
"Best by date of July 12, 2016"
"BBD 7/12/16. Pours a clear copper. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention. "
"Appearance is a very pretty golden amber, white fluffy head that lasts, and nice lacing."
"12 oz bottle, best before June 10, 2016."
Pours a light copper color with about a half finger of head. The nose is really nice and hoppy. The flavor is very hop forward but weak on the malt end.
Exceptional session IPA. One of the best I've had.
"Poured from a bomber ""best by 27 Jul 16"" into nonic."
"Unfortunately, had right after a Second Fiddle."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Best before 03 Jun 16 printed on the label. Pours a beautiful honey gold with a translucent clarity and loose, half inch, off-white had that quickly loses half its volume within seconds off the pour and disperses into a consistent skim that coalesces around the shoulders. Nose is subdued yet bright - floral, citrus and piney hops express themselves, as well as crackery notes. Taste consistent with nose; however, hops character is a bit muddled and there's also a trace of caramel malt in the mix. Finishes with a medicinal bitterness that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a crisp carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer although a bit maltier then I anticipated. The flavor profile, however, doesn't work for me."
"This is a delightful citra hop. Decently piney, it has a sour mix of lemon and orange, and a lager/pilsner like body. Very easy going, yet satisfying if you're crazing an IPA."
"Pours gold with one finger of white head that leaves very little lace. Smell is citrus rind, light resiny hops, and raw biscuit dough / wet socks. Taste has a bit of cracker malt. Feel is light - even though this is a ""session"" IPA, at 5.25%, this still seems thin."
"Our first Alpine Beer - now in MN! A pale orange typical of the west coat IPA, with a bit of head and light lacing. A piney hop aroma comes up with some light floaral background. Not too much, but a good omen. Taste is hop forward, not as intense as a full-on IPA but can hold its own with many. Lingering bitterness and light aftertaste, light and enjoyable carbonation. Of all the sessionable IPAs out there, this stands out from the crowd. Very nice. The remaining four of the six pack are now destined to be consumed next Sunday for the Super Bowl."
Best by July 2016.
"great drinkable sessionable yet flavorful ipa. big pine and citrus notes, little tropical as well. dry finish, yet crisp and juicy. well rounded. would definitely get again."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Purchased in Providence, RI."
"L: beautiful gold color, with a thin white head "
Deep golden color like that of a dehydrated piss. Amazingly brite. Not even a single drop of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Not a terribly floral hoppy scent. It was there when I opened the bottle but dissipated quickly. Taste is really something else. Very unique. Like a tadty roasty oaty grilled coffee-marinaded brisket. Except its hoppy. Somewhat bitter. Shitty feel. Like thick air. Overall a tastytreat. Will buy again.
"Nice and brigh visually. Floral and earthy hops on the nose. Overly bitter on the palate. Thin mouth, not oily or gushed. Not something I'd come back to time and time again, but happy I got to try it. A bt expensive at $12.99 a six or $2.99 per bottle at my bottle shop. "
"Poured into a tulip, it is a deep golden amber with a nice cap of off white head that leaves tight sticky lacing in big quantities. The aroma is primarily pine hops with subtle amounts of caramel malt and citrus hops. The taste is much the same but a little lacking in depth. The body has a nice weight and is mostly smooth throughout with just a little hops bite on the finish."
"Smell is huge citrus and pine, mandarin oranges, a little bit of caramel malt, and floral aroma."
12 oz bottle was poured into a pint glass. 
"Hazed orange colour, ring of white head and slight lace. Smell is full of citrus and pine, some dank/earthy hops, tons of grapefruit and pineapple. Taste s hoppy, stays mildly bitter all the way through, big dank and tropical flavours. Light carbonation, medium-light body. Very good stuff here, I could see this being a staple fridge beer if it were available in my area."
"Bottle poured into a snifter. Seeing ""Green Flash"" on the bottle seems wrong to me in some way. Best by April '16."
Look - A light golden color. Semi hazed 
"A: Pale yellow, with a touch on tangerine. A very full white head on top, that develops a few craters, but seems to have some real staying power. "
"Poured from a bottle. Pours a hazy, bright yellow-gold with a densely bubbly cream colored head. Aromas of citrus and pine with a hint of spice. Flavor much the same with some grapefruit, some noticeable malt notes, and a little mild, lingering bitterness. The flavors are stronger than expected and very well balanced. Smooth, medium mouth feel with some dense carbonation that almost gives it a textured feel. Overall, an excellent session IPA. Lots of flavor, and the flavors work together well. I might start keeping this on hand somewhat regularly."
"Poured into a glass. Golden color. Pine taste. Hops are definitely the feature, but not overwhelming. Hint of blueberry. Very smooth, simple (in a good way) taste."
Bomber poured into a stange
"Had this on 2016-01-16 in Lancaster, PA at The Fridge"
"Clear golden sunburnt, two finger white head. Piney hops good bitterness. Quite a dank brew, not bad"
"A - This is an exceptional looking beer. Clear, golden orange body, a full but not ridiculous head that fades to a thin cap of white. Lacing stands out here, with lots of beautiful tiny bubbles. What you want an IPA to look like (and it is called a session IPA)."
12oz bottle poured into a goblet. Minimal to no head. Slight Hazy appearance. Good pine and citrus notes. Clean crisp finish
12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.
A: Pours a golden orange color with a fingers worth of head that fades down to a thing ring of lace around the glass
"Color is a clear dark orange color with a thin white head that leaves a bit of lace around the edge. Smell is of citrus grapefruit some pine and light caramel. Taste is similar to the smell with grapefruit, pine, citrus, and light caramel. Medium body, crisp carbonation. Overall a very good IPA, maybe a little bitter for a session beer for me, but overall very good."
12oz bottle dated best before 04 June 2016. Into a Lost Abbey tumbler. It's kind of strange to see this beer available on shelves in my region now. 
"A best by date of 18 MAR 16, I'm guessing a batch code of F15282 poured into a 13oz. snifter. "
Very happy to find some Alpine brews in my local beer store.
"Just a bit odd that BA has this listed as a Pale Ale, as the bottle clearly lists it as a session IPA. First smell is of hops and citrus, and the taste follows. Nice balance of hop and malt, with the hips and juiciness more pronounced. Nice color and head has good lacing. My bottle says brewed and bottled by Alpine, not by Green Flash. Good stuff - a really solid IPA."
"22 oz bomber poured into a lagunitas glass.Smell is hops,grapefruit and a little orange.Taste is citrus and very hoppy.I have to say I like this very much.I think its pretty good.I would buy it again.Only thing I would do is raise the ABV."
"Clear orange-gold with a finger-and-a-half of bright white head, and great lacing. Relatively restrained pine and orange aroma. Mild bitterness and a hint of orange up front in the taste, a pretty hollow middle and a bitter aftertaste. Light, but prickly mouthfeel. I don't know if I've explored the whole ""session IPA"" subcategory enough to stack it against other session IPAs. As an IPA or an APA, it has a nice fresh hop bitterness and is definitely refreshing, but little else going for it. Fairly boring in comparison to other hoppy beers at the same price point, IMO. Maybe if it were priced as a session beer I'd feel differently."
"This deep gold low-ABV IPA is effervescent and very slightly hazy; its brief-lived medium ivory-colored head leaves fair bands and splotches of lacing. The nose is medium-big: a delicious blend of candy-like spicy florals, green pine and grapefruit. The palate leads with bitter pine and hints of soap; mid-palate the citrus emerges, along with hints of bittersweet nuttiness and a bit of bready malt. The finish is nutty and medium dry, and is followed by the onset of a grassy/piney bitterness that is quite creditable for a session IPA; it sticks around for more than a few minutes as well. The mouthfeel is biggish for the light body, and not watery in the least, and the texture is medium-creamy and moderately peppery from the well-expressed carbonation. Between the malt presence and the mouthfeel, Hoppy Birthday shows itself to be a well-crafted session IPA that does not have any of the weaknesses typical of its breed. (22 oz bottle, 140 days before best-by)"
"22oz bottle in a nonic. The ""best by"" date was 3/18/16 and I've had it for about 2 months so let's get to it."
"The beer says best by June 10th, 2016, which is maddening considering it is December. This is a 12 ounce bottle, bottled and brewed by Green Flash"
This was poured from a bomber marked Green Flash into my snifter glass. It poured a lighter yellowish orange color. There are some nice hop aromas in the nose some tropical fruits and a hint of pine. The taste was a little better than average for a session IPA with some good bitterness. The mouthfeel was average. This is a good session IPA.
"Maybe it is just me but I just do not get the high ratings for Alpine beers. This is a good beer but certainly not something I would seek out over many others. Typical hop profile, decent malt backbone and flavor. Like Duet and Nelson, I wouldn't seek out or be bothered if I never had again. So many others that are much better."
"12 oz bottle, best by June 9, 2016. "
"Bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Light golden on the pour, and settles a vibrant, medium golden in the glass. Great carbonation, great clarity, and topped off with about a finger of white, sticky foam. Modest aroma of light tropical fruit, dank pine, hops, and some light biscuity malt. The taste follows right along. This beer has some fruity highlights, but overall is more dank and pine/hop forward. A little onion on the taste as it warmed up. Very easy drinking, albeit a little more watery than I was hoping for. Still a great sessionable IPA."
"Best by 6/4/16. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours golden with a white head that fades and leaves nice retention and lacing. The aromas are very nice. Lots of ripe peach and mango. Some garlic and onion in the mix. Bready malts are there, but the hops shine. The flavors are sharp and clean. It has a very clean bitterness. Lots of fresh pine needles. Lots of grapefruit. More peach. Some lemon and lime zest in the mix. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is nice. It's light, but has a body to it. It's not thin and has active carbonation. Smooth and refreshing."
Does not live up to the hype at all. Green Flash has let you down.
"A: Golden honey like in color, clear with a thin head."
Consumed 12/21/15
Pours a clear copper orange with light head and light lacing. Smells of floral and piney hops. Citrus hops dominate beginning to end. Bitter throughout. Light mouthfeel and carbonation. Decent tasting lighter ipa
"Dull orange with a big white head and tons of lacing. Big hoppy nose. Notes of light pine, dank, light floral hop, grapefruit, and citrus piths. Medium feel, great body for the abv, lingering bitter finish and slightly dry. Really nice pale ale with an amazing level of hoppiness. More pale ale than session ale, in all fairness."
22 oz capped bottle poured into a stemmed tulip style glass.
"Clear copper in color. Big soapy white head that rapidly recedes into a thin film. Aroma is faint citrus and mango, strong pine, a bit astringent. Flavor is some malt up front with a bitter citrus pine finish. Overly bitter and thin. 5.25% is not session strength. A fine beer, but there are better actually session strength hop forward beers out there."
"This is my favorite offering from Alpine Brewing! Very drinkable session IPA with great flavor behind it. As the name gives away, this beer is heavy on the hops for a session ale and the aroma and flavor of the beer are smooth and delicious. Pours a golden color and has a nice head and lacing retention on the glass. This is a great beer for summer since its lighter and so drinkable but I like it any time of the year for just a refreshing, hoppy, smooth, west coast style Session."
Best by date of April 2015. Trying it in December 2015. Doh!
"On draft at meadhall in Boston. This beer has to be a shadow of its former self. Nice up front I guess, hop forward, but aftertaste very offputting and sharp. Aftertaste wore me down."
"Pours a clear amber, big off-white soapy head, settles to a thin ring with some big clumps of lace on the glass. Smell: floral, pine, whiff of grapefruit and orange, note of apricot. Taste: grapefruit, pretty rindy, slightly grainy pale backing, finishing resiny with more grapefruit. Body is quite successful given the low abv and amount of hops shoved in here; does really well for a session IPA. Overall it's good and well built, though the hop profile isn't terribly exciting."
Look - dark/orange in color...clear with one finger white head...lacing is good
"Green Flash version distro'd to Florida. A pretty solid brew, a bit oniony, but nice. Happy to have this around on a regular basis."
Enjoyed a mug at Frisco. It's a delightful IPA. It's piney and bitter. A winner considering the lower ABV.
Appearance: Mildly hazy amber color with a generous-sized off white head that slowly faded. A good looking IPA.
22oz bottle into a pint glass
12 oz bottle poured into wine glass
Darker than I was expecting on the pour. Citrus on the nose and on the pallet. Also some dankness towards the end. Great to have Alpine available in MA
"Appearance: Gold, filled with particles, good head."
"Now I got that Altered Images ""Happy Birthday"" song stuck in my head, which is actually a good thing since that song kicks ass."
Poured from a 32oz. bottle into an IPA glass.
"My favorite ""session"" IPA. Very hoppy, just strong enough and refreshing. For reference, my palate, my all time is Pliny the younger, then Sculpin line, then Alpine, followed by Russian River and Stone."
"Let it be known that the Hunter digs this beer. Whether it's an APA or IPA is up for you to decide. Rusted orange when held to the light. Head retention and lacing are fair. Smells of sugared grapefruit, Wimbledon grass, spruce cones and spearmint. Taste is pretty spot on with the grapefruit, orange zest, and lemon peel. Feel is prickly, and semi-dry. Has that tongue smacking bitterness I speak of frequently. This is a nice beer, overall. I would seek this regularly if it were available to me with more regularity. I may grab another growler tomorrow. Cheers."
"22 oz. bottle, best by date March 18, 2016 printed on the label. My first beer from Alpine Beer Company, though apparently my version is brewed by Green Flash. 'Green Flash' etched into the glass bottle, though the label says brewed and bottled by Alpine Beer Company, San Diego, California."
On tap at the Main Pub in Manchester. Very enjoyable pale ale with a hoppy aroma of grapefruit and pine. Flavor follows the nose. Nice body for a pale with a some hop bitterness on the finish. Would take this over pretty much any session IPA.
This beer pours a cloudy golden color with about a two inch thick foamy head that sticks around. You immediately smell the hops and the citrus you also get a grapefruit smell. The taste is great citrus taste grapefruit and a bitter piney after taste. Light body good carbonation tingles your tongue. Overall an outstanding beer!!
"This is the beer distributed by GF, bought locally in Birmingham, AL. I have had several Alpine beers through trade and this was one of my least favorites. It was too bitter for a session IPA at least by my tastes"
Poured from 22 oz bottle dated best by 5/17/2016 into snifter. 
"A: Pours slightly hazy, more gold than orange, off-white head"
"Poured into my Marz Brewing tulip out of a 22 ounce Green Flash-imprinted bottle, Hoppy Birthday is little more one-note than I was expecting, especially given the reviews here at this forum—which is not to say that note is bad, but nonetheless a factor that keeps this Alpine issue just out of the upper echelons of IPAs (session or otherwise) for my tastes. "
A new birthday tradition!
Bottle poured into a Green Flash Brewing Co pint glass

"Oh the hops. That is pretty good. So smooth. Best by 4/16. A little bitter, but definitely good"
I've had this on tap at the Jersey City Barcade and am having an imperial pint bottle now.
"Pours a hazy honey-straw color with a half-finger off white head with good retention. Nose is hops with sweet citrus fruits - tangerine most strongly. Dry, hop-forward palate, with pine notes most prominently emerging, accompanied by a mild malt undertone. Light carbonation lends an almost creamy texture to the mouthfeel. Overall, and excellent pale ale, which could just as easily pass for an IPA with its bold hop character."
Decent but nothing special IMO
A fairly average session IPA. Big bitter pine and citrus with no sweetness whatsoever. The brightness of the hop presence really faded after a few sips as well.
"Had on 11/25 at Cask Republic in New Haven. Pours a slightly hazy ruby color with some amber notes, decent head leaves minimal lacing. Smell is pretty hoppy initially, some nice fruit and resin there. Body is a bit different, there's a big caramel sweetness to it, very similar to a light bodied amber ale. Beer is hoppy and juicy at first but quickly gets beat by the malt as the beer warms. Hints of mint and pine near the back end. Overall a nice Pale Ale but wasn't expecting so much sweetness. In the end I was a bit disappointed with it."
"A 22oz bomber with a drink by date of March, 2016"
A: Pours a clear medium honey orange in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass and faint brassy + golden yellow + amber highlights. The beer has a two finger tall sudsy foamy off-white head that reduces to a medium to large sized patch of thin film surrounded by a very thin film covering the majority of the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate to significant amounts of lacing are observed.
"I am lucky enough to get one of these fresh in NC. It was brewed at the green flash brewery, or at least it is in a green flash bottle. Excellent look, one of the best smelling beers I've had in a little while with a taste that backs it up. Do not pass on this!"
"Good, not great APA. Was excited to finally see it on tap, but was somewhat let down. Nice and crisp, with a pleasant piney bitterness, but seemed to be lacking any kind of depth in the flavor profile. Definitely wouldn't turn one down, but wouldn't seek it out either."
"Four Alpine beers have recently hit Atlanta and this one and Nelson are my favorites. This one's a very hop forward beer with a solid medium body. One of the best ""session"" beers I've ever had, though 5.25% ABV isn't *that* low. One of those beers that is best from mid-palate to the finish. Love how those hops continue to tickle the tongue long after the sip. Fantastic."
"A: Poured a light golden color, not quite clear. Smallish white head with pretty good lacing."
"Clear golden-orange body with a thin, but creamy fringe of froth. Beautiful!"
Good for a session. 4.1
"Hazy pale orange with a one finger white head, with nice retention and lacing. The aroma has grapefruit, pine, and citrus zest."
Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a nonic glass. An almost clear orange color with a slight haziness. Smell was nice but standard for the beer type. I especially like the subtle not over the top hoppy/bitterness taste.
"Tap at River Room. A nice rich golden body with creamy head. Initial blast of hops on the nose, taste follows with crisp, sharp hop bitterness. One of the hoppier APAs, but very tasty."
"Pours honey colored with 2 fingers of than head. Never quite drops bright, great head retention & lacing"
Clear amber colored beer with a medium sized white colored head.
A: poured into a pint glass to a light gold topped by a dense one finger head that retains well and leaves decent lacing
One week old. The beer has a clear orange color. The aroma is citrus and pine. The taste is masked by resiny bitterness and malt. Tastes like an old IPA despite being super fresh
Best By: 20 APR 16
"Clear coppery orange colored beer under a soapy bubbly pile of head. Aroma is soft and fluffy floral hops, spicy, piney, and fluffy biscuits. Taste is bright and festively hopped. Bitterness lingers around evenly across the board. Rindy grapefruit, sticky pine needles, and a subtle candy lime."
Green Flash Bomber. Best by 3/18/16. Guessing that means it’s a month old. Just showed up in Chicago 4 days ago. So decently fresh. Pour is golden orange. Aroma is hops. Not hoppy. Straight hops. On the super dank pine end of the spectrum. Taste is intensely bitter hops. It really tastes like licking the inside of a picked off the vine fresh hops. A lupulin smoothie. Completely out of balance and lacking any malt. Too much hops for such a light beer. This thing is a damn lupulin smoothie.
"Another fantastic offering from Alpine. This one doesn't have as much fruity hop notes on the nose as some of their other offerings, but this one is extremely easy to drink. I could put down like 10 on these on a hot day."
I only can think I had a bad pour. It was butter all the way. Awful.
"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/18/2016. Green Flash bottling. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep golden yellow color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, light honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, light honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, mango, lemon/orange peel, pine, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero bitter astringency after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, and resinous/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5.25%. Overall this is an awesome pale ale style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
A - Pours a hazy golden orange with a two-finger white foamy head. Decent amount of spotty lacing.
Crystal clear deep golden color with a bright white head that leaves good lacing. The smell is pine mostly with some citrus and malt sweetness. Nice citrusy taste with a balanced sweetness and a bitter piney finish. Another well made beer from Alpine.
Golden in color with a 1 finger head. Citrusy nose with some sweetness. Great balance of malt and hops with some extended bitterness on the finish. Light mouthfeel for the level of sweet and not overly sweet. I can see why this beer is so well loved.
A: This poured a clear gold with moderate white head.
Best By 4/19/16. Assuming a six month spread after bottling (a very high estimate for the preservation of hop flavor) this one is three weeks old.
22 oz. bottle poured into a Founders snifter. Best by date 3/18/16. Green Flash produced.
22oz Bomber
"Green Flash bottled version. Clear orange color with slightly off-white head. Aroma is really intense for such a low ABV beer. Definitely west coast style hop profile with lots of pine, grapefruit and herbal / woody notes. Starts bitter up-front and gets even more bitter towards the finish and lingers in the aftertaste. Slight malt, but mainly it's just about the hops. Grapefruit and orange pith come to mind, with the same abrasive, harsh bitterness. Body is medium with good carbonation. Overall this is a well made beer but doesn't really stand up with anything. Classic hop profile and a lot of bitterness, which lowers the drinkability factor for me."
"22oz bottle. Pours a hazy golden amber color with very little head. Lots of lacing. Hoppy aroma of citrus, pine and floral hops. Slightly sweet. The taste is bitter piney and resinous hops. Floral and grassy hops towards the end with some light caramel malts. Bitter piney and resinous hop finish. Very bitter brew with a light mouthfeel but very, very dry. Very little alcohol presence but the super bitterness makes it not overly sessionable. Still it works very well. Overall, great hoppy brew as advertised."
"Looks the part, with a huge but slightly forced white frothy head that leaves behind a sticky lacing. Crystal clear light orange appearance. "
"This is Green Flash's version. Poured out of a bottle with a Green Flash logo on the actual bottle, but Alpine on the label."
Had on tap at Headkeepers in Greensburg pa. Very underwhelming. Some pine and floral notes. No citrus and hops were somewhat muted in the nose. Taste had moderate bitter finish as well. Was hoping for more.
green flash brewed version i think. meh
"Pours a mostly clear golden color with white head. Pine, citrus, and resin on the nose; follows onto the palate. Light bodied. Finishes with a floral hop note."
"I've had this on tap back in the days when it was only Alpine and not done on Green Flash premises nor in a Green Flash bottle. But I do like that Alpine is starting to get around. The trio that is making the rounds consists of Duet, Nelson, Hoppy Birthday. If you haven't seen them yet, they'll be around soon enough."
poured from Green Flash bomber into an IPA glass. 
"Pours a crystal clear bright orange with a fluffy white head. The nose is dank, fruity and has a good malt presence that comes through as biscuits. The taste starts out very malty, with decent citrus and pine coming through, but nothing really jumps out as the dominant flavor. Overall, it's a very drinkable good beer but not something that blows me away."
"Hoppy Birthday is labeled as a ""Session India Pale Ale"", although the alcohol content is on the high end of what most consider a session ale at 5.25%. The beer pours a deep gold color with plenty of foam retention. Made with six different hops and registering at 69 IBUs, the beer smells and tastes exactly how you would expect a beer made with that many hop strains to. There are grapefruit, mango, and floral aromas. Notably, a pine taste pervades the palate toward the end of the sip, and lingers on a bit afterward. This pine linger is by no means a undesirable characteristic, but full of flavor, and complements the front hop flavors nicely. Hoppy Birthday finishes dry and is well-balanced."
"First smell was citrus and pine. Easily drinkable and makes for one of the better options with low ABV pale ales. Doesn't sacrifice taste for lower ABV like many other ""session"" pale ales out there. Comparable to firestone walker's easy jack"
"Description: Golden color with white head and lacing. This is a really effervescent beer with a balance aroma of pine, fruit and floral. Taste was similar to the smell with an added bit of dankness before a bitter finish that lingered on the tongue a bit; not the clean, dry finish of some IPAs. The feel was quite carbonated although that feel quickly dissipates. As can expected from a session ale, alcohol wasn't really noticeable."
22 oz. bottle - Best by 18 March 16:
Yeah. I could totally get used to this one.
Bottle from Colonial Spirits.
Green Flash bottle.
"Green Flash bottle, but brewed and bottled by Alpine with a best before March 18, 2016. Clear, light amber body with a snowy white head. Pleasant aroma with lots of citrus, canned peaches, mango, blueberry, papaya, white grape comes in faintly, pale crackery malt, and some pineapple. In the flavor, you get hit with bitterness followed by a dry biscuity sweetness. Grapefruit rind, pine, tropical juice, mango fruit leather, orange pith, lemon zest, and lots of resin bitterness. This is a session IPA with full flavor and a nice slap of bitterness."
"Don't get the hype. Drinkable, but not great."
Low ABV but nice smoothness with some bitter complexity
Poured from a Green Flash emblazoned bottle into a standard pint glass. Best by 3/15/16
"Great beer. Not exactly like I remembered from the Alpine Brewery Taproom, but a beautiful beer. Nice and clear with good head retention especially for a session IPA. Smell was tropical with citrus peel. Nice bitter piney finish more than over the top tropical. Solid."
In review is the Alpine version of this beer.
"A pretty decent looking glass of beer comes out of a 22 ounce bomber from the guys at Alpine; great color, smaller but decent head, not much if any lacing to speak of left behind. A pretty good taste but it seems to one dimensional leaning towards the grapefruity citrus, without much else going on. If that's what you want you'll love Hoppy Birthday."
Poured from 22oz bomber into a dimpled mug.
Picked up a bomber at TW Arrowhead last weekend for $7.99. Best by 3/18/16. Brewed and bottled by Green Flash.
"Hoppy Birthday was a copper color with a good sized head. Nice fresh floral aroma. The taste was rather balanced, but strong, big malty backbone, with a good fresh hoppy flavor. Overall its a very solid APA."
"We open a bomber, pouring into our Great Lakes pint glasses. It lights the room with a coppery, amber coloring that supports a sturdy two finger head of bubbling, creamy headiness the color of pancake batter. This retains well, leaving vertical chains of lacing in its wake. No haze or sediment is noted, and carbonation appears to be on the active side. The aroma is whopping, comprising notes of heavily tropical and nectary fruity hoppiness, lighter citric hop oil brushes, sugar loaded pineapple juice, lightly toasted and biscuity pale malts, very faint caramel graininess, dried papaya cubes, green bananas, tangerine flesh, freshly whipped buttercream, fresh honeycomb, bubblegum sugars, simple booziness, and bronze button metallics. The flavoring swirls with toasty pale grainy grit and dryness, gentle booziness, bright citric and piney hop zings, mineral clay, dusty ale yeastiness, freshly liberated tangerine juice, earthen tree barkiness and oiled wet mossiness, toasted honey sweetness, green bell pepper juice, kiwi skins, and the chemical sting of perfume. There is bright lingering bitterness of bitter citric and soapy hops, orange peel pith, unsweetened wafer cookies, and Irish soda bread. The body is full and the carbonation is medium, with decent prickle to the tongue. Each sip gives wonderful slurp and smack, with immense frothiness and creaminess as it crashes into each crevice of your oral cavity. It sloshes around like a syrup, but a syrup that has been aerated and infused to the brim with the softest bubbles. Somewhat like nitro, but yet simultaneously not at all. It makes your mouth water and sweat, but with sticky, binding drops of saliva. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks away easily, in large gulps if you allow it to."
"500ml bottle, best by March 18, 2016, Alpine Label in a Green Flash bottle, poured into an Alpine Beer Co. pint glass."
"L - copper, slight haze, head mostly dissipates"
Appearance - The beer was copper in color with a fluffy white head. Carbonation bubbles were apparent. 
22 oz bottle. Pours clear copper gold with a big frothy white head that retains well and leaves some lacing.
Alpine Hoppy Birthday
22oz (best by 3/18/2016) into a tulip. Pours a hazy strwaw w/ a soft white head.
On Tap
"On tap at Smoke & Barrel, Washington, DC. In a large stemmed tulip"
"Gorgeous color and a massive, bright white, frothy head. Nose is off-the-scale. Huge tropical fruit and juicy, resiny hops. It's lovely! Flavor is the same. So hoppy yet not really a hop-bomb, in my opinion. Nearly perfect balance with complex character. Regardless of the the hop profile, it's just wonderfully drinkable. Feel is smooth and delicious with every sip. Not overbearing like some hoppy brews can be. This is beyond world class from Alpine. I never found it while I was in college in Arizona but now that Green Flash is involved, this is available in Massachusetts! Hell yeah!"
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bottle on October 16, 2015. Bottle labeled best by 18 Mar 16."
"L - Glowing orange, mostly transparent. A finger of white head."
pours orange with a thick white head.
Pours a golden color with a light haze. Has a piney aroma. Flavor is bitter hops with a pine and herbal / musty hop profile. Has a clean and crisp finish. Very solid overall but drinks more like a pale ale than an IPA
L: Gold with slight haziness. Foamy white head dissipated quickly leaving a little lace
"The beer pours golden, with ruby tones, with a thick cream colored head; very visually appealing. Very strong smell; candied citrus and pine dominate, with floral undertones. The taste is reminiscent of the smell, powerful citrus and pine, however, in my opinion it may be just a bit too powerful, it reminds me of eating a hop pellet, albeit not quite as strong. The mouthfeel is solid for the style, finishes fairly dry while still having a juicy body. Overall this was a good beer, very appealing to sense of smell and sight; while the taste was good I honestly think if I picked up another one, I would drink it about two or three weeks from now to see if the hop pellet flavor fades with time."
Draft. Golden yellow orange with a layer of off white head. Smells of hops and citrus. First sip is a little better but it cleans up quickly and finishes quickly. Little hoppy bite on the back end. Tasty and drinakble. Good ipa.
Pours a clear golden color with a frothy white head that leaves chunks of lacing.
"Aroma is dank hops, spices and very light citrus/fruit. The flavor is hops, citrus/fruit, malts and a mix of dry, bitter and surprisingly smooth in the finish."
Green Flash bottle. Best by 3/18/16. So probably 9/18 bottling date?
"Bright golden orange, clear, and billowing white head with great retention. "
"Pint bottle. Pours bright orange, slight haze, head doesn't last but lots of lace. Citrusy aroma, orange and grapefruit, sweet mango. Great tasting west coast IPA. Grapefruit peel is prominent with some pine and floral notes on the edges. Overall hop flavor has a dank weediness to it that lasts through the sip. Just enough malt to impart a touch of sweet in there. Light body but slick with a semi dry finish. Overall this one has got to be the best low abv IPA I've had."
Bottle poured into a tulip glass
"L: an orange/yellow color, with a nice white head that stuck around for a while"
Poured from the tap to chalice glass with a bright setting sun glow of orange and off white yellow hues. Very hop forward as the name would suggest for an American pale ale with a very floral citrus smell. Taste was more balanced but with a heavy bitter after taste for an APA.
"This beer pours a beautiful bright golden orange color with a huge pillowy white head. The nose on this is about as good as they come. Huge juicy notes of tropical fruit, most notably grapefruit and mango take center stage accompanied by a good deal of dankness and pine. Taste is the same, tropical and juicy at first with a bitter pine finish. Feel is medium amd resinous with a good amount of carbonation. Overall this beer is fantastic, and to my suprise I like it even more than Duet!"
"Had this beer up at the Cloverleaf recently since it was on their PhD list for the fall. I hadn't hear of this brewery before but after having this, it's easy to see how this would be one of the ""gold standards"" for IPA's from the other side of the country. So easy to drink and so balanced, the quality of this was along the lines of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale in quite a few ways!"
Served from GF bottle. This is bitter enough to be more of an IPA than it is an APA. Very much a West coast style hoppy beer as it is overly bitter compared to what I have become accustomed to with a good APA.
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a chalice.
Pours a slightly amber golden yellow with a large two finger head of sturdy froth.
"The nose on this beer is exceptional. Juicy fruits and citrus all in your face, so amazing. The taste is lightly sweet, nice bit of pine, with a light bit of mango and peach, before a nice bit of dank piney finish that lasts in your mouth. Just a great beer, could only imagine what the true alpine iteration would taste like."
poured a 22oz into snifter. GF version Best by date 3/18/16.
"Poured a lighter orange tinged golden with a half finger white head atop.Tropical fruits and mown grass really stand out in the nose,the hops really jump out at ya.For a ""smaller"" beer the hop profile is fantastic,tropical fruits,grass,even a bit of sweet onion,not much bitterness but it's there in the finish.I could drink this all day,a hophead's ""session"" ale even at 5.25%."
"Green flash bottle. Amber-gold (a bit light), very light haze, sticky looking 1.5 fingers of head. Citrus and piney hops on the nose. Plenty on the tongue as well. Some light sweet malts coming through and maybe a touch of honey. Great stuff, especially considering it says ""session"" right on the label."
"L: Clear, very pale , no gold or amber hues, bone white fluffy head"
"A crisp, zesty nose features a nice combination of citrus and floral bouquets. On the tongue is a mild, pithy bitterness perched atop a modest malt backbone. This one is content to vacillate from fruity to grassy to herbal, and I'm OK with that. Solid beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Green Flash bottle, best by March 18th 2016."
"Pours a Carmel orange with a one finger tan head. A little lacing. Some carbonation also. The perfect citrus hoppy smell. Crisp, clean citrus burst with the great bitter hoppyness backing. The funk comes out a little more than expected for an Apa. My first Alpine Beer makes me understand hy all the hype."
"Beautiful clear golden orange color. Piney, resinous, and spicy hops jump out of the glass. Sweet malt backs it up. So much flavor and body for 5.25%. Reminds me of Zombie Dust."
A very very good IPA. Not as many fruit or citrusy notes as say a typical west coast style. Lingering hop notes on the finish and after.
"The nose on this beer is ridiculously good. For a 5.25% ABV, this beer packs a bucket-load of hops. I smell pine, I smell citrus, and then I need to take a sip. Would definitely buy again if I can find it in Milwaukee."
Classic golden ipa color.
Poured from a 22oz. Bomber.
"Amazing golden-orange in color with a finger and a half of very frothy white head an sticky, spotty lacing. Aroma is dank with lots of pine, citrus rind, pineapple, nectarine and peach. Taste is bold with pine resin, oranges, bitter pineapple, stone fruits an other assorted fresh citrus. Mouthfeel is good, with the citrus, citrus peel and massive amount of hops balancing very well. Finish is strong, slightly bitter, and definitely reminds you again about the large mount of hops present..."
Pours a finger and a half of head on a hazy straw body.
"Poured out of a growler. This is a very assertive and flavorful ""session"" IPA! I love the bitterness that is almost astringent but has a fresh, citrusy, piney, and toasty flavor that makes it very drinkable. The mouthfeel is clean with tight carbonation. It has a super clean bitter finish that refreshes the palate and begs for more. A great session IPA. Another great recommendation from CW at City Growler!"
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, bright, golden orange coloring with a flurry of carbonation in the body and a fluffy, low profile, off-white head. Aromas of wet, dank hops resin forward, with notes of pine, wet grass, grapefruit, lemon zest, and candi sugar. Very balanced and very hoppy nose. Flavors are very hop forward, bitter and resinous, with a solid blend of pine pitch, cannabis, and wet grass. The hoppy notes are balanced by a sweet and tart blend of citrus fruit, heavy on grapefruit and orange, with candi sugar highlights. Smooth, bold bodied, with a solid aftertaste of hoppy, resinous notes and citrus sweetness. The finish is smooth, slick, and dry, with a hoppy linger. Amazingly balanced and damn tasty!"
"Pours a hazy shade of golden yellow topped with a creamy white head that left lacing all down the glass. The nose is vibrant and loaded with citrus, but a bit muted. The flavors are amazing, fresh resinous delicious hops with a background sweetness and black pepper. Awesome. The feel is spot on and lively to match this amazing palate."
"Got a 64oz growler of this from a gas station in Sidney, OH. Was just tapped and I will be going back tomorrow for a refill before they blow it. Looks great, smells great, taste great. Sessionable APA teater's on the IPA range. Would definitely advise to at least give it a try!"
I had the Green Flash version of this from a Crowler. Opened the same day as filled.
"I usually get this on draft but first time getting in a bottle and enjoying at home. Finally, Alpine bottles in NorCal. Best by date: 18 MAR 16F15282. What is crazy is that the label calls it a session IPA. I always known it as a pale ale."
"Poured from a slim 22 oz brown GF bottle into a clear glass tulip. Best by 18 MAR 16 on label. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA). "
The beer pours a nice white foamy head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a clear pale amber; bearing a strong resemblance to light copper. The overall appearance is fairly attractive and good-looking; giving off a nice preview of what to expect from the beer's body.
Light copper color with oodles of tiny carbonation bubbles erupting from within. A quarter inch of eggshell white rests on top. Moderate lacing. I smell light hoppy notes. There's a brief piney hop wallop. Light malt and honey notes are present in the fade. The mouth is very crisp and smooth.
On tap at Aurora Brew Works in Buffalo after Zwanze Day at the Blue Monk. 
"With a little surprise in every beer, Alpine's session IPA celebrates in a bit way- a blend of six specialty hops to give the taste a bright, juicy, citrus and tropical medley on an approachable and moderate alcohol content and body. Its a beer to enjoy specifically on a birthday, or less specifically- any day you can!"
"From a 32 oz growler ... well, actually, the entire 32 oz growler .., into a lager glass. "
On tap at Pinocchio's.
Holy crap this is some good beer.
"Pours a translucent golden color with a very thick amount of head that leaves some nice lacing. Smells amazing, by far my favorite part of the beer; smells piney and citrusy, just overall fresh. Taste is somewhat disappointing... the dry-hopped aspect of it takes over and creates a very bitter (but nonetheless full of flavor) pale ale. Probably the most taste I've ever had packed into a pale ale... Feel is nice and smooth, slightly creamy, very dry. Overall... well done, I think it's just not my cup of tea. I seem to be in the minority in the overall rating of this beer, I respect it, just don't love it."
"Damn, this beer is absolutely beautiful. It smells so damn crisp and piny, too. Altogether, no single element seems fantastic, but it features amazing integration and refinement. Tasting it...yep, I'm right. This beer is loaded with pine and resin, yet it finishes so dry and mellow. This tastes 7%, but it feels like 5%. My only niggle is that there's no citrus flavor whatsoever - it's all pine, flowers, and bitter. And I don't care. The mouthfeel is perfect: it's somehow full bodied yet light on its feet. Now this is a session beer! (so what if it's over 5%?) It's the best showcase of Columbus hops I've ever had, by far."
"This beer is amazing. Simply amazing. Had it on tap at buckeye bar on Kelleys island oh. This is pretty much a perfect pale ale. Hell, it's a perfect IPA too. If this was available locally, it would be a staple in my fridge. Simply outstanding. Never had old alpine stuff, but not sure how this could have been better."
Smells like heaven. 60 IBU bitterness. Refreshing. Moderately strong. A GREAT beer. 
Appearance - Golden yellow hue.
Hazy golden wheat with little to no head.
"On tap. Thin white head with good retention and lacing. Clear light golden color. Nose is subtle cirtus hops. Taste is bready, slightly bitter, non-descript hops, pretty good balance. A bit thin mouthfeel but within expectations for the style. "
"Had on tap; really nice APA/IPA. Crisp, hop-forward but not overpowering. Easily drinkable. Smells fantastic; citrus and pine. A rare beer, and I'm glad I tried it."
"Pours a light golden with 1 inch foamy head, leaves terrific lacing on the glass."
Hoppy. No hint of underlying sweetness bullshit to appeal to the ketchup suckers.
High hopes for this based on the ratings over time. 
"From tap, pours a hazy golden with a thick, frothy white head that turns into plenty of lace. Aroma is pine initially, but citrus emerges as well. Flavor follows the aroma, but pineapple is included as well and there's a general fruity sweetness as well. It's not specific to any fruit, but balances the beer well. This is bitter, but not overwhelmingly so if you like IPAs. The fruitiness helps keep the bitter from destroying your palate, and as bitter as it was, I was surprised not to note any resiny film in my mouth. It was light, crisp, very refreshing, and at the ABV, something I could drink all day long."
On tap in Chicago
On draft at prison hill brewery in Yuma. This is a great beer
Had a growler of this one. I had not read much about the beer before I tried it and based on the taste I thought it was an imperial IPA. I was shocked to see the ABV.
"Hogwash - San Francisco, CA - draft"
"On Tap at Beer Culture. Poured a nice copper color. Nose is more on the piney side, Very hoppy for an APA with some grapefruit to go along with the pine. A bit resinous in feel for an APA."
Poured from a growler into a Surly Teku. Light golden color with pure white head. Lots of hop presence for a pale ale. Good carbonation.
"Had poured from growler into clear plastic (poolside) water cup, and then into nonic pint. On first tasting, assumed this beer to be a traditional IPA, but pleased to learn it is actually a very sessionable hoppy APA."
Growler thanks to osnapson (Reddit).
From alpine brewery. Great smell but has a rough taste at the end
"Pours with a thick white head, color is a polished bronze, the beer is super cloudy. At first a nose of tart grapefruit dominates, and grapefruit comes through on the tongue, suppressed by strong bitterness. As the beer warmed bitterness gave way to faint red fruit, raspberries and a little strawberry. Grapefruit still dominates on the nose, and the beer is still too carbonated to crush, but a deliciously drinkable and relatively complex treat."
"Had the day before my birthday. Thanks, Alpine!"
"Pours dark golden with a white head. Smells piney. Tastes much the same, with a faint nutty maltiness way at the back. It's fairly meaty for a beer this low in alcohol. Drinkability suffers a tad from the unremitting hops, but it's a solid beer."
I thought this was an ipa or double ipa. It drinks like one flavor wise. I am having a hard time with the flavors in this beer. Piney and hop resiny. Earthy. Very happy.
On tap at Cooper's Craft (Chelsea) NYC
Got this on tap at Rays growler gallery in Wauwatosa Wi. Good beer but nothing great. Not sure if it has something to do with Green flash brewing it.
"A: The beer is relatively clear yellowish amber in color and has a slight amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a short off white head that died down, leaving lacing on the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass."
"Was surprised to find out this was actually an APA, upon first sip it had the hop overload to be an amazing IPA. Still, it was fantastic, and would easily make my top 5 pale ales."
very nice. very hop forward for such a low ABV. clean. almost refreshing.
"Tried this on draft in July 2015 at The Brass Tap in Winter Park/Orlando, FL."
From a trade friend...fresh growler from Alpine Tap takeover...smell is ridiculous! Tastes right up there with smell and has lots of citrus...little resin on finish.
"Had this out of a plastic solo cup. Really solid, those boys at Jungle Jims know how to impress. Dank bright bitterness that really made the trip around a huge grocery store that much better. They sell Ostrich eggs and their shopping carts have cup holders, cool."
"32 oz. growler poured into a snifter. Clear deep orange body. Nice white head. Grapefruit hop aroma. Caramel malt. Taste is just like the nose. Aggressive grapefruit up front. Hefty caramel malt behind it. Not sweet, more bready and toasty. Strong bitterness in the back end. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Straightforward and very tasty."
"On tap in Albany this past Saturday. I am normally much more of an imperial IPA guy, but this really was a very solid refreshing beer in every way. Great aroma, nice light floral hoppiness. Winner I would buy again with no hesitations"
Poured from a 32oz crowler bought a DeCicco's.
Serving type: 12 oz into a shaker pint.
10-24
"Not a very smooth or balanced beer. Hits with strong grapefruit flavor which almost immediately blends into an okay bitter finish/aftertaste. Definitely isn't a bad beer, but based in this one, it's certainly not something I'd search out."
A: A light brown copper with a little gold. Poured with a finger of tan head which quickly dissipated. Some nice spider web lacing. 
"Poured a clear orange body with little head and lace that sticks around. The hops are noticeable in aroma, giving off a more citric, earth tone aroma than sweet malts can poke through. Incredibly smooth are first two words that hit me as I take first sip. Smooth, slick, but not watery, a hopped up brew that straddles between citric and grapefruit/tropical fruit hops and has touches of bread/grain hops for balance (maybe caramel). Smooth, oily, buttery, you get the gist. Easy to drink and a hoppy beer that isn't overhopped or messy, a rare thing these days it seems. Very easy to drink"
"A: Poured from the growler (cost: $14.99 at Westmere) into a Piraat tulip. Body is clear, coppery-orange with a small whitish head on top, which recedes to leave decent splotches of lace."
"If you see this, drink this. At all costs"
"On draft at my local whole foods. Smells great, first sip was amazing. As it warmed perhaps not amazing, but still very good. The best from Alpine I have had, this one was draft, the others in bottles."
Had this one right at the Green Flash well. Awesome brew!
"On tap at World of Beer, Appleton. Great flavor packed into a 5.25% abv."
On tap at the Trail's End. Poured into a pint glass.
"I don't understand what beer some of those really low reviewers were drinking, but it certainly wasn't what I had. I only regret not having had more. Had on tap at Streetcar Bistro in Portland, OR on June 26th. Delicious beer, very hoppy, almost drinks like an IPA rather than a pale."
"Appearance: Crystal clear yellow, off white head with great lacing."
It is a very Hoppy Birthday!
Hoppiest APA I've ever had in my life. Super dry.
"Very unimpressed. No nose, no hops, and didn't love the malt bill."
"had it a couple weeks ago, was not blown away whatsoever.."
"Delicious big earthy and piney hops, very substantial body, resin that lingers."
"32 oz Crowler purchased at The Iron Abbey in Horsham, PA."
Pint poured in a shaker glass at Nob Hill Bar and Grill. 
"Due to the acclaim this has received, I expected more. I had this at the end of a long tasting, an this is IPA 7 for the day, so my tasters aren't at full sensitivity. However, I don't taste anything that makes this overly superior to, say, Stone Go-to IPA. I will seek this out again with a fresh palette at a later date."
"An okay APA, nothing miraculous."
A very flavorful pale.
Saw this on tap and I had to try it! My first Alpine beer and it was a good one!
"I can't believe this is a pale at 5.3%! Incredible long full finish, bitter but not to bitter but definitely a memorable hoppy finish! Delicious!!!!!"
great west coast pale here... citrus dank hoppy but very smooth
"Phinally in Philly! On tap at TRIA Taproom. I feel like it's my birthday after having this for the first time. Great IPA. Also had the Duet, but went right back to this. Hopefully more kegs on the way."
Another forced review. Overly bitter without a ton of flavor. Not pleasant.
Didn't live up to the hype. Average.
"Over-rated, as expected from Alpine IPAs"
Very hoppy with citrus overtones.
Very hoppy nose for a pale; piney. Aggressive bitternes for the style. Solid beer.
"My first Alpine brew - super hoppy, lots of dank, tropical flavors. Delicious!"
On tap at the Tap and Growler the other day.
"The look of this hopped pale is underwhelming, but the nose is exceptional. Very drinkable."
"Excellent beer, looks great, smells great, tastes great, but no head retention."
"Very mildly fogged and true amber in color. Grassy piney nose. Flavor is hoppy, of course. Earthy with grass tones. Hints of pine. It's good stuff. A bit too bridled that though. Wouldn't mind a bit more crazyness about it."
Legit.. Tropical fruity hops with a big bitterness that is unapologetic... Light pale malt.. piney hops that sometime go a bit catty Dangerously drinkable.
"Two plus fingers worth of light airy lush khaki colored froth comprised of lots and lots of big chunky bubbles... Nice retention that really begins to hold around one fingers worth... Turns a bit richer and creamier as it settles a bit... Lots of carbonation some of which clings to the glass and some of which rises sporadically at a modest to slightly quick pace... The color is a somewhat vibrant light copperish amber... A thin film and some lacing clings to the sides of the glass... The aroma is all hops all the time... Glorious hop resins... Fresh hops... Just lots and lots of hops... Mostly piney with some citrus mixed in... There is little or no malt to be found... Dank and hoppy... Lemon zest... Earthy hops... Orange zest... Piney hops... A very light biscuity malt layer is buried beneath the surface... The mouthfeel is medium bodied... Rather sturdy... Mostly dry throughout turning a bit drier on the finish... This is an outstanding American Pale Ale and a very welcome introduction to Alpine... If someone wanted to know what hops tasted like, this is the beer that I might point them to... Lots a goodness in a very subtle <6% ABV... Love it..."
"Nice flavor and color, I like it hoppier though."
"The name says it all HOPPY, its delicious"
"Big piney head, quite hoppy for a pale."
Delicious piney and fruity pale
"Served in 12oz goblet, this was a very nice beer, but not one that stood out from the field of 41 other hoppy pale ales. I will bang again, but it's not a transcendental experience."
"Solid looking draft beer (on tap at BBD's in Rocky Point, NY) with hazy dark gold color and a creamy 2 finger tan head that faded very slowly and left excellent foamy lacing and rings as it went down. "
On tap; poured into a pint glass.
I had a pint of this one from the tap at the Flying Saucer in Fort Worth. It was on the newly tapped list. 
So piney and dank an amazing American Pale Ale.
"Edit to original rating, which was on-tap. This rating is from a 500 ml bottle (best by March 18, 2016) into a tulip. The bottle is labeled Alpine, but ""Green Flash"" is molded into the glass."
"duet for me, was really worth the hype, this one was also really good, but less exceptional i think. less amazing and unique is for sure, but still a really trusty ipa, that i would happily drink all the time if it were available here. unique in that it finds the floral/pine specturm, while almost entirely skipping citrus. sure there is a hint of orange peel, even candied orange peel in the nose, but the flavor is like clover and pine forest, with no citrus in between. usually there is always that element there, but this is way cool in that its polleny and blooming, but also hearty and sappy. its balanced, but its big too, and although the hops drive the flavor, there is definitely a moderate toast to a fuller grain body, really really nice. i like this a whole lot, and amazing to have it on tap for the first time, but i just dont see it as one of the best in the world in its category. maybe i am spoiled, but for me, its a level below the hype that it comes with."
Draft at Flying Saucer
16oz nonic pint at HG.
Tried this at the Yardhouse in LA. Beer had a smokey aftertaste which was very unusual. I am not sure if something was not wrong with the beer
"McLaddens Northampton, MA. Been on draft for about two weeks. Notes taken during second time consuming it."
"Starts with nice citrus flavor, followed by earthy spice notes, a tad bit of wheat, well balanced. Can tell it is an APA as it is missing just a touch of hops in the finish. Rather crisp and dry."
"Green Flash version. The nose and flavor was more hop forward than the Duet drank side by side. More balanced, not as much bitterness. As it warmed the hope profile came through more and it became more pleasant."
"On-tap 3/8/2015 at Stevie D’s in Cumberland, RI, served in a US tumbler pint glass."
"Nice dry, bitter hop bomb. Less sweet (thankfully) than it smells. Nothing wrong with the feel, but clearly the weakest element, and given the standards set by the likes of Noble or Maine BC, subpar."
Flower Bomb
Not my type of pale. I'm used to the big citrus bombs here on the east coast and this was very piney to me. Nicely balanced but just not my flavor in terms of hops.
Been waiting a long time to try my first Alpine beer. On tap at the Ale House Amesbury and this baby didn't disappoint. More than lives up to its lofty rating. Hoping to see more of this around. Thanks Green Flash!
Very intense hop bitterness. Mostly heavy pine. I'm wondering if the GF acquisition has eliminated some of the citrus characteristics others have mentioned.
"Very nice aroma, all day pale ale, deff great summer time beer"
The beer comes in a hazy light amber.
Enjoyed at the Dive Bar in Worcester. 
"Huge pineapple and grapefruit nose with equally powerful flavor that matches the nose. So much flavor in such a modest ABV. Heavy bitter finish that matches the rest. Medium body and on the same level as ZD, Edward, etc..."
Pint from tap at Dive Bar in NYC.
Lots of tropical fruit in the smell. Super flavorful yet light and delicate. This is right up there with Nelson. This is probably the best tasting lighter alcohol beer I've ever tasted.
This pours a glowing orange tan. 
"On tap at 4th Ave Pub in Brooklyn for Alpine/Green Flash tap takeover. This has been one of my wants for a while--really happy I had the chance to try it. The nose on this beer is wonderful--hops galore, florally, tropical fruits and some grass. Taste follows the nose--fruity hop bomb that could easily be an IPA. This beer is very well done--right up there with Zombie Dust in terms of world class APAs for me!"
Thick bubbled but thin head. Plenty of blanket lace on the glass. Cloudy dark amber color. 
"On tap at The Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY."
"On draft. Yes. Have wanted this brew for ages. Poured fairly clear. Thin, white head. Mild lacing. Aroma sinks into my schnozzola and delivers bright, lively hoppiness. potent West coast pine and citrus along with some more East coast tropical fruit and juicy notes. Just a little bit of neutral maltiness but this one is clearly hop perfume. The flavor is simply so bright and lively it's such an enjoyable experience. Very complex hoppiness. No one hop descriptor dominates. Citrus, grass, pine, pineapple, some passion fruit and some mango. This one has plenty to latch on to. Finishes with a nurturing bready malt and a long lasting hoppy grass/fruit combo. Medium bitterness. Light bodied. Long aftertaste. Carbonation adds drinkability. This lived up to the hype for me. West Coast meets East Coast hop profile. One hell of a Pale Ale."
"Drank on tap at Lord Hobo, Cambridge, MA"
My favorite Alpine beer even compared to the others.
"On tap at Fireworks Pizza during the Alpine launch party. I tried to go into this tasting with an open mind, as it included Nelson and Duet and I had never tried any of these beers. Hoppy Birthday was the clear winner for me, which was quite a surprise. I'm not sure I've ever had such a full bodied, hop forward satisfying APA. This would be the Alpine beer that's in my fridge at all times if I had the option."
Amber fizzy brew with a decent foam in the pint shaker. On tap at Toma Sol in MIssion Hills. Richly hopped with a spritzy mouthfeel and friendly malty taste.
Growler
"When this is on, it's the picture of a pale ale maxed out on hops, a little savory/dank, a little tropical. I honestly can't think of many hoppier pale ales. Don't know that the GF-version is quite on point, though."
"On tap at Barrel Republic. Hazy orange in color with a white head. Smells earthy with some pine. Kinda garlicy. Taste follows the nose. Super easy to drink. Loads of dank hops, some tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is great. Really smooth and drinkable. Overall, incredible pale ale, dare I say best pale ale I've ever had."
"On tap at 38 Degrees Ale House in Alhambra, CA. Pint glass."
"Dusty with less ""hop"" than expected."
"I've been lucky enough to have a lot of great APA's - Edward, Sierra Nevada, Daisey Cutter, Alpha King, Zombie etc. This one is, in my mind, the best, especially for a good session. Incredible citrus nose, forward but not overagressive hops. I could easily drink this all day."
Tried this at on tap at City Beer Store in SF. Really sparkly hop flavor. It's like 5 different kinds of bitterness mixed together that turn into something totally different when combined.
Type: Growler
"really a nice beer, thanks ANDREW!"
Growler thanks to Tommy619!
"A very amazing IPA, I'm glad it's starting to be made more. This has a lot of flavor up front, but thanks to the low ABV, is easily drinkable. Not quite as potent as its bigger badder brother (Bad Boy), but great in its own right."
"Picked up,a bomber of this brew at the brewery in Alpine while passing through from San Diego to Yuma. Nice IPA. Great hop aroma. Nice lacing. Solid beer."
"Pours a pale gold with a small white head, good retention. Lots of citrus on the nose with mango, pineapple and apricot notes. Hop forward. Fruity on the front of the tongue followed by pine resin. Biscuity malt backbone but takes a back seat to the hops. Light bodied with light carbonation. Finishes dry. Overall possibly the best sessionable APA out there."
"I had this at congregation ale house. I've heard great things about this and it did not disappoint. I even gave some to a non-beer-enthusiast and he loved it. Sweet, malty, crisp bitter, dry, smooth, citrus, refreshing. This beer is a solid brew, if you find it. GET IT!"
Alpine Brewing Co. Hoppy Birthday APA
"I used to drink this beer back in the day when it was first released. Back then, this was cutting edge stuff. The smell is wonderful and the feel is great. With the release of so many new APAs, this definitely needs an overhaul...however, it is still in the top tier for APAs. "
"Another super-dry hop bomb from Alpine. This one low enough gravity to have 3 at a sitting. On draught at the Rose & Crown, Palo Alto. Cloudy pale orange pour with a finger of foam which persisted until first taste. Apricot nose and orange rind, no appreciable sweetness. A perfect IPA for a hot summer day."
"First time reviewing this beer. Summer 2014 in San Francisco I had what (I think) was the Alpine brewed version. From memory, it was one of the best beers of my life. Let's see how the Green Flash stacks up."
A: 4.25 Cloudy orange gold with a one inch off white head. 
Served on tap at Final Gravity Taproom. 
On tap at a pizza port. Pint.
On tap at Amazing Grapes in Rancho Santa Margarita. So excited to see this on tap outside of actually going to Alpine.
"I walked, well almost ran, to City Beer Store when I saw they had tapped this. Pours somewhat hazy golden, slightly darker than straw with a fluffy one finger white head. Aroma is well balanced though amazingly hoppy for a 5.5% pale ale. What really sets it apart here is that super fresh hop aroma that is reminiscent of very fresh Pliny. Big piney dank hops overwhelm the senses. On the palate there is big grapefruit up front that turns into lots of piney dankness. Wow, this is dank as hell for a pale and also more bitter than I expected. Similar hop profile to Duet imho, just accentuated in different ways. A delight and lives up to the high expectations. World class west coast APA."
"On tap Lowbrough sacramento, ca"
God this pale ale has to be the best in the world. Forgot zombie dust go for this! So Cal residents only though so come on down and join the fun!
"Sampled on tap at Ale Arsenal. Beautiful golden color with some haze and great lacing. Fantastic aroma with loads of tropical fruit and citrus. Flavors follows with outstanding hop complexity, moderate bitterness and a foundation of toasted malt. A creamy texture and a perfect carbonation. A flavorful and refreshing beer that's perfect for a sunny CA day."
"Poured from an Alpine growler 05/24/14 (filled the same day). Absolutely the best American Pale Ale I have had, just a perfect balance of hoppy, sweet and bitter."
"Besides the great name this beer also has an incredible taste overall. With a pour of hazy yellow and a thin head. Aromas include hops, grapefruit and orange. The carbonation is medium and the flavor is very sweet with caramels and citrus. The aftertaste has a little bitterness."
Served in the Alpine Beer pub (the closest thing I'll ever get to heaven) in a taster glass.
"Appearance: Pours a clear honey color, with 1/2"" of eggshell white head which has nice retention and lacing. Excellent looking APA."
A - Golden straw color with a long lasting head and great lacing.
"Appearance- Received with only a small amount of head, basically a sliver. I'm guessing the head was a pure cotton white. Very similar to Nelson as far as appearance goes. The body is a pale amber that looks a dull amber when held up to the light. Some lacing is left behind. "
A quick note after re-visiting this on tap here an Arizona.
Appearance: Clear golden with some haze and a small white head with delicate lacing.
"Appearance: medium sunny color, near white finger of head, nice lace."
200th Review!!
"Artfully capped growler kept the carbonation just right until I was able to share with my neighbor.Pale straw color with a one finger bone colored head, great lacing in the pilsner glass."
"On tap at tha Joint - Alpine, itself."
"On tap at the 2013 Firestone Walker Invitational held at the Paso Robles Event Center in Paso Robles, CA. "
64oz growler poured into Surly stein (0.5L pour). Thanks Tom (airfoil) for this one!
"64 oz growler acquired at Alpine two days ago. Served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are through the roof given the brewery and high ratings. Price was somewhere around $20.00 for the growler. "
"Pours a nice medium orange. Fairly cloudy. Nice big white head. Lots of fine foam, which leaves a whole bunch of lacing behind. Aroma is orange, tangerine and pineapple. Lots of nice hop flavor bouncing around. I'm not getting any malt character, really. Smells like a nice clean yeast. A touch of mineral water flavor. Lots of hop flavor in the taste. Very dry. Just a hint of biscuity malt. Medium bitter. The dryness amps up that bitterness some in the finish and I'm getting some solid grapefruit pith and pine resin. Tasty stuff. Very refreshing. Not quite as bright as some hoppy pales/session IPAs. Mouthfeel is light. Prickly carbonation. Good hop bite."
"A big thanks to hamilton23 for sending this growler. Much appreciated, Steve! From notes on Sept. 10."
"A: clear, deep golden yellow in color. Forms a small to moderate sized white head that reduces down to a fairly thick and bubbly surface coating. Leaves some moderate lacing on the way down. "
"So, this happened. Thanks Miller! Growler shared with a few people the day it landed from San Diego."
"Super big thanks to BdubleEdubleRUN for hooking me up with this surprise growler as an extra in our most recent box exchange. Really Brett, you are the man. Poured into a snifter, the brew appears a perfectly clear color of golden. A rich finger of white creamy head sits atop and slowly fades leaving an entire white wall of lace sticking to the glass. Rising bubbles of carbonation maintain a thin film across the top. A light swirl revives a finger of yellow stained head back to the surface."
"Growler at Woodshop 7. Not exactly mega fresh since this hasn’t been brewed in awhile, but CP filled and immediately fridged by a Woodshop attendee (amtran maybe). Clear to chill haze golden pour. Spotty white foam. Nose is big mango and tangelo. Taste is tangy, nutty, rich, fresh and chewy butterscotch. Heavy, rich, quenching, elusive butterscotch quality only found in select West Coast IPAs like Port Wipeout, Alesmith IPA, Alpine Duet. Very yummy. Amazing palate. Very bitter through the long finish. Still holding up- will be a knockout fresh on tap. 7/23/2012 7/4/8/5/15=3.9"
Super psyched to try this beer. I was able to get this to celebrate my wife's 30th birthday while the beer is rated #30 on the top hundred. Poured from the growler into a goblet on the day it showed up.
"C'mon, I can't believe I never reviewed this!"
"Growler shared at Woodshop 7. Not super fresh but way better than plenty of fresher hoppy beers out there. Sweet citric aroma with oranges, tangerines, lemons and mild stone fruit. Flavor is nice and tropical, grapefruit and orange and mango, a hint of sweeter malts in the back, dry finish and lightly bitter."
From notes at O'Briens
"Growler poured into a taster snifter. Very happy someone brought this to a tasting as I've wanted to try it for the longest time. Beer pours a light golden yellow, mostly clear, with half a finger of loose bubbly white head. Head dissipated quickly, leaving a little light lacing. A few bubbles here and there, but not overly carbonated."
Poured from a growler.
Finally got around to bringing a growler home after missing out on the last few releases. First time with this brew.
Thanks to DarthKostrizer!
"Pours a lighter shade of amber/gold with good clarity, forms a small white half finger head with minimal retention. As you drink the lacing forms impressive rings that drop down into beautiful sheets of lace, stunning."

From 500mL swingtop growler to Bruges hybrid glass on 2/20/12
"Poured from a growler into a tasting glass. It poured a very bright, golden amber color with a thin but sticky white lacing covering the top of the beer. Great lacing as I drank it as well. "
Thanks Chris for sharing the birthday beer... 
Shared by my buddy Romulux for our birthdays.
Thanks to afksports for sharing the growler!
"A - Pours a hazy, golden pale with a dense white head. Thick rings of clumpy lacing."
"super clean, filtered and lovely white lace. great example of a pale ale appearance. the smell is hoppy but muted, even with the head strong as it is. taste is hoppy with water pine and citrus and toast. the taste finishes clean and drying, and is seriously well balanced. sierra Nevada still wins in my book, but if i could ha e this all the time It would be serious competition. happy super bowl, hoppy. birthday. thanks Martin for the hookup. seriously enjoyable. great beer cheers and go pats!"
Big thanks to Ultraman9000 for the growler!
On-tap at the Alpine Pub while I waited for the ExPo line to move (it didn't move much as I drank my pint). On to the beer:
A: Crystal clear golden orange body. Massive white head. Excellent retention and substantial lacing.
"Smell man so many layers of hops. nelson, cirta, simcoe, amarillo, pacific gem and one more I cant name. layers of smell."

Fresh growler shared by largadeer. HOP PUNS FOR THE WIN HELL YES!!!
"Reviewed from growler into tulip. Pours a dark gold or light orange with a fairly bubbly white head. The smell is much fainter then I had expected and really had to stick my nose in it, pun intended. Smells sweet citrus and almost musty. The taste far over powers the smell, there is a floral bite with a tangy citrus. Good cabonation with a fairly dry sticky finish. Great beer, absolutely perfect sitting out enjoying the outdoors."
"Poured from a growler into a tulip. Thanks readbaron, I'm glad it arrived safely."
Thanks Andrew for the sample.

683rd Review on BA
Enjoyed at the Alpine brewpub alongside a pulled pork sandwich that was crazy good. 
"Pours out a golden color, plenty of clarity, white head, decent, nice, dissipates in an average amount of time. Good hoppy aroma, nothing like some of the other Alpine dry hopping (Expo, Duet, Nelson) but damn good nonetheless and better than 98% of apa's out there. Props for not being afraid to use Summits."
"64oz. Growler shared by Dr. Abmuh, thanks!"
growler from the brewery - thanks to poneill - long overdue review
"Beer served in a Russian River wine glass. Beer is yellow / light amber and clear with a nice white head with some retention, carbonation moderate to low, looks excellent."
Thanks to spycow for sharing this at DLD.
"Thanks again to starrdogg for sharing a growler of this amazing beer, thanks Matt. Alpine is quickly becoming in my book the go to brewery for hop heads like me. "
Huge thanks to MrHirschybar for this one. 
"Have had this on tap more times than I can count on my hands and toes. The color is golden, slightly bronzed, and always carries a nice frothy airy white head. The smell to me is more of a green, earthy smell, with only a tiny bit of citrus hiding in the background. The hop flavor over the palate is spicy, slightly juicy, again just a touch of fruit or citrus. This is not a sweet/bright/citrusy/tropical beer. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side as to be expected. Being a somewhat small-batch beer, it varies a bit from time to time but it's usually a must get anytime we see it."
On-tap at the Toronado in San Diego.
"Thanks to Spycow, I think, for the share."
Shared a growler with some Ba's at my house before DarkLordDay. 
Growler out at ol' 'Watcher's joint on a night that lead to my demise. I got about 2.5 tasters full of the stuff. I can't say that it was really a crowd favorite amongst the tasting group. 
Clear pour the color of pancake syrup. This beer's got massive head. Bitches love head. Fluffy and cratered like an ice cream float.
"Growler shared by yourefragile, thanks!"
Growler shared with 321Jeff and Huhzubendah. Thanks JohnDoe8 for hooking us up!
Growler shared by yourefragile. Thanks Michael!
"Massive thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one at an impromptu Hobo Tasting #7 which turned out to be a good time in an Ingles parking lot out of the trunk of my Audi with my AR-15 in-check to keep the haters out! Served from growler into a Stone nonic. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and a very subtle roastiness. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew just plain excellent in all aspects. I have been wanting to try this one for QUITE some time and glad that I finally was able to. The nose on this one was nothing short of excellent. The flavor, well balanced and excellent in all aspects. If you haven't gotten your hands on this one before it is definitely worth seeking out. You won't regret it!"
"o it began. Hobo tasting No. 7 commenced at Ingles on an overcast and slightly damp day. It was an impromptu event that really was not solidified until a couple hours before, but none the less went off without a hitch. As me and Calton chilled for a good hour enjoying some of the finer craft offerings in our multitude of glassware and bottles and growlers, one could only wonder how much better it could have gotten, enjoyed during a hell of a good time on 04/21/2011."
Draft service into a shaker pint glass at the Alpine pub.
Pale yellow with a thin cap of foam.
On tap at Alpine. Into a pint glass. 
Poured into a pint at the Alpine Pub.
"Pours a super clean golden amber with a large white head that lingers. Looks fantastic. Stronger hops come off the nose than expected, pine and resin, maybe a touch of lemon. So far so great. This beer is more straight forward bitter than any APA I've ever had. Really smooth, with a more generic hop bitterness than the nose implies. Thicker than expected in the mouth, in a very pleasing way, with solid carbonation. They did a great job disguising a 5.25% ABV beer in the mouthfeel as something bigger. To me, that is an impressive feat. Aggressive bittering hops limit the drinkability slightly as an APA, but yet it otherwise presents itself as a 6-7% ABV beer, increasing the drinkability quite a bit with its lower ABV. Really, one of the best 2-3 APA's I have ever had."
"A fresh growler provided by Alex, drank from a Cigar City snifter... The body is a bright dark clear gold with a beautiful off-white head. The head rises a few fingers and settles with a nice cap, decent lacing. Crystal colors and contrast, looks great... The aroma is very sharp, at the most basic level its a mixture of catty/dank and sweet amarillo like hops. Other notes of pine and lemon, very good. Its sweet but dank... The taste isn't as sweet as the nose, more of steady hops throughout, not super bitter though. Light grapefruit on the front. This is an apa that tastes like an ipa but drinks like an apa. Has to be one of the most flavorful drinkable 5% beers out there. The aroma is outstanding, well worth trying. The aroma is more of 4.75 and taste is more a 4.25."
"Thanks to ArthurPendragon for the hookup. I've been looking to try this one for a while, and Arthur came through. Served in a Portsmouth tulip."
Growler thanks to Alex by way of ArthurPendragon! 
"Growler from Ultraman9000 - thanks, Martin!"
"On-tap at O'Brien's, San Diego."
A big thank you to johndoe8 for sharing the west coast san diego beer week wealth!
"Happy birthday, Matt! Oh, and thanks, Chris! This has spent 2 weeks in the growler already, lets see how it is."
"Huge, huge, HUGE thanks to mday for this. After multiple unanswered ISOs, this gets delivered to my doorstep announced. Glad I got to experience at least part of your California trip."
"THIS is a great little beer...Not the biggest on the block, not the gnarliest but very clean, and well balanced."
"Chilled growler into a glass. Yeah, I killed it alone, shut up, Roger."
"poured a golden orange with yellow highlights that had a half finger of head and left good lacing sticking to the glass. the aromas were just like most of other IPA's consisting of a great hop profile, pine, grass, citrus grapefruit, slight pineappple, and some good malt prssence. Upfront the hops and pine flavors were the stara with citrus grapefruit and slight pineapple co-stars. even though it was pretty hoppy the malts did come thru to balance out the hop bomb which was is really a pale ale;great job. the brew was light to medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a nice slight sweet but bitter hop crisp finish. it drank very good and IMO can become a epic session beer chiilin in the hot socal summer sun."
From a pitcher at the new BBQ joint shared with Jessethehutt.
Poured from the tap at Alpine Brewery. Poured a beautiful gold with a nice head.
"Beautiful appearance with tons of fluffy, white head, which retained for quite some time in the glass. "
Perhaps my favorite brewery...Alpine once again knocks one out of the park; Poured from a growler into an Alpine pint glass at roughly 50 degrees Fahrenheit. 
"Poured into a pint glass from a freshly filled growler, showing a clear golden straw in color with an inch or so of milky white foam. Strong retention and artsy lacing follow."
On-tap at Toronado SD
Growler fill from the brewery on 6.12.10
"Growler from ArthurPendragon. Thanks, old friend. The beer is a hazy, glowing yellow peach color. An inch of sudsy, frothy foam tops the body and retains nicely for the duration of the glass, which was admittedly brief. The first whiff displays huge tropical fruit and citrus hop aromas. Pineapple, papaya, a plethora of words that begin with P. Also mango maybe, which begins with M. Malt character is faint, possibly even imaginary. The taste is explosively hoppy yet quite dry and nuanced, with a light biscuit malt foundation barely perceptible beneath the hops. The hop flavors range from tropical fruit to fresh pine needles to juicy citrus. The body is light, but this has a ton of flavor. It finishes with a silky smoothness, only moderately bitter really, and with incredible balance. This is exceptional. Superlatives and Alpine seem to go hand in hand."
"More IPA than pale ale, this brew reminded me of the Sierra Nevada Harvest series. BUT WITH THE DIAL CRANKED TO 11!"
5/23/2010
"Poured from bottle into tulip, good 1 finger cream colored head, good retention and lacing. Pale luminous opaque golden in the glass. Smells of pineapple, citrus and some vegetal hops. Taste is initially pineapple, mango and slightly sweet orange juice, bitterness is a little more than most of these styles, think that is why I like this one, good sharp finish. Very creamy mouthfeel. One thing I want to point out is the shelf stability of this beer is better than any other NEIPA I have had. Did a blind tasting with this, Haze and Green and this was my top pick."
Had ontap from Growler garage Santa Rosa FL July 2018
Re-review a week later : 
"Grapefruit, pepper, dandelion greens, interesting take on a NEIPA."
Taste & smell is heavy pineapple.
Hazy and tasty!
Quick thought on this great beer.
"From a 12 oz bottle into my Sam Adams “perfect pint” glass, Bloom is shockingly hazy bright yellow-orange. I’m looking for sediment – nope. Just super hazy. Nice thick white head with good retention, thick cap and collar. Nose of fresh grapefruit and maybe some more exotic citrus fruit. A little bit of spicy fruit – mango? Whatever it is it smells damned delicious. Noteworthy – “noseworthy?” Taste is similar to nose with lots of citrus hops extremely well balanced against the sweet malt, amazingly akin to some kind of citrus smoothy. Mouth is chewy and stout and I could swear I taste tiny bits of pulp! However a careful examination with a flashlight proves this is only part of the wonderful citrus illusion that is bloom. Overall: HOLY COW this beer is amazing. I’ve had all kinds of IPAs and citrus-forward IPAs in general but Parish takes this to a whole new level. Simply amazing. Will actively seek this one out again."
Bottles on 3-21-18. WOW is this good!
Bottle. 10 days old. White head. Pale hazy yellow color.
12oz bottle poured into a tulip
Bottle. Batch 3. Cloud yellow appliance. Loads of citrus and tropical fruits. Very tropical taste. Maybe a bit lighter feel. Easy to drink.
"Excellent, hazy, orange juice looking, juicy and smooth."
12 oz bottle pours a very hazed gold color with a modest cap of creamy white head. Nice retention and full sheet of lace.
"Another stellar Parish beer. This one was very fruity (grapefruit) on the nose. Taste is slightly smoother than Opus Vert, but still fruity and beautiful. Probably second to DDH Citra Envie as my favorite Parish beer."
Surprisingly this was my favorite Parish brew so far (more so than Ghost). 4XDH was equally great but I haven't compared them side to side. Bloom was so refreshing and flavorful. Definitely more tropical/juicy than piney and full of flavor. More likely to find on draft in Louisiana. Was Batch 2.
Poured into a tulip
Pours a hazy yellow and gold. It has an aroma of citrus fruits and a floral bouquet (hence the name). Smooth mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Excellent beer.
"Cloudy yellow in the glass with a finger of white head. Aroma is orange sorbe, lemon, pine resin, white grape, tangerine, and grapefruit. Full flavored, but soft. Sweet orange candy leads the way with lemon, papaya, grape flesh, maybe some apricot and light stone fruit. Bitter dry finish. Medium mouth feel is creamy with moderate card. Nothing wrong with this beer. Really enjoyed it."
"Appearance is a hazy light orange, light white head with good retention. Aroma is nice and complex mix between citrus & tropical notes. Taste follows suit with a nice balance of citrus & tropical fruit, some slight pine mixed with bready malt and sugary sweetness from the malt. Nice soft body and super drinkable."
"12 oz bottle. Pours cloudy yellow-orange, two finger head lasts and leaves plenty of coating scattered lace. Big tropical juicy aroma jumps out, wow! Taste up front is citrusy juicy with a touch of sweetness. Bitter citrus and piney hops fill the back end, mild herbal notes at the very end. Super dry crisp finish. Medium soft feel glides down. Another delish brew by Parish. Thx to Buddha for hooking me up with this one since I missed the release."
"Parish continues to absolutely kill it with their hoppy brews. Beautiful color, super refreshing citrus aroma and taste. So drinkable it's dangerous. Just as delightful as Opus Vert."
"Mother of god. Better than Sip of Sunshine, Lizard King, etc. Light malt backbone with a crisp citrus taste that reminds me of OJ (in a good way). Crushable"
A-Pours a very nice amber color with a nice head and lacing
Sometimes I get lucky and my brother in law from Ohio brings me some of this!
"Pours a slightly turbid, foggy orange with a finger of white head. Head forms fairly freely, and retains fairly well. Good lacing left behind. Aroma is pine, resin, and dank hops right at the front. They sorta stick and linger in the nostrils. A whiff of mango add a little extra depth, while throwing in a dash of sugar to the more bittery hop aroma. Flavor profile is mango, grapefruit, pine, and resin. It opens up with those sweet tropical fruit notes, but quickly works its way into a more bitter, evergreen forest-like finish. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a nice crisp finish that just has a touch of harsh carbonation to it. Overall, hops hit both sides of the spectrum, but balance and work each other out. Well rounded and developed IPA. "
"Golden body, matte and clear. Two and a half finger white, rocky head that dissipates to a patchy cap. Spare and sticky lace."
No date. 12 oz. bottle.
"This is one of my most favorite IPAs. Slight hint of grapefruit, but not grapefruit infused - all the taste is just from the correct selection and brewing of hops."
Gifted by the man TB! Probably 4 to 5 months old by now
12oz undated bottle received from WesMantooth in the first of his BIF boxes. 
"Color is golden like bronze, nose is thick of hops. The taste hits quickly with the citrusy hoppy flavor. It is dry, but not too dry. This is a very good, no great beer."
Picked up a single as a gift from my local beer store. Was told it was bottled 8/2/17. Thank you Joe.
Poured from the tap into a pint glass. 
no bottling date on 12oz bottle. thought I caught some numbers on the case box saying beginning of June.
"Having this on-tap. Served to me in a pint glass, this beer draws a clear, medium golden color with an amber hue and a white head that's about 2/3 of an inch thick when first poured. Settles eventually to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass. Aromas of some toasted, bready caramel malts and citrusy, piney hops. The taste is pretty much the same, with somewhat toasted, fairly bready, caramel malts that have some sweetness that's followed by big citrus and piney hop bitterness. While the malt flavors make their presence know, the hop bitterness is certainly the dominant flavor here. And that's just fine. Has a fairly crisp, mainly smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. As a clean finish along with a fairly dry aftertaste. The bitterness longer nicely on the palate for a long time after each sip. Easy to drink in a good way. Worth a try to say the least. Hope heads will enjoy this one. I know I sure am."
"Easily one of the best beers I have had in Ohio, and deserving of its 'world class' rating."
Poured from a bottle into a snifter. No bottle date evident
"Pours a beautiful and clear deep gold to amber with a foamy white head that caps and stays a quarter of an inch on the surface. Good lacing. Smells of blueberry, mango, pine of a snow dusted Douglas Fir, and a mild buttery caramel. Taste follows with mango being dominant as both a sweet and bitter component. Tropical fruits followed on the coat tails by delicious pine and mild caramel and biscuit sweetness. Feel is nice and smooth, somewhat slick and resinous perhaps due to the mild to medium carbonation, and coats the mouth. Well balanced but favors the bitter end of the spectrum. Overall, this is a wonderful IPA. Meets the tropical and juicy components as well as the bitter and sticky ones of new and old. Thanks again to Corey for this gem. Cheers!"
"Excellent West Coast style IPA here. Light gold body with a small white head, recedes to a nice thick ring. Good lacing on the glass as well."
Acquired from mantoury74 so a big “Thank You” goes out to him. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.
"The near perfect IPA. Nicely balanced with a crisp hoppy finished. Holds its own against other ""cult"" IPAs."
"My wife recently took a work trip to Cincinnati & naturally I requested that she bring back some beer from Ohio, specifically beers that I am unable to get in Chicago. She came back with 3, 2 of which I have already had (but really liked) and 1 which I had never had before. This beer is that one."
Bottle.
L: Ironic name given that this pours a dark muddy Amber. Really not an attractive beer.
Pint at the Winking Lizard Cleveland
"Bought this IPA on my trip to Toledo, OH last year. "
Nice to be in Ohio so that I can great get the White Rajah and Hop Ju Ju. A very nice IPA with nice bitterness and citrus flavors. A little rougher than the Hop Ju Ju but I like bitter and aggressive. This is that. Have only had in a bottle so hard to see the color but nice aroma. Will pick up another 6 pack when I see it again in the store.
"I was nervous that the ""white"" in the title was going to be another typical Belgian style IPA.....NO....this beer is very very good. It poured a copper clear with white head that left a spotty lace. The scent had nice orange peel spice. The taste reflected the scent but had touches of pine as well. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall....yeah its that good...definitely worth a taste."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a goblet. Very light Amber. Light aroma. Pale head with minimal lacing. Big piney hops up front. No bitter aftertaste. Very thin mouthfeel. Decent IPA but less than what others think, IMHO!"
Love this beer. It is very hoppy without being overly bitter. The best description I can offer of it is the flavor is citrusy. It has hints of grapefruit without coming across as a flavored beer like a shandy. For the IPA lover in the Cleveland area it is a legend.
"Pretty damn tasty. Mangos and peaches stand out as fruity flavors on top of the other medium-bitter hoppy flavors. Even-flavored, medium bodied, with a nice lasting head, this is generally a good, slightly fruit-forward IPA that is dry without being too bitter or sweet."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a hazed apricot color with a small white head and lacing that stays thru-out, smells of tropical and pine hops with sweet malts, taste follows the nose citrus and tropical hops are followed with a bitter pine hop, mouth feel was dry and some what bitter on the finish, liked this IPA ,did not like the dry / bitter finish, smell > taste , but overall a very nice brew"
Nice brew
Poured into a Duvel tulip. No freshness date.
This is one of the best IPAs I’ve ever had.
The Brew Kettle Production Works - White Raja. 6.8% ABV. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass bottled not sure of the bottle date, but it is fresh. Pours an attractive orange with a 2 finger sticky white head that leaves crazy lace behind. "
Lighter amber colour with a decent half finger of classic bubbles. 
"Best IPA ever. Hoppy, citrusy, yet pleasantly smooth and hoppy."
Damn good IPA. Balanced great with the citrus taste.
"12oz bottle, served in a snifter glass."
"12 oz bottle. Deep orange amber pour, thin white head that maintains a thin layer, little lacing. Nice ripe fruity aroma. Taste is sweet bready malt and bitter grapefruit and pine hops. The hops win out with long lasting bitterness. Medium soft mouth. Good brew overall."
Served on tap in a pint glass.
"Impressive color gets me excited despite a lackluster head with whispy lacing. Nose is big grapefruit with a little nose stinging spice as well. Taste is everything all at once - grapefruit bitter, sweet malt and piney finish. Medium body and overly dry. Very nice beer."
"I really can't fault this beer for nearly anything. Delicate floral, juicy, hops with a hint of pungency on the finish. Balanced towards the bitterness. Very soft pleasant malts and smooth as. It's a pale yellow, with a white head. Really nice. Perhaps light for the winter, but probably the only thing a person could want in the heat."
Smells like buttery popcorn. Like the sticky movie theater floor beneath my feet. Nice. Has a sweet biscuity flavor. Lemon zest. Bready. Unique IPA! My kind of malt bomb.
Excellent balance!
Easily one of the best IPAs I've had.
Sometimes the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
"Dark amber color, slightly cloudy. Full aromatic hop nose -- sets the stage for a taste that does not disappoint. Strong citrus hops, grapefruit flavor -- exactly what I hope to find in a WC IPA. A nice bitterness that lingers long after swallow. Appropriate carbonation."
Consumed 12/3/15
"Nice foam lacing 1/4 inch, great hop expression, lovely lengthy finish"
This was a bland IPA I can see people liking it that don't like ipas. I don't see how it is the best in the nation.
"Pours clear fizzy orange, with a huge tropical nose. Lots of apricot, mango, pineapple essence anchored by zesty earthy hop spice that tickles the nose. Flavor is a bit sweet at first, but balances out with some spicy hop bitter by the end. Feel is smooth with appropriate bubbly fizz. Great example of the style."
A: straw to golden yellow minimal white head
"Exceptional ipa. All the big fruit flavors of hops dedicated to doing so, in a fashion that wants to make you drink more of this berry esque ipa. "
"White Rajah - The Brew Kettle Taproom & Smokehouse / Production Works. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this brew's head is one finger thick and off-white , with secular lacing, and a clear straw gold body."
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip pint. The brew appears a pale golden copper color with white cap. Smells hoppy with citrus and pith/pulp character. Tastes bitter and rindy with a mild fruity character, resinous and somewhat floral. This is medium in body with modest carbonation. Overall pretty nice, easy drinking stuff."
"White Rajah has a medium, white head, a semi-opaque, orange-gold appearance, some bubbles, and not so heavy lacing left behind. The aroma is of very citrus-type hop oil and white bread, and the flavor is of the same, with citrus rind and pith. It is not too bitter or sugary. Mouthfeel is medium, and White Rajah finishes mostly dry and mild. "
"Good copper color, nice head, laces the glass. Not as bitter as I like but great flavor, smooth. One of the better non west coast ipas I have tried so far."
Pours a semi-clear bronze color with a a white head of about three quarters of an inch. 
Picked up a from Jungle Jim's in Fairfield. Pours an orange gold with a light head that lingers. Aroma is slightly dank and piney in the best way. 
Good stuff hard to find
Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a stemless wine glass. 
Appearance - White Rajah is straddles the border between a straw yellow and light orange and is nearly completely clear. A large white head bursts forth and looks like a snow cap.
On tap at the CBC restaurant. 
Shoutout to Eziel for this trade!
"12 oz bottle, no date. Bought warm in Ohio but in the fridge the last week. Clear golden yellow color, fairly pale. White head. Big hop aroma and flavor, fruity, floral. All hoping the taste, no malt flavor at all, I'd like more balance. Thinner mouthfeel, I'd prefer more body."
L: Nice light copper color. About 1 1/2 finger head with lots of tiny bubbles. Well carbonated.
Wow!
"Poured into a snifter. Hazy amber color, smallish white head. Aromas of grapefruit and resin, but more muted than I expected. Taste was bold citrusy bitter hops with a clean dry finish. An outstanding west coast IPA but I expected a bit more - not sure about the freshness of this one."
Good ipa with a great nose to it but I feel the malt bill takes away from it a bit in the taste. Maybe it was a bit too hyped up in my brain but it wasn't quite the stud that I thought it would be. STill a good ipa but there are so many great ones out there now & this seems to be a step behind
Pours a deep apricot yellow color. Tropical fruit and mango in the nose. Fruity body with a nice bitterness that fades in the finish. On par with many of the top IPAs out there right now.
Favorite Ohio single IPA period. Great hop forward punch but light with a light malt backbone that allows the tropical juicy hops to shine. Would always grab a six pack when in the area!
12oz bottle from JustDoIt1234 (thanks man!). No apparent bottle date. Served in a goblet. 
"Great IPA, subtle hop aroma, light in color, smooth with a very mild finish. Very balanced and easy to drink for an almost 7% IPA. I enjoyed this one a great deal"
"You can almost smell how slick & juicy this beer is, with lots of flowery, herbal hops with tinges orange citrus & a little grapefruit peel. The hops are not super bitter but are a tad astringent / medicinal. It has a medium body with a good resinousness that coats the tongue. More soft grapefruit rind and citrus hops with very little malt presence. As others have said, it is very drinkable & not some bludgeoning hop monster. Even if IPAs aren't your thing this beer is definitely worth a look as it is very smooth and even with a refreshing, juicy kick."
"Clear orange, big white head and spotty lacing. Notes of orange, hay, and grapefruit pulp. Thin side of medium mouthfeel. Very easy drinking IPA, classic west coast profile but don't very well."
Tried this on my last visit to Ohio at the Lizardville beer store. Great hoppy local IPA that I would be happy to have again. Nice citrus notes but easy drinkin.
Fresh 12oz. bottle poured into a snifter tasting glass.
Got this as an extra in a recent trade. Thanks @plutoniumpete! Great aroma with a 2 finger head that lingers for a little bit. Taste is exquisitely balanced with the bitterness perfectly contrasting the malt presence. I wish I was able to get this in the South. Great experience and glad I was able to try a bottle.
"A little disappointed in this one. Maybe just not the right day for it, as I drank a few all day ipas before it. "
"Revisited this beer after not having it for a long time. Why was I not drinking this all the time? I served this to several friends at a tasting I hosted. Some rated it their favorite of the night, behind PtE, KBS, and Dark Lord."
Exceptional! Had it fresh. You have to try its a must!
"Absolutely delicious. Beautiful amber appearance with a nice creamy head, that melts after a few minutes, leaving a nice lacing. The aroma is bursting with ripe typical fruits. Taste follows bouquet, and is joined by a gripping, assertive, hoppy, grapefruit rind bite. Great balance here. The astringency lingers as the fruit basket melts and morphs into caramel, toffee sweetness. The finish goes on, and on... Really beautiful. "
Hard to find much wrong with this beer
This is a fantastic citrus IPA - I could drink this everyday and be happy! Just wish I didn't have to drive to the next State over to get it!!!
12oz bottle. 12oz Can
Wow! Recommended by an unknown compatriot at Joseph's. I recommended Founders Centennial IPA to him. Add this deliciously smooth IPA to the best in genre! Cheers!
Shout out to The Brew Review Crew for the trade!
"The sweet and smooth finish really puts this above most other citra IPAs. Its basically hops all the way through. My girlfriend would hate this beer, but I really like it."
"Great West Coast style IPA. Heavy citrus nose, very little malt present, and very hop forward. Really great IPA."
"Nice color,taste like a Pilsner looks like a Pilsner."
A twelve ounce bottle with no apparent date but I'm certain it's fresh as I trust the sender. Pouring it in a 13oz. tulip for the review. 
"12 oz. bottle into a tulip. Cloudy, medium amber in appearance with 1/2 a finger of white, bubbly foam. Huge tropical fruit, citrus, and bubblegum notes on the nose. Light weight with a crisp, dry mouthfeel. More tropical fruit on the taste initially with a sudden transition into a bitter hop bomb. There's a good balance between the fruity sweetness and the hoppy bitterness, with this one leaning slight toward the hoppy side. I detect traces of alcohol, but not enough to be offputting. The finish is clean and assertive, and you're left with a piney, hoppy aftertaste."
"Pours a clear light golden color with a pretty thin white head. No lacing. Smells like mango, guava, pineapple, and slight citrus. Tropical fruit heaven. Citra hops for sure. Taste follows the nose. Malt is really hidden with little alcohol. Probably the best ""West Coast"" IPA I've had that's not from the West Coast. Good amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Very drinkable. Overall a great IPA. Not much to complain about."
I had an older bottle - very malty.
A really great beer. Loved it. Big citrus taste.
How can it get any better than this?
"To me, this is a perfect IPA. The citrusy aroma and flavor are incredible. It's not what I would call a ""balanced beer"" and that's exactly what I want in an IPA! If I want a malty beer, I'll drink a stout or scotch ale. Don't get me wrong, the malt is there, but it's juuuust there enough. The hops are the star here."
The appearance is golden hay.
"Great citrus smell. Quite bitter flavor, good carbonation, not very malty. Piney aftertaste that lingers."
Poured from 12 oz. bottle to pint glass.
It's pretty good but not on the same level as the Vermont guys.
"Long time want from buschbeer, cheers man!"
"Very Good IPA, I'd have it again."
One of my favorite IPAs. Tropical fruits and citrus fans should seek this brew out.
Candied fruits and slight bitterness that dissipates quickly. Bomb diggity.
"5's across the board for me. This beer is PERFECT for my taste buds. Assertive bitterness gives way to mild fruity sweetness at the finish, which is exactly what I want from an IPA. "
"Bodhi, Head Hunter and this are my Holy Trinity of Ohio beers. Rajah is a super-balanced West Coast styled IPA. Its flavor is crisp and bright, almost perfumey, and has a fantastic sweet finish."
"Awesome! Great taste, but the head disappeared."
Look - Bright golden honey. Head is thin and white. The lacing is more apparent and sticks around. 
"After reading prior reviews, I'm concerned I drink a bum bottle. Regrettably, my second helping confirmed my disappointment. Looks and smells great, but the taste was overweighted citrus, and flat. Very flat. Willing to try another from this brewer, but not crazy about my first choice."
Wow. Just wow. Bravo TBK Bravo.
Had never heard of this beer or brewery before. Completely caught off guard by how amazing this beer was. One of the best IPA's I've had.
Great citrus hop flavor. Drinks smooth. No long-lingering aftertaste. A great IPA.
Look: A transparent burnt straw with a minimal white head. 
Wow this might be the best IPA i've had smells so good and taste so good so smooth
"Pours clear golden in color with no head whatsoever. Smells very hoppy, as it should. A piney, resiny, punch-you-in-the-nose hop aroma."
"An explosion of citrusy goodness. Great balance, nice bitterness. A really good IPA."
Not sure what else to say other than this was the first experience this Californian has had with Ohio.
Look - hazy golden copper head with a white head
"Yum. They hit the mark. Gold color slight haze with white head. Grape fruit ,Peaches , and dank aromatics. Tastes of grapefruit ,orange ,vegetal leafy ,and a mild bitter finish. Light to medium mouth feel."
"Unlike any other ipa I've had. An epic bubble gum and tropical fruit smell, and the taste follows suit. Has a good hoppy aftertaste too."
If u can get it! Get it! That good.
"My favorite IPA (even beating the likes of Fathead's Headhunter, for crying in a bucket) and in my top 5 beers of all time. Simply fantastic and unique aroma, taste, and mouthfeel--the blend of Hops used is magical. I'm smitten...problem is that while I'm from where this nectar is brewed, I now live in South Florida--where I can't get it."
"Slightly pungent citrus aroma. Off white head turns into a sticky, newly spun spiderweb lace that sits on top of a two-month-old-penny color. Hoppy slightly oncoming sucker punch followed by an oily stick-your-tongue-on-9-volt-rayovac aftertaste. My go-to ""session IPA"" that leaves with with a late afternoon of regrets."
"Appearance was promising, considering this is billed as a West Coast IPA, but it's a textbook maltbomb."
Reminds me of Zombie Dust
A hop spectacle for the taste buds. Had this at the Brew Kettle fresh... as good as it gets baby! P.S. Check out Ogrefest!
Perfect Golden in colour. Nice fruity Taste. One of the best beer I have ever had.
"We pour into our glistening new King Sue tekus, christening them on their maiden voyage. The coloring shows up a shade of golden honey. A one finger head of soapy white foam is produced, but this is transient, disappearing quickly. Flicking the wrist robustly, however, causes a wonderfully triumphant return of said head. Lacing is globular and spotty. No haze or sediment is noted, and carbonation appears to be active throughout. The aroma is sweet and generously hopped to include notes of citric and nectary fruity hoppiness, pale and soft caramel graininess, apricot, peach, and red apple fruitiness, honey sweetness, metallic ale yeastiness, astringent detergent, tart bubblegum zing, grapefruity rind and oily zestiness, candy corn, flaked butter biscuits, peppery booze, old leather, and wet wool. The flavoring is sweeter than expected for a self-professed “west coast style IPA”. The bitterness of hops is there, but it comes as a slow, lingering tickle at the far back of the palate. Primary notes include citric and floral hop sweetness, honey and white sugar, buttery pale and caramel malts, simple malted barley, acetaldehyde, black pepper and garlic powder spiciness, melted plastic army men, microfiber fabric, concrete and mineral, pine sap and green grassy resins, peach syrup, grapefruit and tangerine fleshy sweetness, powdered Sweetart candies, chalky but savory yeast, and white grape skins. The body is lightly medium, and the carbonation is light and soft as well. Each sip gives nice slurp and smack, but creaminess and frothiness lose out to oily coating on the swirl. The mouth is left significantly puckered after this drips away, especially as the beer comes to temperature. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks away quickly."
THIS HAS TO BE MY FAVORITE IPA OF ALL TIME
Like this one more than Black Rajah
Thanks to @WesMantooth for this gem. 
great beer... about a month old.. really good
Strange taste and strange smell
"White Rajah is on the light side of amber, showcasing gold more than anything else. A relatively pale complexion by IPA standards, only its highlights display any bronzed tones. Foam is spotty over top but is wrapped around the glass like a scarf on a particularly cold, blustery day. "
"Surprisingly good refreshing, head was 1/4 "" of heavy foam which laced the glass as it was enjoyed. Smell was hoppy goodness, without any bready yeast smells. Color was a orangish yellow very clear. Taste was without yeast. Great hopped unbalanced delight."
"Beautiful golden beer, incredibly active, with a solid snow white head. Retention is fantastic, leaving behind wide flat snowy fields of lacing."
12 oz bottle poured into snifter
Don't really know how you can beat this. I don't find anything wrong with it. 
"Bright juicy fruit (bubble gum comes to mind here...) a highly sessionable APA that is obviously very well made. The only thing that I would say could be improved is the complexity of the malts on the finish are pretty much non-existent; I would prefer a little bit more cloyying to liken it to a WC IPA as the bottle states. Nevertheless, a very quality beer (from my hometown nonetheless!!)"
"Floral smell, well balanced with malt in backgound and a nice fresh hops finish."
"this one looks nice. beautiful head just off white, very sticky. Nice deep brown red and gold color and vibrant carbonation. Nose is very oily and pine like. Hops in the background. Taste is hops in the front but the back and aftertaste are sweet maltiness. Cloves and spices. Somewhat buttery taste and feel. I like it a lot."
Pours gold. More clear than some IPA's. Super hop smell with lots of citrus. Even with a slightly stuffy nose this hits you hard. Goes from tons of citrus to bitter. Smooth transition all the way through. Love the hops in this one. Great beer. Good find by the wife on her trip through Ohio!
"After hearing about this brew for quite awhile, I finally got a chance to try it and it lived up to the hype. "
"Dark honey in the glass, with a good head and attractive lacing qualities. A big citrus hop scent, followed by nice grapefruit, pine, and mango flavors. Medium bitterness. A really solid IPA."
Bottle: Poured a amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention. Aroma of citrus and piney undertones is quiet nice. Taste is also dominated by citrus notes with light piney notes also observable. Bitterness isn’t too intense with floral notes as dominant as I would have expected. Body is about average with good carbonation. Tasty beer with well balance bitterness level and great hops aroma. I would have liked flora notes to be even more dominant but still a very enjoyable IPA.
Pours a golden light amber color. Not too much head and it dissipates quickly. Some lacing.
A - Poured a light orange with a sturdy two finger lasting head.
A- Crystal clear bronze gold body. Fine white head pours 2 fingers high with ok retention and low lace.
From notes on 6/6/14
"Appearance: Light copper, slightly hazy. 1/4"" very light tan foamy head. Excellent lacing. Thin froth retained."
"A - Clear golden orange beer, large head reduces slowly to thick white cap that laces as it goes down."
great hop flavor...lite malt...good balance
"Sweet maltiness with a strong undercurrent of mandarin orange. What more can I say? A great IPA with a balanced foundation, and a touch of something special that makes it worth its reputation. Very nice!"
"Appearance: Golden amber. Decent froth at first, but leaves a minimal lace for head. "
"The nose is filled with pithy grapefruit rinds and juices, with a floral touch and some pine needles. The flavor is straight to the grapefruit qualities with a nice back of honey sweetness. Added sweetness comes from a thick caramel malt. It finishes bitter with pine and dank onion but than dries out with a barley flavor. This is a very tasty beer that would be greater doubled."
"Had a few bottles of the White Rajah in my fridge from a party the weekend before. Intending to savor the taste of some wonderful takeout, I poured a bottle into a glass. I didn't realize that I hadn't touched the takeout when I had already finished the Rajah. Best beer I've had in over a year. Timing? Beer? Who knows. But man, was it good!"
A: deep golden and just short of clear; few fingers of ivory foam atop; slimmed to a cap of foam and left some trails behind
"Poured into a pint glass, this is a slightly hazy orange-amber beer that develops a large inch-thick head of airy foam--it features excellent head retention, still large after a minute. The nose offers a big bouquet of citrusy hoppiness, readily scentable even while the beer is on the table. Really delicious flavor, too, with gobs of citrusy hop flavor, while the bitterness is not really all that high: emphasis is on taste. The malt adds some sweetness but not any real malty flavor. Finish leaves a lingering hop taste. Body is light despite the 6+% strength."
"Pours orange amber with gold highlights, slight haze. Serene, glowing and golden. Creamy head of off white foam that leaves lace. Hop bomb nose. With a citrus and with fruitiness, a good floral perfume. The nose is like a fountain of hops that is shooting into the air spectacularly. A bit of honey sweetness on the nose. Grapefruit, citrus orange and mango. It surprised me with a bit of light sweet caramel on the palate first and then that bushel of fruit. A dry cracker malt and fruit that was both sweet and tart. Lovely light mouthfeel that stayed west coast style light even though there was some malt flavor on the palate. This one drinks juicy and then there's a bitter. A staunch firm and lasting bitter that reminds you as it lingers of all that sweet and delectable fruit. "
Bottle (no date) poured into my HF stemmed tulip...
Huge thanks to mtomlins for this one. 
"Chilled, poured into IPA glass."
First tried White Rajah in a bottle a while ago and was left disappointed; had it on draft last night at J Alexanders and was blown away! Sure wish Brew Kettle bottle dated as I never know how fresh the beer is at local stores.
Bottle poured into my teku glass
"Nice, clear golden amber pour on draft at the Magic Tree. One finger of white head which went to lace quickly... nice lacing throughout, though. Clean citrus nose, bit of pine. Astringent bitter note on the nose. Liked it a lot. Nice balance overall with big bitterness and fresh citrus coming through. Good mouthfeel though oily... hangs around a bit with the nice bitterness. Overall a really nice OH IPA choice! Brew Kettle rocks."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but should be pretty fresh. Pours slightly hazy deep gold color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, pine, honey, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity of big citrus/tropical/grassy hops with light-moderate malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, honey, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel/rind, pine, floral, grass, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity or bright citrus/tropical/grassy hops and light-moderate malt sweetness; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible IPA. All around fantastic complexity of bright citrus/tropical/grassy hops with light-moderate malt balance; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. An extremely outstanding offering."
One of my fridge staples. 
"A: Light colored IPA. Two finger retention of white head, lacing is decent but disappears quickly"
Bottle poured into pint glass. 
"Holy nose! I took a whiff of this thing right off the pour and it was super resin. Flavor is very much the same. Strong tones of it. Whew! Meaty this beer is (read that in a Yoda voice). Just wads of pine on top of gobs of it. And I like it. Smooth feel. I found Columbus IPA and this one at the same store and felt pretty lucky. In the end, I think this one wins the battle of the Ohio IPA heavyweights."
"What a difference fresh i had this baby as a 3.5. then had one a lot fresher, boom! 4.21"
"With White Rajah, The Brew Kettle has concocted such a wonderfully unique interpretation of the grapefruit/ bitterness characteristics I love so much about the West Coast style IPA that I sense a paradoxical shift in my pallet! "
Pours out a translucent amber gold with a very light head which is gone almost immediately. Head settles into a slight ring around the edge with decent lacing. Floral notes and grapefruit hit the nose first with a bit of caramel malt. Perfect amount of bitterness in the taste with a will balanced malt and hop profile. Grapefruit definitely dominated the taste but isn't overwhelming. Bitterness tingles the palate almost perfectly. No pocket effect. Overall an excellent brew great for the warm weather after some gardening.
"Deep golden, orange highlights. Great sticky lacing. Floral notes on the nose, some orange peel too. Big bitter grapefruit, citrus pith, honey. Bitter, drying mouthfeel, just a perfect amount of abrasiveness. It's a solid everyday IPA."
12oz into a tulip.
12oz bottle poured into a goblet
I started drinking this beer after I opened a Dirtwolf. This is a much more superior beer.
Drank from a 12 fl. ozs bottle acquired in a trade with mps
"Bottle purchased at Kafe Kerouac in Columbus, OH and drank there."
Grabbed a six pack of this for a beer tasting party.
Clear golden hue with a nice tight finger high head of white. Average retention and attractive curtains of lacing.
"I actually went back to a pub I had been to when I realized they had this and I missed it. The prior night I had Fathead Headhunter and thought that was amazing. Honestly, I think this little IPA topped it! The smell was perfect. Heavy floral and fruits, how I like it. Taste just as great. The smell translated well to the taste and had just enough sweetness and just enough bitterness. Really glad I found this one. Makes my top five IPAs up there with headhunter and jai alai. If you find this one try it and but it. Glad I had to go to Ohio for a wedding to find this."
"I think this is one of the best IPAs most people don't know about. Awesome flowery smell. Great mouthfeel, this stuff dances on my tongue. Carbonation is perfect. Great taste, every sip makes me one the next one more."
"Pours a huge, white head with great persitence. Nice, bright citrus aroma. Hazy straw color. Starts EXTREMELY bitter with huge notes of grapefruit and citrus rind, with a touch of pine in the back. There is (surprisingly) some malt showing through. The bitterness rapidly drops to create a slightly malty, citrus rind bitterness lingering into the finish."
"Amber on the pour. Wow, outstanding hoppy nose. Pine and floral scents. This is a really well-balanced IPA. Floral, resiny, citrusy, dryer sheety hops are smoothed out by a thick, oozy slug of caramel malt. This is a classic Midwest take on a West Coast IPA."
Undated bottle at 50 degrees into imperial pint
Bottle to tulip. First beer of the evening. 
Gonna start by saying I f'n love this beer. It is easily one of my new favorites now! Too bad I can't get it locally. 
Appearance: Golden orange color. Half a finger of head on the pour and present on the edges of the glass while drinking. Heavy sticky lacing left behind at each level. Average amount of active carbonation.
"Honestly, this is one of the best around ! Looks great, aromas are fantastic, assertive hop profile and to top it off it has a solid feel as well. An ipa lover's ipa."
Appearance - Golden in color with a modest white head. 
"Pours a brilliant copper with a silky, frothy cream head that lingers."
No bottling date poured into a pint glass.
"One of my goal beers on my Ohio buying trip, can't wait to try it. The pour is a pale reddish copper color with a slightly off white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The aroma is super hoppy, tons of notes of citrus and tropical fruit; as well as pine and grass. This is definitely a hop forward west coast style ipa. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and resinously coating on the palate. The flavor is all hops, I'm not sure there are any malts in this ale at all. There's a ton of pine, citrus, and mango flavors in this beer. It is quite the tongue tingler. It is a one note wonder but that note is done damn well. This rivals the best west coast ipas from brewers like Stone, Lagunitas, and Green Flash."
12oz Bottle received in trade with iguenard - thanks!
"super clear, light golden color, fluffy white head,thin lace sticks to the glass. "
Finally got to score a few of these!
The beer comes in a dark orange amber.
You had this beer. 
A - golden haze with an orange / copper color. 
Appearance: Beautiful amber pour with 1/2 finger of white head and ample carbonation.
Poured from a growler into a pint glass
"A: Golden orange, slight haze."
"WTF!!! This is only a beer in the technical sense. In reality, it is a hop delivery liquid with only 2 main purposes; (1) To dissolve any and all tooth enamel, and (2) Put you into a lupulin coma."
Fresh growler. Still don't particularly care for this. Somewhat vegetal taste and heavy fuzzy mouthfeel.
poured 12oz bottle (no date) into imperial pint glass with a 2 finger white head that left some nice lacing on the glass. Color of the beer is a clear light golden.
"Ohio has some heavy hitters in the world of the IPA: Fat Head's Head Hunter, Columbus' IPA, and The Brew Kettle's White Rajah. Each year when I return for Christmas or summer to visit my family I change my favorite. This past summer the beer that impressed me the most was The Brew Kettle's White Rajah. "
White Rajah 
poured 12oz bottle into a snifter.
"Got this in a trade from CincyTrigger, thanks for sending it my way. Beautiful looking orange hued IPA with a two finger head. Lots of tropical juicy fruits on nose as aromas of orange, pineapple, and grapefruit shine through. There isn't much for booze or malts, fine by me! That's good stuff. There is some quality grapefruit and pine flavor to be had. Faint malts are hidden in there somewhere. Not overly bitter. Would definitely like to drink this stuff again."
"Thank you Ohio!!!! Wow!!! Smells of honeydew melons emanate from the bottle as soon as its opened... very nice rich sweet malts accompanied with rich fruitiness...reminds me of lychee, pineapples and melons....SUPERB IPA!!! WOW!!!! I must seek out more.. got one as an extra in a trade and i am hooked...i want at least a 6er to the face...Sooo gOOD!!!"
"This beer is what IPAs are about, and more. The beer pours a medium head that leaves quite a bit of lacing. This is probably the best smelling IPA I've had, as the tropical/citrus aromas are spectacular and huge. The citrus and pine flavors continue to be great, and this beer has pretty much no malt presence at all and finishes quite bitter, but that's to be expected. The mouthfeel is on the thin side, but the beer finishes clean and bitter. Overall, this is an incredibly drinkable IPA for a beer with such dominant flavors. This would make for a great session ale given the thinner body. One of these is just not enough."
"Appearance: pored into a great lakes snifter, beautiful golden color "
Thanks to Kurmaraja for this one. Poured into 10oz goblet. Poured a lightly hazy yellow-gold color with about 1/2 inch of white head that had medium retention and light lacing.
"Deep golden almost light amber body with the appropriate creamy white head. The smell is pine needles, grapefruit rind, and some tropical fruit. The taste is rich and bitter. There is enough citrus sweetness to round everything together. The mouthfeel is full but also slick. This is about as crushable as it gets for almost 7%. This rating goes over 4.5 though when on draft at the Brew Kettle. It's as good as a citrusy IPA gets when on draft. The bottle is still in the top 10 for Midwest IPAs."
Poured into a tulip
12oz bottle poured into an Idle Hands tulip. Long time want of mine...
"12-oz bottle to tulip. Acquired at Savor Market in Columbus, OH, on 9/7/2013. $11.99 for a six pack. There is no ""born on"" or ""best by"" date, but the owner said the shipment arrived 3 days before purchase. Consumed on the date of purchase."
"The beer is gold in color with a finger of white head. There is a really nice citrus hop nose on this one. Plenty of tropical and fruity notes, too. Similarly intense hop notes on the palate. Lots of tropical fruit and citrus characteristics with a moderate bitterness to it. There is a hint of bready malt in the background. Medium body with medium carbonation. Nicely done."
A. Amazing color with a nice head and amazing lacing. 
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a stemmed tulip glass
"If you drink the RAJAH long enough you will notice some variation from six to six. I find that a lot with well crafted high quality beers. I won't bother you with the outstanding color and taste of this beer. I'm sure you have heard about it at this point. It is a little thin on the tongue, but to be expected with a beer that tells malt to take a hike. It is very easy drinking. The real treat with this beer is in the nose. The smell that I just want to BATH in. If I drink enough of this stuff the wife gets turned on from the smell. It's insane. Total ripe grapefruit and citrus. It plants your feet in the ground and sends your head into the clouds. This is world class midwest IPA the way it should be done. It kills cascade hops. Don't get me wrong, I lived in Portland through the nineties and still need a cascade style to break the routine, but you won't find a cascade that touches a upper mid atlantic brewed IPA. This is the beer that is changing what beer is. Crack it and stick your nose in it first thing. It gets better when it gets a little warmer. Unfortunately it does have a tendency to vary some what from batch to batch. I find that the first bottles in a batch don't have that over powering intoxicating smell. It's best to get a later bottle fresh off the line. Any way you get it, other beers are always trying to imitate. REAL AMERICAN BEER."
12 oz bottle poured into a Prohibition Pig snifter glass.
"Thanks to NW2285 for this great brew. Pours a clear gold with billowy two finger head. Decent lacing. Fruit forward aroma. Redolent of white grapefruit, mango, with a little dank, and a slight whiff of cat pee. Outstanding flavor, juicy tropical fruits strike the palate first. Pleasant bitter aftertaste make this an extremely drinkable IPA. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Finishes dry. Overall, a well crafted brew and a model of what IPAs should smell and taste like!"
A - Deep gold with thin white head. Great lacing.
Pours bit cloudy. Orange hued golden straw color with two fingers thick head with great retention leaves a decent sheet if lacing. Looks just fantastic.
Appearance - golden colored liquid with white head
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter.
"A – Pours a clear light golden color with a finger of slightly off white head, phenomenal lacing and great retention."
Served from a 12oz bottle into a Lost Abbey Teku. No freshness date.
"Definitely one of the best IPAs I've had. Pours on the deeper golden color side of the ipa range with a half inch of white head. The smell is fantastic, dominated by citrus and hops. Taste is similar and on the sweeter side. Hops are not dominating but a good presence. Overall a must try."
Big thanks to maximumu13 for this bottle. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a CCB pint glass.
Holy hell this is fantastic. If this were made by Founders or 3 Floyds it would dominate the ISO portion of the trading forum no less than Zombie Dust. 
Huge thanks to my friend Jay for the growler! Poured into a NB goblet.
"12 fl oz brown glass bottle with interesting label art and branded yellow pressure cap acquired in a trade with michaellcoates (thanks again, man!) a couple days ago and served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are high given its current ratings; it's currently #146 on the top 250 list so I'm really excited to try it. 6.8% ABV confirmed. 70 IBUs. "
Thanks to Chris and Adam for this bottle. No freshness info but this was apparently very fresh. 
12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass
A: a light orange with a nice amount of carbonation coming up from the bottom and a pure white two finger head.
"Pours a light orange color with a finger and a half of white head, very clear."
Big thanks to blacknyellow20 for sending this as an extra! 
From FalconA. Thanks! 
"Presentation: Very cool and eye-catching label with great colors and font. Label gives ABV and IBU info, a small description of the beer, a bit of info and small description on the brewery, Label states “Taming the Savage Hop”. Really cool cap. "
White Rajah IPA
"No date on this one, however the beer store said it arrived 5/17. Given the taste I'd say it's quite fresh."
No bottled on date. Tulip glass.
The Brew Kettle Taproom & Smokehouse / Production Works - White Rajah - 12fl oz bottle
"Pours a deep amber with minimal head, respectable lacing."
My first review!
Hands down my favorite IPA. I am also lucky enough to live 10 minutes away from the brewery so I have access to it 24/7. 
"A - Clear copper body, white head has some retention and some lacing."
"a hazy golden/orange in color with 2 fingers of bright white head leaving behind nice lacing. smells of grapefruit citrus, pine, grassy hops, caramel, honey, pineapple. a wonderful tasting ipa.. lots of sweet delicious citrusy grapefruit, tons of piney cascade hop flavor lingering for bitterness and pineyness.. a delicious sweet caramel/honey malt profile. this is a really great tasting ipa. medium body with moderate carbonation.. slight creamy mouthfeel. "
"12 oz bottle courtesy of mgbickel pours a uber-hazed gold color with a small, but tight off-white head. Decent retention and good lacing."
"Thank you, misterhops for this long-wanted extra."
Big thanks to Sam for this one. One of the best beers from my favorite brewery? Yes please! 12oz. bottle into a Lawson's pint. 
received a bottle in a trade- Thanks pschnei3!
12oz bottle poured into wine glass
Tasted On: 03-13-2013
"Wow. This is a beer worthy of an awesome review. I am not sure how fresh it was, but my god, the hop notes were in-your-face. For an American IPA, that has it all. For the style, it really puts many others to shame, including its local rival, the venerable Head Hunter. This is a beer to seek out. I would buy this beer whenever I see it. They need to can this beer and ship it so everyone can enjoy it. Bravo TBK!!!!"
Thanks to Scott for this bottle
Poured from a bottle. 
Poured from bottle into my snifter. Bottled less than 1 month ago according to trading partner. Thanks kcbaby!
From notes. 12oz bottle poured into a Riedel beer glass. Didn't see the date but the person who brought these to the tasting said they had just arrived on the shelves.
12 oz bottle into a SA perfect pint. Huge thanks to WesM63 for throwing this in as an extra!
"A) A very light, slightly hazy amber colored beer that is light enough to see through and that leaves a light thin white frothy head. This is not a very malty beer. The first time I tried this beer it left beautiful lacing all the way down the glass as I drank."
"Deep glowing sunburst orange body that is translucent, white cap."
12oz bottle served in a standard pint glass.
A 12 ounce bottle from JM03; thank you! Poured into a tulip glass.
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large tulip.
HUGE thanks to brew33 for this glorious extra!
A - A very standard looking IPA. Clear amber and bubbles constantly floating to the top. This could be why I am not getting much lace but the head is a great 1/2 inch that settles to a thick lace ring.
12 oz. bottle poured into a standard pint. Thanks to mrfong07 for sending this one. No bottling info that I can find.
Thanks to Goryshkewych for the hookup.
"Big thanks goes out to JM03 for sending me this one as an extra in a recent trade! Had this one as a pre-game to one of my best friend’s rehearsal dinner! Served from bottle into a COAST Willi. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tropical fruit, fruit, fruit hop, pine, and pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, tropical fruit, fruit, fruit hop, tropical fruit hop, and pine hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Based on the reviews I actually went into this one expecting a lot which is not normal at all for me. I can honestly say that this thing delivered! So much complexity going on here with tons of different hops playing around with your palate. Once you got used to one, another came in and knocked you off your feet. Really complex and satisfying throughout the entire glass. A really well done brew that I wouldn’t mind having quite a few more of. An absolute must try for any hop-head out there, you won’t be disappointed."
12 oz bottle courtesy of JM03. Thanks! Poured into a pint glass on 10/13/12. 
This poured out as a nice looking clear golden color with a white frothy head on top. The lacing was sticky and the retention was great. The smell of the beer gave off massive amounts of hoppy citrus aromas and pine notes. The taste of the beer was sweet in the very beginning before transitioning over to the bitterness of the hops. Lots of pine resin and tropical fruit flavors in this beer. The mouthfeel was smooth and lightly carbonated with a slight thickness to it. Overall it's a damn good IPA.
A thanks to Miketd for including this in the box. Poured into my duvel tulip.
"Really excited to finally get a chance to try this. A buddy of mine brought it back from his recent trip to Cleveland. Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium snifter. The appearance is a clear orange-gold color with a nice white head, but quick dissipation. The nose is outstanding. Lots of ripe tropical fruit notes like pineapples, oranges, and peaches. There's also a slightly sweet, breadiness to it also. Very nice!"
Pours a clear amber color with a fairly large white head that leaves some solid sticky lacing.
A - pours copper without much of a head on it
Big thanks to thebouch01 for this brew!
12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. No bottle date. Big thanks to henryspam for this one.
Bottle into tulip pint. 
"The beer pours a clear amber with a thin white head. The nose is slightly hoppy and sweet, but not overbearing. It's a rather generic tasting IPA, but is quite balanced and drinkable. The aftertaste is actually sweet. This is a beer I'd enjoy more on tap..."
"Nice deep gold with a tight thin white head. The smell has lots of powdery sweet malt and even more grapefruit. Very faint pine needles and lemons. Hm its bitter. Almost unexpectedly. I want more of the underlying notes of bitter pine, bitter grapefruit, and tart lemon rind to come to the front, but its not. Im not sure about this one. The bitterness is drinkable, but not the best."
"Alright, we had to lighten things up a bit after that Bell's batch 10,000. That is a brutal beer. Poured into a Weyerbacher pint glass."
"A crisp light golden color with a half thumbs width cream colored head. An awesome sweet tropical fruit component from the hops and a nice malt underbelly give this a fantastic aroma. Flavor is really nice with the pleasantly sweet tropical fruits showing themselves with some orange on top the malt underbelly along some grassiness. Moderate to medium bitterness to this. A creamy, crisp mouthfeel. Overall, everything I want in an IPA this one offers. Definitely one of the best IPA's I have tried, wish this could make it out to Colorado."
"12 oz bottle, Erin brought it back from Ohio."
"Thanks to CruisaC for the generous extra. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours a translucent amber with a fizzy, quarter inch, white head. Head eventually settles into a oily slick, with a tight band around the shoulders. The nose on this beer is fantastic! Tropical fruit is prominent off the bottle pop and is present off the pour; however, caramel & toffee dominate once the brew settles in the glass. Taste consistent with nose; however, an earthy, rind-like character cuts through the caramel and finishes with a light, lingering bitterness. Tropical fruit presence is also a bit more diminished. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive carbonation that falls just shy of prickly. There's also a slightly oily texture to the consistency. Overall, a very good IPA. I really enjoyed this beer, but perhaps it might be just a little too malt forward - not in a bad way whatsoever, but I think it might slightly detract from the hops complexities."
Not sure on the freshness. I was told it is less than two months old. May as well give it a go. 12oz bottle into Duvel tulip.
Thanks to AndrewK for sharing this one at his tasting.
"On-tap at the Brew Kettle in Strongsville, OH..."
"Had this on 2012-06-22 in Columbia, PA. It was bottled less than a week ago."
Delivered fresh in a growler from my Cleveland buddy Jason...thanks!
Had it on tap and bottle. Pours a beautiful semi-
Thanks Steasy66. 12 oz bottle split between two people.
"12oz bottle received via Growling at the Moon from bb8189. Thanks for the brew, Brian!"
"Juicy citrus character, supple caramel sweetness, and dry hop bitterness carry this beer from the initial aroma until the long-linger of crisp citrusy bitterness in aftertaste. This beer astounds at every corner."
A - Opened the bottle and it poured a deep orange with a white head...about a finger worth. some visible carbonation.
Poured into a tulip.
"12 oz bottle poured into Ommegang flute, absolutely gorgeous transparent golden bronze color with about a 1/2"" of white bubbly head with a constant amount of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom center to the top, head quickly reduced to a little ring with minimal lacing."
"Bottled 2/15, sampled early April. Poured into Duvel tulip."
"12oz bottle, courtesy of pest (thanks Andy!), into a 7venth Sun snifter. "
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. None to very little head or lacing. Very hoppy and citrus aromas, maybe some pine. Hops are dominant on my tongue... a very light coating otherwise very thin in taste. Overall not bad for an American Ipa. Would like to try this as a draft."
"A - Pours a medium bright orange gold, crystal clear, and a layer of soapy looking foam and no carbonation."
A - Nice light orange color. Relatively clear. Quarter finger of head with a conservative pour.
4/13/2012
A: Slightly hazy orangey amber in color. Forms a moderate sized creamy white head that reduces fairly quickly to a thick ring around the edges and a patchy surface coating. Some light lacing. 
"A: One-finger head, kinda fizzy... clear golden/orange color, moderate to heavy carbonation. Good lacing. "
Thanks to pest for this brew. Poured 12 oz into FFF pint glass.
"For my 499th review, I have a nice surprise from local brewer, Brew Kettle. #498 was a bummer in a can from Finch's, but this was great before it hit my lips. The nice ""floral"" aroma hits before you can take a sip, true to the style."
Definitely not a favorite from the Brew Kettle. 
Poured from a bottle into my bells tulip glass. 
Thanks Adamb!
"Reviewing the White Rajah from The Brew Kettle Production Works. I had this beer a couple of months ago for the first time, but that bottle was noticeably stale."
"Pours a clear amber with two fingers of golden white head that lingered until the bottom of my glass. Nose is pure hop awesomeness, floral, sweet citrus, honey, and pineapple. The taste is like the smell, 100% hop, with a bitter aftertaste that doesn't overpower. Carbonation is appropriate for the style, and mouthfeel was slightly creamy. Overall, this is an excellent west coast style IPA."
"served in a Kiuchi ""pint"" glass. sampled on 9.22.11 and reviewed from notes."
Crystal clear golden body with stark white head. Good contrast. 
Thanks to MarkIntihar for including this as an extra to me!
From notes. Poured from a growler into a tulip.
thanks for giving me this beer last night duff27!
A - Pours a super clear golden-orange with a finger of frothy slightly off-white head. Head fades at a normal pace leaving behind some nice lace.
12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass at slightly-cooler-than-cellar temperature.
Pours clear orange with a 1.5 finger white foamy head with good retention and spotty lacing.

Thanks to Chris for sharing this one.
Had this on tap at a local pub.
"Got this in a trade. Straight outta the box, into the fridge, and straight into my Hill Farmstead tulip."
Bottle courtesy of TomTwanks. Thank you for opportunity to drink a long lasting want.
this pours a clear dark amber to brown with a white head that hangs around for quite a bit. the smell oh boy the smell! this is the best part of this solid brew. it hits you with a stong mango note with some carmel hints as well. the taste is deffinatly fruity. i'm pulling out some mango and pineapple. the malt character in this is slightly stong for an IPA but not bad. it is nice and refreshing in the mouth. overall i am a big fan. i like the fruitiness and crisp hop finish of this one.
"Poured from a bottle into my Deschutes tulip, reviewed from notes taken while the site was down."
"Poured a Clear rustic Orange with a light white head, small head, but a fine foam lasted through out the glass. Smells like a hop bomb, Grapefruit...and some sweetness on the end. Tastes as it smells, but better. Full Citrus Hop explosion, Grapefruit, Orange Peel, and a light sweet malt kiss, just for good measure....keeping with the east coast IPA’s. Hard to believe its not a Double IPA. Delicious."
1108th Review on BA
After having this one several times now I am ready to give this one a review. Now starting off I have to say that this one is a little hard to review because I have noticed some variance in flavor between bottles in the same six pack. 
Thanks to ChrisPro for the share.
Beer shared by Huhzubendah- Thanks Matt!
"Brilliant, crystal clear glowing orange bodied IPA. Bone white fluffy head, two fingers worth, rests atop. The head works its way back rather slowly, ultimately leaving a slim cap floating atop. Spotty lacing left cemented to the walls of the glass. The appearance is top notch, I am not sure how one would improve upon this."
"12oz bottle with no freshness date. Come on Brew Kettle, White Raja is certainly worthy of a bottled on date!"
"12 oz bottle, thanks to Dan for sharing this. "
"The beer appears orange and fairly hazy. The head is pure white and measures about a quarter inch, leaving ample lacing on the walls of the pint glass. The aroma is quite nice, with notes of grapefruit and pine resin. The flavor brings a healthy bitterness, with lingering tangy grapefruit in the finish. The body is thin, even a bit watery. Overall, a very good beer. I would certainly have this again."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, orange and pineapple like citrus. In the taste, orange and pineapple like citrus hops. A small hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine and citrus hop in the aftertaste. BIG HOPS! Big citrus and a small dry pine, quite enjoyable."
American IPAs are the beers that got me started loving craft brewing. This is a notable example of what happens with a commitment to a style of beer from a great brewery. Thanks Matt for picking this up for me.
A- Body is a completely transparent light orange hue. Body is somewhat bright in color and carbonation bubble can be seen rising to the top. Pours with about a 1 finger foamy white head that has good retention at 1.2 finger. Little to no lacing is left behind in the glass.
Appearance- pours a clear bright copper/orange hue with a finger of white head that clings to the glass with every sip.
Thanks to TomTwanks for sending me a 6er of this; thanks Tom! Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into my Bell's tulip.
"Tough to find in NW Ohio, but I did it! From a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Nice hoppy, citrusy smell and orange/honey color -- gonna be a good one. Yes it is! Pleasantly bitter with a taste of pine, grapefruit, orange, and just enough funk. Deserves to be in the top 100. And it is! How'd I know?!"
Many thanks to beerhan for running this one down for me. Cheers!

"Thanks to IrishColonial for bringing a growler of this over last night. It poured a clear, orange amber color with a thin white lacing scattered across the top of the beer and sticking to the edges of the glass. "
"Aroma: Powdery lemon zest, oranges, and floral hop notes pop out of the glass. Powerful and aggressive American hop aromatics that continue to remind me of candied oranges. Minimal sweet caramel malt aroma blends with the citrusy hop aromatics. Clean fermentation character."
"Poured into a standard pint. This one is super fresh, only about 10 days old. Thanks to frenchblood21 for the hookup!!"

"Undated bottle, just delivered from OH."
Poured from a bottle into my Duvel tulip.
"golden amber, light hue with a mild fluffy head to it. smells of honey and gum with a strong floral nose. delicious, but not as pleasant as the nose, to me. tastes of rose/grass/earth with a slight sweetness to it and very sharp bitterness at the end. nice carb, light bodied. Crisp, refreshing."
"I've been drinking this for the better part of the day, okay I've only had like three or four but they're incredible. I loved the beer on tap but the bottles as fresh as these must be amazing. Please let my local store get a steady supply of these why would I want other beers when this is coming in to the area. "
"what a pleasant surprise, thanks to crushedvol!"
"A finger of almost white head sits atop a coppery-amber body, but not for long. It dissipates to a ring and a light dusting in a couple of minutes, and enough light lacing clings to the glass during consumption to please the eye. A small amount of bubbles are noted rising to the top of this nice translucent beer."
"Live Review. Poured from the 12 oz. single that was given to me by the fine folks at Save-On Tobacco & Beverage in Mentor, Ohio simply for being a good customer (believe me, the pleasure is mine!) into a clean, clear pint glass. Price tag still stuck on the cap indicates $1.85. No observed “best by” date."
Served in a pint glass. Thanks duff27!
"12oz bottle, thanks Mark"
Almost feel bad getting this review in as I am ultimately cutting into my own supply of this stuff!
"This brew is a brightly shining crystal clear amber in color. The white head that develops tops off at just over a finger in height and leaves a thick, compact foam when it dissipates a bit, which itself leaves fairly hefty deposits of lacing behind."
Served this 12 oz. brown bottle in a Sam Adams glass. No date. The body was bright golden honey with an off-white head. There was a lot of carbonation rising from the etching in the glass. Very pretty.
Golden orange with a centimeter of white head. 
"Presentation: Thanks to my drinking buddy DoctorDog for providing a six pack of this. Managed to keep my wife from drinking this one. Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Label is predominantly green, yellow and white and has a British jack center with the words White Rajah superimposed and a starburst pattern around. No clear freshness date."

"I finally found this on the shelves of one of my local shops. A 12oz. bottle poured into my DFH sniffer. Smells like 5-Alive fruit punch. Wow, this might be the best IPA I have ever tasted. This is a dry, bitter, citrus bomb. Loads of grapefruit and mango. No trace of the 7% ABV, very well hidden. This is a world class IPA."
Live tasting review.
"12oz bottle poured into Alchemist pint glass. No bottle date present, but my assumption is pretty darn fresh. Special thanks to beerhan for this one!"
"A: Very orange in color, maybe a hint of gold orange color to it. But very orange."
"Agressive pour leaves a3 finger, bubbly white head on this crystal clear pale gold colored beer."
No freshness info.
"Thanks to CaptCleveland, a recent (& hopefully future) trader who jammed this little gem as an extra into a recent box. "
Poured into a perfect pint.
White Rajah pours a copper color. Looks mostly clear. A little light gives it orange highlights. It’s topped with a vanilla colored head that rises to nearly two fingers in depth. It takes quite a while to completely dissipate. Waves of sticky lace cling to the glass as it descends. Looks good.
Big thanks to seeswo for yet another outstanding brew
I had this at a tasting in the home of finewinemike. Poured into a Chimay goblet.
Do you like hops?? you better if you wrestle with this one.

"big thanks to beerhan for sending this as an extra! poured this into a pilsner glass (because i can, and i like the way a beer looks in a pilsner glass), pours a cloudy yellowish orange with a full finger of thick white head that leaves big clumps of lacing. smells like a tropical citrisey punch with a kick. tastes like a glass full of grapefruit and other tropical fruits, just plain delicious! mouthfeel is slightly oily with a bitter bite and an extremly smooth finish. this is one hell of an ipa. gotta trase for more and so should you."
A proud brew out of my home state!

"Bottle poured into a DFH snifter, thanks to Thorpe for giving this to me as an extra. At the time of this review, this beer is the #6 top American IPA and is flirting with the top 100, currently the #79 beer on the Top Beers - United States list. Just a few away from the cutoff, unfortunately except for providing one more review for it, my review probably won't help its stats."
Thanks to CaptCleveland for the 6-pack! 12oz bottle poured into an imperial nonic. 
"A: Pours a hazy golden color, white head. Sticky lacing, nice rings."
"big thanks to a great trader for this fresh puppy. It went from the box into the fridge and in 1 hour it was cracked and down my stomach. From a 12oz bottle it pours a see through gold color with a white. The smell is citrus and fresh fruits and hops super fresh!!! If it smells as good as it tastes I’m gonna be bummed because this is my onlt (lol). WOW, this beer is so deiciouslly balanced and you taste the fruit up front with a hop finish. The taste of this beer totally lives up to the hype of the smell!!!! Super bummed that I only have had one because I could drink this one over and over and over again. Thanks Bitter!!!"
"White rajah pours a light, golden hue with no haze. A two finger head forms with no effort and leaves thin lacing as it recedes. The label reads: ""taming the savage hop""."
I give you my first ever 100% 5.0 review...
Huge thanks to beerhan for this doozy!

"12 oz. bottle into a snifter, thanks to ColdPoncho. No best by/bottled on date."
Thanks to Ryan011235 for this 12 ounce bottle and the DFH snifter taking its maiden voyage with White Rajah. Hazy golden amber with just about a finger of off-white foam. OK retention with a bit of scattered lacing.
Reviewed from notes:
I received this bottle in an in person trade with eyeenjoybeer this past Friday. Thanks Michael!
"Thanks to Sean for sharing this at Zwanze Day 2011. Served in a Cantillon glass, before it was unexpectedly poured out by an over-zealous employee. Thankfully I was able to get a refill."
Bottle courtesy of exitmusic00. You're the man Matt.
"Pours a clear golden with a nice frothy head that's a plus, a full 2 fingers and durable leaving a lot of lace and hop oils on the glass."
"deep orange amber, and absolutely crystal clear. There was a radiance about it that was outstanding. Tons of carbonation rippling up toward the surface, three-inch head of white foam formed on the top settled down into a nice one finger high pillow"
Pours a crystal clear golden orange. perfect frothy white head. This beer looks incredible!
A: Pours a nice honey color with good clarity. I managed a 1.5 finger pillowy white head. Nice lacing.
On tap at flipdaddy's burgers and beers
Big news to have this stellar brew now in bottles.
"A - beautiful copper/straw/golden body with a big offwhite head. Very pretty color, good head...doesn't get better than this."
Bought multiple 6-packs of this stuff from Jungle Jim's and plan on savoring the stuff over the next few weeks. 
"A - Pours a very light orange/amber, very clear and transparent, great 1.5 finger. Bubbly and leaves a lot of good lacing."
12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Bottle lists this as 6.8% ABV and 70 IBUs.
A - Lightly hazed and the color of straw. One of the lighter brews of this style. Pours with a fluffy white head which leaves lacing all over the glass.
Review from notes: 9/4/11
A- Pours a light golden color - a bit lighter than I was expecting based on the style. No haze at all. Light on the lacing as well 
"Pours a apple-juice golden with a nice white head. Looks really good. As soon as the bottle open, an aroma of piney and tropical hops make their way out. A bit of biscuit malts as well. Very nice! The taste is very similar to blind pig. Strong grapefruit and piney hop flavor up front with a middle of biscuit malt and bitterness and a finish of more of a grapefruit, tropical hop flavor. Really interesting and quite good. This is really a tasty brew with some serious hop flavor. The mouthfeel is medium, with medium carbonation. I really like this beer a lot, especially if I could get it regularly around here. One of the best flyover IPAs I've had which can compete with, though probably not beat, the best of the west coast. I had this quite fresh and it is unknown how well it holds up. Enjoy!"
Pours a clear dark golden with a white head.
"I've been waiting to try this for a while now, hope it's as good as everyone tells me it is! 12 ounce bottle, 6.8% ABV. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear golden/orange color with an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention is excellent, and there's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. The grapefruit aroma is strong in this brew. There's also some tropical fruit, lemon peel, pine hops and a bit of bready malt. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma. The citrusy hop flavors dominate, and there's also some pine hops and a bit of bready malt flavors noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has good carbonation. This is a pretty good brew, I wasn't disappointed at all. At $10.99 a 6-pack, I think it's worth every penny."
Served on-tap into a tulip glass at Senate in Cincinnati.
Had this on tap at TBK in a pint glass. Pours a clear golden copper color with a minimal white head. 
"Sampled on draft at Paxton's in Loveland, OH."
Brew Kettle : White Rajah
From 64oz growler to Bruges hybrid glass on 7/12/11
"Draft to pint. Looks great; not too dark, not too light. Smells great too; fresh hops and citrus. Tastes good; light and hoppy . Mouthfeel is excellent; the easiest drinking 7.1% beer I've ever had. I'd probably have given it a 5, but it's just so different from a normal IPA. Overall, a great beer that I'll be having again - in about 5 minutes when I get up to order another :)"
A- Pours a lighter gold color with a slight bit of haze and a fairly small white head. Head has pretty solid retention and leaves just a bit of lacing at best. 
Poured on tap at Vintage Estate
Enjoyed on tap in a pint glass at The Brew Kettle.
"On tap at bw3 in troy, ohio. Have been seeing thiis on tap more and more places lately, along with other TBK beers, which I am very happy about."
"Ok, I've had this one a few times.. time to give it its due. I still haven't had this one from the bottle, haven't gotten around to the brewpub.. I hear it's somewhat rare in the bottles, hopefully that changes. Anyways, pours a nice golden, nice white head, sticky lacing. Ok, this is definitely one of the best noses ever. Lots of pineapple, apricot, and mango. Amazing! Tons of citrus. Slight amount of pine. Amazing flavors, straight dank; extremely tropical! Great use of citra. Great mouthfeel, extremely smooth, right amount of carbonation; finishes dry. Alcohol goes unnoticed. This is impossible to stop drinking! WOW! Bottle this in sixers and watch what happens! This is the best batch I've had thus far."
Served on tap into a shaker glass at the Brew Kettle
Pours a deep copper with a two inch rocky slightly off white head. Great retention.
On tap at the Brew Kettle.
"Wow, this was a really good IPA. I’ve heard a lot of buzz in homebrewing circles regarding Citra hops (sold out a lot of places) and I have to say I didn’t understand the buzz until I tasted this beer. A light orange body that is clear but not brilliant under a soft white head. Aroma is very citrus-y with a lot of pineapple notes. Bitterness is quite apparent but not harsh in any way. This beer has got its IBUs in all the right places to make it extremely drinkable. Mouthfeel was smooth and good. This was a very good beer. I had this on-draft at Rozi’s Wine house in Lakewood."
"22oz bottle courtesy of thegrogbog (thanks Tim!). Apparently this won an IPA contest at Fatheads, but I also heard that Fathead's beers weren't included in the competition so this shouldn't indicate any position over Headhunter. Still a good accomplishment for the Brew Kettle though."
Received this bottle via an in-person trade a Jackie O's. Thanks Paul! Poured from the bottle into a Foothills pilsner glass. 
"Pours a slightly hazy oranigsh color with a frothy three finger head which reseds to a tight skin and gives way to good lacing up and down the glass. The aroma is fantastic big earthy and piney hop smell balanced out with a nice citrus smell. The flavor is like the nose, a nice beefy hop character of earth and pine the citrus brings a great balance to the flavor. The mouthfeel is well carbonated. The drinkability is very high and easy drink with a great nose and a complex tatse that keeps you wanting more."
Amazing find on tap at the swig in perrysburgs.
On tap in a pint glass at Bodega on 11/3/10
Generously received this brew from jampics2 in a recent trade. I must admit that I've never heard of The Brew Kettle but apparently this brew did quite well against some big named IPA's. Drank from my Minneapolis Town Hall Weizen glass.
On tap at Bodega. Part of a featured line up from The Brew Kettle. 
"On tap at the Fat Heads IPA festival. 7%, 78 IBU. This beer won the belt for IPA and best overall beer at this festival, a HUGE accomplishment for TBK. The beer's still being tweaked a bit, but is described as:"
"32oz growler filled at the brewery hours ago. Pours a murky burnt orange color with no head. Trace amounts of lacing. The aroma is a sweet blend of mango, papaya, peaches and green tea. The taste is tons of ripe and juicy peaches with mango and papaya. Slightly herbal and piney towards the finish but the main flavor I get is the peach. Lightly toasted malts peek through at the end along with more herbal/piney notes. Mouthfeel is my only issue since there seems to be very little carbonation but it doesn't hurt it very much. Dry. Overall, a solid IPA I'll grab again."
"Pours a beautiful light amber with lovely, opaque yeast suspension. Smells like a tropical fruit basket: strawberries, peaches, mango. The taste is juicy, but not in an unpleasantly sweet way. A natural burst of fruit flavor atop a delightfully pungent hop punch. The best part of the beer is the finish: too many juicy IPAs finish sweet but this goes dry at just the right time, leaving your lips puckering and needing another sip. Simply my favorite Conmecticut IPA and a perfect example of what a single hop beer can be."
"Another great offering from Steady Habit Brewing. These guys know what they're doing. Pours hazy, 1"" pillow head. Tropical, fruity notes. Pineapple, mango and papaya. The Mosaic is very evident. I already see myself finishing off both 750 ml bottles tonight. Do yourself a favor if you're in the central CT area and swing by Steady Habit."
Yet another very solid hoppy offering from Steady Habit. I really like what they have going on over there and will be sure to stop by to try everything they put out.
"The smell is really amazing, and the taste follows suit. The mosaic hops create a myriad of tropical flavors ranging from citrus and mango, to pineapple and papaya. Poured fresh from a growler it didn't leave much head (strangely), and the mouthfeel was a tad too thin. I would like to revisit this one for a second opinion, but the smell and taste were above reproach. Definitely worth seeking."
"Popped the flip top bottle and the aroma of fresh hops filled the immediate space around me. I knew this was going to be good. Poured a bright yellow-orange with a thick 1” white head into SHBC snifter. I let this growler sit for a few weeks and it clarified the brew somewhat, so the glass of beer was shimmering. The mosaic hop character is potent and distinct, yet clean. Tropical zesty citrus goodness, almost candy-like. I honestly couldn’t take my nose away from the glass. Such a pleasant and alluring aroma. "
L: Bright and hazy straw color with fluffy white head. Thick sticky lacing.
750ml growler split 2 ways into tekus. 
Growler from SH today.
The amount of mosaic used really shows. The nose on this beer is beer is amazing and the taste matches. great mouthful which reminds me of every great new england style ipa. This will be one I want every time its on tap.
"This beer poured out as a hazy yellow color, white head, good lacing and retention. The smell is awesome, loads of Mosaic hops (which I love), The taste is also very good, nice fruity bitterness with a subtle sweetness to balance it out. The feel of the beer is smooth and very drinkable. Overall it's a great IPA from a small CT brewery."
"Yum! This is a delicious showcase of the Mosaic hop. Bright and complex with a great dank mango flavor going on, excellent bitter/dry finish. "
Pours beautiful clear straw gold. Smells of hops. Drinks smooth with hoppy bitter taste throughout. Very drinkable.
"11/2/18 (Okemos, MI): 16 oz canned 10/2/18 3:25, multiple pours into snifter, gift from brother. Light golden pour, fluffy head, heavy carbonation, leaves nice white lacing. Light citrus aroma and balanced taste, slightly sweet citrus, bitter dry hops, excellent. Mouth feel creamy, very smooth, carbonation holds well. Overall very good IPA."
Absolutely a disappointment
"Had on tap. Finally got to try this after years of keeping an eye out. Was worried it wouldn't stand up to the ipas of today, I was happy to be proven wrong. As much as I love dry hopped ipas, this reminded me how much I loved wet hopped ones. The citra hops meld so well with the underlying caramel malts, giving you a burst of wet sweetness, that then is dominated by delicious hop bitterness. Good citrus fruit, grass and floral hops notes in smell as well. So much flavor for a single ipa."
"What a great beer, just ridiculously pricey in WI"
"Canned October 1st, 2018. Pours a slightly foggy amber with a thin white head. Smell is mostly dank hops with some citrus notes. Flavor has notes of grapefruit, pineapple, grass, and hop bitterness, all in abundance. Medium carbonation and body. Solid, very flavorful IPA, and I love Citra hops to boot, so this was the year to beat."
Can dated 10-1-18. Pours a clear honey yellow with a large white pillow of a head that lasts and leaves good lacing. Aroma is tropical fruit. Flavor is sweet ripe tropical fruit with a slight hop bitter finish. Feel is soft medium bodied. Overall a pretty nice beer without being too special. Expected more from a 4 day old beer from this brewery.
"Nice frothy head that leaves trails of lace, straw yellow."
Mosaic.
"Golden, a bit hazy in color. Creamy, fluffy white head. Apricot, pineapple, peach, pine, grapefruit, and honey very fresh aroma, full of juicy tropical fruits. What a delightful brew!"
"Wow, 8 years since I last had this one. Time for a re-review."
"There isn't a whole lot not to like about this beer. The big burst of hoppy aroma on opening the can tells you what's coming. Poured into a tulip glass from a 16-ounce can. Very pretty homey-colored pour, with a two-finger white head that settles into a thin cap. The note on the bottom of the can reads ""GET WET MOSAIC."" This sample was just under two months past the canning date. Intense hop character was still evident, with notes of pine resin up front and citrus and tropical fruit in the background. Good malt backbone, with enough sweetness to provide balance. Dry finish, with lots of resiny bitterness. Very well done, and an outstanding beer."
"Honey suckle, orange, pineapple and pine. Some floral grapefruit juice. Bit of caramel and biscuit malt. Medium bodied. Extremely balanced. Semi dry finish. Touch of sweetness. It's good."
"Gold in color with a faint sedimentary haze. There's an inch of densely packed, creamy beige on top. The aroma is of light crackery malt and piney hops. I'm tasting a sharply bitter piney hops and light crackery malt. The mouth is lightly resinous, crisp, and refreshing."
Mosaic version from 9/29/17.
16 oz can poured into a pint glass canned on 10/2.
"I guess its kind of difficult to accurately measure this beer given that the recipe changes big time for it each year. I think 2012 was the year I banged a 4 pack of this, other than that its been extras thrown around. "
"16 Oz can poured into a notice glass. The beer almost seemed visually thick when pouring and has a pillow white head. It is a very c learn beer, orange in color. Earth and citrus hits the nose but could be better, this beer is over 3 weeks old now. Some fresh clippings smell too. A little bitterness hits the tongue we Ithaca some earthy tastes too. Resinous coating on my tongue gives me a Chewy crisp mouthfeel."
2017 edition. Pours a hazy orange-gold with a dense and creamy white head. 
"A - Copper body, clear, with first can, a minimal head in the pour and no real lacing to speak of. Second offered fairly standard head, and nice lacing. My guess is the first was a bit of a bum can."
"Poured from a 16oz can into glass. Stamped canning date is 09/28/17, Also has 'GET WET MOSAIC' stamping on bottom of can. Described on the can as a 'West-Coast Style IPA'."
Meh. First time trying it. For 18.00 a four pack nothing special here.
"This year's version was great. I didn't like some of the years, but this one has a lot of resinous Mosaic in the taste and it is perfectly balanced by the nice light crackery malt backbone. Would buy lots if it weren't $20/4pack."
2017 edition. Mosiac. 6.1% there's not much to say but as amazing as always. Alotta hard work in this can and you can really taste it. Everything is perfectly on key.
2017 edition featuring Mosaic. Canned 10/2/17.
"2015 Simcoe 7.0% tasted in a Spiegelau glass from a 1 pint can in October 2015. 2017 Mosaic 6.1% abv tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pint can on October 10, 2017. Canned 10/02/17. Recommended."
"Glad it's back, the 2017 version is very very good."
"I think I'm the only person on earth who thinks that Surly offers mostly over-priced & over-rated beers. Just my opinion. But this is my favorite beer ever. Amazing flavor that is truly one-of-a-kind. Great balance. I had it on tap & it was all wow factor. $17 for 4 16 ounce cans is robbery, but I'll be willing to pay it."
"color pours out Straw with a copper hint. It has a heavy white head that sticks around. It is a very dry beer, definitely hop forward, but also some sweet. Feel is a little thin, but dry. Smell is floral, Nice."
Pours a kind of murky rusty golden yellow with a two finger head of foam.
"2015 year. Purfumey and boozy, slick, heavy. Not a lot of wet hop character; no greenness or subtlety. Tropical but flat, rough. I'm a fan of most Surly IPAs but having been spoiled by the glorious wet hop beers in the Pacific Northwest, this does nothing to capture the magic of fresh hops."
Can dated 9/30:
"Consumed 11/27/15 with some memories of drinking this at the brewery about a month ago; I've received a strong recommendation from Goblinmunkey7 to not review this can, as it is a bit old (9/29), but this suggestion has only bolstered my determination to review - hopefully I will update this for the 2016 iteration"
"I was expecting a lot better. Watery, some earthy hops, not that bitter."
"This is a fantastic tasting, very unique IPA. The overall hoppiness is a little more subdued, maybe because the hops are never given a chance to dry out as the description on the can states. Either way, flavors of citus, tropical fruit and sweet malt come through. Just flat out delicious."
2015
Type: 16-oz. can 
"Light copper pour, moderate clarity, and sticky white head that clings down the glass. Pine and resin on the nose, along with some grassiness, lemon, and bready malt. Slightly more subdued than expected, but some hop aroma has likely already faded. The flavor follows exactly, plenty of piney, resinous goodness with hints of grass, lemon. A very balanced beer. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate high carbonation. A nice dry finish. A very nice wet hopped beer!"
"The beer has a light orange color. The aroma is malty. The taste is piney bitterness, grassy, tropical fruits, and some malt. One of the better wet hop beers"
"Poured from the tallboy can into a becker. Pours golden clear with a one finger head. Has a sweet spicy scent. Feels foamy in the mouth almost like the beer is not there. Sort of a sour, bitter, chunky hops taste. Bit of a can smell after a while, but overall tasty and a little different."
L (4.5) - Very nice dark amber color and big pile of off white foam on top. 
Pours a bright translucent gold. Few finger head that quickly dissipated but a layer of foam film remains. Smell of wet hops is unmistakable. Nice tropical dank with a hint of malt. Taste is similar. Dank upfront with some fruit rind and then a nice mellow bitter. Great feel. Super smooth with the added wet feel reminiscent of drinking a red wine. Great beer.
"Can. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a very nice, thick, consistent head. Aroma out of the can is actually much better than from a glass. The nose doesn't blow doors off but you get some inviting citrus, dry malt and mango hops with some light grass. Flavor is clearly better. It possesses a really tangy, citrusy, grapefruity, orangey hoppiness. Almost tart. Then you get some more of the nuances from the hops. The malt is drier than many but still offers a bit of sweetness for balance. I enjoy the flavors from the hops in this beer. Hops almost taste a bit peachy, too. Medium body with some potent bitterness. Been a long wait for this one and I know the recipe or at least the hop varietals change year-to-year but this year was quite tasty."
"From notes, at the beer hall in the last few days of September, into a snifter."
Received this as an extra in a trade. Canned on 9/29/15.
16 oz can dated 09/29/2015
"16oz tall can ""CANNED ON 09/29/15 F3079"""
"TONS of white grape must in the nose, smells like I'm walking in a vineyard there's so much grape. Flavor is actually pretty well balanced, maybe could use more malt to back up how fruit forward the hops are. The most white grape I've ever gotten in a Simcoe hopped beer. Could've sworn it was Nelson Sauvin. (2015 vintage)"
Excellent beer. Received as part of a BIF.
"16oz can, canned 9/26/15, poured into a snifter "
Thanks to Jeff for this one. 16oz. can into a Grrrz teku. Shared with schen9303. 
Look: Nice looking beer. Yellow-orange with a thick white head. 
"Canned on 09/29/15. Only a month old. Poured into a pint glass. Almost clear gold with a one inch head. Flakes of sediment float throughout. Decent lacing. Not much in the smell. Grass, lemon, and citrus. Taste follows. Not very bitter and has a sweet malty taste with slight grapefruit in the finish. Creamy and smooth feel. Good beer but a little disappointed. The rating was a 95? Definitely think that is too high."
"16oz can, dated 9.30.15, poured into a Surly Darkness tulip glass."
"Poured from a 16 oz tallboy into a clear glass tulip. Canned on 09/24/15 on bottom of can. Lugged by my parents from IA -- thanks M&D, that's love."
Excited to try this one. 16 oz. can into a tulip. Dated 9/25/15 so about 5 weeks old.
A: light golden honey color with no haze. It has moderate carbonation and a very thin white head.
"Canned on 29 Sept and enjoyed on 16 Oct. Medium dark with heavy head which stays around with good lacing. Nice, fresh hops aroma drifts up. Taste is clean and clear, piney and resinous. Long, lingering aftertaste. A wonderful fall alternative to the pumpkins and Marzens."
Fresh sour taste and smell.
Thanks to jason83 for this one!
Poured from a 16oz. can into s Surlyfest stein.
This stuff is the nectar of the gods. Since it's seasonal I anticipate its arrival every year. Unfortunately Surly did not release it in 2014 as they were transitioning their production to their new brewery. If you're a native Minnesotan or just visiting definitely check out the new Surly brewery complex. Great food as well.
"they didnt make this last year, and apparently the locals and folks in the know are giving this a hard time for being not as good as it has been in the past, maybe a product of their size in the new place, i dont know, and i dont pay that much credence, as this is a wonderful beer, my fist during an awesome week in minnesota, literally right from the plane to the bar, and a pint in my hand. its nice looking beer, but not way out of the ordinary. orange hue, relatively clear, a little grain weight, nice white head. smells juicy and pungent, and im not real sure what people are talking about. i cant imagine this being a whole lot more aromatic, its beautiful, and the freshness of the hops is obvious with a pineapple and sweet oil thing going on, and a lot of resin in the feel. the flavor is a little mild compared to the nose, but i dont need to be kicked in the mouth with it sometimes, and the flavor, not the intensity of it, is what this beer is all about. hints of tangerine and wet grass, lots of oily feel, and a little grain sweetness to balance it out. mild red pepper, which i have been getting in a lot of wet hops beers this year, but its not distracting. drank this way too quickly too, some alcohol in this one! this is one of those old rarities that really isnt anymore, but a beer i have always wanted to try since i first found out it existed. it was nice to realize the dream, and its worth the hype."
Happy to get to taste this.
"Not a bad looking orange and amber body. The head is white, sticky, and foamy. After the breakdown of the head, there are some really unique looking clumps of dense foam. I also really appreciate the artwork on the can. It is basic, bold, and manly looking. Nice and light, fruity aromas of tangerine, nectarine, peach, and light tropical fruit. The taste is similar to the smell and is very nicely balanced, no tang. The fruity hop flavors properly meld into a very fine taste. The sweetness is under control. For me, this beer ends with a nice honeydew melon and hop taste. Feel - Nice lighter than not body. Almost crisp in the mouth. Nice dense foamy action in the chomper."
Pint can:
Pours a hazy golden color with an orange hue and about a finger of off-white head.
Appearance – The beer was a golden copper color with a bubbly white head. 
"Tallboy poured into a clear Solo cup. Hey, I'm at the train station."
3 week old canned poured into a pint glass. Clean dark blonde or light orange body with a nice full white head. Nose is fairly muted with hints of grass and pine. The body is clean and emits a west coast style slick mouthfeel. The flavor is non-descript. I don't know if the hops are already falling off after 3 weeks or if they just weren't that pronounced. No flaws outside of the lack of flavor and hop punch especially at the price point.
Canned on 9/30. 
2015 canning; dated 9/25/2015. Poured into a Surly goblet.
2015-10-18
"Look: Clear Orange, white head"
I had really high hopes for this beer after everything I've read about past brews. Sad to say I was really let down with Wet (although Surly makes the amazing Todd the Axeman and therefore will always holds a top spot in my heart). 
"Pours to a nice light copper to straight amber color with a two finger white head that laces well. Smells like German malts with a touch of lemon - no hops detected. Tastes nothing like it should - plenty of lemony maltiness and not much else. Finishes with some faint, lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side as is the carbonation. Surly has missed big time with this beer. It tastes nothing like I would expect - more like a semi-hopped up lager. And at $17 ... well let's just say I am not happy."
"The fact that I destroyed the four pack in under 24 hours says a lot about how I feel about this one. Fresh is the one word that I'd use to describe it. Crystal clear with strong foam and carbonation. Hop smell and taste is superstrong, but surprisingly not overpowering. Just a mild bit of bitterness on the aftertaste. Crisp, refreshing, juicy, and extremely well-balanced. Did I say fresh? One of the best beers I've had in a while."
2015 Version:
"Pours clear bright orange, thick fluffy head with good retention. Smells of light toasty malt, flowers. The taste is very different, light malty sugar with grassy leafy hops, like a hoppy sweet tea taste. Very clean, refreshing. Finish is wet, grassy, crisp. Bitterness lingers. Mouthfeel is light, but slick. Overall not what I was expecting, very different tasting IPA, but very tasty."
"Just cracked open my first can. Nose is semi-sweet hops, piney, resiny some citrus notes. Nose kinda reminds me of Sierra Nevada hoppy beers actually. Taste sorta follows the nose but also includes some malty sweetness and a nice bunch of bitterness that lingers a bit. Finish is biscuity malt and some sweet, piney hops flavors. Mouthfeel is medium...a little sticky."
"Overall a disappointing beer. Was expecting tropical, but got a lot of cat pee dank and a stickiness to the malts that was out of balance. Nothing distinctive about the fresh hopping, very middle of the road"
Look = 4.0 Pours a clear golden orange with 3 fingers of crisp white head; some floating sediment in this pour. Great head retention and lace.
"2015 version. Interesting beer from Surly. Tastes a little light for an IPA IMO. Not necessarily a bad thing here though. Hops come through very smoothly with some effervescence in the beer. Think this is good, though atypical for the style. That's not a knock against it though."
Served in a seidel at my dad's cuz he doesn't give a shit about glassware.
"Crisp clear orange color. Nose is fairly light. Taste is a smooth bitter. Finish is juicy, like a hopped tea. The feel and finish make the beer, a solid beer worth trying."
"Beguiling. I wanted the hammer, but Surly said no. no. You must dance with this one and be rewarded. Often plain. Sometimes rough. Sweet grape. Pinecones."
"Holy crap. Might as well suck on a hop. Canned 9/25, this Wet is dripping with hop goodness. Picked up a single can for about $5. Being my first wet hopped beer I didn't want to get crazy. The pour is beautiful, the nose—pretty weak. Almost smells like a Hoppy Pabst. Seriously. Taste is great. Resiny, weedy, piney, dank, and delicious. I will definitely seek more wet hopped beers. Very good overall."
Got the last 2 4 packs at Woodmans in Menomonee Falls. Poured into pint glass.
Very flavorful.
"Smell is a grassy, almost woodsy kind of aroma - like rotting vegetation. Also smells of light dankness, pine, and sugar water. Taste is lemon, pine, citrus, with very light bitterness throughout. A really refreshing IPA."
"2015. This beer pours a slightly hazy mellow honey color with a average but lasting head. The aromas are lemon peel, mango, guava, pineapple, and grapefruit. The flavor is fairly fruity, mostly tropical, with a nice citrus kick, and a strong but quickly fading burst of bitterness. The mouthfeel is somewhat thick. Overall this is a very enjoyable IPA. In past years fresh hop beer have not bee my favorites, but they are starting to grow on me now. This one is frighteningly juicy and well balanced."
"Although there is a very obvious lack in aroma, the flavor makes this beer worth coming back to. Dank and slightly piney with a beautiful grapefruit-ish finish, there is a very pleasant lingering bitterness that carries the beer through the taste. As I've come to expect from Surly, this is an exceedingly easy drinking beer that betrays its ABV by being so smooth. It's gone before I even know it."
"Filtered IPA, muted flavor and aroma...the aroma and taste that is there is of dank dry grass with cat pee...mmmmm"
"This one is very difficult for me to describe. It's full of fresh vegetable odor. It's resinous fresh hop flavor, go figure."
"2015. Light gold color, perfectly clear with thick white head that sticks around for a bit. Dank, but not overwhelming, hop nose. Medium-light body, easy-drinking, almost lager-like. Taste is piney, resinous, with a strong lingering bitterness."
"2015 offering, from a can to a glass."
"This beer is super dank, super hoppy. It's not like other IPAs that I've had. It almost smells grape-like with citrus. I am just dumbfounded by it as I don't know what to think yet, but I know it's tasty. My score my change."
"Pours a beautiful and lively one-finger head. The color is a lightish sort of amber, with slow upward moving bubbles. Just a beautiful looking brew. "
2015 version - exceptional. 100% simcoe.
"Poured from can into beer glass. Warm, orange in appearance with a half inch head. Smelled of mandarin oranges and fresh citrus, with the faintest smell of fresh hops. Complex, colorful taste that is extremely crisp and not bitter. Medium citrus and hop flavors."
Picked some up today at Total Wine in Bloomington - they had a bunch and it was flying out the door. Surly pricing $14.99 a four pack :(
"Had on tap at the Bryant Lake Bowl L: Brilliant straw gold with a thin white foam collar. S: Spice, herbs and fruit. T: Well developed hop flavors supported by a rich malty texture balance an assertive hop bitterness. F: Low medium body, high medium carbonation. O: Big hop flavors are well handled."
one of the best wet hop beers I've tried
Tall can received in trade with cfrancis - thanks!
"A big thanks to amerak for sending this to me as an extra. Poured out of a 16oz can into a tulip glass. Canning date is listed as ""09/12/13."""
"A - Pours a hazy glowing yellow straw color with a magnificent light tan/off white head. Retention is a 10, lacing is a 9+. Fantastic."
16 oz. canned poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed tulip glass. Canned on 9/12. Consumed on 11/9.
"Wet pours a copper color with a small but lacing head. There is a mellow hoppy aroma, that is sweeter then it is bitter. The taste has a nice mellow long lasting, drawn out hoppy flavor, nice and floral. Good solid body, good flavors, and very drinkable. Overall its a very nice beer, the ""wet"" hops do cause a different experince."
16oz Can
Date: 10/11/2013
Big thanks to Cyclone8 for sending this one down! Poured from 16 oz. can into a CCB pint glass.
Huge thanks to TheSevenDuffs for sending this beer as part of the fall Canbif.
"Bright neon hop green 16oz can that has the name of the beer in big ass bold white letters and ""Surly"" in smaller light yellow letters. The back of the can has a foamy black pint glass that contains a description of the beer. If you continue on to the right, you'll find the mandatory Govt. Warning. The bottom of the can contains a stamped canned on date of 9/12/13. This can was consumed on 9/27/13 Poured into my Surly Darkness Tulip. "
"Clear Orange color with a high amount of carbonation and a semi-foamy head. Aroma has some citrus hops, yeasts, biscuits, and malts.; Bit of an earthiness to it. Flavor has resiny hop bitterness, yeasts, biscuits, light caramel, malts and dry hops. Aftertaste is a fairly prominent bitter resin flavor. Body is moderate in weight and carbonation is fairly mild."
Appearance: The clear goldenstraw-colored liquid is capped by several inches of foam that leaves splashy lacing behind
"Pours a clear orange color with a thick, foamy head. Good retention and lacing. The aroma isn't very pronounced, citrus with hints of earthiness, biscuit and sweet malt. Bitter resiny hops hit the palate upfront followed by biscuit and caramel. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Overall, a very well crafted fresh hop beer. Not the hop bomb I expected, but a great mellow earthiness that opens nicely as it warms."
Thanks to drewone for sharing this one at GRG1313's tasting. 
16oz can (canned on 9/12/13) poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass.
Thanks to Ri0 for this gift. Pours a crisp clear straw/amber color/ Big fluffy white head with very very sticky lacing. Looks ipa-y :)
"2009/2010 Simcoe/Citra: Can courtesy of beerandogs. Pours a clear orange amber with a billowing, yellow, rocky head with great retention and some excellent fluffy lace. Aroma at first is dank hops, then floral hops, lemon zest, orange blossom, honeysuckle, sweet rolls. Big starfruit and raw mango peel start to show through. Taste is nutty bitter, oily, drying, fruity with a big chewy, sticky to near syrupy mouthfeel. Very intense chewy mouthfeel. No astringent bitterness. Massively rich and easy to love. "
poured 16oz can into snifter. Canned 9/12/13
Poured into tulip.
WOW!!! i was not epecting this years hop profiles to come in soo good!!! This beer was overall as delicious if not more delicious than last years... although not as resinous imo... the citrus tones of the centennial and cascade come through very well along with a malty backbaone.. and very nice dry finish... this beer is great was very hard to find sadly.. supposedly surly cut back on the production of this beer and i dont know why... its a great beer... hopefully they can make tons in the new brewery...5 thumbs up out of 5!!!
Poured from a can into a Boulevard tulip glass. 
"Another downgrade today. So sad. Wet 2015 is just disappointing all around. Still slightly resiny, but no punch anymore. I've already had numerous wethop offerings from the local market, and this is by far the worst. "
"A- Light golden color, medium low carbonation"
From notes.
Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip. Acquired as an extra in a trade from Surge1311. Thanks bud!
Surly Wet (2012 Vintage)
"Pours a bright, clean, golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is awesome! Fresh hops with pine and citrus. A good amount of orange and grapefruit. A hint of marijuana. Very light malt, quickly overcome by more hops. Taste is just as I was hoping it would be. Reminds me of some of the great IPAs I get here on the west side. Clean, crisp hops with just a tiny bit of malt. Has some familiar ""Sierra Nevada hoppiness"" to it. Lovely grapefruit, orange, lemon, and a hint of melon. Bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, and refreshing. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is another amazing hoppy beer from Surly. I really wish I could buy this beer here in California."
A-golden amber color with a nice off-white head and good lacing
A. Large white that's very frothy and has great retention. Body is completely clear copper orange-y and has some nice carbonation. A ton of lace is left and a rocky foamy slab is above the body. Looks fantastic.
"16 fl oz aluminum can served into a Dick's Last Resort Pilsner glass in me sister's gaff in low altitude Minneapolis, Minnesota. Reviewed live. Expectations are through the roof; I fancy me some Surly. No best before date. "
"16 oz can, canned on 10/04/12, poured into a pint glass. Major thanks to Brian for the hookup with this."
"Special Thanks to Irish763 for sending this one over to me. This beer poured out as a beautifully clear gold color with a fluffy white head on top. The retention and lacing are very good on this beer. The smell of this beer is incredible... I can pick up some of the freshest and juiciest citrus aromas. Packed with orange, some peach and grapefruit all come together on the nose with some subtle malt. The taste of the beer gives off lots of citrus flavors as well. It's very refreshing. The mouthfeel is light bodied it has a smooth feel to it with a very nice dry finish. Overall, this is excellent. I enjoy this beer a lot. Looking forward to have the rest of my 4 pack soon."
Canned 09/20/12. Tulip glass.
A- Light white head that laces glass nicely. Beer is golden/amber color.
"2012 Version, out of a pint glass. Canned on 10/1/2012"
"16 oz. can poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. Liquid is somewhere between brown and orange, sort of a gasoline color, maybe slightly darker. There is a nice fluffy white head with tiny bubbles that work their way up to the brim of the glass. The head takes forever to go away and a film stays on the top the whole session. This one took a while to pour out. The clarity is absolutely perfect in every aspect. This is an amazing looking beer, a perfect representation of an IPA in my opinion. Also, the can is pretty cool looking, I like the light green and it looks like a can shaped hop, if only...that'd be awesome. "
16oz can dated 10/04/2012 poured into DFH chalice.
"Reviewing the Surly Wet from Surly Brewing Company out of Minnesota. According to the beer's description, ""2,400 lbs of hops picked freshly in Oregon and shipped to Minnesota immediately. We brewed this beer three days later."" Last year's batch (2011) was made entirely with Citra hops. This year's batch was made with Simcoe hops only."
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip.
"Big white head and big lacing on a light golden head. Very fresh and drinkable. Leafy minty, hops in the finish that are moderately acidic but also well balanced with spice. Smooth mouthfeel otherwise. Look forward to next year's hops. "
"Thanks to Rutager again, the guy is unreal."
"A- Pours a gold yellow orange color, with a good very foamy and frothy head. White head goes as high as you let it. "
"A huge thank you to Steasy66 for getting this to me in record time ...only to be delayed on the last leg of its travel by a couple weeks. No matter, it's in my glass now and looking like the real deal."

16 oz. can poured into a Manchester United pint glass. Thanks to copyguyadam for this a four pack of this long-time want.
"Enjoyed fresh one day after canning. Appearance is typical IPA burnt orange almost amber. Noticed a good amount of carbonation and a thick frothy pillow like head that stays around for a good while. The aroma has hints of lemon like citrus and some pine. The taste is best described with one word... resinous. There is some citrus rind in the background, but resinous pine dominates. Overall I think this IPA is much more one dimensional than the previous reviews would indicate. The flavor profile is super hoppy and resinous without much else going on in my opinion. Definitely a good tasty brew and if resinous is your thing I would definitely reccomend trying to get your hands on this elusive beer."
2012 batch review. 1 week after being canned
"a beautiful clean amber pour, visible carbonation, 2 fingers of off-white creamy head causing lots of sticky lacing."
A: Clear golden orange with a half finger head that settles into small wisps atop the beer. Only a little lacing.

"Canned on 9/20/12, so nine days ago. Poured into an Irish Tulip Glass."
I had some at Surly Fest for volunteering and managed to find some in stores this week. Tough stuff to get a hold of.
"Let me first say i got to try this beer last year and it was AMAZING! Surly has chosen to forcus on the ""Simcoe"" hops this year rather than the ""Citra"" hops they used last year, im excited about this ""simcoe"" are one of my favs but so are ""citra""! all i'm hopin is that it has the same mouth feel as it did last year...that of a ""mouthwatering"" effect as you drink it!! I've had a ton of i.p.a.'s in the last year (singles, doubles, triples, black.. and even other ""wet"" hopped) but i have never had another beer that made my mouth water like this one did last year. also Surly screwed a lot of fans of their beer over on this one. I work at a liquor store, people (my co workers and I included) have been waiting a loooong time for this, we preordered 10 cases of this glorious brew waited two extra day to reciecve and FINALLY at 2:20 pm today we recieved our shipment (which we found out unbeknownst to us was/is ""allocated"") 3 whole cases! WTFrog Surly?!?!? i understand the ""Simcoe"" hops may be harder to come by but i dont wonder with ""surly's"" attitude if this is not just a marketing trick/ploy/gimmick to make their already high in demand beers even more crazed over...so here it is...."

A: A very cloudy amber pour. Huge fluffy offwhite head. Great retention and lacing.
"Big thanks goes out to MBrausen for sending me this one so I would have the chance to tick it! Freshly canned (&lt;1 week)! Served from can into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Poured red-orange with a one finger slightly off-white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grapefruit, grapefruit hop, toasted bread, and subtle earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, bread, earth, earthy hop, and grapefruit hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I can honestly say that this is one of the better brews I have had out of a can. The freshness of the can I had really shined through on this one with a really nice hop aroma and flavor. A well done brew that no beer lover should go without trying. Nice job Surly, nice job."
Poured from can into a large tulip.
"Pours a very pale yellow orange. Completely clear from one side of the glass to the other. Really fresh hop aroma. Fresh melon, mango, nice sweet orange and grapefruit notes along with some floral and earthy hop aromas. Fresh juicy, resiny hops all over the flavor profile. Great grapefruit sweetness, orange is less pronounced, but does well in a back-up roll. Really nice fresh cut grass flavor as well until a very resiny pine finish does provides an excellent balance between sweet and bitter. Terrifically hopped IPA."

500ml can thanks to stevef03 for the trade! Poured into a Triple Karmeliet tulip.
"Huge thanks to Soonami for this great extra. 16 fl. oz. can served in a tulip nonic. Pours a pale, honey-colored hue with a translucent clarity and a rocky, two inch cream-colored head. Head eventually dissipates into a solid 1/8th cap. A delicate, textured semi-circle of lacing adheres to the walls of the glass. Great nose - starts out with pine resins followed by citrus rind. Taste is a slightly sweet with a more assertive malt profile than I anticipated, based on the nose - light, toasted malt with a pleasant cereal sweetness. There's a bit of citric acid in the mix but the big piny aromas in the nose do not translate to the flavor profile. I have to say that I dig the mouthfeel - light-medium in consistency with a slightly oily texture and an extremely smooth carbonation. Overall, not as much of a hops presence as I anticipated, but I found this beer extremely pleasant and drinkable with a well-hidden abv. I'm not sure how this beer is fresh from the line, but I really enjoyed this brew as is with a month or two on it."

"I fear I may be coming to the party a wee bit late. Though this beer is barely 6 weeks old, clicking through the reviews reveals a steady dropoff in scores from its release date up until now. "
Another fantastic offering from Surly.
"Excellent representation of a fresh hop beer. As with many in a similar vein, the smell is typically the star of the show. You certainly get the Citra, but I also pick up an equal amount of the Simcoe in there. "

"big thanks to beerhan for sending this as an extra! pours out a crystal clear bright golden orange color. topped off by a two finger bright white head that slowly fades to a cap leaving sticky lacing behind. nose is filled with big tropical, sweet, juicy citrus fruits, some malts and a little pine on the tail end of things. taste buds are greeted with pineapple, orange, mango fruits, some sweet malts and a little earthy pine needle. mouthfeel was surprising to me. it had great carbonation and a well balanced body. it just seemed to not be as dry and bitter as it should have. dont get me wrong, this is an excellent beer, but it tasted more like a pale ale than a west coast style ipa."

"Great hop & sweet smell as I pop open the can - poured into a pint glass, the appearance is a nice dark-golden/amber hue. Not a lot of head (I find all the Surly beers I've had to be lower in carbonation), but decent lacing. Good amount of bitter and hops at the front followed with a sweetness and a slightly dry finish."
You had this beer. 
"Poured this lovely fresh, wet-hopped brew into a stein producing a brilliant clear goal with a solid inch of bright white head. Retention and lacing are good. Nothing is exceptional in appearance."
Poured from a 16oz. can into a pint glass.
"A= A hazy golden color, there are some orange highlights in it. Nice foamy white head that sticks around lots of nice stickey lacing in this one as well."
"This is perhaps the best IPA i've ever had! Poured with a small to average off white head and a little lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is the freshest hops and balanced against malt, caramel, fresh bread. Flavor is like nose and again the freshest hops perfectly matched to the malt, yeast, and carbonic tang. Body and carbonation excell. Finish is like flavor and surprisingly of average length considering the fullness of the flavor."
"Thank you Karen my friend who is a BAD-ASS who lives in Minneapolis who used to live in Missouri and was my employee at the restaurant I co-own. I love Karen in an inappropriate way...she and my wife are friends, but Karen brings or sends me Surly...Karrren. Bright brilliant light orange with tiny bubbles rising to the top. The top...a never ending foamy fluffy white head that is just now dissipating after 45 minutes of alternating sip sip sip SWIG. The head stayed at 1/4 to 1/2 an inch for sooo long. Yummy earthy citrus funky skunky hop aroma. The flavors follow in the way flavors might and sometimes do...not quite a mirror, but still a fantastic balance on the palate finishing...finishing, with a cleansing bitterness. Flavors of citrus fruit and earthy funky hops. Smooth and slick in the mouth yet finishing dry and inviting another sip. If I could I would drink this every day, it rocks."

Poured from a can into a pint glass.
"Yeah hops, crystal clear orange amber with tight CO2 bubbles rising from the bottom of my DFH pint glass. Merangue like dense head sticks relentlessly to the glass. Nice floral citrus hop aroma, doesn't pop the way I expected but it's a nice aroma (it is the middle of november after all). "
"Have had this beer every years its been avalible and a couple different ways. Cans draft, and cask. The last two years the beer powered a more murky yellow, where the 2011 is more dark orange color. The first two years the smell was super hoppy, this year not as much. The tast for the first two years was super hop bomb where this year seemed to be more balanced with a big hop flavor and then some sweetness. They seem to be refining it much more with each passing year but they've also dialed back the hop profile."
"Possibly the best straight up American IPA I have ever had. Complex, like the hops have their own aroma and flavor bell curves of perfection. The malt is hidden underneath but is still fully present in the flavor. And the hops taste just a fresh as they guarantee them to be. My can was only 2 weeks old. I would simply buy this all the time if it was available for me on a regular basis."
"Can into a snifter, big thanks to Coldponcho! Canned on 9/24/11, it seems."

"Burnished golden orange pour with great clarity and a creamy half inch of bubbly foam on top. Nice active carbonation. Aromas kick off with juicy, fresh, resinous hops. Lots of citrus and grapefruit all over the place. Mellow roasted malt in the background with some caramel sweetness, but hops rule the show as it was brewed with 100% Citra."

Thanks to surlytwinsfan for this fresh hopster. poured into my stone cali-belique glass
"Wow, just popped a can of this - the hops hit the nostrils before I even poured it. Pours a beautiful licht copper with a thick golden head. Massive lacing as i drink. The taste is the most floral arrangement of hops I've ever tasted, like drinking a bridal bouquet. It nicely crisp in the mouth, and alcohol is no part of the palate. 6% abv and 90 ibus makes this a hop head's dream. Outstanding job Surly."

"16oz. can served in a Duvel tulip. Canned on 10/17/11. A couple of weeks old. Pours a clear reddish gold with a thin white head. Very fragrant, piney hops and some crystal malt. Nice hop bitterness from start to finish. Lighter side of medium bodied. Good malt backbone to hold up the hops. Nice dry finish. Good stuff. One of the best fresh hop beers."

Canned date 10/04/11. Poured into my Surly pint glass. A very clear bright orange color. Not a lot of carbonation bubbles heading to the top. Head is a large two fingers and sea foam colored. Rocky and frothy in appearance. Lace is already sticking in a sheet pattern. Quite nice.

"Big thanks to Shane for this can, been a want for a very long time. "
can generously shared by mike after some edward. look is classic orange with thin head. smell was hard to pull at first as it mostly resembles a clean glass. some hops but mostly a sour candy like funk. taste is way different. resiny hops. fairly thick. coats my mouth for sure. none the less pretty good.
"Surly Wet pours a nice copper color with great big sticky head which left plenty of lacing. The aroma is alive with hops: citrus, lots of pine and flowers. On the palate the west coast hops explode forward. Grapefruit, bitterness and pine resin obliterate the taste buds. This is a hoppy affair. An aggressive beer, but surprisingly drinkable. Freshness is a key to the success here."
"Poured a cloudy dull yellow with a sticky white head, nice lacing and retention."
Received as an extra from Thome50.
"After having this fresh for the second time, I felt it was necessary to review this gem. An extremely fresh can (brough back from Darkness Day!) split 3 ways from a 16 oz can. Poured into a pint glass..."
"I poured form a can into a snifter, bright orange pour, slight white head. The aroma has pine and tropical notes. Lots of pineapple, and mango juice with this one, notes of bitter pine, grapefruit pith, the finish is lingering with bitter pine. A great sticky mouthfeel, good carbonation. A nice wet hoopped IPA, very enjoyable."

Dry with a medium body and perfect carbonation. I tried it straight from the can and it was much more flavorful. Overall, I was disappointed. I would have never guessed they used 100% citra hops in this. I expected more tropical and citrusy hop aromas and flavors."
"I picked this can up in Minneapolis over the weekend as I stopped by for Darkness Day 2011, what a great time! I'd been craving this beer all weekend before finally finding some in a store after the event."

"The beer pours a copper amber color with good head retention and lacing. The nose on this beer is great, showcasing dank earth, considerable dry citrus, light pine and a hint of caramel/brown sugar. The flavor profile replicates the nose on this beer, with the hoppy bitterness winning out handily over the sweet brown sugar flavor core to this beer. The finish is dry and bitter, with a hint of caramel sweetness as well. Mouthfeel is otherwise medium bodied, with a fairly long, sweet and bitter finish. Alcohol is well integrated into the the flavor profile, though I did get a touch of alcoholic heat at the end. "

Not nearly as bitter as you'd think given the strong hop aroma. This is a great wet hopped beer."

Citrus with grass, alpalpha and a summer day in the nose with orange, tangerine and grapefruit--all subtle and clean. Good malt and slight caramel backbone for the earthy and mellow hop bite.

"A - Clear light golden copper colored with a big, long lasting, fluffy whitish head.Tons of thick, crusty lacing left throughout. Simply an absolutely delicious looking IPA."
Can from December Santa Cruz tasting. Pours an orangey gold color with a thin off-white head. Aroma is herbal and tropical with lychee and a slight caramel malt influence. Flavor is pretty much pure hops. Malt is barely perceptible. Plenty of citrus and herbs to go with a solid - but not quite west-coast - bitterness.
"A: Light, golden with a huge frothy head--big bubbles sit on top of each other; bubbles shoot beautifully through the middle of the glass toward the billowing head"
Enjoyed with some friends before the holiday break so here goes...
"Had some of this one at a Christmas tasting courtesy of my friend Megan. Poured a medium yellow color with a good white head. Aromas of resiny hops, along with some pine and grassy notes. On the palate, medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Some bready malt, but mostly big, fresh, resiny, piney hops. Very good."

"Poured from a 16 oz. can into my Duvel tulip. Received as an extra in a trade with GoldenJet; big thanks Cory! This was a Want I was thinking of trying to trade for. Canned on 10/12/10, consumed on 11/11/10."
"big thanks to wkcyr for including this cool surly surprise as an extra. can marked with ""canned on 10/13/10"", so it's been trapped in there for 28 days and it's time to pop the can. "
"Poured from a 16oz can into my Surly imperial pint glass. It poured a beautiful, crystal clear amber color with a thick and rocky head nearly spilling over the edge of the glass. It had some decent head retention and left some nice lacing on the sides of the glass."
"16 oz can into a pint glass. HUGE thanks go to joshuaseresse for including this most awesome extra in a recent trade. You really came through for me Josh. Thanks! The can is marked with a fill date of 10/12/10, so I'm only getting into this a few weeks past its optimum drinking window. "
"16 oz can poured into a Sierra Nevada imperial pint. Canned on 10/13/10. ""Get Wet"", No info."
"Bifrostguard shared a few cans of this over the past week. Thanks, Cam. Pouring a gold-tinted amber, Surly Wet is clear in the glass with a lasting sticky head. Hops dominate the aroma, citrusy and resiny, reminding me of pine needles and grapefruit. The hop aroma doesn't display much complexity, but it's very pleasant. The same flavors are present on the palate, pine being especially prominent. There's also a spiciness, and a mild green/grassy hop note. Malt flavor is subdued, almost absent, though the beer has plenty of body. Despite being fairly strong and bitter, this drinks easy and kept me coming back for more. Another very solid offering from Surly, this is better than many West Coast brewed wet hop beers I've had this year."
"16oz can, dated 10/13/10, courtesy of Hopstoopid120, into a Duvel tulip."
"I must admit that I am not the biggest fan of fresh hop brews, but if anyone can do it right, Surly can. Many thanks to Hogwildliquor for throwing in this much wanted extra. Poured in straight in to an imperial pint glass, the look is hazy gold in color, and three solid fingers of heading that sticks around for a while. Big whiff of piny, citrus hops right from the start, as well as tobacco and grapefruit. The taste has West Coast IPA written all over it, with aggressive hops bringing on the citrus and earthy qualities they are known for. The body is medium, and about as drinkable as it gets for this style. Unlike many other fresh hop beers, the hops here actually taste fresh, and are as aggressive as any other IPA. Aside from their Imperial Stout, Darkness, this is the best brew I have had from Surly, and also the best fresh hop beer I have had at all. People from Minnesota are truly lucky to have this beer around."
"Poured an amber brown with orange highlights that had a half finger of head and left a little bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was really sweet and floral consisting of piney hops, citrus grapefruit, grass notes, but did have fruit aroma like apricots. The nose made it seem like it was gonna be delicious but it was surely decieving cause the taste was not as bold as the nose. There was some hop character but was very mild and didn't really have a bitter bite either. I did manage to detect citrus grapefruit with very slight fruit notes and malts that probably overpowered the hop profile. The brew was light to medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a citrusy, sweet, and very mild hop bitter finish. It drank real good but was let down especially because they noted it was an interpretation of a west coast IPA. I guess you have to leave it to the west coast to handle that business."
Thanks to mymrnngjckt for a couple cans of this.

"I CANnot tell you how much I enjoy Surly's beers and how grateful I am when they arrive in support of The CANQuest (TM)! This one kind of makes me giggle from the utter simplicity of its name. I guess that if they had Michelob Dry in the late-'80's, we CAN have Surly Wet in the early-'10's. "
Poured from a can into a nonic pint glass a beautiful amber color with a puffy white head that held for a good bit of time and left good lacing down the glass.

"Beer poured a clear golden color with a nice white head on it. It looked clean, crisp and fresh."
Appearance -- Pours a bright copper like a brand new penny with two fingers of stiff frothy parchment head. Lacing up the wazoo!
A -- An bronze golden brew that pours a fluffy head that sticks around a while and leaves a good amount of lacing.
Poured from a can into my tulip. 
16oz. can poured into a nonic. 
A - Bright copper gold with a finger of head. Head diminishes quickly.
This beer pours about picture perfect copper color with a beige topping of medium/thick head. The smell is evident of hop residue as soon as the can is opened. I brought by buddy a glass and from across the room he said- oh wow- that's some hops. Taste is incredibly dry- like bone dry- but the plentiful hop profile is very nice. Very tough to get through the second one of these- the first was very drinkable- but I wouldn't recommend more than one at a time- this is very thick and is filling me up way too fast.
"The 2015 batch smells and tastes like a floor cleaning product mixed with pineapple juice. This beer was an unfortunate waste of money because it has been quite good in the past, but this year it is horrible."
A - Beautiful gold color with a finger of foamy white head with great retention. The color was so clear I could read the can through the beer in my glass!

"16oz can into a cervoise. Canned Oct 11, 2010. Reviewed Oct 28, 2010. "
"I got a four pack thanks to Lenny1203, thanks a lot man. Me and my friends each drank a can and we all agreed that this was a pretty good beer. I think this may be the best wet hop beer I have ever had. It really captures the hop oil in the aroma and the taste, its strong and distinctive. This is easily identified as wet hopped and I honestly can't think of how to define teh flavor other than super hoppy and dank. Not much pine or citrus that I could detect, this was all humulus lupus, fresh nugs. I wish I could buy this."
A: clean copper pour.
Thanks Doug!!! You're the man! Live review.
"Deep golden body with a slight haze and small amounts of carbonation noticeable. Decent crop of white head on top with good cling. Nice fresh hop aroma. Citric fruits and pine and grass. Grapefruit and lemon. Nice juicy hop flavor. Bright citrus tones with grapefruit, tangerine and orange all coming to mind. Some smokey resinous qualities as well. Bitterness is pretty even keeled. Nothing over the top. Moderately carbonated and medium bodied. Solid wet hop."
Thanks to biniek13 for this. Poured into a pint. Canned 10/12/10
Big thanks to my wife for picking this up for me along with the Darkness.
Pours with a bright white head that's about a finger thick. Some light creamy structure to this before it finally collapses. The beer is a bright gold color with excellent clarity.. Lone bubbles rise to the surface now and again. Slight lacing.
Canned 15 Days ago. (10/11/10) Poured into Bells Tulip.
16 oz can served in a Duvel tulip
"I had this brew last year on draft, while it was good, it didn't wow me. While I managed to make it home from Darkness Day with a can dated 10/11/10 (today is the 25th) with much thanks to millah. This time around, the beer seems to be a whole different animal (perhaps due to freshness) so I thought it would be fitting to review this canned version."
"Poured from can into tulip. Golden amber in color, white head fades to ring with excellent lacing. Smell is impressive for a wet hop - Lots of resin and pine, light malts, some tropical fruits buried under all the piney hops. Taste is very similar to smell, lots of pine tree hops and a light malt presence to provide a tiny bit of balance. Columbus hops stand out most in the flavor, where the citra is more noticeable in the smell. Not terribly bitter but very tasty hops. Mouthfeel is medium body and medium carbonation. I would prefer it to be a bit drier. Overall an excellent beer, I love the smell. One of my favorite wet hop beers. Wish this one was available in Chicago."
A-Orange/tan colored....white puffy head
Thanks go cmurren25 for sharing this at the pumpkin murren event at Al's.
A: Pours a clear caramel color with a quarter of an inch head that leaves very nice lacing.
"Had this on tap last year, first time from a can. Pours a perfectly clear golden color, maybe some pale orange in the center, with a small white head that left some surprisingly decent lacing. Wonderful grapefruit and citrusy aroma. There's a little bit of peppery spiciness in the back that I typically don't like, but in these small amounts, it's almost herbal and lightly floral. Mmmm, nice bitterness in this beer. It's not overpowering, but works well the semi sweet malt, with notes of grapefruit, orange, pepper (light), and a sticky resinous finish. This is good stuff! Body is above medium and it's got a lingering dry finish. Very nice beer, but the bitterness overwhelms me after awhile. One or two at a time is ideal."
Canned 10/11/10 and Consuming 10/22/10 So Fresh!!!
Canned 10/11/10. Consumed 10/19/10. I like those numbers. Big shout out to Einweizenbitte for making this possible! Thanks again Todd.
Another wonderful IPA from Surly. Beer is amber and clear with moderate carbonation and a big white head of small and medium bubbles that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Looks good.
"Appearance: Beautiful clear coppery, brass body lays beneath a thick, fluffy white/off-white head. "
"Got a 4 pack of Surly Wet in Apple Valley last night. Light brown hue, and poured with ample head. Great soft mouth feel with light citrus resign-y flavor. Guy at the store told me to drink 'em fast they dont keep. That won't be a problem. Spendy but worth it."
Can dated 10-11-2010. Consumed 10-12-2010. Poured into a pint glass:
16oz. can poured into a pint glass. Canned date: 10/12/10.
"Canned 10-11-10, 1 week ago today! Ultra clear appearance, more on the golden side for an IPA. Lots of sudsy white foam leaving behind a nice lace. Well balanced aroma with a bright hoppiness leading the way. Less citrus than expected, it's more of an earthy/grassy smell with a spicy bite. There is a grainy malt note present also that borders on a toasted nut character. Not too intense but rather inviting."
"Canned one week ago, and this is my last one. So sad..."

Canned 10/11/10
"16 ounce can poured into an over-sized wine glass. Canned on 13-Oct-2010, reviewed on 16-Oct-2010."
Purchased this beer the morning of its first deliveries in Minneapolis on 10-12-2010. The bottom has a canned on date that reads 10-11-2010. 
"We're lucky in Minnesota - Surly Wet and Town Hall Fresh Hop both released on the same day. This one was canned 3 days before drinking - how's that for fresh. This one pours a clear copper with a large head that fades to a film of bubbles throughout the drinking. Smells nice and fresh, not overly hoppy smelling. Has a grassy, green hop taste backed up by just enough slightly sweet malt to make this a well rounded beer. Finished very crisp - that's what I noticed most about this beer. It finishes very clean with a slightly minty smack. This is an easy drinking beer. I could drink alot of these. Had this one within the same week as having the Fresh Hop. If I had to pick one I'd have to give a slight edge to the Fresh Hop due to a slightly bigger backbone than the Wet. That said, I can't drink many of those due to how filling it was, this one the other had could be an all day beer if you take it slow."
"16oz can, goblet, canned 10/11/10. "
"My first thought on this beer is about the head. It is one of the most glorious heads I've ever seen, extremely thick, lasts for days if you let it. The body is a clear, amber color. Very pure. Spiderweb lacing throughout."
Poured from 16 oz can into a pint glass.
"Clean, clear and plenty of foam. Very impressed by the clarity. Head settles to nothing after a couple minutes."
"I bought a 4 pack of Surly Wet on October 12th from Heritage Licquour in Maplewood, Minnesota and it had been just delivered to them that morning. The beer was canned on October 10th! I have never drank a beer that the hops tasted so fresh on the pallete than Surly Wet! This was one of the most enjoyable beers I have ever had and hope that it becomes available on tap and many bars in the twin cities as I have only heard it being available at a select few including The Blue Door Pub in Saint Paul."
"Going up against high expectations here. Citra and simcoe, 5 days old according to the canning date. Surly, hops, fresh, etc. Drooling as I pour...."
A= The pour is a nice translucent light amber color with a good looking thick foamy finger of head that holds excellent retention and lacing. The head gives off that almost green color I get with a lot of wet hop beers... may be my imagination though. I will note that this looks a little lighter than last years wet???
"Light golden color with a nice white head that settles into a goopy film. One of the lighter IPAs I've seen in awhile, which I guess shouldn't be a surprise if they're really dialing back the malt here."
Edited ratings from 2012 version with straight Simcoe. Best version yet.
"I had this last year on tap at Darkness Day last year. I am glad Surly decided to can this. ""Canned 10/12/10 Get Wet"" is printed on the bottom."
"Poured into a Surly pint glass. Canned on 10/11/10 (yeah I know, I may have aged this a little too long ;)"
"Had this on tap last year and enjoyed it, happy to see it come to cans!"
Poured from a 16 ounce can into my Russian River glass. 
"Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. Fresh hop aroma is immediately evident as the beer is being poured. Appearance is a vibrant copper. A moderate head dissipates rather quickly. The taste is all about the hops. Very grassy, fresh and vibrant. Intense and aromatic."
"Very clear golden colored brew. Sizeable memory foam head, tan colored. Sticks to the glass. Scent is all floral hops with some fruity notes such as grapefruit. Smells very good. Probably because it tastes very good too. A light malt front, almost like a pils without the lagered fermentation, given how light the malt profile is compared to the hops, which is clearly the highlight. Lots of sticky icky going on here. Floral, bitter and citrus, its got em all. Fairly thin, and a wet feel. Good stuff"
"This beer pours a crystal clear reddish bronze color. The head is a rocky two inches of foam that recedes slowly into nice sticky lacing. This is a beautiful looking beer. The aroma is very bright with hops. Floral hops, herbal hops, piney hops, and a hint of grapefruity hops all mingling together perfectly. The taste has a very sharp bitterness that comes across first. However, behind it there is a plethora of complex hop flavor. It tastes like a hop rainbow in a glass. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate, fine carbonation. The texture is extremely silky which is immediately noticeable, and adds a lot to the taste. Overall, this is a great beer. I am a huge fan of wet hopped beers, and this beer is the best I've ever had. If only hops could be harvested year round."
"I biked all over to find this today and I am not disappointed. One of the most refreshing brews I've had the pleasure of tasting, made all the better by this beautiful fall day. It's not Furious and nor should it be. The taste of Wet is just perfect hops. It's bitter but not too much to slow me down. I dub this beer the Fresh Prince of Minnesota."
"16 oz canned two days ago, bitches, poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint on the early morning of October 13, 2010."
pours out a light orange color with two fingers of head that leaves decent but not great lacing. a lot lighter than all of surly other hoppy beers. definitely fits the label description of west coast style IPA on the label.

First can review! (even if it is only #38 overall)
Had at Darkness Day 2009 (finally putting in notes)
On tap at the Bavarian Lodge back in November 2009. Reviewed from notes.
"Found some notes I had put in my cell phone, won't be able to get too descriptive as it's not in front of me."
A: Amber brown with little or no head or active carbonation to speak of.
"A - Poured a clear, bubbly burgundy color with a small, off-white, head of thick foam. It left little to no lace."
Pours a golden red with a off white smooth bubbly head.

"I had this one on tap at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL. Poured into a 13oz stemmed goblet."
"After having this once or twice, had another pint of this gem at The Blue Nile tonight after dinner. Served by Al. Which I'm sure made it taste even better."
"Drank in a 12 oz snifter at the Bavarian Lodge. Even the shrieks of a herd of drunken revelers did not detract from the immediate impact this beer made upon us. I have drunk a lot of very good beer over the past year or so; in fact I try only to drink very good beer; so it has to be something quite special that makes one really take note. The Wet is one such. Dulcie immediately proclaimed ""top five."" I tend to be more circumspect, but I will say I will savour the memory. Even several hours after leaving the Lodge, the hop imprint still lingered on my palate."
On tap at the Bavarian Lodge.
I drank this from the tap into a pint glass at the Darkness release party.
Had this on-tap earlier tonight at Sheffield's(Chicago). Reviewed from notes.
"On-tap at Ngon Vietnamese in St. Paul and served in a tulip glass. The beer appeared orange-red with a tall white head that left lacing. The aroma is a little too strong to make out a lot of discernible hop character - it blend into a big blast of citrus punch. The flavor, however, puts this beer among the best wet hop ales I've ever had (2008 SN Harvest comes to mind). It begins with floral and apricot hops before sliding into rougher grapefruit and citrus rind notes. The citrus then dries out in the aftertaste to leave a bitter dried fruit and crushed pepper taste. Damn, that's a good IPA. Drink it if you can find it."
Poured In: Pint Glass
"A crystal clear copper pint, brimming with a sticky crown of foam. The retention was good, and a swirl summoned a swarm of bubbles up to the surface. "
After erroneously being served Broodoo due to a tap handle mix-up I finally got a tulip of this stuff.
"served on tap in a pint surly glass it had a beautiful light copper coler with fresh head and lacing the smell was fantastic it was hops fresh hops with pineapple and grapefruit,mango and more oily hops with a malt smell in the background the taste was exceptional it was so smooth creamy and silky and delightful to drink..this ipa was brewed to showcase fresh hops and brewer excellence and it does both extremely well this is a hop explosion with a perfectly balanced ipa between hops malt and water...had 1/2 dozen wet -hop ipa's in the last 2 weeks and this is is by far the best not even close.. ...im so glad i live here to experience this elite brewery and the products they put out"

Had the pleasure of enjoying this one on-tap at Roat Osha.
"1400 Pounds of hops in one batch. One small batch. 50 barrels, was it? Centennials and Chinooks, picked in Yakima, WA and shipped off to Brooklyn Center, MN, tossed into the brew kettle a mere three days after the picking. Wet as in not dry, not old, fresh as they get. Big, bright, bold, brash hops up in there and all over. So good I had 7 pints in a row at it's release. Two nights later, I sit down with one to investigate it. "
"Difficuly to rate as it is so different. Get a lot of papaya, the sour culture cuts through it, and then the hop flavours come in. So inventive and a magnificent effort by the brewers to keep that level of balance. I would love to see how they make this, i think if i tried a homebrew i would get it wrong 100 times before it was remotely drinkable. As i finish it off i get hints of the other flavours, but for me the (ripe!) papaya was dominant."
"tastes like papaya juice with a hint of hops. typical goodness from HVB. I didn't get much coconut or green tea at all, though you could just call this a papaya IPA sour and still have it hit a home run."
"This one pours a super hazy and milky looking orange, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing."
"A: Going by the seemingly standardized appearance of these Hudson Valley sour IPAs, this is a shade or two darker than the norm, maybe 3:1 on the orange juice : pineapple juice ratio. Deep gold with hints of burnt orange. Typical thin, compact head formation that dissipates without much time. "
"Crazy delicious sour IPA---smell is always tart grapefruit, but taste is as usual very unique.... juicy papaya tropical goodness with a nice coconut finish--especially as it warms... green tea is in there as well just more subtle... taste like eating a whole roll of life-savor tropical fruit candies--with that rare coconut one in the mix..."
"This beer is insane. The apotheosis of HVB achievements and the style they’ve essentially created and mastered (sour lactose laden blended hoppy beer with fruit purée). Just explosively flavorful and at the same time beautifully balanced. Not gimmicky at all, just a tremendously drinkable and appealing beer. Paired this with handmade Shanghai dumplings and noodle dishes and the moderate sourness and fruit sweetness, with the subtle hop bitterness in the finish, cleansed the palette and held its own against another tremendously flavorful offfering. Wow."
"Really great beer. Perfect hazy look, tight pearl head. Smell is sweet grapefruit and spices. Taste is wonderful grapefruit, hint of honey, with a creamy mouthfeel and a citrus twang on the finish that is awesome"
"Super hazy NE IPA body with a fizzy, off-white head that fades to a sparse, soapy residue atop. Aromas of pineapple, fruit punch, sweet citrus. Loads of fruit character in the flavor. Tangy acidity with a light body. Prickly carbonation a la soda. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"well, holy shit. is this the new direction? and to think we were enamored with 'west coast IPAs' just a few years ago..... lots of flavor. slight tartness. very nice!"
Smells like straight grapefruit
"This one pours a super hazy and quite milky looking yellow-ish orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"Hudson Valley continues to impress with this delicious entry into their sour/brunch IPA series. This one falls somewhere in the cross-section of Crush! orange soda, melted Creamsicle pops, and fresh squeezed ruby red grapefruit juice. It's offers both tartness and sweetness, but the two keep each other in check wonderfully, resulting in an extremely intense yet easy/pleasurable drinking experience. Ride of bright, creamy citrus flavors is capped on the finish by a delicate, somewhat grassy, somewhat minty bitterness that is likely the contribution of the Motueka dry hopping. The feel is medium with even, soft carbonation, accenting the refreshing drinkability of this beer. Another delicious creation by these alchemists!"
"Just a fantastic beer in every way. I went to HV for my first release and came away impressed by everything from the brewery, the people, vibe and most importantly the beers. All were excellent and this was the best. So juicy - smooth and full of citrus goodness with just the right amount of sour tartness. You get that nice juicy IPA hop hit up front and then the wonderful sour/tartness on the back end. Quite possibly the best IPA I had in 2017. Well done."
Sour and light orange soda! Who loves orange sours?! I love orange sours!
"L: hazy to murky gold blanketed by 3"" of persistent, white lacy foam"
"Vanilla is just a tad too strong, but overall really good milkshake IPA."
"This beer has made me rethink everything I've thought I've know about beer. It's outstanding. It tastes like a creamy orange julius, but it's a BEER! My mind is blown."
"Overall an amazing beer. The look is a cloudy orange. You put your nose up to the glass and are greeted by a sweet citrus fragrance. I could just sit and smell this beer. The taste is a soft more smooth orange, like an orange dreamcicle. This is perhaps one of my favorites. Try it and enjoy!"
"This one pours a very hazy and glowing orange, with a fluffy whipped looking head, and lots of lacing."
Super hazy/cloudy pale gold. White head with lace. 
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. 
Poured from 16oz can into glass. No canning date information found on can.
Was excited to try this one but also nervous that the addition of vanilla would overpower the beer. It's just my personal taste but I only like vanilla in beer if it is subtle. Too much and it tastes artificial to me. This beer nailed it. The vanilla did not overshadow the hops as the beer still had a fair amount of juiciness and bitterness. The vanilla hit on the backend. To me this tasted like a hop dreamsicle.
"It poured a very hazy peach color with a creamy frothy head that just sits - looks like a nitro beer. Lacings all around the glass. At first smell, I swear I picked up aromas of vanilla milkshake. The lactose is really heavy at the nose. Some hops - very fruity with passionfruit notes. I am immediately wowed by the flavors - almost hard to describe actually. The hops come in with notes of pine and tropical fruits but its not overly aggressive. The lactose adds a huge layer of sweetness, contributing strong notes of vanilla ice cream. Its kind of a mesh of two different things in one beer. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy - heavy in the mouth. Overall: this is an outstanding beer. A beer style that was once an oddball but is becoming the norm at many breweries. The Brewing Projekt aces it."
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. Pours a creamy golden yellow body, slight orange hue, two finger thick white head, good retention, lots of lacing, Smell is vanilla, lactose, grapefruit and citrus, touch of tropical fruit, minimal grainy malt sweetness. The lactose makes this turn out to be like an orange milkshake. Flavour follows, reasonably sweet but not overly so; good balance with a citrus and orange zest, good milk and lactose sweetness, mild zesty bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, minimal zesty bitterness on the backend. Pretty much a milkshake IPA; enjoyed this one and this is akin to the Untitled Art strawberry milkshake IPA released not that long ago."
Quite bitter as one would expect to go along with the nice aroma from dry hopping. Poured a nice head with medium bubbles. Not creamy which is OK. I’d be happy to find a glass of this anytime.
"A great IPA, if you enjoy a strong hop flavor and citrus. It finishes somewhat bitter, but that reenforces what it is."
Mighty tasty. Pretty good
Draft. Clear amber appearance. Medium malty back with citrus + earthy front.
"Near perfect NW IPA, crisp and biting. Orange amber body with substantial creamy head. aroma of hops, and more hops. Taste , too. Barley Brown’s knocked this one out of the park."
"Copper gold, with a bit of haze and a frothy soapy white head. Smell is light, not much there, just pine. Flavor is big green chlorophyll. Lots of pine, and bitter green lettuce. Good but one note for me. Finish is extra dry from the huge amount of hops and lasts a long time. Not my favorite. Hops are tasty, bright and zesty, but this just seems like an attempt to cram in a bunch of hops without really crafting a balanced beer. Not my style."
"My hometown Brewery and Pub.... well it's 65 miles away, but I call it home."
"Chill haze light amber without much head, but what's there leaves some good drippy lace. "
"This hits all the right notes for an IPA. Piney and citrus in abundance. Intensly hoppy finish, as it should be. All around solid IPA. Don’t pass this one up."
"On tap at Engine House 9 in Tacoma, WA."
"Poured from a growler at a day old. Pours a deep golden amber with a thick tan foam head. The nose is of malt and light tree bark. Taste is malt forward. Caramel sweetness to it along with herbs, grasses and a very faint citrus lemon peel. The lemon peel is almost herbal tea like or medicinal. Medium to full body with a semi crisp clean finish. Good beer."
I had this beer on-tap in a pint glass at Collins Pub in Seattle.
On tap at Pour House Grill in Bend OR. Never heard of this brewery before but they have certainly made a great impression. Bartender told me they won GABF for this brew a few years back. Def worth trying if you can get your hand on it.
L- clear amber color. Poured with a half inch head that dissipates fairly quickly
"The flavor hits with strawberry, sweet melon, biscuity, drives with malt onto a earthy and piney bitterness. A well balanced IPA with the hops driving some quite interesting flavors not generally found in IPA, albeit with a dominant malt character."
"32 oz crowler. Pours hazy light amber gold, thin white head fades leaving some rings of lace. Sweet melony aroma. Sweet malt taste, tons of piney hop bitterness. Tropical melony notes. Medium slick feel."
"Had on tap at the Loyal Legion in SE Portland. Nice golden amber color with a slight haze. Smell is of citrus, grass, and earthy notes. The flavor is citrus, pine, and herbs. The maltiness is more subdued, and the hops speak with this beer. Resinous mouthfeel. Overall an excellent IPA."
"On tap at Sassy’s, Portland. "
"absolutely top notch ipa right here, classically northwestern, i am very surprised this doesnt have a little more hype around it from the ipa geeks, its good enough to warrant some serious conversation. medium orange in color with good clarity, a one inch pure white head, and spiderweb lacing, its a nice beer to look at. even nicer to sniff, with big citrus hop aromas, likely some simcoe in here, and a real woody bitterness, maybe centennial in the long boil. nicer still to drink on, man this is good. citrus up front for sure, its the classic grapefruit zest profile, fresh and juicy, followed up by a little burst of semisweet caramelized crystal malt, finally backed up by more of a pine dimension on the hops with all kinds of bitter bite. as big as this feels in body and resin and even alcohol, it also still sort of demands quick consumption, its so fresh and good that its hard to even set my pint down on the bar for a moment. lemon and burnt orange in the taste, brings out the best of the malt, and there is very much a spruce note to the finish. well put together beer, i know these guys win a lot of awards and stuff, so its nice to finally have one of their beers. outstanding ipa."
"This is a remarkably good IPA. Nice nose, super juicy, with s little resin on the finish. Well Balanced!"
Crowler. White head. Lace. Golden orange.
Oregon has an unknown number of single IPAs and I have had most of them. This is my favorite.
"Tasted in pint glass from a growler on March 27, 2016."
"The best American IPA from a state that makes an incredible amount of amazing examples. Clean hop presence, good citrus, nice fruit. Nice bitterness and clean finish. Beautiful beer. Ya'll don't know."
"Pallet Jack is a unique West Coast IPA, but is also a great example of the style. It's quickly become the most popular IPA in the Portland metro area, and when fresh you can understand its popularity. It pours a nice orange color, has a smooth feel and ends with a brilliant bite in its finish. I would recommend this as a must have for anyone visiting Oregon."
Pours a finger of head on a clear straw body.
Tried on tap at a local taproom.
Had on tap at Kay's Bar in SE Portland.
America's best IPA.
"My favorite, go to IPA here in Portland. Piney and well balanced."
"Around the Portland area every place that serves draft beer carries this, and there's a reason why. A great goto (sorry stone) ipa. Hits every mark for a great ipa."
sent from smart phone so short.
Hop forward and very fruity. I like my IPAs with a little more malt balance but I could see how hop heads would love this brew. I'd definitely recommend trying it.
Just a fantastic IPA. Fantastic brewery all around.
"If you see it, drink it. Amazing nose. Great all around. Needs to be in discussions of top IPA"
So well crafted with huge hoppy flavor and just a touch of malt sweetness. Seems to be a little more widely available now. A fine addition to the Northwest IPA lineup.
Good tropical fruit hop flavor. I'm liking this a little better than the RPM. Both of them could have used a touch more sweetness to ramp up the flavor. Really good ipa.
"Barley Brown has a knack for making high quality IPA's and DIPA's, so it's no surprise thiat this is yet another strong effort. The beer has the usual dry hoppy flavor profile, with something of any underlying grittiness that is interesting and intriguing. There's just enough sweet malt to bouy all the dry citrus and light pine you get in this beer, and drinkabilty is oustanding. It's pretty much reached the point that when I see the words Barley Brown and IPA/DIPA together, you pretty much know you're in for a hophead treat. "
"Great beer, but seems to have gotten a little thinner in recent months."
Clear amber with an off white three finger head that lasts a long time. Rings of lace on the glass as the level drops.
Served on tap into a pint glass.
RB
Picked up at the Brewery in a 32oz growler.
"Very well made, but not really my favorite hop profile. Too much pine."
"Thanks to Eric for sharing this one! Took GABF Gold in American IPA, and it shows."
I've had this previously bit never reviewed it. Growler from Tap & Growler in Eugene. 
A: clear copper with sustaining head and good lacing
"Barley Brown's new tap house is where my glass was poured with a finger thick head. The golden brown color was accompanied with a pungent smell of pine and a hint of citrus. The smell was intoxicating with just the right balance. I smelled the IPA multiple times until it felt awkward doing so. As the beer met my taste buds, I was met with a multitude of hop flavors. As each second passed, each hop took turns flaunting their own unique characteristics. The brilliant showcase and blend of hops left my mouth lingering with pine and a slight bitterness. Each subsequent breath continued to experience the aroma of the IPA. "
on-tap @ Belmont Station.
"Growler (pint bottle filled from CO2 priming draft filler at Imperial Bottle Shop and Taproom) fresh off their GABF Gold medal win for this one (2013). Poured into my large Gulden Draak tulip, Pallet Jack is orange with a spritzy white head leaving light head. "
"Updated initial rating of 4.5 based on draft pint @ Beer Monger on 6.14.15. Damn this is one fine beer, always worthy of a pint and/or growler fill! I just wish I didn't have to go all the way to OR to get some Barley Browns deliciousness."
"750ml, Filled 8/17/13, Drank 8/24/13"
On tap at Barley Brown's 5/23/12.
L - What you'd expect an old school west coast IPA to look like - classic color. Lacing on the glass hints at what's in store.
Super solid and smooth.
Reviewed from notes taken in Fall 2014.
Fantastic nose on this IPA with strong grapefruit notes. Taste is a smooth well blended hoppy grapefruit experience. Definitely a solid IPA
"It's big on pine and grapefruit, with a hint of caramel malt, and sweeter peach notes in the middle. While this doesn't break ground, it's very very drinkable for the strength and wonderfully balanced. As in, hell yes I'd order a second pint."
Had this originally at a gastropub while in Denver for the 2015 GABF. Then numerous times afterwards during the after hours celebrations.
Balanced while still showcasing a beautiful hop forward profile. Citra is great on the nose when fresh. Favorite IPA brewed in Colorado.
"Their flagship, served at the brewery in a ""proper,"" 20 ounce pint."
8-4
"An incredible IPA that perfectly balances hop flavor, bitterness and malt. A dark golden with a touch of haze, a nice head and a huge juicy citrus and pine aroma. The flavor begins with a big resinous bitterness and moves into bright pine and citrus hop flavors balanced with the perfect amount of crystal malt. I get a growler every time I go to Denver to visit family."
Served on draft at the brewery
"I'm not an IPA guy, but I'd drink this beer regularly. Great balance, not overly hoppy or bitter or crunchy like many of them. Definitely got the grapefruit aroma as in the description. No wonder this is their best-selling beer."
Poured into a regular ass pint glass at Falling Rock 
"Pours a nice pale amber with a good head. Smells of peach, mango, and some general citrus. The taste follows the nose with a nice lemon up front, some sweet melon in the middle and a slight grapefruit on the finish. Very west coast style. Perfect bitterness."
On Draft. Falling Rock Tap House in Denver.
"Fantastic IPA full of citrus notes on the nose and the palate. This one will give any IPA a run for their money. A world class IPA out of Colorado, indeed!"
"If you like IPAs hopped more for aromatic flavors than bitterness, then this is the beer for you! These are the hops they use: Citra, Simcoe and Amarillo"
"Really, really good IPA. Guessing this brewery has a connection to La Cumbre in NM as the Superpower is nearly identical to the La Cumbre Elevated IPA. Identical hop profile, a tiny bit more malt on the finish for the Elevated. Rated them both the same in a side-by-side comparison."
Squealer delivered to me by BA strongrepublican. Served into an oversized Belgian tulip.
"bland, for all the kinds of different hops none of them standout"
"Probably the second best IPA produced in the state. Reminds me of a really good west coast IPA. Light in color. Great citrus smell. Citrus and pine in flavor. High attenuation, light, crisp and very drinkable. I highly recommend this one. Grade (A-)"
"Damn delicious, great job Comrade."
One of if not the best IPA I've ever had.
"My favorite CO IPA so far. This just checks all the boxes of an American IPA. Light golden color, big head and a huge nose of citrus and tropical hops. Hops bitterness and flavors follow the nose and demolish the taste buds. It is a bitter beer for sure but it is in between waves of citrus, melon, peach and other fruity hoppiness. with little to no alcohol detected and carbonated perfectly. It is a hop monster but very easy to drink (if you like IPA's) One of the few 5's I have given - I haven't I tried heady topper, Julius or any of the East-coast stuff but this stands up with or exceeds the best west-coast or Midwest IPA's (they exist...) I have had. It is truly a hoppy treat!"
Had three pints of this at Comrade then took a Growler home even though I was extremely broke. I walked to this place because my apartment is right next door and I drank half of it straight from the growler happily along the way. When I got home I poured into a classic British pint glass.
"Dank, citrusy, crushable, delicious IPA. Better than the west coast IPAs. Rocky Mountain sweet nectar! This beer is rad!"
"Outstanding beer. If you can find it, buy it."
Well made but more piney and catty than I care for
Sampler at the brewery. Looks like an IPA. Slightly stanky (in a good way) hop profile. Perhaps some slight cattiness to go with huge pine and pineapple aromas. Very bitter. Solid effort.
A fresh growler fill at the brewery and poured into a pint glass. 
"Full notes taken to my phone at Falling Rock Taproom, Denver, CO during consumption."
"SuperPower IPA delivers an absolute beat down on the palate. And I love it. Tons of dank citrus, grapefruit, pine, resin, herbal, floral, and sticky oiliness with a juicy center and clean, bready, malty backbone. Full-bodied, not overly sweet, and ends dry."
"From a freshly filled growler into a tulip. Reviewed from notes dated July 27, 2014."
"On tap at Comrade, poured into a pub glass."
"a really well hopped ipa, distinct from the many generic ones on the denver market, and decidedly american, with no apologies for not balancing this thing out with caramel malts. minimal bitterness with all the hop flavor is appreciated, and there is a floral tropicality to it, with maybe mosaic or citra in the dry hopping. something along those lines for sure, higher alpha and uniquely fruity. the beer is only medium bodied, which is nice for its higher abv (nearly 8%). creamy feel and a nice head on it, but like all the beer i had at comrade last night, its moderately undercarbonated and could really sing with a little more gas on it. the hop profile is what makes this ipa unique, and i can see this being the one to put comrade on the map. its distinct enough to stand out, and i think thats everything in this style these days. well done overall."
"This is my go to beer at this promising new brewery. Light gold in color, big piney nose, the first flavor hit is a mix of pine and grapefruit, not tangerine or tropical fruit. There is something dank and Columbus-like down in the mix too. Malts are bready, cereally as opposed to sweet, but they're present. The beer finishes dry but not bone dry. It is very, very nice IMO, an answer to folks who ask where's the great Colorado IPA to match those coming out of San Diego or Sonoma County or Vermont. We've got others; DuganA and Myrcenary spring to mind. But this one is my current favorite."
"Served out of a growler last night, poured fresh just shortly before drinking. This beer smells incredible and is very juicy, full of grapefruit and pine notes. I love super hoppy and flavorful beers, and while this could benefit from being slightly hoppier/pinier, this is one of my top two favorites that Comrade offers. I've been very impressed with everything that I've had so far at Comrade, and they are super friendly there as well. Could definitely see myself drinking lots of this beer. Recommend."
"On tap at the brewery, labeled as superpower and as a West Coast IPA which I really wish brewers would stop doing if they are not true west coast IPA's. Alpine, Pizza Port, RR, Green Flash, Alesmith, these are true west coast IPA's. Most brewers outside California who label their beer as west coast never get the hop flavor or aroma aspect to match. Now this beer was nice and hoppy and I liked it but it just doesn't fit with the stuff I've had coming out of CA. This was sort of yellow in color, nice citrus aroma with a little bit of pungency but not quite dank and not really tropical fruit. Flavor was similar and had a nice bitterness. This is a good hoppy IPA it's just not in that West Coast league. This was the best beer I had at Comrade."
"This is currently the best IPA brewed in the state of Colorado. Absolute hop bomb, light malt. Maintains excellent mouthfeel throughout. One of the best breweries in Denver."
"From the bottom of the can: ""0461 CANNED ON 08/23/18 16:15"""
"A: Amber in color, with a light tan head. "
"I received this from @vidblain in a BIF box. Canned 8/20/2018. Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a color something between orange and ruby with a huge, milk-white head and lots of clinging lacing. The nose is decidedly malt-forward. There's not much fruit but a fragrant smell of hops. The taste is interesting: it's malty with roasty barley and a hint of caramel or toffee up front but the complex hop bill of Amarillo, Simcoe, Cascade, and Warrior is bitter and bites hard. It finishes with a bitter after taste. I really like how the bitter hops and sweet malt battle for supremacy. This ale has a nice, creamy mouth feel with pleasant carbonation, and at 6.7% ABV a second pour is a must. Overall, I like this a lot! It's an IPA with an attitude."
Nice IPA and good bitterness. Easier to drink than Todd.
Nice beer if you like hops
"Poured from a 16 OZ can into a pint glass at Beer Head Pub in Schaumburg, IL. Another great beer from Surly. The appearance was a cloudy orange color with a medium sized white head. The taste and aroma was malt and pine."
I personally find it rather overrated for the poularity that it has here in the Twin Cities. The hops really hit hard for my taste but it is still a good brew.
Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. 
Golden amber. Nice head on pour. Tasted from a draft at hotel bar in cold glass. Very bitter taste with a hoppy feeling. Mixed feelings on mouthfeel/after taste. Great flavor that sits on your tongue. Four stars
"My current Favourite beer at the moment. Everything about it is is lovely...my only sticking point is that it's 6.7% thus you can't have a lot of them in a sitting as you'll get too loaded. That said, I wouldn't change a thing."
Has a nice reddish amber color. Aroma is strong of hops. Taste is hoppy and bitter. The bitterness wipes out this beer. It needs some more malt to balance it out. I was hoping for a little smoother taste. Poured into a plastic airline cup on SUN COUNTRY AIR from a 16 ounce can.
"Bitter; beyond my liking. This isn’t that great, but it’s not bad either. It’s kinda the most prototypical IPA I’ve ever had, but not an exemplary version of it."
"Im Just not a hops guy, if you are i'm sure youll love this, nice amber color, malt backbone for sure"
From tasting notes 10/20/17
"Interesting to see how this has averaged out to outstanding, interesting..."
"Look- translucent amber liquid with a billowing off white head that settles to about 1/4"" and sticks around; tons of lacing"
"Finally got to have this classic. Am reviewing from memory (had last week), so go easy on me if I'm somewhat inaccurate. Here goes:"
"Had this in a can in Minnesota. The beer has a nice amber, murky appearance with a huge head. The beer has a nice malt aroma mixed with some spiced hops. The taste is pretty hoppy mixed with like a caramel malt flavor but the mouthfeel makes the beer a little too heavy and dense for my taste. Overall, enjoyable mixture of flavors but an off mouthfeel."
Just a solid solid brew from Surly.
"Poured from 12-ounce can into a stemless wine glass. Translucent caramel color with a reddish highlight here and there and a two-finger off-white head that left some pretty lacing. Good, strong malty backbone that provides some nice structure for the piney and citrusy hop blitz. Pleasantly bitter and dry finish. This sample was about three months past the canning date, but still delicious and drinkable. Another great offering from Surly!"
"4/7/18: 16 Oz can poured multiple into a pint glass, canned 11/28/17 12:18, gift from brother. Brown reddish pour, puffy off-white head 2 fingers, lacing prevalent after pour, mild carbonation. Sweet pine needle aroma balanced by hops. Firm taste, hops strong, pine balance. Bitter, pleasant. Carbonation holds, firm mouth feel. Overall very good offering!"
A nice dark rich copper caramel color pour. Smooth citrus notes and pine presence make up the smell. Taste is aggressively hoppy with a nice mouthfeel. 
"nice foam! dark orange color, not much of a nose. the taste is pretty ok. hops is prominent and the taste is clean. not an overly malty beer. might buy again and/or try the brewery's other offerings."
Great well rounded beer
"Could rate higher some nights, lower on others. A solid, drinkable, but in the end, unexceptional, IPA."
Canned 3/5/18. Pours a caramel-brown-tea color with an off-white-yellowish head of 3 fingers. Sparse lacing left on the glass as the head recedes. 
"Crystal clear transparent red-hued amber ale, topped by a prodigious light cream colored head. Excellent retention and nice lacing. Very lively."
Poured from a pint can into a pub glass.
Poured from tap into 16oz glass at Galloway Grille in Eau Claire. Light amber color with good citrus aroma. Nice hoppiness and bitter finish that doesn’t linger too long. Solid.
Canned on 1/15/18. Consumed on 2/20/18. Nice to see Surly have 12 oz servings available.
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass.
Poured from 16oz can into glass. Marked with 09/08/17 canning date.
1 PINT can
16 oz can with a 6/30/17 canning date. Poured into Teku glass.
L - Poured from 16oz can - Copper colored with cream tinted head
"16 oz can, thanks Bro- Pours autumn chestnut red with a large off white head that reduces leaving cobwebby lacework and minimal head. Aroma is spicy hops, pine, rye bread. The taste is caramel malts, bitter hops, piney, biscuity rye bread, more of a red IPA, solid beer."
"Cloudy orange-brown body with a tawny, coarse head that leaves no lace. The nose is based mostly on caramel malt and husk aromas, with a bit of orange juice and pith and some unidentifiable bitterness, similar to noble hop aromas. The flavor is also mostly malt, a coarse, raw, dry kind of malt. The hop flavors are restricted to the basics of orange varieties; any kind of other fruits, skunkiness, pine, earth, or anything else interesting are absent. It is much more bitter than sweet, which isn't to say it is either bitter or dry. The body is medium-full, carbonation has disarmed itself to a pleasant prickle."
Poured an amber color with a nice two finger head. The head broke slowly and there was nice lacing visible. The smell was bready and caramel malts and a broad citrusy hops. The malts show up quickly on tasting but are then pushed out of the way for a hop blast. The hops are strong and remain on the tongue quite a while. The feel is medium with good carbonation. 
"I had this beer on a flight from St. Paul to Seattle. Don't know if that made it better or not, but my first impression was that it was too highly carbonated. The color, red-orange, was exactly what I expected from reading the can, and the strong hops aroma came through and persisted throughout the three hour flight. I would like to try this one again while I'm on the ground."
"The appearance was always a nice golden orange to amber color with a one and a half fingered white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. The lacing slid into the beer. The smell had a nice sweet maltiness running underneath of a nice citrusy/piney hoppiness. The taste was basically the same that lead to a decent sweet aftertaste and a dry sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat at/about a light to medium in body and holds a decent sessionable aspect about it. The carbonation was slightly smooth as it didn’t really seem to hold its own as far as sharpness for a normal AIPA. Overall, good AIPA for the most part."
"Poured from a 1 pint can into a Shaker pint glass, ""best by"" date 3-28-17."
"Surly Furious, 6.6% ABV, 99 IBU. Pours medium viscosity and copper, with a half-finger off-white head. Nose is fruity and hoppy, taste follows, with a moderate bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel, a well-balanced beer that doesn't show its 99 IBU rating. Overall excellent."
"Great beer. It reminds me of Blood of the Unicorn by Pipeworks in that it's red, but the taste is IPA throughout. I'm psyched that I can finally get Surly in central Illinois!"
This brew I had on draft during a business trip to Minneapolis. It is a hazy amber brown color with a slightly off white head. Hoppy and earthy aroma with a similarly hoppy flavor. Wonderful bitterness and a full body. Nice.
A - One-inch head that holds for about a minute. Cloudy amber color with little bubbles
"I frequently overlook this beer, for no good reason at that. My favorite style of American IPA, somewhere around Two Hearted and even within range of Arrogant Bastard. Dry malt, piney, citrus shows up as acidity (but in a good way). Balanced ABV, a bit murky in appearance. But definitely needs to be poured into a glass."
Picked up a can from TW Arrowhead on 3-12-17 for 3.49. Canned on 2.7.17. 
Look: Dark orange/copper clear with small head that recedes quickly.
Can poured into a Russian River Brewing Co nonic pint glass
Appearance - Pours wonderful deep amber color with thin off white head. Spotty lacing.
"I am shocked at what is rated a 96 on beeradvocate.com. Fcking shocked. I am a Minnesotan through and through and was all excited to try a Surly beer and holy crap was I disappointed. I am not going to mention what glass I poured it in, what color I thought it was, and I am not going to mention what it smelled like. I popped the canned top and prepared my self for uber goodness. What I got was uber sadness. Oh, it was drinkable, but I polished off beers half the price with 4x the flavor before trying Furious. WTF. I am embarrased for the state of MN with this particular beer. I SOUGHT after Surly beer because of its scores. I am pissed that I bought a sh*tty beer. Maybe my palate isn't refined. I know I am not among the beer tasting elite, but good god was this a bad buy."
"This one pours a nice moderately dark amber, with a small head and lots of lacing."
"Pours reddish-brown with a big off-white head that dissipates quickly. Dark but not opaque, looks like a lot of bubbles are in this one. Smells very hoppy with some citrus and pine. Biggest tastes for me here are the pine and hops, and while it's very aggressive to start, the malt mellows it out before long. Dry finish. Medium to heavy mouthfeel that I didn't love, but the carbonation is nice. Overall just a little too bitter for my palate at the moment, but it's clearly well-made and I'm hoping it'll grow on me the more I get it."
"Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City Spiegelau IPA glass."
Tap poured into pint glass at the yard house 
"Pours a amber red with a large off white head from my heavy pour. Nose is fairly unspectacular. Getting a bit of malt and really no hops. Taste of toasted malts, pine gum, floral, caramel and alcohol. For some reason I'm finding this on pretty hot and boozy for single. Fairly bitter, a beer in the mold of a NWIPA. Medium body with a nice dry finish."
"Pours a orange/red with decent foam and lacing. Smells wonderful, full of pine, citrus, malt, and hops. The taste is just full force, this stuff is terrific in your face beer, tons of citrus, pine, hops bite then a smooth malt mixed in to temper the storm. The finish is medium and clean, very nice beer."
"A-Brown with an orange/red hue, off white head, low to medium lacing"
"16oz can with a 2/14/17 date poured into a Trillium 16oz snifter. Looks like a clear amber ale with a half finger of loosely packed head that receded to a ring around the glass and left minimal lacing. Aroma is pine and earthy peat moss. Flavor is pine and bitter citrus. Taste like I'm chewing on an orange peel. There is a slight sweetness but I wouldn't call it caramel as the commercial description claims. Mouthfeel is very dry, very thin, and very bitter. I had high hopes based on the high score this gets, but now I'm regretting buying 4 cans. It's not very balanced, and falls short for me."
"How can you not like this beer? Seriously, how? One of my go-to favorites. I won't bore anyone with mouthfeel or color... this beer is just so dang good. Drink it."
"I brought two cans home from a recent trip to Minneapolis, about one month old according to canning dates. The first can I drank had a fairly strong alcohol presence, but the second can (consumed several days later) was much better with really nice tropical fruit notes."
I finally am able to enjoy this IPA thanks to a co-worker who brought it back from Christmas Vacation. Poured into a pint glass at 40 degrees. A one finger light tan foamy creamy head with fair retention. The color of the beer is a copper color with some reddish hues. The clarity of the beer is clear and some carbonation bubble are visible. 
Pours amber with a tall foamy white head. Fades to short uneven creamy head rather quickly
"Can poured into pint glass; rustic orange color with modest carbonation. Hops, burnt caramel and pine greet the nose. Medium body with well balanced hops, malts and resins. Mild bitterness that does not cling to the palate. Very enjoyable!"
"Pours a deep dark opaque orange. Nice cream colored head, which doesn't stick around too long, nice lacing though. Very carbonated, medium mouthfeel. Strong hoppy flavor that really lingers. Delicious!"
"It sits in the glass as a slightly hazy amber yellow brown color with a thin layer of white head spread across the top. The smell of this beer is rather complex. You get the caramel malts in the middle and followed by the piney bitter bite of the hops. At first though the beer has an almost rose like nose to it, especially when it was colder. The malty nature of the beer starts to shine once it warms up a bit but you also get a slightly sweet juicy note to the aroma as well. The taste is nothing remarkable to be perfectly honest (Caveat, I am not a hop head). It is kind of flat an muted with not much nuance. There is slight juicy flavor on the front end but the middle is hollow and empty. The back end is followed by the piney resiny bite of the hops yet it still manages to not be all that bitter, which I enjoy. The hop resin does linger however and coats your mouth. The feel of this beer is medium light with a normal amount of carbonation. Overall this beer is better than many IPA's yet is not world class."
"Great aroma to match the taste of this beer. The body is great holding a slightly more viscous consistency than that of many of it's IPA counterparts. This was a great pleasure to drink. Coming from Oregon, it's great to see other areas in the nation with passionate and growing beer scenes."
Dark Carmel color with a moderate pure white head and lacing. A subdued nose with more malt than pine. A bold taste with malty Carmel flavors and a bitter hop flavor throughout to keep any sweetness at bay. A nice twist on the pale ale but still true to the style. Worth seeking out.
"L: Pours a brilliant, crimson color with a nice creamy white head, a very nice looking beer."
"Like so many beers before it, Furious is one of those brews which I patiently waited to try for years until one day, the opportunity became under seige. Changing flights in Minneapolis gave me that one shot, and I took it. On to the beer:"
Received in NBS BIF #4 – thanks @josholson666!
There's a point where it's too bitter even for someone who loves hops - this beer seems to have crossed over that threshold! I enjoy the taste up front but it's too much bitterness at the end.
"Gives you an orange colored pour, fluffy white 1"" head. Aroma is excellent, pine, grapefruit and sweeter citrus. "
Served in a snifter glass right from the can. 
Enjoyed this at a bar in the airport at Minneapolis. first beer i had while in MN.
"4/19/16 can date. Didn't realize this was three months old, but oh well. I love the 16 oz serving size. Perfect amount of beer for a 6.5%abv. This one is hoppy with a good malt backbone. Kind of reminded me of an Arrogant Bastard light. Still hoppy with plenty of bite but less alcohol, more balanced even. A wonderful brew."
"16oz can. 6/22/16 can date. Appearance: Reddish, amber brown with a slight haze and a moderate khaki colored head. Aroma: Toasty, light caramel maltiness, with a moderate resinous and light citrus hop aroma. Taste: Rich toast, bread crust and caramel maltiness dominates the taste profile. Strong hop character throughout to balance the rich maltiness, leading with resin and finishing with a moderately strong perceived bitterness and a quick burst of grapefruit. Mouthfeel: Fairly heavy body for the style, with a medium carbonation. Finish: Hop bitterness really lingers on this one, almost stronger than during the actual tasting. Sticky resin really lingers on the tongue. Overall: Really interesting in that this beer seems to be a blend of an American IPA, Red IPA, and and English Bitter. Malt profile reminiscent of English pale ales, but the hop profile is probably suited for a IIPA. One thing is for sure, there’s nothing weak about this beer. It’s very good, but the intensity would make it tough to power through multiple in one sitting."
16 oz can. Pours slightly hazy light copper amber with a medium frothy off white head that retains fairly well and leaves little lacing.
"Brewed with 2-row, Golden Promise, Aromatic, Medium Crystal, Roasted Barley. Hopped with Warrior, Ahtanum, Cascade, Simcoe, Amarillo. OG=15P, English ale yeast. Bought at Goodmans in Kenosha, $8.99/4pk 16oz cans. 6.60% ABV"
"Poured from a can, a deep orangish color (sunset after a good downpour color) Not too heavy of a head. Tastes exactly as described on the can, heavy hops aroma. Fantastic tastes, this is definitely a favorite."
poured out of a can. barely 30 days old.
"Pours slightly cloudy reddish brown with an ivory head. Leaves great lacing. Aroma is citrus and pine. Flavor is a blend of malt and hops, citrusy and pine. Well carbonated and crisp. A decent beer."
A - Pours a dark amber with a two finger foamy off white head. Good amount of soapy lacing.
"Aroma is fairly malty, with notes of caramel countered by muted grapefruit, pine, and resin."
"Well. Can advertises citrus and pine with notes of caramel and toffee. What I got was tremendously tea forward, followed by notes of citrus, pine, caramel and toffee. Which was ok, kinda reminded me of an old Northern Hemisphere tea bomb and a young Weyerbacher Harvest Ale I had once. I like tea, but not this much. No excuses this beer is barely over one month old. Overall disapointing at best."
This beer is amazing!!!
"Deep amber color, good clarity. Poured modest whitish head, okay retention. "
From can dated 3-15-16 
APPEARANCE: Just slightly hazy. The beer has a red and what I would call tea-like appearance. A finger + of foamy tan-ish head that quickly settles down to a ring. Minor lacing.
"Pours orange brown with slight head, thick lacing. Floral and almost buttery notes on the scent. Crisp citrusy tasting. The slight bitterness and alcohol are more on the aftertaste. Very full mouth feel."
"Beautiful Amber. Carmel and a hint a sweet fruity bubblegum, floral hops. Above average nose but very great flavors. I am really starting to like surly beer. I enjoy the complexity."
What was I thinking ?
"On tap at MSP airport. They served it very very cold, but hey, I've got an hour to kill, so I wait for it to warm."
Moderately hazy amber-orange color with a frothy light tan head. Decent lacing in the glass. Big piney aroma with some orange rind and caramel malt. Piney as hell on the palate. Also balanced with earthy and some citrus notes. A dry caramel malt backbone. Old-school bitter and a clean finish.
"Poured a cloudy golden color. The hoppy, fruity smell is strong and the best part. The taste was overly hoppy for me, and almost too complex, leaving a bitter aftertaste. Not a favorite."
Revisited 10/13/18
I had this poured at a bar into a clear glass. Great look! Nice head! Very good beer. IPAs aren't my favorite; too hoppy.
"Pours dark orange, one finger of head that doesn't linger very long. Smell is aggressively hoppy. Taste is not as hoppy as the smell would indicate, but is warm and smooth, balanced. Taste is long-lasting. Feels creamy and gentle going down. Very nice!"
Furious has one of the most succinctly accurate label descriptions ever.
This beer poured a darker golden orange color into my Teku glass. The nose is a little more malt forward than I expected from this beer. There is a nice hop presence and a good amount of bitterness. A little more malt than I like in this type of beer. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean. A nice beer for the type but a little heavy on the malt for my taste.
"pours a slightly hazy reddish/copper color, off white foamy head that dissipates quickly into nothing. smell is light, pine and caramel like malt with a very light lemon scent over hanging, almost like a Stone IPA. but taste is nothing like the smell, citrus dominates for a second but then that caramel malt and pine come in and mix with it, it's very balanced, leaves some stickiness on the tongue, and has a good light mouthfeel. I was actually impressed by this one. I was a little nervous with the color, but it doesn't taste much like a red IPA. Hope I can get my hands on Abrasive."
"Pours amber in color with a nice white head that turns into a thin covering that remains on the edge of the beer throughout the pour. The nose is very malty to me, which is the opposite of what I was expecting. I pick up some biscuit and some earthy wood like flavor which I attribute to the scottish malt. There is a hint of scottish ale to this one which is a fun and unique dynamic. There is also some pine and citrus on the nose, with maybe a splash of dankness. I would guess there is a lot of simcoe hops in this one. The taste is that of a malty ipa with some some nice sticky pine residue. The feel is clean and crisp with an awesome bitterness. I keep wanting to drink more."
"The bread and butter of Surly Brewing's creations, Furious is a very solid IPA. Known for being an in your face IPA-maker, Surly has crafted Furious with extreme amount of hops that can be a little startling at first but becomes enjoyable with palate adjustment. Wonderfully flavorful but a bit on the overly bitter side."
Can poured into tulip glass. 12/8/15
"Poured from a tall boy canned 5 weeks ago. Bold amber body with a moderate head that lasts. Aroma and taste is big malt, caramel, toast, wood and light floral hops. Citrus and pine atop the Scottish malt foundation which tastes of caramel and toasted malt. Great looking beer with a clean malt bill and big bitter finish."
"COD 12/1/15. Pours a lovely amber with a strong garnet cast. World class head volume, lacing and retention."
"Aroma - orange, pine, resin, caramel malt, toast, mild anise. Fairly strong aroma."
Perfect.
"came out the can a cloudy dark orangish amber--darker than I'd have expected, if I had an expectation. The head rose a scant 1/2"" and left the area quickly, leaving a film. Sniffwise, got to be at least 99% grapefruit. My hopes that this one-sided character would not carry through through to the taste were quickly dashed, however. Grapefruit juice, grapefruit pulp, grapefruit pith, fresh grapefruit, boiled grapefruit . . . (activate Bubba Gump voice if desired). Not to offend grapefruit fanatics, but this is a beer I have looked forward to trying for a very long time and I could already get plenty of grapefruit bombs. Better describe the finish to make this review legit. Grapefruit. The feel is fine, I guess, if you can ignore that your mouth is full of fizzy grapefruit pulp, grapefruit juice, grapefruit pith, grapefruit rind, and possibly some bits of videotape from an old Oceanspray commercial."
"I grabbed a growler from Casanova liquor, and drank a few hours after purchasing. I pulled the growler from the fridge and poured about 5-10 minutes afterwards. "
Have been waiting to try something from this brewery for some time now. Pours brownish cooper with one finger head. Piney with faint citrus aroma. The sweetness from the malts dominate with hops playing the background similar to a hoppy barleywine such as Bigfoot. It is rather smooth. The balance and mouthful are its strong points just not what I look for in an IPA.
Really good Hoppy brew. Is a go to brew as it is readily availble. Well balanced and great hop bill. A little to malty for my personal taste. Could use more juice
"Flight at MSP. Different for an IPA, some savory spice. Creamy, slick body, nice lacing. Medium golden, some honey, not a lot of hops. Mid west IPA? Did not feel the love that is bestowed on this beer."
Christmas gift from Tom.
I am within walking distance to get this beer. I consider myself blessed. Just an awesome IPA.
into the glass copper with reddish hue and wheat head 
8/11/15 can date
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 10/20/2015. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy reddish orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, light roast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, light roast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Large amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and minimal hop astringency after the finish. Good amount of dryness from bitterness as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome IPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. Despite the darker malt and appearance; this was still very dry with minimal overall sweetness as expected for a west coast style IPA. A highly enjoyable offering."
This is my absolute favorite American IPA. Only bad thing is it's not distributed in Michigan.
"The reserved aroma doesn't come close to preparing you for the huge hop punch about to land on the roof of your mouth. Major grapefruit and piney bitterness that lingers on and on. Some milder notes of tropical fruit, aspirin, and lightly toasted bread. Full bodied, slightly creamy mouthfeel. No doubt a well made beer. While a little more bitter than I prefer, I highly recommended if you love big hops."
Had this beer at tap takeover at Red's in North Liberty
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass
"I really like this beer a lot. As the 16 oz can says, it's crimson-hued and very clear. Beige 2 fingers of head doesn't last super long. Decent lacing. The first smell is a massive hit of pine, which after a bit moves more into a grapefruit type thing, and later has some dank and just a bit of sweet malt. The taste is like the smell: pine/grapefruit then some bready malt, then a moderately dry pine finish that lasts a long time. Feel is pretty substantial overall, with only just a little bit taken off for a watery middle before the drying finish. This is a balanced and complex beer that is currently one of my favorites. Try it if you can get it!"
This is a great beer. A hoppy session sledgehammer. It's pretty much what you should expect from a world class IPA. Enjoying this fresh in Minnesota makes this beer all the better.
"On tap at Links taproom in Chicago. Pours a brilliant Amber. Not a ton of hops in the nose, more of the malts I think. Taste is plenty bitter, not particularly juicy or bright. Plenty of malt build, so it is on the sweet side. This one is highly rated so I had high hopes, but it is just solid for me rather than remarkable."
"This one was a little disappointing for me. It had a really nice nose and a beautiful hazy apricot colored pour, but the flavor was not very well balanced. I got lots of bitterness on the finish without enough juiciness from the hops."
"Looks outstanding. A non transparent copper - amber color with a huge, fluffy tan head that lasts all day. "
Draught @ Green Mill: This one pours a fairly clear coppery/amber color. There was a small off white head that leaves some lacing. The nose is good. A good mix of pine and tropical fruit hops. Some malts and grain in the background. The taste is very good. A good hop flavor. It is a mix of pine and tropical fruits. A nice balance between all of them. Good malts and grains in the background. This is a keeper.
A 16 fl oz can canned on 8th July 2015 and poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
I was really looking forward to this beer. At the very least I was incredibly disappointed. Traded for it and just underwhelmed from the get go.
"This tastes a hell of a lot like Nugget Nectar to me. Big piney citrus hits in the nose and the requisite bitterness that comes with it in the flavor. Sides of the tongue will feel the IBUs in this beer. Drinks a little bigger than the 6+% ABV would suggest. Lovely dark amber in color with an orange tinged two finger head. Lots of caramel sweetness, kind of a sweet bready quality in the aroma. Interestingly the sweet smells and flavor don't translate exactly in the mouthfeel. It was more light of body than I had anticipated after smelling and taking my first few sips. Great beer all around, would love to try some more of what Surly has to offer."
A wonderful beer. The story goes that the brewery didn't really expect to do much with this beer and then the public tried it and couldn't get enough of it. A fantastic IPAish beer. Enjoy!
"16 oz can poured into a shaker. Very sweet, potent floral notes, along with ample citrus, cereal and a bit of bread greet the nose. A slightly hazy copper red colored body is topped by a puffy, doughy, light tan / orange head. The retention is okay, with a thick ring and a heavy wispy layer leaving behind a light, messy lacing. The tongue is met with a high level bitter that’s cut nicely by a smooth, velvety, medium high sweetness. The texture is velvety smooth and slick, with a light, fluffy carbonation The medium body is bready with bitter citrus and the finish has a citrus and creamy caramel character to it with some sour cherries, and bubblegum, and a burnt hint and some pine. The aftertaste is not as overwhelming as I would have thought - given the bitterness. It cleans up and consists mostly of a toast dryness and caramel syrup. The aftertaste does linger, but is mostly mellow."
Poured from can with a canned on date of 8/4/15
"A delicious hoppy beer obtained in trade. Was worried about April 27 date, but cans clearly outlast bottles. Was surprised that it didn't have a stronger aroma."
Another one from my friend in Minnesota. This is a really hoppy beer. There is a lot going on inside this can and everything about it is totally awesome. I honestly wish I could get this on the regular.
"16oz can, at 6.6% ABV, and thanks be to rogerdandy for the donation to the cause. I never knew this brewery had so many awesome-sounding products!"
"I've been drinking Furious for about five years, and I consider it my 'go to' beer. In my opinion it's the ideal. It hits everything almost perfectly. I tend to prefer a slightly higher IBU, but that's not what this beer is about. It's about balance. I've never been disappointed drinking this beer. It keeps me coming back for more. I'd have rated it higher but I don't believe in perfection. If there is such a thing, Furious comes close."
Maybe I had an old or it is not my style of IPA. Too malty for my taste. Obviously well liked but won't have again. Had high hopes but that's craft beer for ya...
"The beer looks great in a glass and has a fantastic aroma! Citrus, pine and more. It is very smooth and flavorful, which makes it easy to have 4-6 of them no problem. One of the best single IPA's in the Midwest! This is probably the third best beer made by Surly, which is crazy!"
A - Amber with 2 fingers of head
"A bit too malty for me, but still a very nice IPA. Very balanced with minimal bitterness and focuses on the flavor and aroma of the wonderful hop profile. Definitely worth seeking out."
Excellent. Very refreshing. Malt sweetness can be tough for me. This was perfect. Very subtle.
A - nice reddish brown clear color with a khaki head on it that fades pretty quick
"pours an amber color with an off white head. good lacing and decent retention. smell is huge amounts of piney citrus. taste follows, with resinous pine dominating the palate with a touch of sweetness. not overly bitter. delicious."
Clear Amber appearance with a big fluffy head. 
8/25...Surly Furious. Reddish brown some remaining white foam. Bready toffee nose. Tsunami of pine expertly blended into a peppery malt. Spicy finish. Outstanding. 4 45 425 45 425
"Hard to beat. My only gripe is that there's so many on shelves these days it's very difficult to find fresh. Piney, malty and subtle hints of pineapple."
"Deep clear amber, finger white head, minor lacing. Caramel malt aroma with faint grass and pine, dark fruit as warms. Big sweet caramel malt flavor countered by piney hops with a little wood in the finish. Mouthfeel is crispy with dry finish. Overall a malt forward full flavored IPA with powerful hops. Very good."
Poured from a can about a month old into a pint glass.
Had this at brewery tap room in Minneapolis poured from tap into their fluted snifter as well as from a 16oz can at a twins game the next day.
"Pours a rich copper color. Has a malty sweet aroma with hop presence. Taste is intriguing. Like a quick burst of ops that gives way to a balanced maltyness, but leaves a light hoppy aftertaste. A very good beer"
Awesome combination of west coast hoppiness and eastern sweetness. Very easy to drink.
L: Pours brilliant tea tinted amber under a persistent 3” cream colored clingy foam collar with a very fine bead. 
Poured from a 12oz can with a canned on date of 1/16/18; into a pint glass.
Very nice brew here! Real good look and feel; the taste is superb! I will have more Surly Furious in the future!
This beer is one of my favorite go to beers. It is just the right amount of citrus bite with a nice crisp finish. This isnt one of those that goes bad quickly either. Great 5-6 weeks later
"Amazing malty sweetness alongside the bright ""grapefruit"" variety hops and honey. My first Surly brew was an unbelievably mind-blowing experience!"
Poured from a can into a snifter. 
"Dark copper color with a nice red hue. Thin head that lingers. Nice hop aroma with a little bit of maltiness. Good hop flavor with some toffee from the malt. Good, smooth carbonation."
"Amber, reddish color. Very thin white head, not too much lacing. Nice tropical hop aroma on the nose. Hoppy taste on the front, malty flavor on the back end. Not usually a big proponent of the maltier IPA's but pleasantly surprised with this one."
On draft Minn airport
A (4.75): Poured from a can into a pint glass. Somewhat Translucent Amber ale with huge number of sprites rising to the 1/4 inch creamy fluff of a head. Nice lacing on glass tilt. Looks good. Lacing holds up fairly well with an 1/8 inch remaining on last pull.
"Pours a hazy orange-amber color, with a decent head."
"Looks and smells beautiful and initial taste is good. Finish is weak and disappointing. Overall it's good, but once I finish the 4 pack of cans its probably not a beer I will buy again."
"Now I see the hype with this one. Bitter, but with tons of flavor. The hops really stand out. I was first reluctant to try this due to the high ibus, but the flavor really makes it worth it. I'm glad I live in Minnesota so I can buy many more of these."
"I am normally a huge fan of bitter IPA's, but this one just killed my tastebuds. Citrus and pine? Nope, just bitter."
Had on tap 3 July 15 Minnesota airport
Super strong hard to drink For beer pros only
Extremely overrated and overhyped. Canned on 5/19. 
Better than average but could use better balance with malt
"Big head to begin, fading to a bubbly chunkiness. Beautiful amber-orange emanates from the pint glass. "
"I, I don't get it. You can't go to MPLS without some yahoo staggering up to you bragging about Surly this or Surly that. I mean, really? It's a decent enough beverage to fill-in when your first or second string is on the bench but come on, the Hype! around this concoction was waaaaay over-rated. It's a little silly. Especially from a place where Summit comes from. But having said that, I can see where the excitement comes from. So...yea for you, I guess."
"My favorite MN beer, for more than 1 reason. After ya finish yours I think you'll agree, cheers!"
16 oz can poured into a pub-style pint glass.
16oz can dated 04/06/15
"Poured into a taster glass. Thanks, Biggs!"
Really glad to try this one. Dark amber which is normally a turnoff but overall this was very good. Balanced and nice bitterness. Nice buzz from one 16 oz can.
"Look: Barely hazy amber with light tan head, some lacing	"
"Super clean, well balanced, excellent malt flavor, but you still don't lose the hops. Has moments of imperial IPA but only in taste not abv. Really enjoyed this one"
"Really amber for an IPA. Lots of toffee, caramel and malt going on.Nice clean hop finish."
Great beer! Had it served with lovely appetizers at a local restaurant! Can't wait for the next one!
Super balanced beer. Flavor form start to finish. 96/100
Amazing...wish it would be exported to rest of USA so America can taste what the Twin Cities has to offer
This is how its done
"L (4.5) - Beautiful amber, orange, gold color. Nice amount of head on top. Nice light tan colored"
My current favorite local beer! Big and bold.
"Nice blend of hops and malt, heavy on the hops, but delicious."
"Broke in my new IPA glass with this one. Beautiful deep amber in color. I could smell the citrus (primarily grapefruit) from 2 feet away. The grapefruit carried over into the taste with a nice hoppy & bitter aftertaste. Feel was average with small bubbles and smooth carbonation. Overall, very good and recommended."
"Pours a medium red with a one finger head. I wonderful citrus hop smell. The hop not as strong as expected, withe a slight bitter finish. It does resonate into the nose. Could drink a bunch of this."
Outstanding IPA. It's like a fresher tasting version of Sculpin.
"Deep amber w great legs. Piney citrusy nose w a very similar taste. Notes of buttered, honeyed bread and lemongrass in the finish. A bit overpriced for what's ultimately a second tier Midwestern IPA (A four pack of Two Hearted tallboys is about four bones less), but this at the very top of that second tier and a very pleasant drink regardless."
"My go to IPA. Perfect balance between hops and malts. Defiantly worth seeking out, or trading for."
Appearance: pours a deep orangish red color. a two to three finger off white head with decent retention. a small streaky lacing around the edges. pretty hazy and almost opaque. 
Entirely too malty to be considered an IPA
"A MN favorite, hop forward ipa"
"Great copper color. Very clear. Minimal head retention. Subtle citrus hop flavor quickly overpowered by aggressive, palate-cleansing bitterness.... Which I loved! Very lively carbonation which was also refreshing."
"Very sweet tones on the nose of honey, caramel, watermelon, tropical fruits and grapefruit. There is some dank herbal hop notes as well. "
I drank this beer 2 months after the canned date. Seems like a very malt forward beer. I won't spend my review criticizing it because I love this brewery. It's just not for me.
Just not very good. Too much malt which overpowers the hops.
Very Very good. Just not Abrasive...
Dude hooked me up with two in a row. Solid man! Great trade!
Tastes like a spicy ipa that just doesn't blend well
"Canned 12/23/15 . Dark copper, off white foam. Nice nose, oily pine. Bitter hit, then orange peel and pine. Finshing citrus peel. Grapfuit, sory of oily peel finishing after 3rd swallow. Hint of sweet? Hope taste and aroma is great. Not overwhelming but for sure there. Hopheads will really enjoy. I echo earlier sentiments, really smooth."
Tap pour into a pint glass. 
"As a Wisconsinite, I only get the treat of drinking this when I visit friends in Minneapolis. Usually, I bring a 4 pack of Furious home to share with friends. "
Overrated. Not a bad brew. But definitely overrated.
Solid hopp! Maybe a sweeter finish. Overall pretty good off the tap in a pint glass with dinner. Thank you sir may I have another!!
"The name says it all here - this is a hop heavy, deep amber IPA that amps up the IBUs whilst maintaining a malt backbone that keeps something of a balance here. But let’s be honest - balance is not what you are looking for here. Some sweetness on the back end that does its’ best to level out the bitterness."
"Extremely hoppy, but very flavorful. Next time I need to pair it better."
Smells like grapefruit and blood orange. Bitter hops punch you in the tongue with a piney taste
Very enjoyable and easy drinking. Solid beer.
Had on draft
Very bitter and earthy. I enjoyed the English tasting malt but the hop profile left something to be desired on my palate.
Almost the perfect IPA. Strong hop-forward taste like you'd expect and enough bitterness to pack a punch but not wreck your palette. Love it!
super solid IPA.. love this beer
Just another delicious beer from Surly!
Trendy hipster palette killer for the immature.
This was just an ok IPA to me. Nothing special about it. Over-hyped in my opinion.
"A: Amber/red in color. Finger off white head. Head is rocky, with fairly rapid dissipation. Carbonation is minimal, with miniscule bubbles rising to the surface. Moderate lacing. "
Malty resiny aroma. Amberish in color. On tap at MSP airport. 
Much darker than I anticipated. Overall good with a sharp bite up front but lacking any smoothness on the finish. Still glad I got to try this!
"L - It pours a coppery brown. About a fingers width of off white head. The head lingers for quite some time. When it dissipates it falls into, leaving a thin ring around the edge. A slight amount of lacing clings to the glass. Very enticing."
Not sure what all the fuss is about.
Very hoppy but good for an IPA
What a surprise - an IPA in a can. Very pure IPA favor and golden bronze color. A must have IPA
"Bitter is the main flavor especially the aftertaste, very smooth in terms of alcohol"
Well balanced IPA
Furious WOW! Smelled the pine and the hopps are kickin but I got a hint of gasoline. Is it the Scottish Malt? What a Kick!!
Wish I could get this stuff more regularly!
"16oz can, kept at fridge temp (~40F) poured into hefeweizen glass. Can is dated 7/29/2014, consumed on 9/23/2014"
I always seem to get this along with Overrated and I always prefer the latter. Furious pours darker than I like my IPAs. Very malty and bitter for my tastes
"My exception for American IPAs. Nice, sweeter, with less carbonation then other beers. Good flavors of citrus or grapefruit. There is a little touch of bitter aftertaste."
"Without question, one if not my favorite IPA of all time, year after year."
From notes on 3/29/14
Wasn't a fan of this.
The ultimate IPA. It hits every note you want from this classic style of beer.
Canned 7/17/14 and poured 9/8/14. Price interestingly enough isn't on the can like the others one I got from Four Firkins. I'd guess maybe $4 for a single can wouldn't be far off.
"Pours amber with a big rocky head. Aroma of orange, grapefruit, biscuits, and caramel. Tastes of citrus, bread, pine, caramel. Very hoppy, but strong malt presence. Sweetness balances the hop bitterness nicely. I like a malty IPA, and this is right up my alley. The malt and hops elevate each other, though the hops are still the star of the show. If this were in my distro area, it would be my go-to beer."
Pint can at cooler temp poured into a shake pint glass. Canned 07/30/2014.
"Finally after long last my FIRST Surly beer,thanks Erik.Pours a deep burnt orange color with a full half finger slight off white head that leaves a few broken rings of lace as it settles.Hop oils really jump out at ya in the aromas just resiny and sharp goodness,sweetish caramel malts stand out as well.Resiny and with sharp grapefruit rind hops up front on the palate,alot of sharpness,followed by some nuttiness and quite sweet caramel malts.It is a big hop machine,sharp and bitter,I love the hops and really like this beer."
Dark amber colored with great clarity. A fingernail of white foam covers the majority of the top of the beer. Brussels lacing. The aroma is solely comprised of citrus hops. The citrus hop flavor is prominent but is nicely balanced with light malt. There's nice long bitter citrus hop fade that beckons you to take another sip. The mouth is fairly smooth and light for all of that flavor. Dangerously drinkable.
"Poured from a can. Deep amber color, decent head and lacing. Smell is tropical and matches a nice hop flavor. Its more malty than most of the other top IPAs, but it works. I've had this several times in the past and have been unimpressed I think due to age where the malt took over. A recent pursuit to get a much fresher can (1 month, still could do better) has yielded solid results."
I ordered this. Furious at Ike's in the MSP airport.
Good flavor without heavy alcohol.
"Aroma is floral hops, pine and a hint of candy/sugar. The flavor is citrus, relatively light grapefruit, malts, mild hop resin and a long and very bitter/dry finish."
Finally had the chance to try this beer on tap while visiting Chicago. 
"Very good but overrated (I say overrated simply because I do not feel it deserves its current, elevated reputation) IPA from a very good but overrated brewery."
"Serving: On tap, 4oz sampler"
Brought home in my luggage from a business trip to Minneapolis. Cannon on 6/25/14. This beer was five weeks old. Poured into a nonic pint. 
"A - Transparent reddish orange-copper, with a hint of gold, and a off-white head that pours short and fades quick, but laces expansively."
"Poured a brownish orange, like dark amber maple syrup. I smell faint hops and malt. A nice solid head on this one, and good lacing. Tastes of mild fruit, though none of note, and some pine, as well as caramel malt. Well balanced, with the malts and bitters in check. Glad I got to try it through a trade."
Appearance is a dark amber color with a one finger head.
"This is an IPA that I wish I had here. It's the best example of a Mid-Western balanced IPA out there. I cannot find much fault with this one. It has great lacing, a good head on the pour, smell is solid and the taste is full and is not just a hop bomb. Great one if you can find it. They are expanding to Chicago and building a bigger brewery. Lets hope they get outside of MN."
A: reddish translucence. A nice thick off white head. Slowly dissipates. 
Can poured into a Jester King goblet.
Glass Used: Nonic
"On draft at Butcher & The Boar and Triple Rock Social Club, Minneapolis. "
Appearance - Poured from the can and a dark orange liquid appeared. Left behind was a 1 inch off-white colored head that dissipated with rings of lacing along the glass.
"Thin, light, white head. Color is ruby red orange. The smell is of aromatic citrus, honey, and subtle, sweet pine. This beer is hoppy, citrusy, and balanced. Nothing overwhelms the other. Carbonation is medium and the mouthfeel is about average for an IPA."
A - pours a dark brown / red with two fingers of creamy off white head. Nice retention and spotty lace.
Traded to get a 4 pack and glad I did. This is my last one so time to sip slow and review.
"This beer is the bar by which all beer loving midwestern's measure every other IPA's. It's better than Two Hearted, Pliny the Elder, 90 minute, Hopslam varies too much from year to year to say, but if you can remember the first time you had any of those beers and you haven't had this one, you're in for a treat."
On tap at a special event. Appearance is copper with a little more red thrown in. No haze noticed. Head was good on my pour and left nice lacing. 
"Pours out nice light maroon in color with a healthy two finger, white head with good retention and some really nice lacing."
Had on draft at churchkey on 5/8/14
Drank on 5-5-14 from a can that was canned on 3-24-14. I live on the East coast so i am assuming this to be about as fresh as I am going to get. Not that it seemed stale..
"This pours a semi-clear, dark amber color with a foamy, beige head. The aroma is strong with hops and citrus mixed with some floral tones. The taste is extremely bold in bitter hops especially for being 99 IBUs. Great texture with decent drinkability but with 16 ounces, you can expect your taste buds to be ruined for a little while. The first Surly beer I have ever had and it’s delicious."
"Pours a soapy, resiny head that has insane persistence and laces like mad. Citrus hop aroma; smells like a grapefruit. Amber burnt sienna color. Starts bitter with a great citrus hoppiness; very bright. Moves into a respectable maltiness before the finish, which is lingering citrus rind bitterness on top of the malt. "
Poured straight from a 16 oz can into a snifter glass. Canned 4/21/14 and consumed nine days later...super fresh.
"Shared a can of this immediately before trying Surly Abrasive. As far as standard IPA's go, this is definitely one of the best. A huge aroma and lots of big flavor here. Notes of pine needles, orange and other citrus. Nicely balanced. Not much else to say - just a fantastic, straight-up IPA."
Poured from a can into a snifter
"This beer has an overall amber color. The head is very thick with a beige/amber color. Aromas of pine, caramels and tea leaves make give this beer an overall earthy tone. Flavors include grapefruit, pine and spices. The aftertaste overall is dry and bitter."
Poured from a 16 oz. Can
"This is an old can dated from September. I should be more careful when buying. Nevertheless it's clearly a fine beer. Its best quality is the look: dark caramel color. Aroma is slightly citrusy and the taste combines the citrus with sweet caramel malts. I like my IPAs on the malty side and this is past it's prime, but without doubt a very good beer. Looking forward to trying it fresh."
"After having on tap several times and being underwhelmed, I tried this one again and came away with a more positive review."
16oz can from bobbypaulson (thanks man!). Canned 1/9/14. Served in a Founders snifter. 
"Furious is a nice, slightly hazed medium-dark orange that leans bronze in the depths of the body. It keeps up some strong bubbling activity for the session. This serves to keep up the eggshell-colored head that's created upon settling. The head is firm and dense, thick and rocky and heavily pock-marked as it very slowly settles. Patching is in very good quantity and is downright chunky in parts."
Had on tap at MSP Airport. Amber looking color for an American IPA. Seemed odd. Had to actually look it up on iPad as I didn't trust the man telling me the flight order as he looked confused. Damn nubes.
Pours a clear somewhat ambery red with a plump finger of off-white foam.
Poured from a can into a regular glass
Amber copper color with a thick beige head with good retention and leaving laces.
"Pours a darker, semi-murky amber color. A little darker for an IPA. Medium sized off white head that quickly dissipates. Very little lacing."
"Pours a dark orange with a huge foamy head. Malt forward on the nose with caramel and toffee notes. Lots of pine and citrus hop aromas. Pine and grapefruit pith bitterness on the front of the palate balanced by the strong malt backbone. Full bodied with light carbonation. Finishes bitter and a bit dry. Overall, even though it's a bit maltier than most IPAs, the hop profile will satisfy the heartiest hop head out there! Well crafted and quite tasty. Great job, Surly."
"Hop rich flavor and aroma, sharp crisp hop taste with a hint of grapefruit bitterness, followed by a mellower malt and hop finish. Very nice layering of flavors. Similar experience to Arrogant Bastard. Beautiful deep clear amber/dark brown color, tasted great with chargrilled steak."
"Pours amber in color with some light red hues. There is a slight amout of haziness and a good amount of visible carbonation. Head is fluffy, about one finger, white and retains nicely."
"Poured into an IPA glass from a can dated 1/21/14. Appearance is caramel-amber - fairly dark for the style, with a huge custard-colored head that's starting to leave nice tendrils of lace. Tons and tons of bubbles rising up to the top."
"Over 3,000 reviews, I'll be brief. Served op-tap."
A: dark amber color with moderate amount of lacing around the room
A: Amber hued clear brew topped by a creamy tan head. Excellent lacing and head retention. 
The beer comes in a clear deep ruby red color. It’s pretty deeply 
A- Pours a deep copper/amber with a 1.5 finger khaki head that retains well. Soapy lacing
"Surly's flagship beer pours a beautifully deep reddish gold that screams DRINK ME NOW! at the top of its lungs. Guava, mangoes, peaches are all present in the wonderful nose. Doesn't quite taste as good as it smells but I found that to be the case with a few of Surly's beers. The beer gets much more complex and flavorful as it warms, so try not to drink this one ice cold. Lightly carbonated and refreshing and at 90 IBU's has the perfect amount of bitterness."
"Appearance - Aggressive pour yielded a 3 finger head. Great lacing throughout and a pillow of foam remained the whole time. Deep amber in color, much darker than your standard IPA - must be the Scottish malt. Hazy."
"Reddish color that always thrills. Foam does not persist long. A bit of chill haze also doesn't last. I perhaps didn't linger long enough on the aroma as I don't recall it. Taste was quite nice with a balance of crystal sweetness to stand up to assertive bitterness and complement fruity hop character. The body of the beer is a little heavy and the abc is higher than my sweet spot. Still, this seemed like a great pairing with what would otherwise have been an over spiced peppery jambalaya."
"From a 16 oz can (dated October 17, 2013) into a tulip."
"Appearance - Poured nearly 2 fingers of off white light amber colored foam, the body is a slightly hazed brilliant deep amber, just a gorgeous beer. Lacing is pretty good."
16oz Can &gt; 2XIPA Glass
"Appearance: Pours with a heavy thickness for an IPA with a ruby red color. Above half a finger of head on the pour which was present while drinking. Sticky lacing left behind with each drink. What I really love about this brew is the suspended sediment with this brew, even ultra fresh. Part of the beer and it looks awesome."
A - Nice color and bright head. Extremely well filtered as it is totally transparent with no chill haze.
16oz can poured into an oversized tulip. Canned on 11/21/13
Reviewed from notes after having on 12/20/13. Enjoyed out of a tallboy can with a canning date of 8.13.13 marked on the bottom. Poured into a 50 cL glass stein with a textured exterior.
"A- Pours a very deep golden to full amber in color. Big, frothy, off-white to almost tan head. Retention and lacing are incredible."
"Pour / Appearance: Pours very well carbonated, creating a thick bone white head. It hangs around pretty well. I know this isn't ideal for an IPA in terms of losing some aroma in the head, but it looks damn pretty. The beer itself is a very nice ruby-amber, with a cloudy orange hue when held directly in the light. Great."
Can poured into Spiegelau glass. 
Pours out a darkish orange in color with a small whitish head that seems to have a slight tinge of brown. There's no doubt the nose is piny with some fruity grapefruit/tiny bit or orange with no resin or anything like that. Taste is slightly malty with a little bit of the piny hop flavor to balance things out. Really well balanced. Mouthfeel is fairly thick for the style which is a nice surprise as I haven't really thought critically about this beet for some time. Overall I really understand why this beer is so well respected. It's just a great beer.
"Well whaddya know? Surly has returned to Chicago with cans instead of kegs. Nice to try this for the first time. 16 oz. can purchased at MSCM. 10 oz. into a FFF Rastal on December 6th, 2013."
Furious
"Pours a dark copper with amber and garnet accents capped by a two finger white head. Average retention, gobs of sticky lacing present. Caramel, pineapple, and other mixed citrus notes on the nose. Mango, pineapple, citrus, joined by light caramel and toffee notes midpalate. Finishes with continued light caramel notes and bold citrus rind bitterness. Lighter side of medium bodied, slick mouthfeel. As more of a hoppy amber rather than an IPA, it tends not to be one of my favored styles. However, it certainly is a solid brew regardless."
16 oz. can poured into a tulip glass. Canned date: 02/18/2015. Review date: 03/10/2015.
"A: Dark copper, clear. 1"" head with lacing that is prevalent on the glass as the beer is consumed."
"Canned last week, most likely the freshest beer I've ever had from out of state."
"Poured 16oz can into imperial pint glass, canned 11/11/13 (11 days ago). Left a huge 2inch white head that took it's time to settle down. Color of the beer is quite dark for an IPA--dark amber."
The hop party is in full swing and fully apparent in the first swig of this red.
Can into tulip. Thank you lurpy1
"Poured from a 16oz. can that says ""canned on 9/10/13"" into a Russian River pint glass."
Poured from a 16oz can.
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark red orange with a small fluffy white head. Smells of flowery and citrus hops, very nice aroma. Tastes of citrus hops with a nice afterbite, with a hint of light grain. Beer is heavily carbonated, medium bodied, dangerously sessionable. Overall a superb beer."
"Rusty copper red in color with a heavy chill haze that clarifies as this warms. Poured with a billowy off-white foam that slowly reduced to a thick frothy cap that leaves soapy, sticky lacings on the glass. Slightly pungent citrus grapefruit and pineapple aromas with floral notes over the top and pine hop bitterness beneath. Aromas are undeniably hop forward, however sweet caramel aromas. On the thinner side of medium bodied with a slick oily feel up front until tangy carbonation rolls through the middle. Fresh grapefruit and citrus flavors up front and through the middle that transition to pleasant pine hop bitterness to the finish. Sweet malty backbone throughout. Finishes semi-dry with citrus grapefruit notes followed by light pine hop bitterness."
"Can from trade from an awesome trader. Dates 9-24-13 poured 11-5-13. Should be fresh enough. Pours a deep dark copper red color with a half finger creamy, off white head. Aroma of toffee, biscuits, pine, citrus. Was expecting more hop profile here. Up front big time bitter, grass, pine, big time bready, toffee malts. Dry on the palate, clean finish. Medium carbonation, slightly slick, but mostly dry. This comes off more as an APA than an IPA to me given the big malt presence. Good brew nonetheless."
"Appearance: Poured into a wilibecher. Pours a cloudy brownish-orange with a foamy two-finger head. Interesting color, relatively dark for an American IPA. Decent head retention, very nice lacing."
"A: medium amber with orange hues; slightly hazed; fingers-thick tan head, left some light lace"
Enjoyed on draught in a college improv bar in Minneapolis.
Poured from the can a deep orange-amber color with two fingers of off-white head. Generous lacing left behind.
"Generously provided to me by Todd after his voyage through Minneapolis. Freshness date is printed at the bottom of the can as ""08/02/13,"" so almost two months old at this point. However, it was pretty fantastic fresh, and I'm not anticipating too many problems at this point. Poured into a tulip glass from a 16oz can."
"Big thanks to TBrink for carting a stash of Surly back from Minnesota for us. We crack a can, pouring a brew of fiery golden brown into our Great Lakes pints. It produces a massive three finger head of chunky, cakey medium brown bubbles, showing nice retention. Uniform honeycomb lacing is left around the glass, and it looks beautiful. A chill haze diminishes the initial clarity of the brew, but no sediment is found. Carbonation appears to be highly active. The nose gives heavily soaped and citric hoppiness, toasty brown, caramel, and pale maltiness, sourdough yeastiness, mineral water, gravel, cinnamon chewing gum, coppery metallics, gingerbreadiness, freshly picked pea pods, clovey spice, chalk, and sugary sweet strawberry and apple fruitiness. Our first impression is that the malts are surprisingly forward in how bready they are, but it doesn’t come close to the powerful, juicy, and wonderfully pervasive presence of the hops. As we sip, the flavoring flourishes, with resiny citric and floral hops, lemon juiciness, pale, brown, and lightly caramel maltiness, tannic iced tea, biscuity breadiness, chalk, ale yeast, mustiness, dandelion petal leafiness, lightly roasty char, and tinny metallics. The middle comes out with continued biscuity maltiness and lemon bite, earthy herbals, sweet caramel malts, salt, coppery metallics, soft booze and black pepper spiciness, clover honey, and fruity, nectary hoppiness of citrics. The end has plastic bite poking through the sweet, wheat bready malts, with shiny coppers, darker roasted brown and caramel grain, gravel, musky cheddar cheese, grassy, citric, and piney hops, soured red wine vinegar, white glue, fresh dill, and wood lacquer. The aftertaste breathes of soapy, floral, and herbal hops, booze, planted greenness and twiggy sprigs, fresh parsley, tannic pucker, lemon rind, chalked pale maltiness and raw barley, heavier caramel sweetness, lactic acidity, graphite, and milky sweetness. The body is medium, and the carbonation is on the high side of medium. Each sip has nice slurp and smack, cream and froth, and crisp finishing pop. Glugability is way up there. The mouth is initially coated, but quickly dries into sticky, metallic astringency along the walls of the mouth, tongue, and hard palate. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks easily."
"A - copper amber, white head dies down to a thick film of bubbes w nice lacing"
Big thanks to Petcha for the hook up with this:
Appearance: 
Big thanks to Evan for again throwing me a great beer!
"Pours a slightly hazy copper color with small off-white head that leaves a little lacing. Aroma is full of citrus, pine, and floral hops with just enough caramel malts for a good balance. Taste is bitter at start and finish with a bit of sweetness in the middle. Medium body, average carbonation, and a crisp mouthfeel"
This beer is about a few months old but the flavors seem to have held well in this can. Poured into snifter glass. Very light in amber color with an inch white head after pouring aggressively. Dissipated rather quickly with no remaining head at the surface. 
"Pours a deep clearish amber with two fingers of tan head, nice lacing."
I never give a beer a perfect rating but this beer is as close as it gets. Perfect two finger head when I poured it into my chalice. Perfect lacing. The taste is a great hoppy flavor but not overpowering. A slight piney sweet taste and smell. Anybody who can get their hands on this beer definitely should.
16oz Can
"can thanks to my trading dog in MN. Sat on this one a little too long, so its a little past prime. drinking straight from the can. Nose of citrus like american hops. Flavor is initially bitter, but quickly turns sweet and caramel. finish stays a little sweet, but with some hop astringency - not offensive, drying in a way. Overall, a very good beer when I had it fresh a couple years ago, but after I sat on this can for a few months, it's definitely lost some hops."
"Poured a deep dark copper with a substantial head. Immediate aroma is pine and citrus hop forward notes which fade into bready caramel ones. There is an initial aggressive and harsh bitterness, but the bitterness in the finish is much smoother and soft. The hop flavors come across as quite citrusy, lots of orange juice and tangerine lending a very bright taste. There is a subtle sweet caramel backbone that complements the intensity of the hops, but doesn't temper or balance them much. Not nearly as overly aggressive and in-your-face bitter as I remember it being but sill an extremely great example of its style."
"Can of Surly Furious, poured into a pint glass"
Canned 6/7/13' poured into a tulip
"16oz. bright red can with the Surly symbol of an angry and happy man with a pint of beer dressed silver flames. Directly below the symbol is ""Furious"" in big bold white letters. The back of the can has a good sized paragraph that describes the beer. The bottom of the can has an easy to read canned on date. "
"This beer better be furious! See what I did there? I haven't mad many beers from this brewing company, but two are on our list. The first one we did wasn't very good, but I heard, after sharing our review of that one, that this is the best beer they make. I like hops, and this is a HOP BOMB coming in at 99 IBU. Do you know what IBU stands for? That means international bittering units. This is a measure of how hoppy a beer is. Humans can't taste beyond 100 IBU, but there are beers that go beyond that. Like the Green Flash Palate Wrecker. That beer, this year, was 137 IBU. It. Is. GREAT! "
Thanks to ObiWanKushnobi for this
"A-Pours a reasonably clear hue. Copper body. I think chill haze is the only haze I see. This ale Boasts a short, stocky, compact head. Very clingy lacing."
16 oz canned 06/20/2013
Can from Kjyost. From notes.
Pours a reddish-copper color with a large light tan colored head. Lots of sticky lacing left behind when the head finally dissipates.
A: Dark copper with a fluffy white head.
"poured from a pint can into a Surly ""pint"" glass"
Poured into my trusty Samuel Smiths' Imperial Pint Glass
"Poured into a large Tulip, can dated May 9, 2013. Thanks to FrostyWPG for this one!"
"Received in trade from a friend in Minneapolis and my hopes were high. Furious did not disappoint. A deep, amber/red color, nice off-white head and moderate carbonation all hold up a fresh, fruity scent. The malt back-bone elevates the hops creating a truly satisfying IPA. I'm sold, I just wish I could track it down at my corner store."
"Hands down one of my favorite beers. Red in color... Very aggressive but at the same time very well balanced. A citrus aroma, with some hints of pine and oak. 99 IBUs I believe, but Surly knows how to balance the hops with other flavors. It's an IPA that goes down very smooth."
Canned on 5/21/13 (brought to ATX thanks to AHM)
"Appearance- a half finger of off-white head, this beer had a dark red hue with little carbonation"
16 oz can into a pint glass.
"A - A deep, caramelly brown body with lots of fizz and light foamy head. It was much darker than I expected, but it looks really nice. There's a decent amount of lacing left behind on the glass."
Yet another big thanks to yamar68 for this one.
Excited to try this difficult to find beer while I'm traveling. Can date 5-2-13.
"16 oz can poured into my mason jar, canning date of 5/8/13. I'm excited to be able to try this so fresh!"
"16 oz. can poured into a nonic pint glass. A hard pour brings about a slightly orange cream colored head; very large with mostly small bubbles, really nice lacing to it. Liquid is darker than I would expect for an IPA, sort of a nice hearty amber color. Still very good clarity to it even though it's a little darker than I expected, a really good looking IPA. "
Been wanting to try this for a very long time.
A: Brilliant chrimson red to marroon in color. Hazy apperance but light blurs through. Tan head that recesses fast but clings to the side of the glass for dear life.
Finally getting to try this!!
"I had a Surly Abrasive Ale preceding this one, and this still knocked my socks off - What a beer."
"Can Surly kick it? Yes he can!!!! Raul is almost doggone floored by the near utter perfection of this beautiful beast. The hops, the malt... like J-Lo and Marc Antony's marriage before pre-thang thang. "
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter
Surly Brewing Company - Furious
"My cousin hooked me up with two 16oz cans of this beer on my last visit to the midwest. I already drank one of them and wasn't overly impressed, but I'll now take a go at a full review. I pour this into a standard pint glass."
Poured into a Victory Hop Devil Nonic Pint.
"Huge shoutout to maximum12 for throwing me some of these. He is an amazing trader - absolutely crushed me with extras. Ever since I fell head over heels in love with Abrasive, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this stuff. It pours a brown-tinted copper color, deep and rustic; light ruby hints blanket the edges. The eggshell-colored cap is cloudy and puffy, showing insane retention and leaving some fat, chunky lacing behind. Beautiful beer."
"Poured into a tulip, it has a nice amber hue and a slight white head. Looks very slick in the glass, good lacing."
"Great beer. Wonderful nose, fantastic flavor. I don't worry to much on the mouth feel when it comes to an IPA. But overall one of the better IPA's out there. There is yet to be a Surly beer out there that I think is bad. I don't even really care for Lager and there lager is good. If you see Surly buy it."
12oz pour on draft at Keegan's in downtown Mnpls today 3/30/2013.
Poured into a goblet style glass
"Furious pours a golden cooper color, with a nice lacing white head. There was a floral aroma. The taste was very hoppy for just an IPA, lots of floral notes and a strong bitterness. Very drinkable, and doesn't have the dryness like other IPAS. Overall a very nice strong IPA, very bold flavors."
"Another gift from my friend Ethan! Bottled on 1/2/13, so not eminently fresh but not geriatric either. Poured from a tall boy glass into my 7venth Sun tulip."
Had on tap at Señor Wong in St Paul.
16oz can
"16 oz. can purchased in the greater Washington D.C. area, canned 1/4/13 (check the bottoms!) poured into a 3Fs Teku long-stemmed glass, drank 3/17/13 (definitely not the typical St. Patty's Day offering) over ~one hour."
Poured into a Dogfish Spiegelau glass. Bottom of can says Canned On 12/04/12. Thank you Chazari99 for my first taste of Surly.
"Traded for this, only to find out it was almost 5 months old! Fail. I miss my Heady Toppers. 16 oz can, poured into a Bell's tulip glass."
"A: Deep copper color, decent head which drops to leave traces of a wispy lace on the glass, miniscule particles visible in the beer – 4.0, S: Wonderful nose and quintessentially IPA, quite pungent and with a sizeable grapefruit and slight pine aroma - 5.0, T: Sharp hop bite that is nicely balanced with a dry malt, strong pine - 4.5, M: Slight grainy texture that hangs on the tongue - 4.0, O: The nose is what really standouts for me, a solid beer all around - 4.0"
Served from a can into a Bellhaven pint.
"Pouring a light copper color from the can, the beer had a slight white head in the pint glass. The aroma was surprisingly mild, composed mostly of hops with a measure of citrus. At the forefront of the taste were onion and citrus like hops. There were bitter acidic and citric notes present, crisp to the point of being an attention getter. The highlight for me were the dark sweet malts that lay the backbone. The bitterness continued into the aftertaste, lingering slightly with certain orange notes. The carbonation hovered in the moderate range, allowing the taste to linger just long enough to be noticed without overstaying its welcome. This is not my favorite effort by Surly, but it is solid and quite drinkable."
"Appearance - A dark orange almost amber color, the head at pour is thick and then thins out to above a collar. Lots of lacing left with the glass. A bit murky. "
poured 16oz can into Duvel tulip.
"I first tasted the Furious at The Buffalo Tap in Savage, MN. I asked for something brewed as locally as possible, and the beer-tender handed me a pint of this lovely ale. Classic IPA bold flavors, with a crisp, bitter aftertaste. Some months later, beer buddy suggested it was one to try, when I realized I had indeed tried Furious. Located a retailer online who would ship to CA, and voila! we were getting Furious in Santa Cruz! Go for this one if you like a bold IPA, with a hoppy finish."
I work at a bar which serves furious and needless to say It is my go-to for after work occasions.
Canned 12/26/12.
"a fantastic ipa, which totally took me by surprise. the pour is pretty standard, pale orangey straw color with a finger or two of white foam. the nose is piney hops, sure to be a high alpha bomb, some lightly toasted american barley malt happening as well, but the big oily hops are stealing the show. the flavor confirms a nice hoppy brew, but fairly balanced despite how intense the hops are here. what surprised me more than anything is how soft the mouthfeel is. its really really gentle on the tongue, which is absolutely not what we have come to expect in ipas. the carbonation is relaxed but suitable, and the body is near medium, but somehow there is the feather soft character to it that is a total shocker. really wonderful way to experience hops. in the end i loved my first surly beer, not one of their highest acclaimed brews, but a very impressive introduction. the feel makes it."
Canned 12/17/12 poured into a snifter.

"Thanks to buzze40 for a couple cans of this! Canned November 11, 2012, into a tulip."
Thanks to maximum12 for extra-ing a four pack of this!
"16 oz tallboy can (dated 11/15/2012) pours a medium amber with fluffy white head and great lacing. Aroma is pine, citrus, apricot, and pitchy resin. Taste is citrus, apricot, pine, caramel, and a touch of vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium, sticky resin aftertaste hangs in the back of the mouth to remind the tongue it's time to take another sip. This is the type of hop bomb that I love - intensely resinous, but well balanced."
"Well, this is going to be very hard to write unbiased. Surly Furious, along with Two Hearted Ale, are the two beers that got me into craft. I was just a young, innocent boy in downtown Chicago. I'm 4 years older now, and now fatter and happier because of it. Nostalgia."
"To call a beer perfect is a tall order, but this one is. I am an absolute hop head and this is a gem in my quest for the holy ale! It pours like no other beer I have experienced. While it is the typical orange of other IPA's, it is murky and has particulate matter floating about. It is surly, surely. The smell, to quote a good pal of mine, is GLORIOUS! Citrus-pine-grapefruit will overtake your nostrils and initiate a hop coma that may be summed up in just one word; mmm. Or ""mmm, beer"" if you want to quote a famous father we all know. Oh, the taste... Perfection. I wonder if they just put hops in a blender and then canned it. If you are a floral hopoholic, this is the beer you have been looking for. Imbibe, my brothers and sisters."
Can (10/18/2012) to Troegs Pint glass 
"16 ounce can, canned on 11/21/12. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark amber color with about an inch off-white head that stays around for a long time. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is good, the brew smells like pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, along with some bready and caramel malt. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some floral hops and a bit of tropical fruit. There's also a nice lingering hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and smooth with moderate carbonation. I have to say this is a pretty good brew, it's rated high for a reason. It won't take long for me to finish this 4-pack!"
"Poured into a branded snifter. Pours a nice amber fluffy head which quickly dissipates. Light grapefruit with a little bready malts on the nose. The taste has some nice citrus to it grapefruit, mango, nicely balanced out by the malts. Mouthfeel is very smooth very moderate carbonation. Really like this. Glad to have tried!"
"Pours a dark amber with a very light tan head. The head really fades quickly. Very fresh, inviting pine nose with some grapefruit breaking through. The mouthfeel is better than average for this style. Quite wet throughout despite the hop presence. Very reminiscent of PtE. Mown grass, tons of pine, and some grapefruit comprise the flavors. Very good."
A-red amber color with a nice off-white head and great lacing
You had this beer. 
"16oz can. Pours a clear deepish amber to red with a massively rocky head, massive lacing of God. Piney, citrus, sappy, perfumey hops, toffee, dirty, iron rich earth. Taste is not too bitter- lots of nice Scotch malt, fairly sweet and creamy with piney, herbal hops. Excellent palate. These cans don’t last for more than a few seconds because the beer is so damn good."
Thanks to Mista for sending some of these my way.
Canned 09/19/12. From notes about 3 weeks later. Props to France44 for having this so fresh. Tulip glass.
"Thanks again, Steasy66!!"
16 oz. Can to Snifter.
"Thanks to Rutager, again."
16oz can sent to me by Will. Thanks!
Poured from a 16oz can into a standard pint glass. Thanks Tom for sending it.
"Review #2500: This beer poured out much darker than I expected. It has a deep orange color, almost red. The head was a light tan color and decent sized. The smell of the beer is malty and sweet. There is a pleasent floral hop aroma. The taste of the beer is nicely balanced, there is a sweet malt flavor that has a moderate hop finish. The mouthfeel is clean and a little oily. The carbonation is crisp and sharp. Overall this beer is really good, looking forward to drinking the others I have."
Canned on 9/17/12.
Split a can with Hophead717. Thanks for letting me finally try this.
Can thanks to yamar68. A long time want! Poured into an HF tulip.
This has long been my go-to beer. Can't believe I am only just reviewing it.
Poured from 16 oz can into Cheers drinking mug. Served chilled...
A: Pours a dark reddish coppery color. Teetering on almost a brown color. Not a lot of head but leaves a thin lacey ring around the edge of the beer. 
One of my go to beers.
16 oz can dated 8-14-12 into a beer goblet.
"An impressive looking beer, even the can. Pours a rich crystal clear amber with hints of orange. A tall dense head sits on top with sticky lacing on the glass, lots of lacing. Though dense the head is it does fade quickly to a collar."
"Another from the much appreciated six-pack sent to me from my sister's boyfriend, this one certainly earns its praise as a top American IPA. It pours with a deep reddish-amber color and is topped by a big, rocky, sticky head. The beer is very fragrant, with a big contribution from citrusy hops on top of a light, bready malt base. The flavor is big and bold, with juicy, resinous citrus and spicy pine over some noticeable but nondescript malty sweetness. The texture is mouth-filling without being heavy. Overall, this is just an all-around very good IPA."
"Pours a clear, dark-amber colour. Smells malty, citrus hops, grapefruit rind, and pine resin. Tastes crisp, bitter, grapefruit pith, citrus, light caramel malts, and a pine-resin bitter aftertaste."
Serving type: 16-ounce can. The “CANNED ON” date on the bottom of the can is “08/03/12.”
"Amber-orange colour, one finger of off white head, decent amount of lace. Smell is loaded with hops, citrus and pine, orange, grapefruit, a bit of sweet bready malt comes out the second time around as well. Taste is initially a mix of caramel and toffee malt flavours with pine and citrusy hops, lightly sweet, orange, tangerine and grapefruit nice bitterness throughout, long hoppy finish and aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, med-full body, oily, good overall feel. Just a straight up awesome IPA, no doubt this would be something I kept on hand all the time if it was local."
"16 oz can, canned on 08/27/12, poured into a tulip glass."
Appearance: This beer pours a clear amber color with a clean peach head. Head retention is great with a light lacing on the glass.
Side by side with Furious on-tap at a Surly tapping at Churchkey in DC. Centennial hops lend their leafy selves to the beer inside the cask.
A: The beer is clear dark amber in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a half finger high beige head that only died down a little and consistently left a thin head covering the surface.
"Okay. I've learned to appreciate this one more. I'm not falling for the cult (not drinking this kool-aid?), but it's better on the third or fourth time around. The first time I tried this, the extreme bitterness made me gag and trade it off to my friend for his Summit Pale Ale (a beer I still find preferable to Furious, by the way). But after a few more tries, I ""get"" it, I guess. The hoppiness is harsh, and it isn't balanced with any malt or softer fruits, but that's the point. It will never be my first choice, and I much prefer Bender or Abrasive, but this isn't as ""meh"" as I used to think it to be."
A- poured into a glass copper hue completly clear with a peach colored creamy head of foam ! 
Thanks to JLindros for sharing this.
Already had a can of this and wow was it awesome and worth a proper review. Poured into a classic pint.
Medium white to off white head dies to a thin lacing above a copper colored beer with tons of small particles suspended within.
A: Pours a crystal clear dark copper to amber in color with some light amounts of visible carbonation. The beer has a finger tall pillowy dark beige head that reduces to a mottled patch of thin and thick film covering the majority of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.
Back-logged circa 12/29/2011
"Surprising beer coming from a can! light aroma, a nice amber color with generous effervescence, a bit cloudy though, with some sediments at the bottom, which is unusual for a beer in a can! "
Poured from a pint can into a pint glass.
Poured from can into Russian River tulip
"The smell is definitely a strong one, even for style....resiny, full of juicy citrus and grapefruit just bursting out of this one. Wow."
Poured from can into Duvel Tulip
16oz can poured into a pint glass
"A big shout out to cpolking for sending this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a pretty amberish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by citrus. Taste is hops, citrus, some bitterness, a bit of malts, tasty and flavorful. Feels medium bodied and bitter in the mouth and overall is a beer worth seeking out."
Canned on 6.11.12
"Orange copper color with a pale yellow bubbly head. Burst of fresh hops, pine and citrus zest in the pungent, earthy aroma. Rich, bittersweet hop uproar in the first sip. Creamy and sweet molasses, citrus rinds and roasted nuts in the body. Hoppy, crisp; with almost a minty sense to the mouthfeel. Succulent medium sized body with a balanced carbonation. Pleasantly hoppy, refreshing finish with a sticky mouthfeel. I continue to be impressed by craft canned beer, a great example."
A - A finger of off-white head of larger bubbles. Body is very cloudy and a nice orange/brown color. Great lacing.
"I wasn't even expecting this beer, but the ever gracious BA Steimie offered it up for a trade and I gladly excepted."
I enjoyed Furious with a shaker pint.
Big thanks to Mista for the extra! 
"A. Caramel color and hazy, with a good amount of sediment and few big bubbles (extremely small bubbles). Big head and tons of lacing."
This beer makes an appearance in my fridge at least once a week. I chose to review a can that has about four weeks on it because that's realistically about the average batch you'll find at most metro liquor stores on any given day. 
finally taking the chance to review this amazing IPA from Surly. I love this brewery
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. Super fresh (canned two days earlier)...
A - Just from the look of it I could tell this beer was going to be a dank hop experience. A dark amber brown with a 1/2 inch of the bubbly stuff and tons of micro floats in the glass.
Beer poured from can into a Nonic shaped pint glass
Poured from tall boy dated may 7 into Sammy smiths tulip.
"No idea when this was canned, looks like the date stamper was down on this particular day. 16 oz tall boy into a tulip glass. As soon as I cracked the top I could smell tropical fruits!"
"A: Amber orange with 2 finger head, with lots of spotty lacing. Beautiful looking beer, imo."
A: A medium amber color with a thick white head 
"This beer definitely lets you know you're drinking it. All the elements stand out, yet they still get along with each other. This is a hoppy beer with notes of citrus that is good with a meal or all night imbibing. It's got a great finish with high drink-ability. This is a beer lover's beer."
"A - Amber body, 2 finger white head "
Thanks to cyclone8 for this one! Poured from 16 oz can into pint glass.
"A gift 16oz can from a friend at Tommy's Pizza in Gettysburg, PA. "
16oz can into a tulip glass
"My man Kiddwhiz hooked this up! Poured from can to a pint glass the beer arrives a hazy amber color with a good 2"" white head, good retention and lacing, looks the part! The aroma is a nice blend of citrus/tropical fruit with the hops, though the earthy pine is strong, too. A hint of crystal malt. The flavor is a rush of fruit: mango, lemons, grapefruit together with the earthy pine hop character found in the nose. Medium bitter. Light caramel malt base provides a nice sweetness. Tastes great. Finishes with a lingering hop bitterness and residual sweetness together with the pine hop. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a good brew!"
Poured from a 16 oz. can into a tulip pint glass.
Poured from a 16oz. can into a Duvel tulip. 
"Pours a murky burnt Orange color with a nice dense off-white head. Outstanding head retention, which leads to good lacing. Sweet citrus aromas with a hint of spruce. Hops control the palate with bitter citrus flavors with some evergreen tones. The sweet malts balance out the bitterness perfectly. Mild carbonation with a smooth and clean backbone. Very complex palate for an IPA. Nice and crisp with a dry finish. Very nice drinking IPA. Surly Is making amazing beer....and in cans no less!"
"the amirillo stands out in this beer, taste little of edleberry, citrus, and lots of hops, hard to get this beer in new england, so will take a trip to find this one again, one of my top beers to have in my fridge (next to the heady toppers). WOW and it comes from a can too."
"A: Murky reddish orange, very carbonated. Light tan head that leaves strong lacing behind."
Got this one in a trade from a great midwestern BA'er. Many thanks! 
"I had this beer in a bar and given my scores compared to everyone elses, I must have had something else?....but I double checked and the waitress insured me it was Furious."
Canned 3/7/12
A very generous friend agreed to bring a 4 pack of this back from his family's summer vacation trip. I've had it before but thought I'd formally review it. 
You had this beer. 
"A: Poured burnt orange, almost an orangish brown with one finger of thick head that fell away but stuck to the glass."
Pours rusty red with a head of waxy foam. Two fingers at most with very good retention that settles to a thick cap leaving a bit less lacing than I would've liked.
Poured from can into tulip. Can date of 1/19/12.
A: A deep orangeish-red pour with a good sized and fluffy light tan head. Retention is quite good and there is a pretty formidable amount of lacing on the glass.
a deep amber/brown with a nice amount of head. looks like a thick pour.
Thanks Mark!
"Canned a month ago, so fairly fresh. Pours a dark, amber, mahogany brown color with a medium, off-white head. Scent is huge, with an immense amount of hops and a nice bouquet of fresh flowers. Some spicy rye aromas with a nice little malt profile. More hops...lovely smelling beer...smells very fresh. Taste is just as fresh. Initially, bitter, hop resin flavors with a bit of potpourri. Some piney notes, with a great amount of fresh, bitter grapefruit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and bitter finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a world class IPA. Great stuff here."
"served on-tap at Churchkey in DC for the Surly takeover. pretty pumped to get this w/out having to trade or travel! poured into becher, review from notes:"
16oz can into tulip. canned on 11.3.11
"A big and powerful IPA, I actually preferred this one to Abrasive, as I found it a little more drinkable and it punched me in the face just a little bit less. But I love it! Both beers are must tries for the true hophead, as they are completely unapologetic in their bitter assault. This one poured nearly clear, dark gold, with a huge fluffy off-white head, great retention, and tons of sticky lace all over the glass. Super hoppy aroma is very piney and floral, and the taste follows the nose closely, combining bitter pine resins, floral notes, and grapefruit with a strong onion and garlic flavor underneath it all. Very little sweetness or maltiness, it’s just hidden below things propping up the hops ever-so-slightly. "
16oz can canned on 12.29.11
"Dark copper pour with a thick off white head and a ton of lacing. Nice aroma of citrus and pine. First drink shows the bitterness with lots of pine and citrus. Wow, this is a very drinkable,and well balanced IPA. Small bit of breadiness to off-set the hops."
"I had the blessed pleasure of repeated on-tap servings of Surly's Furious IPA over the last two years. Naturally I had many varieties of craft IPA's in between. I had a building score list of IPA's and each time I had another opportunity to tip back a Furious - I had to shake my head and exclaim, ""DAM!"". There are some really great IPA's out there but I've found no one who can balance it like Surly in their Furious offering. A gorgeous dark swatch down from amber and a sharp scent of heavenly evergreen that belies the balance you about to taste. This beer surprises you everytime by returning you HOME - it is as like the TARE on a beer scale. Some beers can take you high on various notes but Surly Furious is the new standard by which all other beers must measure themselves. I dropped the score on 'mouthfeel' to 4.5 only because I feel the need to leave room for another beer to challenge the perfection of Surly's Furious. Of possible, only a creamy mouthfeel could perfect Furious."
A: Reddish copper color with a 1/2 finger sandy head and some spotty lacing down the glass. 
"Thanks to Tim and Blair for these two. Poured from the can into a Delirium snifter. Canned on 12/15/11, drinking 2/16/12."
Huge thanks to LaCoursiere for another great Surly brew.
"Had this many times, reviewing a tap pour from Sawatdee at lunch with spicy papaya salad."
Look: Copper in color with a 1/4 inch white head and no retention
Big thanks to cradke for this one!
"A 16 ounce can born on 12/28/2011 and drank today, just over a month out. Sent by inlimbo77; thank you! Poured into a DFH signature glass."
"fresh can via trade with samtallica, bottled on 1/11/12"
Thanks to DarthKostrizer for sharing...
Canned 1/11 and drank on 1/31
"Poured from a 16oz can into a new belgium globe. Pours a deep dark muddy brown/orange with a couple fingers of slightly off-white, fluffy head. The aroma has some pine and grapefruit notes. The taste has a nice balance of pine, orange, grapefruit, and malts. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and refreshing, with a good amount of carbonation, and a very smooth and crisp taste."
thanks to darthkostrizer for opening it at a bottle share.
Stoked to try this through a recent trade.
from 16oz can:
"Received as an extra from fourisbetter. Love the Surly, thanks!"
Appearance: Very dark for an IPA. Crimson and amber. Pours a great head with some streaming carbonation from the bottom.
Surly Furious is a delicious American IPA. Fragrant and hoppy with a malty base to balance. One of the best American IPAs I've ever had.
"Poured from a tall can into a tumbler. Canned date 1-4-12, bought from my local bottle shop, what in CA? Yes. Thanks Jazz!"
A – Deep maple amber. Incredible lace and nice retention on a foamy khaki head.
"Thanks to Chris for this, canned 12/27/11."
Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for the cans

A 17 day-old pint can poured into my DFH Signature Glass. I now know the DFH Signature Glass holds exactly 16 ounces.
Looks like Ive started back on my quest for the Beers of Fame (#62/100)! Thanks Heatwave33! Canned on 11/28/11
"Third can of Furious I've had and finally impressed with one. Canned 12/5/11...a bit more than a month, not bad."
"After being totally blown away by Abrasive Ale, perhaps my expectations were a bit high for this beer. Nice amber color with good balance of hops to malt. Hops leaning a bit toward pine notes, but I found myself wanting a bit more hops bite. My overall impression is that this beer was more in the American Amber vein. Good, and at 6.2% not exactly a session, but something you can have a couple of quite pleasantly."
"I'm drinking pine needles! That was my first impression. Half-way through my glass I couldn't feel my mouth anymore. This was the first real extreme bitter, hoppy beer I had and I will never forget it. The aroma reminded me the that Sobe Adrenaline energy drink that was made years ago. I'll be avoiding this one in the future, but hop-heads wanting a balanced face-melter will enjoy this one."
A - medium copper color with 2+ fingers of head
"Poured entire pint can into an oversized tulip glass. Right away, the aroma of piney hops arose from the glass. This is about what I expected, as this can was less than three weeks old. The look is darker than most IPAs; a ruby red hue. The taste followed the aroma here: very hop forward, with a nice bitter finish. The hops are a blend of piney/citrusy flavors. The hops are balanced with a malt backbone that almost tastes a bit like rye. Because of this, I might compare this beer to Founders Red's Rye or Two Brothers Cane & Ebel, but a bit more hop forward. Quite enjoyable!"
"Red glow to the beer. Smells of pine needles and grapefruit. A friend who tried it for the first time told me ""it smells like Christmas."" "
16oz can bottled on 11/4/11. Poured into a snifter. 
A special thanks goes out to my cousin from Minnesota for bringing me a 4-pack of this while I was visiting my family in Michigan. It totally made my Christmas. 
from my brother via bobbypaulson.
Finally got my hands on a Surly; Furious gets my v-card. It begins by pouring a faintly murky amber hue. The head is good as well as retention. 
"Loved this one. Not sure if I liked it more than Abrasive. I would have to drink lots more:] to be sure. I love these canned beers!! This one had fantastic citrus with grapefuit, and some pinyness. Awesome hops! I only with I could get this on the regular with some abrasive. Nice job surly."
"I've been looking to try the Surly beers for quite some time it seems that this beer has had the cult following from day one. Yet, I've never even attempted to trade for it until recently. I love to see an IPA in can form, there's just not enough of them out there. I heard Two Hearted and Torpedo are coming soon, but I've yet to see them in my beer stores. The simple description on the can really gives you what your in for. Definitely a crimson colored IPA with a light khaki beige head forming even thin lacing between sips. Aroma has some citrus and pine hops but there's a nice caramel malt base with Scottish malt adding just an air of rustic smokiness to the mix. Flavor has a beautiful blend of caramel with pine spiced hops and hints of citrus peel. A really mellow IPA even though it's called Furious, it should just be called Delicious. Definitely hop bitterness coming through but throw me a West Coast style or a midwest style West Coast IPA anyday. For example I've been drinking more White Rajah than I care to admit. I fantastic example of the midwest West Coast IPA, or Fathead's Headhunter IPA both beers I would love to have regularly. Masala Mama from Town Hall is actually the most amazing Minnesota beer I've ever had. Mouthfeel was resinous with a strong lasting hop bitterness, balanced on the palate I didn't feel overwhelmed by the big dose of hops. Overall I would be super proud of this beer if I were from Minnesota but compared to the rest of the country it's on par and defintely ot superior with a West Coast IPA. But I want more at the same time, that's the catch with this beer it makes you want to drink another one. Thanks to Ryan aka Schlais for the trade."
A – Deep maple amber. Incredible lace and nice retention on a foamy khaki head.
Tasted July 27th 2011 (from notes)
"How the hell have I never reviewed Furious??? The flagship brew of the flagship Minnesota brewery??? If there was a Minnesota State Craft Brew, it would be furious. Must remediate."
No date on the can but I imagine this one is fairly fresh. 
"Pours a dark copper with a two-finger, long lasting cream colored head. Really dark pour for an IPA. Great aroma. Really big tropical notes. Pineapple, mango, peach and fresh pine as well. Very hoppy brew and so delicious. More of a citrus vibe in the flavor profile than in the nose. Good amount of tangerine, some grapefruit and nice bitter pine and floral notes as well. I did get a hint of sweet tropical fruits near the finish. A decent caramel/toffee malt gives the beer some balance. Overall, a big, well crafted, extremely hoppy IPA with the taste of a DIPA. Awesome drinkability and a great, diverse hop profile."
"Served on-draught into a pilsner glass in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Reviewed from notes. Expectations were moderate. I can't recall the price. "
A: Nice golden orange. 1 finger white head. Minimal lacing.
One of the first IPA's I had. Thought it was time to review after having so many times.
atypical rich dark red amber color. nice pillowy head. most of it dissipates quickly but nice layer on top.
"Pours a pretty deep amber with 2 fingers of sticky head that recede to a clumpy layer on the top of the beer. It is a bit darker than what I am used to for an IPA but still looks good. The smell is strongly IPA, lots of pine and some grapefruit peel, definitely some malt sweetness after the initial hop rush. Taste is more of the same, tons of hops, strong clean bitterness with a good malt backbone. Mouthfeel is good. Overall, I feel like this is a slightly more malty IPA which leads to an increased drinkability. I don't feel my palate fatigued, nor my mouth dryed out as can happen with some really dry IPAs. Definitely worth seeking out."
Thanks to Tballz420 for trading this one to me.
16oz can poured into an imperial pint glass; canning date of 11/4/11 stamped on the bottom of the can
Served in a Great Lakes Christmas Ale snifter. 
Served in a pint glass.
Presentation: HUGE thanks to tmcelvain for sending a 4pk of this! 16oz bright red can; bottled 11-28-11...can you say FRESH? Poured into my Flatbranch imperial nonic. 
"This beer pours with about two inches of dense white head. It is a dark ruby red to brown color with some nice lacing. Very nice looking beer. The aroma is pretty piney, with some clean bitterness and citrus. Flavors are more on the citrus side, very clean, very nice, mild caramel sweet maltiness balancing the hops nicely. Mouthfeel is where I would want it to be. I generally like my IPAs a bit drier, but this is very nice. Medium carbonation as well. Very nice beer."
The thing that sets Furious apart from other IPA's for me is the smell you get upon opening the can. 
A big shout out and thanks to Stu who I got this can from in a trade!
"A: Poured a medium, dark copper color from the can, with about a quarter inch of light beige foam which dropped within 2 minutes into the beer, leaving a thin layer of sea foam covering the beer. "

A: Pours a burnt caramel color. Slight reddish orange around the edges and fairly clear. Huge frothy thick tan colored head leaving beautiful lacing behind.
thanks surlytwinsfan for all the surly cans! poured into my hill farmstead pint glass.
"review from notes on a can that atlsaint sent in a trade. thanks again! pours a nice clear copper color with a finger of off white head that quickly settles into a ring. nose is big on pine, followed up with citrus and malt. taste is pretty much the same. goes from pine to citrus to pine with a nice malt balance to bring it together. mouthfeel is a medium body with good carbonation and a sticky oily pine feel with a long dry bitter finish. overall i'm glad i got to try this but it's not one of my favorite ipa's. dont think i'll set up a trad for more but i wont turn it down either."
Can poured into a pint glass
"Canned 15SEP11 A: Rusty orange with a finger of tan foam which falls quickly to a partial sheet of the same. Excellent clarity. Spotty lace. (4) S: Resin, grapefruit, sage touches over a slightly sweet malt backbone accentuated with honey notes and the faintest copper fumes. Really nice nose here (4.5) T: Earthy hops up front, a hint of catty dissonance between the sweeter malts and resiny oils. Doesn’t taste as good as it smells, but it is a mighty fine beer. Getting some bubblegum later as it warms. (4) M: Prickly up front with the body to tame it. Really a great feeling beer with a good oily residue on the finish. (4.5) O: Really a great beer. It’s a month out, and some would call that ""stale"", but this beer is still lively and quite well constructed. I would imagine some more of the nuances from the hops would be better enumerated in a fresher can, but alas I am not in the distro for this beer. (4.5)"
"Solid American IPA nose. Bright fruity citrus and pine. Hops do the heavy lifting. Good execution, Surly. "
"A: Bronze, dark brown color when poured into a glass. A nice one inch foamy head. An ideal IPA consistency could be seen right from the pour."
huge thanks to mizzouguy for this can! recieved in the Noob BIF round 6.
Can split with my friend who imported this from MN. Thanks!
Pours a beautiful caramel orange with a finger and a half of tan foam that sticks to the glass even as it fades.
"Can not ever go wrong with this one, have had it in can and on tap at pubs and even the brewery and it is always one thing... AMAZING!"
"I am usually not a fan of IPAs in general, but I had to finally try Furious just to support our local rock star brewers at Surly."

i just had to chime in with the obligatory A+.
"Poured into a Stone Imperial glass. A pretty dark but clear burnt orange color. Carbonation bubbles are few and far between but the few that are there lead to a great two finger head, that is cream ale in color and rocky or frothy in appearance. "

Pint car.
Poured from 16 oz can into standard shaker pint glass.
A deep copper-colored beer with a persistent head and nice lacing. Intense hops aroma. Huge depth of flavor balanced by toasted malts. Long finish. 
Still sipping my way through the Beers of Fame. Got this one and Three Floyds Gumballhead and Alpha King from Woodchopper ( a great trader!!!). 
"This beer is pretty like a woman. It's a little on the dark side for a pasty white boy like me--it's nearly opaque and looks much stronger than its 6.2% single-IPA status would suggest. The big, frothy head sure is inviting. "
"Pours a deep copper color. Really great smell on it. Hits lots of floral notes. Can definitely smell the hops coming out. The taste is not nearly are hoppy as I expect. More of an earthy, easy drinking ipa. Lots of earthy, dirty, grittiness to it. Can said 99 IBU so the bitterness must be hidden behind the body. A good solid beer, not as great as advertised."

On Tap at the Muddy Pig in St Paul
poured from a can into a pint glass...
Big thanks to thewimperoo for sending me a couple of these as extras in a trade....much appreciated!
"Pours a beautiful clear copper. Big extremely persistent head. Great lacing. Huge hop aroma. Herbal- like standing in the herb garden herbal. Piney. Awesome. Like the smell of fresh hops- really evocative of homebrewing taking a big smell of the hops before adding them to the wort. This is an IPA with a big malt backbone. Toffee and caramel balance out all the fresh hops. Piney and herbal. Somehow it all combines very well. A little citrus and bitter grapefruit. Great hop flavor. Pleasant lingering bitterness in the finish but overall relatively low bitterness. Well carbonated, medium bodied- actually maybe a bit light bodied relative to other IPAs. Makes it a little more sessionable though. Overall- really awesome. A really unique and great IPA. I've brewed a clone brew of this (I've also done a couple batches of Bender) so I'm obviously something of a Surly fan even though I get this rarely. Just getting around to reviewing it now. I really want reasonably priced cases of this (and other Surly) in Western PA!"
Furious is a great beer. You can really smell the I.B.U's in this beer and has a smell like it is fresh of the boil kettle. I love I.P.A's and Furious has one of the best taste I have had. This beer has a great finish and whether from a can or the tap tastes great!
"Ap- pours a deep copper amber color, not quite clear but almost. A nice 1 inch head slowly fades down to just some surface head. "
"A: dark amber, copper orange, a bit hazy, big head recedes to about 1/2 an inch, decent amount of lacing....a bit different for an ipa"
poured from a pint can into stella glass. 
"Some fluffy offwhite head with some lace, golden amber hazy body."
"I am a big fan of the pale ale category of beer. IPAs and APAs both are a favorite of mine. Because of that, I rate this beer fairly high but it lacked some of the punch of my favorite pale ales so I cannot put it quite at the top of my list."
"16-ounce can picked up at 6-and-Save, the first time I've ever seen Surly beers. Ever. Needless to say, this is my first exposure to both this beer and this brewery."
IN Minneapolis for the first time and visited Bret's Pub...and tried three pints of Surly Furious. The beer pours a nice rich copper with vist white head that laced throughout the drink. The smell was a very nice fresh hop with subtle notes of pine and citrus. The taste was very bitter from the hops and lingered on the pallet. those that enjoy hops and bitterness caused by hops this is the beer for you. I must admit that three pints made for a rough morning.
Poured from a 16 oz. can into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.

16oz can into Duvel tulip. Thanks to BA shufon for including this as an extra in a recent trade; really glad to finally try this beer outside of a palate-confusing festival context.
A: pours a nice fall color with a white head nice lacing
"Time to pull out an awesome extra from tripelhops: Surly Furious! This is the most exciting can of beer I’ve ever cracked. Thanks again, Brian!"
Can (2011)
"canned 8/18/11, tasted 10 days later."
16oz can into an Odell's tulip.
"I love the idea of pint-size craft cans, and surprisingly it seems like the perfect way to present this beer. The label (or Surly's style in general) isn't my favorite, but luckily it's the inside that counts!"
Received this beer via trade with TIMMYJ21. Thanks Tim!
"Poured from a 16oz can . As soon as the can is opened the sweet smell jumps out and grabs you by the neck. The beer pours a nice 2 finger light amber colored head with adequate lacing, which highlights it’s cooper amber body. The smell is dominated with fresh hop aroma of pine, citrus and unmistakable grapefruit with only a slight hint of malt making it’s way through."
poured from a 16oz tallboy into a tulip; damn tough flower it is...and big...
Serving type : 16 ounce can Canned on 8/5/11
"Another can of Surly deliciousness sent to me by Derek, thanks again! 16 ounce can poured into a wide-mouth snifter style glass. Considering I was a huge fan of Abrasive I can't wait to see how they do a single IPA."
Can courtesy of chewy08rx in a recent trade. Thanks for the brews man! 
"Found this beer across the border in MN. Love it in a can therefore this IPA does not oxidize and ruin it's taste. Beautiful smell and flavor, crystal malt sweetness balanced by a wonderful bitterness and hop aroma. Would buy again if I could find in WI."
16oz can poured into a snifter. Canned 6/7/11. Big thanks to 67couple for this one. First Surly beer.
Obtained this in a BIF from surlytwinsfan.
Can shared by Paul – thanks!
Special delivery from one of my client's daughters who lives in Minneapolis - brought me 3 four-packs of Surly - quite the sampler pack!
"Poured from a tap into a pint at King’s Wine Bar in Minneapolis, Minn. Color was a mix of copper and orange. Missed the head, but the lacing was high and consistent throughout the beer. "
Thanks to whoever brought this one to our IPA day party.
"A- Poured into a pint glass. A real nice coppery red color with a two-fingered head that dissipates into a film over the top of the beer. Mostly clear, nothing stunning but beautiful in a very simple way. It's modest, you could say. Some floaties suspended throughout."
"Poured from can into pint glass a deep copper color with a one finger fizzy head that fell relatively fast leaving lines of lacing around the edges. Aroma is very fruity and tangy with mango, orange, lemony bits coming through - not getting a whole lot of malt. The flavor follows the nose appropriately staying super sweet with a minor bitter bite at the end, piny and oily - I had this beer super fresh awhile ago and recall it being even sweeter but it is still solid nonetheless. The mouthfeel is really jumping out at me - bitter around the edges of my tongue with a slight stickiness at the back - a bit above average. Overall this is a highly drinkable beer for me and I'm glad I stocked up before the trip home - very tasty I could drink a 4 pack in one sitting and be very happy."
An IPA on IPA Day 2011. Thank you to whomever provided this pretty fresh can.
"I was happy to have the chance to try this at a recent IPA day event, poured from the chilled can into a tulip."
Can date 6/16/11 consumed 8/3/11
Pours a copper/caramel color with some nice frothy white head leaving lacing down the glass.
poured from a can into a indian wells pint glass. The body has a nice caramel copper tone and is covered with a creamy white head.
"A: This is a darker IPA, looks more like a red ale. Probably one of the prettiest beers I've had recently with deep copper and amber hues. Modest, slightly creamy, head dissipates (disappointingly) quickly with moderate lacing. Still gave beer a 4.5 cause it was so damn pretty."
"A- Darker than many IPAs, it's almost on appearance an amber/red ale, but not quite. Head is about two fingers thick, disappates down to a ring. There's some lacing, but not quite enough for me to round up the half point."
Ahhh... Surly Furious: We meet again (insert evil laugh)!
16oz can poured into Victory snifter. 4/14/11 canning date.
"Clear copper colour with a big, fluffy off-white head. Great head retention."
"Thanks to Robtobfest for this can! 16oz can, bottom stamped ""Canned on 6/14/11."""
Thanks to mashmaster for a few cans of this - how lucky for me that you happened to be in MN! I poured this can - dated 7/1/11 - into a tulip. 
"A: Burnt copper / orange. Cloudy, signs of carbonation slowly build, off white head. "
"can from france44.come, purchased for a beer dinner. this is a leftover can."
A- Pours a deep orange with some haze to it. The white head is creamy and settles to a thin covering while leaving astounding facing.
A Pours a dark orange with a reddish tint. Nice healthy 2 finger head. Decent lacing. Lots of floaties.
"At first didn't really enjoy the taste, but half way through the can i can really say this is a top beer. The taste comes off doesnt come friendly, as a very strong citrus presence, a lot of grapefruit. nice toffe/red color. Smell isnt overpowering."
"A- Poured from the can with 1 finger of offwhite foam, which slowly receded to a haze layer and some bits of lacing. The body was a hazy orange-amber color, which produced some sparse bubble trains up the sides of my tumbler."
"Appearance: Nice solid copper with a bright-white head that leaves some decent lacing on the sides of the glass. The beer is nice and clear, without having that too clean look."
Thanks to TIMMYJ21 for this in a trade.
"16oz canned June 9, 2011. Served at around 45F. Big thanks to Ryan for this one!"
"16oz can that was filled on 7/6/11. Seriously, 11 days old? Awesome, thanks again for the generous extra care of eagles22. Poured into a standard pint glass at 50 degrees. This brew appears a lightly hazed amber copper color with a finger and a half of yellowish stained fluff. The only thing keeping this brew from being perfectly clear is some faint particulate stuck floating throughout suspension. Big bubbles compose the head that is slow to recede. As the cap fades, thick patches of lace cling to the glass in a complete wall. A light swirl revives the cap back to a half finger that holds throughout the duration."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter glass.

Thanks to Chambic for hooking Cavery and me up with this in a recent trade! Poured into a stone nonic. 
Well a venture into my second experience with the Surly Brews:
A- Dark reddish amber with two inches of foam. Good retention for a nice thick head. Lacing is ridiculous.

1 pint can poured into a seidel stein.
"Fantastic IPA, "
First had: on tap at ? 
A- Pours a nice brown color with minimal head.
"Poured this American IPA out of a can into a pint glass. This AIPA poured a amber, orange color. It produced a decent head, that was slightly tan. Head retention was excellent. Lacing was average. The aroma was nice, very hoppy, notes of citrus and pine come leaping out. The taste of this brew starts with a jolt of piney hops. There is a nice base of malt, very sweet, overall pretty well balanced. This AIPA starts with hops and has a nice dry hoppy finish. Overall , i would say this is above average for the style but I am not sure that it lives up to the hype. I was thinking it would be very close to Piney the Elder but its not even in the same class."
"can dated 6-21-11, poured on 6-29-11. Pretty freakin fresh! "
"A-Cloudy amber orange, with one finger head. Some lacing is left behind."
"Pours a suprisingly copper orange color, huge plume of off-white froth, good retention and lacing. The scent is hop forward, strong citrus notes with splashes of pine. First thing to strike me about the scent was the amount of carmel and nutty malts, buttery and toffee like. Taste was quite unique, big harsh and bitter notes from the hops and a big malt presence - nutty and buttery toffee. In the back, one can find notes of lighter citrus and watery fruit. Fuller side of medium bodied, smooth and creamy, lightly dry with bitter aftertaste. Quite a uniqe beer due to the malt profile."
Presentation: Tall can poured into a Sam Adams Perfect pint glass. Served slightly chilled.
Poured from a 16oz can into a clear glass mug. Canned on 06/02/11 stamped on the bottom of the can. From a superb beer haul courtesy of my brother Greg.
"Canned 060911. Pours a clearish, dark red with a nice tan head. Smell is really fantastic. Orange, spicy pine and caramel malt, balanced together. The taste is spicy pine and a touch of orange hops, slightly biscuit, bigger caramel malts. I think it's really good, but I could see how it seems a bit rough around the edges - this is certainly different that a lot of the other really good IPAs. The mouth is aggressively carbonated with a medium body and a touch of malt sweetness hanging on the tongue. Overall, this is a really, really awesome IPA. Much better than masala mama in my opinion in the battle for MN, and the best IPA I've had that doesnt fear big malt flavor."
A: Copper from head to toe.

Poured into a pint glass from the 16 oz can.
A- DARK amber
"I had can that was nearly 3 months old, so I'm reviewing that with my memory of when I has some much fresher tastes."
"Special thanks to Capra12 for hooking me up with a can of this beer. Was way better thank I expected, especially considering it was in a can!!!"
A- hazy brown body with a small off-white head
"Tastes are red-meaty hops, tin, plastic wraps, pills, banana skins, tomatoes, sunflowers, table scraps lemon zest, amber syrup, dextrose, silica, boozy goodness and lemon merigue. Smells are hops, malt, soft water, sugar, spice, beans, rubber, and maltose."
"This beer pours a yellowy orangish color with a pretty descent and sticky white head. the smell is very citrusy with some pine notes as well, a very well balanced hop profile. the flavor is pretty similar with citrus just beating out pine for the dominant hop characters, along with just enough malt backbone so its not just a total hop bomb. the mouthfeel is crisp dry and well carbed. overall this is a very solid brew"
A: A dark bronze - brown color w/ a dirty looking 1 finger layer of foam floatin' on top...
a-Very dark color for an IPA. leaves slight lacing
"A - healthy looking deep orange-amber with a two finger off white head. The head retention is on the low side, but there's definitely a little hanging around, lacing is minimal."
"Got this as an extra in a trade with stevef03, thank you! Color looks like the inside of a plum. Theres floaties like crazy! Very strong peach smell on the nose, some grapefruit, orange, and hops. Upon tasting, once again, peach is very dominant, followed by other citrus notes, however this was not near as hoppy as I would have expected from an IPA. More smooth than bitter. Very creamy mouthfeel for an IPA, I like it! . I thought this was a very nice IPA that I could drink all the time."
"A: deep clay orange/slight amber body, finger head, good lacing"
"Canned on 4/26/2011, courtesy DearthVader"
"A- Poured a light amber color, nice lacing. A bit darker than your typical IPA,but appealing nonetheless"
Nice extra from trade with Mid - Cheers Bro!
"3/29/11 date, drunk on 6/5/11 so about 2 months old. Poured the full can into a big Duvel tulip. The beer was a rich amber color, with a frothy two fingers of billowing fluffy cream colored foam. The head stuck around for awhile, clinging to the side of the glass tightly as it receded."
"Aromas begin with fruity bliss; grapefruit, orange, and pineapple hops a plenty. As it warms you get a little of the caramel/sweet maltiness but the hops are definitely dominating this brew."
"Well Surly, we meet again! :) 16oz can poured into a regular old pint glass (near perfect fit!). Canned on date of 4/14/11."
Got a few cans of this from a trade with TheDudeRules. Thanks Mike. Drank back in March.

"Poured into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint. Copper colored pour with a 2-finger, foamy, off-white head. Lush, fresh, floral and citrusy hop aroma with hints of pine and mint with an earthy, caramel malt background. The flavor is a nice balance of big big, bitter piny hops, herbs, fresh cut grass, lemon, and orange peel rounded out with chewy, earthy biscuit and caramel. Medium, dry body with a healthy amount of lively carbonation."
Thanks to skybluewaters for allowing me to try this beer. 
A - Pours a clear copper red color with a big finger of frothy off-white head. The head fades slowly down to a thick ring around the glass leaving behind some nice lacing.
16oz can i got in a trade with mnbears fan at dark lord day. thanks matt! drank from my samuel adams perfect pint glass. its been a long time since i reviewed this on tap. 
a: brown hue with reddish tinge to it. Nice tan/red head on a mild pour producing half inch-inch high head. Sticky beads of bubbling ont he glass but not a firm head.
Shout out to DoctorRock for hooking me up with this and tons of other Surly brews.
Pours a deep amber color with one finger of sticky off white head. Head recedes slowly and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. You can see tiny bubbles dancing up when you hold the beer up to the light.
"I've received this many times from biglobo8971 and every time I get it I am grateful. This beer has turned into one of my favorites, and now I am finally sitting down to review it."
16 oz can poured into snifter.
Canned on 05/03/11.
"Poured into my ccb pint glass, reddish brown, half a finger head, hazy. Aroma of hops with malt in background. Taste follows the nose hops with little malt, no balance. Citrus from the hops is good just not great. Highly carbonated. It's good just not great, after having abrasive(excellent) it's hard to tell they are both from the same brewery."
A: Beautiful dark amber with a frothy off-white head. Great lacing on the glass 
"Oh, my darling..I'd like to thank the kind soul who brought these back into my life. What could be better after a long long work day?"
The beer is a beautiful deep amber with a pillowy beige head. Wispy lacing on the glass as the beer is enjoyed.

A - Very dark murky amber hue with a slightly off-white color head. Head is quite foamy and solid looking. Nice looking bubble stream from the bottom though the middle. Spotty lacing.
"Caramel malty, complex hoppy dIPA/Red hybrid."
On Tap at Stub and Herbs in Minneapolis
"This is an excellent beer. I have really become attached to it. I received two 4 packs in a recent trade and only have 1 can left. It's deliciously hoppy but not too piney. Color is wonderful, taste even better. I would say that I like it it much better than Abrasive as it is much smoother to my palate. "
Poker winnings from baconsausage. Thanks bud. 
From a can to my Darkness snifter.
A - It pours an inch of off-white head into a pint glass. It has a very nice retention and leaves some decent lacing. The beer is clear and has a medium amber hue with visible carbonation.
"A - deep red, clear, frothy light tan head"

"Thanks to Spdkilz for this! Been wanting to try it forever. Poured from a pint can into my N'ice Chouffe goblet. About a finger of off white foamy head and a light brownish amber body. Head dies fairly quickly leaving a good looking scuzz on the top with pretty nice lacing. Lots of pine and spicy floral hop scents on the nose. Mellow floral flavors lead into a pine and woodsy flavors. Finishes very dry. Good creamy, little bubbles on the mouth. A Great IPA. Wish I could drink this stuff whenever I wanted."

Aromatic lightweight bitter beer.
"Waited a long time to try some Surly. Finally grabbed some Furious and Bender on a work trip through MN. I wasn't even sure what style they were promoting here as the can doesn't really specify. It does fit the genre with a nice hop bitterness. It is unusually smooth, with a good aftertaste, smell and coloring/carbonation. Get this!"
Got this in a trade From HipHop1 -Thanks Hollie
"Received in a trade with syrupjoe, thanks for the opportunity to try this beer! Dated 1/12/2011."

Poured this can into a Central Waters snifter.
Random can given to me by a friend of a friend who recently made a trip to Minnesota. I've been eagerly awaiting trying something by Surly - which we aren't likely to get in Ontario soon - so this should be a treat.
Poured into a snifter. Thanks to TheDudeRules for this extra!
"A: Pours a shimmering coppery red and orange color with a 1/2"" off white head that slowly fades leaving a thin layer across the surface. Partial clarity. I wasn't expecting much lacing, but wow it's definitely there and is distributed evenly around the glass. One of the nicest curtains of lace I've seen in awhile."
Awesome all-around highly hopped ale. This is a standard for those who like lots of hops. Great hop aroma and taste. Spicy and floral. Pine that bites. Easy to drink. I recommend getting this one if you are in the state. Similar to Bell's Hop Slam and lower than SN Celebration.
Been wanting to try this for a while. Canned 2/15/11.

"An extra from a trade. Can poured into a tulip glass. Beer is a mostly clear dark amber color, with a very slight haze. Initial finger of off white foamy and bubbly head with lots of large bubbles dissipated quickly to the surface. Lots of lacing left on the edge of the glass that sticks a long time, and a lot of large bubbles on the surface of the beer. "
"Thanks to several traders for sending this beer my way. I've had Furious on numerous occasions and just now have a Duvel glass full of one to review. I can't remember everyone who sent one of these to me, so I'll just jump to the review. "

Canned on 1/19/11. Big thanks to HapWifeHapLife for the Surly hook-up.
Review from 2/6/11
"I like Furious a lot and to me the Tea Bagged Furious seemed watered down or less flavorful, or dare I say, even tasted kind of flat. I did, however, enjoy it at the time I had it. After two Pentagrams and a Brown-Eye I needed something less flavorful. It did go down a little more smooth than the normal bite of the Furious. But boy do I love that bite."
Live review of a 16 oz can (canned 01/07/11) courtesy of arvjunk.
Written from notes...reviewed summer of 2010
Canning Date 2/10/2011 so only 7 days old!
"A little prefacing is in order. Number 1. I love this brewery, its got a great character about it and its smoking hot in the twin cities - just check the 3 month waiting list for tours of a small suburban warehouse!? Number 2. I hate drinking cans! I don't trust that this can is better than that can jargon. Leave that to Coors, please. I like bigger beers, but hopefully Surly will get enough footing to enter a glass world (swing tops are not too much to ask are they?). Number 3. I love a beer and breweries that push the boundaries, this is one of those beers. "
"Pretty excited for this one. I received it randomly from someone who grabbed some while home for Christmas. It pours very dark for an IPA. It's amber in color, very clear, and has a one finger off white soapy head. The aromas consist of pine, citrus, and honey. It's very easy on the nose. The flavors consist of pine, citrus, honey, light malt, and light alcohol. It has excellent balance for an IPA. It has an almost perfect mouthfeel. It drinks so smoothly from the can it's nuts. This is a very, very good IPA and definitely worthy of the ranking. I may have to search this out in the future."
Yet another thanks to thecaptain073 for including this in a recent trade.
Finally reviewing this great American IPA
"Canned 11-1-10, chilled and poured into a nonic class."
"Can extra'd by Jim. Pours a dark orange nearing red with a fluffy head. First try of a Surly beer for me, I believe. Nose is big pine resin, some citrus, sweeter tropical fruits. Hops are fresh and incorporated well. A fair bit of caramel melt in the mouth, and a full, bitter hop bite that carries through deep into the finish. Sweeter in the nose than in the mouth, if that makes sense. Without major flaw, though not terribly exciting. Quality stuff but not an elite IIPA in my opinion."
Poured a brwon/rose with slightly off white head and great lacing the whole way down.
Thanks to THECPJ for the share. Review from notes 1/15/11.

Furious
Had during an amazing ipa tasting. This got me started
"Pours a crisp clear amber with reddish tints. Plenty of off-whit frothy head with gorgeous lacing. Smells hoppy before i even finish pouring. Mostly pine but some citrus peaking through. Smells quite potent. Tastes... Bitter and hoppy. Lots of pine, lots of grapefruit. The taste is not quite as good as the smell but very solid. The beer sits nicely on the tongue. Not too thick, not too thin. The carbonation is perfect making it oval quite drinkable"
Thanks to korguy123 for this one. 
"I've had Furious in just about every possible way, but this is based on my experiences having tank Furious at Darkness Day 2010."
"Poured from a 16oz can into a dimple glass. Pours a deep reddish copper hue and gives off an average creamy beige head that mostly diminished. Fair display of lacework. Clear flat looking body with an amber color. Aroma was very floral with notes of amongst other things pine, citrus, grapefruit, flowery. Also light notes of toasted malt, caramel, orange peel. Medium bodied with an extremely dry texture and a soft carbonation. Heavy bitter hoppy notes with only light sweet malty notes. Heavy dry, bitter and long lasting finish. Glad to have my hands on this from Surly!"
A - Dark amber pour. Half inch head maintains itself with ample carbonation.

thanks a ton to speedwayjim for tossing this my way at the end of a tasting!!!
"Consumed on 1/3/11 Bottom of can says ""Canned on 10/26/10."" It's two months old, but I may be getting some new Furious in an upcoming trade. If the difference is significant, I'll do a new review."
Poured from a can into a pint glass with a two finger head...
"A great beer I sadly can't get a hold of in NY. Poured into a pint, the pour produces a lovely dense half finger eggshell white creamy head that sits atop a nice deep amber red beer. Smells fresh, aromatic zesty citrus and pine meet the nose. The presence of warrior hops is clear. The taste is again zesty up front with citrus flavors, crisp bitterness follows with a base of great malts up holding the hops. This beer finishes with more hops, but this time piney resinous ones and a round malt flavor. Good mouthfeel for an ipa, a little prickly and well carbed. I could plug a few of these for sure."
This beer leaves some nice lacing behind and is a burnt orange amber color. The powerful hop smell almost knocks you off your feet. Great tropical notes and quite smooth and easy to drink. Carbonation is appropirate. This is probably my favorite IPA right now.
1 pint can poured into a pint glass
Poured from a 16 oz. can into tulip glass and reviewed on paper 12/28/10. Transcribed into BA 12/29/10.
"Note on 01-10-12: I'm updating my scores on this one. While it is still one of my favorites, I've come back to earth a bit after having dozens on these since my initial review. Mostly, I think I need to knock down the aroma as it is really fantastic if you can get it within a week or two in the can, but it fades rather quickly after that. Considering most people are going to be drinking this with at least two weeks since canning, it is more accurate to knock it down in the aroma department."
"Pours a deep red orange with a thick foamy yellowish white head and tons of lacing. Smells of grapefruit and a little orange and some piney hops. Tastes of grapefruit, orange, and tons of bitter hops and plenty of malts to balance it out with caramel flavor. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is quite present. Drinkability is high."
Big Thanx to Alleykatking for hooking me up with this one.
"Wooow! Surly Furious lives up to the hype. As soon as I crack the can, I smell the fresh aroma from extremely successful dry-hopping. The can must really hold the hoppy goodness better than a bottle, because I can't remember having many better bottle commercial IPA. The beer is a dark crimson highlighted amber that is deceivingly dark. The smell is of herbaceous hops with fresh cut pine boughs, orange peel, and baking bread. I just can't overemphasize how fresh and vibrant the aroma is. The beer is appropriately dry with very firm bitterness and a nice little bit of caramel (but not sweet) maltiness. The carbonation was perfect and the hop tannins added a good bit of body. Beautiful beer to have a whole pint of."
This can was sent to me by Zimmerbloke. Canned on 11/01/10
"I really enjoyed this beer, got it in the Secret Santa BIF...thanks Leigh!"

Beer from a can meant for a glass!
My second Surly! Big thanks to chewy08rx.
"Surly is one of those breweries I wish was out here so I could drink Furious and Abrasive all the time. Pours a golden orange with a sizeable white bubbly head. The nose is one of those that you can get about a foot away from the glass, exactly how I like it. Loaded with c-hops. Taste exceeds expectations. Giant pine and white grapefruit first, followed by a movement of pineapple and caramel notes, and finishing pretty dry with some bitterness on the sides of the mouth. Wow! Feel is wonderful, and the drinkability is good, I'd want more than one but your buds would be ruined after more. Excellent IPA, worthy of the hype. Maybe the best IPA I've had that was not brewed out west."
Poured from 16oz can into a pint glass
a - poured a two-fingers thick creamy tan head into a tulip glass that left great lacing and thick sheeting throughout. the body was a bright and dark amber color. if there is a better looking AIPA then i haven't seen it.
"Got this in a trade earlier this week, thanks Joe!"
Poured from a 16 oz. can into a pint glass.
"Copper colored with a massive sticky off-white head. Lot's of lace sticks to the sides of the glass. Smells like a citrus fruit bowl and buttermilk biscuits. It's different, but I like it. Huge abrasive hops abuse the taste buds. Lot's of citrus and piney flavors with hints of caramel. Full mouthfeel with sharp hoppiness. Easy drinker for the hopheads. Probably not the best IPA I've ever had but it's a very good one."
Reviewed on 20 November 2010. Much thanks to Lenny1203 for this beer.
"Appearance- Pours a clear light amber with a two finger creamy head. Good retention, great lace."
Poured from a 1 pint can dated 10/26/2010 into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Big thanks to surlytwinsfan for giving me this in a trade!
This was the first time I have had this beer so I only had word of mouth on what to expect.
On tap at Acadia Cafe
It's good. Not great. Not sure about some of the hype. My opinion.
"Medium copper, orange and slight yellow converge to create my favorite shade of IPA. Hop haze is killer. There is a big 2 finger fluffy, creamy, light beige head that leaves loads of tight-knit spiderwebs down the glass."
Appearance- Beautiful caramel color that is what I expect whenever I try an IPA.
"Pint can as an extra from forgetfu, had before but not reviewed. Thanks man, been wanting to try it again!"
Thanks goes out to Bamadog for hooking me up with this months ago for a tasting
"A: Poured into my pint glass, this brew pour dark for an IPA of this caliper. Rustic orange with a large white-capped head. The head is firm and refuses to dissipate past 1in thickness."
A: Dark orange brown color with a big head excellent retention and leave your glass covered in white lacing. 
Poured into tulip. Very dark copper with a thick off white head. Could almost pass for an amber. Amazing lacing. Very sexy!
Thanks to paulv for pint can! Haven't had this one in a long time.
"Poured into a bulbous pint glass, revealing rich amber brown body with a tall thick and active pale brown head. Nice lacing. Smells like hops of the floral, meaty sweet variety with a good and vanilla/caramel-centered malt backbone. Very promising smells."
"Thanks to Doug for bringing this can, always nice to have Surly stuff!"
Pours a clear amber color with about a finger of light tan head. The head is slow to dissipate and leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass.
A- Pours a dark amber color.
Reviewed from blinded tasting notes.
"Big thanks to Lunch for sending me this one as an extra in our third trade! Served from can into a Stone nonic. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine hops, and a nice refreshing secondary hop kick upon swallowing. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this IPA was quite excellent. It had a very crisp and refreshing aspect to it. Very glad I got the opportunity to give this one a try. Nice job Surly!"
Can into Surly Glass. What else. or HH Pint around the cities.
"A: A clear muted amber with an active but unsettled head, quickly fading in to what looks to be spit?"
Can dated 10-05-2010. Poured into a pint glass
Recieved from biglobo8971 for winning the Sunday Night Football Squares LIF week 4.
"16oz can, goblet, canned on 10/7/10. "
color is fiery orange red. huge rocky cumulonimbus head the color of nougat.
I had this on tap at the Mad Capper in Stillwater for the first time. It is in my top 5 of all-time favorite beers. This beer like Summit EPA make me very proud to live in the Twin Cities. My biggest complaint is that you cannot buy this beer in kegs for the kegerator yet!
"The color is a clear, deep amber color. The head is fast rising, lasting, and leaves nice lacing. "
Tried this on tap on a recent visit to the twin cities. 
"My new favorite IPA...Pours out a deep orange red with a huge orange head on it. Aroma is awesome with piney hops rushing in your face, evergreen, and a slight caramel sweetness for balance. Taste is thick with hops, resiny, piney, and dank. The whole beer has an overall bitterness that just smacks you in the mouth and leaves you with a peppery and earthy aftertaste once the hops onslaught is over with. Once again, caramel and toffee notes are here to provide a touch of sweetness and save the day with some balance. Really good stuff, the best beer I've ever had out of a can. Good job Surly."
"Can and draft. This is probably one of my best beers to have out in the cites when I can't find anytihng else that I want. Pours a really nice orange amber color with a nice white head. Excellent aroma of both citrus rind and slight pine notes in the nose along with some sweet malt backbone. Medium mouthfeel and a bit chewy. Sweet malt flavors up fornt wuickly give way to vibrant hops taste. Citrus rind, grapefruit, and pine all in one. Really well balanced. Just an excellent flagship beer."
16 oz can thanks to squirpy7.
"Poured a pretty copper color with a half inch head. Not spectacular, but solid."
This beer was a gift from a friend of mine. I was very impressed.
Poured into my My Marshall's Wharf pint glass. The 2nd beer from my trade with mothman (A man that knows his beer!) 
"Surly Furious is a very clear copper ale with a dense khaki head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a huge, fresh hop aroma with pine and grapefruit bust bursting out. It smells juicy and fruity. It's pretty full bodied and super smooth. The hops leave the tongue a touch singed. Oh, this is nice and bitter and hoppy. There's a nice full hop flavor here. It's along the lines of Nugget Nectar or Hop Stoopid, but less sweet and more piney. It's perfectly balanced. After almost 800 beer ratings, this is the best rating yet. This IPA is perfect in almost every way. The can keeps it fresh. I wish I could buy this in Upstate New York!"
"Thanks to the Kegatron for sending me a can! I've had this beer a few other times at tastings, but never more than a few ounces."
"Appearance: Ruddy dark brown with a fantastic hop flecked haze to it. Massive crusty head, thick bubbly surface reminds me of what is seen in open fermenters during Brewery tours. Dense deep creamy head starts about 2""+ thick but slowly slides down into the brew as it snap, crackle and pops its way into leaving some thick ribs and smattered lacing. Finely dissolved intense rasping carbonation, but it's all under control. Excellent looks and superb head longevity throughout. Shame to keep this one hidden in a can."
"Poured from the CAN into my Duvel tulip. Ha, never thought I'd type that sentence. Not sure if this is from my trade with chixdighops or the extra I got from Romulux. Either way, thanks!"
Poured into an imperial pint glass. Pours an amber color with a two finger head that thins into lacing. No haze here.
"Andrew hooked me up with this one. Thanks! Poured into a pint glass. Has a nice thin head that reduces itself into nice lacing. The body is a deep clean amber color. The aroma is full of hops. The hops are juicy and citrus smelling a nice bitter aroma the complements a faint caramel malt background. The taste is piney hops with a bit of tropical fruit flavor. This is very crisp and dominated by hops with a subtle malt profile. Very well balanced. The mouthfeel is light and easy to drink. This is something I sincerely wish I could get locally, I'd buy it all the time."
Big Thanks to drhinehart for this one.
Poured from a can into a wide goblet.
can poured into pint glass
Aroma:Tons of fresh smelling hops in the nose. The hops smell mildly like grapefruit.
"Beautiful beer. A fark amber tilting to red. Perfectly formed, dense, eggshell head fills out my Duvel glass nicely. A very slight haze to it. She's a looker!"
"Had it on tap at the Twin Cities Grill over at the Mall of America. It's a beautiful beer - red/brown with a nice head of tightly packed small off-white bubbles. Smells great, lots of flowery notes that dominate. The taste is outstanding, I'm not a huge hophead and I love this beer. The bitterness is in here but they have done a wonderful job ballancing it out. Some beers overwhelm you with the hops leaving you with that dry bitterness on the back of your tongue. The beer seemed more tea-like in the hop flavor that was more round in flavor. I'm no expert on how they did it but there is enough other stuff going on that it's bitter but not offputting for someone like me who's not looking to be blown away by bitterness. Feels very slick in the mouth, a bit of an oily edge that goes down smooth. Overall, this is my favorite IPA - this is what I plan on drinking whenever I need a break from my normal Belgian Darks and Stouts. Just a great beer overall and I'm lucky that I can find it everywhere around town. I get to see how they brew this on Sept 24th. Woot!"
Poured into a snifter on 9/3/10
"I've just come back to Earth after a week-long non-stop beer tasting ""vacation"" with my IPA-obsessed bro-in-law Bernie (AKA ""BDB"" - Bernie the Drinking Bear) visiting from California. My other over-the-top-hophead bro-in-law Scotty Joe also joined the fray. We sampled every American pale ale, IPA and double IPA we could find in the St. Paul MN area plus eight fantastic IPA's Bernie flew in from L.A. "

extra in a trade with kbutler1... thanks!
"Poured into my dimpled thick-walled old school Coors chalice a brilliantly clear rusty amber color with a creamy, dense settled 1/2"" light beige head. A moderate amount of visible uprising carbonation. Perfectly unbroken, unhindered, unobstructed walls of graceful lace all the way down."
Thanks to Marie for introducing me to craft beer in a can.
"16 oz can courtesy of CaptainRedBeard, thanks man! Pour is lightly hazed and a surprisingly dark caramel color. Fine-bubbled, light tan foam shows some decent retention and nice lacing."
"On tap @ Hell's Kitchen (Minneapolis, MN) on 8/11/10. Served in a pint glass. "
A - Pours a lighter Reddish Brown with about a finger of head. Head disappears quickly but leaves alight film with some sticky lacing.
Thanks to Brentk56 for this in a trade. 
Into a standard pint. Thanks go out to biniek13 for sending me a four pack.
"First of all, a huge thanks for this great extra from ShadesOfGray. Cheers! [edit] Had this a second time the other day from a new batch and I enjoyed it even more."
"16oz can into a perfect pint glass. Courtesy of Pullen (thanks, John!)."

A: Served in a 16 oz. pint glass. Dark amber color with a thick head.
Pours an attractive amber-red with a bubbly white and short lived head.
"Received this in a recent trade with airohead2001, thanks a ton! I had the chance to try Abrasive about a month ago and have been really excited to try Furious ever since. Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter."
"Poured from a 16oz. can into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Pours a dark copper color with a nice symphony of carbonation bubbles that produce a big white soapy head and leaves nice lacing on my glass. Starts off with an intense hop aroma with pine resin, a nice array of citrus and tropical fruits, some floral scents mixed in with some nice aromatic caramel malts. Taste starts off with some nice mango, tropical fruit, and pine hop flavors then finishes with a nice strong but not overpowering caramel/toffee backbone. This is a meduim bodied IPA that is very well balanced and feels really nice on the palate, the hops let you know they're there but doesn't overpower it. This has been my favorite all around brew since I first tried it after a Vikings game last year. I always try to keep this one stocked in my fridge even through I sometimes have to drive two hours to replenish it. I just can't get enough of this stuff. This is my perfect 5 beer."
"Appearance: Light amber makes up the base, while traces of copper can be found in the areas with more light density."
Furious poured into a new belgium globe glass.
"I was pretty excited to get a can of this stuff as part of a trade with rudge75 over at Half Pints. It's pretty hard to acquire good American brews in Canada if you're not actively trading with Americans or making frequent trips yourself. Thanks a ton, Dave. "

16 oz. can into Sam Adams Perfect Pint.
16 oz. can poured into a snifter. Another outstanding IPA from Surly - one of my favorite breweries for sure. Living proof that wonderful IPAs can be born in the Midwest!!
"This came as an extra from iasanlee, thanks for the chance. Surly Furious pours out of the can a nice ruby color, with about a half inch of heading. Nose is of bready, garlic like hops, along with some citrus and pine notes. Full on hop assault from the start taste wise, though the Scottish malt does help to even things out a bit. Mouthfeel is medium, crisp and drinkable given that you are into lots of hops. Simply a well crafted IPA from a great craft brewery. Cheers"
Can received in a trade with BarrytheBear. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.
A- Pours a dark red/copper color with a nice 1-2 finger head leaving thick clumps of lacing on my glass. One of the darkest IPA's I have had.
"Surly Furious pours a clear copper, with a head that dissipates slowly and retains a layer on top, marking the glass all the way down. Strong citrusy hops dominates the smell. Upon hitting the tongue, an intense, multi-layered hops explosion grabs your attention, but it's balanced by a very strong malt that makes this beer taste even better as it warms a little. Most beers this bitter feel like they're stripping the enamel from your teeth, but the balance from the malt makes the mouthfeel and drinkability of this beer excellent (and perhaps unsurpassed) for an IPA. "
Pint glass at restaurant in MN. 
"Appearance -- Pours a deep copper, great clarity, with stiff, frothy khaki head"
"Very clear and clean copper color. Big hop/floral aroma. Huge blast of hops upfront. Very grassy tasting. Quite astringent. Strong hop flavor. Nice balance between the bitterness and hop flavors. Some distinct toasted malt notes in the finish. Nice fading sweetness. Solid body-long lingering hop bite, rather dry as the sweetness fades. Definately worth a try-damn good US IPA."
"A - Pours a deep reddish amber color with a nice off white head that very slowly dies down and leaves a nice coating across the top of the glass. If there's any carbonation in this, it's very difficult to detect."
"A- Redish Amber, thicker head but it dies down to a thin layer that sticks to the sides pretty well"
"16oz can, courtesy of Levifunk, into a Duvel tulip."
Thanks to Schmittymack for the extra! Poured into my cigar city snifter.
"Wow, first time having this in a can, and so vastly superior to having it in a cask. Big orange pour, big white head. A big ass hop aroma blasts ya. Grapefruit and pine aroma is only overshadowed by its immense presence on the palate."
"Poured from can into a Harpoon IPA glass. Beer was a dark orange color, with a three finger, off-white head. Soft, slow carbonation and tons of thick lacing around the glass."
"A: Orange-amber head, fairly short retention, medium carbonation."
Poured from can into chilled mug. 
16oz. can poured into an imperial pint. Huge thanks to beerwolf77 for this one!
Thanks to Exiled for sharing this beer that has been on my wants for a long time.
Big thanks to younger35 for hooking me up with this at DLD!
Served in a tulip glass from a can. Furious is a bronze color drink with streaks of auburn when held up to the light. Thin head holds to a skim coating over the top.
"Extra in a trade. Not an IPA guy, but away we go..."
Thanks to phreak1983 for this in our recent trade. Poured into 10oz glass. Poured an attractive orangey-amber color with less than a half-inch of light tan head that had moderate retention and lacing.
"Tasted on draft at Goose Island Clybourn. Pours a clear amber orange with a laced white head. There is a very hoppy grapefruit aroma with a little bit of malt. The flavors are super hoppy grapefruit peel and juniper. The body and carbonation are medium, and the finish is long and bitter."
"Pours from the 16 ounce can a nice fairly clear orange color, with a pretty decent one finger head. Good hoppy aromas, somewhat herbal, grassy and melony. Nice flavors in this one, a good hoppiness with a nice malt backbone. A very nice IPA. One of the better canned beers I've had."
Traded to me from some generous folks (yandlecats) at DLD.
Appearance: A clear orange-brown body capped by over two fingers of fluffy off-white head that fades slowly and leaves brilliant lacing.
"Thanks (x5) for the Surly extras, tytoanderso, you are awesome!"
On tap at Jake Melnick's in dowtown Chicago. I'm pretty sure this was just the normal Furious and not the tea-bagged version.

Poured from 16 oz. can into an imperial pint glass.
Poured from a 16oz can into my Allagash tall snifter. Pours a redish color with an immediate creamy tan head that rises to about a finger's height when poured carefully. Head lasts for a few minutes and remains as a nice creamy rim with great sticky covered lacing.
"December-ish canning, Febuary-ish consumption."

"Sent to me by Hayesz. Thanks, Erik!"
"Received from kbutler1 in a recent trade. I've had Furious several times, but have never reviewed it. Split with my former graduate assistant during a return visit to his alma mater. Split between two pint glasses."
Thank you thank you thank you to Roburg for stocking his apartment with a four pack of Furious before I came to visit! This is a rare live review. Poured from the can into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass (my first experience with the perfect pint).
Split a 16oz can with Zapps after a fluke tennis game. A big thanks to Thorpe429 for including this one as an extra! Very cool trader. My first surly product... can't wait. 
Poured with a small light tan head (bartender proly wanted to give a full pour) and good lace. Color was a clear coppery medium amber. REALLY hoppy earthy aroma with a hint of citrus. Flavors about the same but much bigger. Good malt to hop balance. Hoppy yet easy finish. Could be session.
Reviewed from notes 3/18/10
Served from a 16 oz can. Big thanks to gibby for this one!
Poured from the can into a Sam Adams sensory glass.
"Appearance - Poured into a pilsner glass from a 16oz metal can. Nice markings on the can to include ""99 IBUs"". Should be interesting. Popping the can doesn't release any noteworthy carbonation sounds. The pout produces a mild one finger head. The resolution is nice, with good lacing on the sides of the glass (left enough headroom on the pour). Color is a clear orange-amber with ample carbonation feeding the remaining head. "
Thanks alot to Supercolter for this one!!!
"16 ounce can poured into a Unibroue tulip. Total props to Kbutler1 for sticking this can into his luggage and flying it across the country for me. Popped top. Never smelled such a beautiful smell coming out of any can in my life. Pillow like off-white head rests on an amber body for a good while. Aroma is grassy and piney with hints of sweet malts. Taste is biting, in a good way, a hopgasm in the mouth. 99 ibu's per the can seems like a ton for a single IPA but its damn good, bottom line."
"16oz can, came in a (wonderful) box today via a trade with BA'er brian23456...poured this in a Samuel Smith pint glass"
"A: Pours a dark orange/red-ish with a big foamy head. Great head retention. Clear, not cloudy in the least part. Tons of thick big bubbly lacing."
"This is a big assed American IPA, blows away the other guys, other than Two Hearted. Big heavy body, loads of hops with citrus, grassy, bitter, a load there. The malt is solid, has a dark look but clear, outstanding bitter finish telling you to have more. This is a quintessential IPA that should be shipped out of MN damn it!! Had to go there to get it. It drinks bigger than a 6.2% ABV, lots of flavor for the hit. Everything else pales, maybe the west coasters would disagree, but this it the bomb."
"Appearance: pours a crystal clear red-brown, sort of a combination of amber and mahogany tones, with beautiful ruby highlights. A couple fingers of frothy snow white head, which lasts for a few minutes but then looks like the remnants of a bubble bath, with vastly more foam around the edge of the glass, tapering off into the middle. There's a ton of tiny to medium sized streams of consistent carbonation bubbles, which you can see as they move through the beer. Nice and sticky foamy webs of lacing."
"A - Great amber color with a nice foamy head, nice retention. Medium dissipation rate, beautiful lacing and sticking on the sides throughout the experience."
16oz. can poured into my FFF's imperial pint glass...
"Big ups to phaleslu for this extra. Completely caught off guard with this beer. Personally the can thing is getting redundant, but this was actually a solid beer that I would love to come back too, sorry fat tire but you ruined me on cans, but you also ruined a lot of things for me. Big citrusy hops, well balanced and I can drink these at a Raiders game without the worry of getting hurt when the parking lot gets rowdy and this comes my way in the air. Big fan, now I need to get some more."
"16 ounce can poured into a pint glass. This is a dark amber/caramel color with a solid inch of head. Smells of sweet pine sap and citrus, especially lemon. Very fresh and herbal."
I am biased. I love this beer so much that it is the beer by which I measure all others. The aroma is a delightful bitter floral grapefruit. Color is beautiful reddish brown. Taste is a fantastic bitter grapefruit that lingers for minutes. Full boddied rich IPA. Just awesome. The guys at Surly know what they're doing and this beer just proves it.
Appearance:
"Have had this beer Multiple times in a can, once on tap-"

Pours a clear copper color with nice head retention and sticky lacing.
A: Orange color with a thick head that leaves very sticky lacing.
from BDLbrewster. Thanks!
"Got this in a trade. Thanks Kevin! Poured from the can into a pint glass. Pours a beautiful red/ dark amber color. Leaves a finger of off white foam that dissipates quickly. Nice lacing, and a thin ring around the outside of the glass remain. This is a very good looking beer. Aroma of hops is evident from the git-go, big, piney, and citrusy. Very nice. Taste starts out with citrus, moves quickly to pine, and then plunges into hoppy bitterness. Tastes great! Finish is dry and big time bitter. Bitterness hangs around after I drink. This is a very good IPA. Mouthfeel is right with good carbonation, oily pine, and plenty of bittering hops. Drinkability is great. The enticing aroma bids me to drink deeply, and the hefty dose of bitterness makes me want another as soon as this one is done. Reccommended! Wish we could get this in SoCal!"

I've had this brew many times but never got around to reviewing it (and by many I probably mean like 3-4 times). As I was clearing out the notes on my phone I found this one from Darkness Day '09. Dry hopped with Simcoe. Drank from a fancy smancy plastic cup.
"A - Poured a clear amber-red color with a foamy off white head. The head receded to a thin cap after a few minutes, but left a heavy veil of sticky lacing down the inside of the glass."
16 oz can compliments of brian23456
"Such a delicious beer! I've had it numerous times, but never got around to reviewing it until now. Poured from the can into my pint glass. "
"Pours a ruddy brown color with a dense off-white head, very sticky, lots of lacing. The smell is a big hit of pine, citrus peel, raw minerals, a little savory note at the end. The taste is brutal on the hops: pine, mostly, with some grapefruit peel, some faint sweet malts down in there. Not in the least bit balanced, but enjoyable anyway. It's moderately carbonated, thick and sticky. Too much of a hop bomb to drink much of -- last night I split a can with two friends, and I think that little bit was the perfect amount."
A - This beer poured a beautiful light bronze orange color that produced a fluffy white head that had a great amount of retention and left a beautiful lacing effect around the side of the glass
This was brought to me in time for the holidays along with some Bell's Two-Hearted by a friend from Minnesota. I had one last night out of the can but now it's time to sit down for a proper review. It really is quite a unique and delicious IPA. 
Poured into a pint glass. Big thanks to jkblodge for this extra.
"Thanks to my buddy Jeff for picking up a 4 pack of this on his latest road trip which happened to be to Minnesota. Anytime he hits the road, I give him a list and he has yet to fail me. Review is from notes taken on 12/18/2009 and poured from the can to a pint glass."
16 oz can poured into a tulip.
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a nice beige head that leaves a lot of sticky lacing. Aroma features extremely strong pine and citrus (grapefruit) notes with earthy and caramel notes beneath it. Taste is almost a disappointment after the power that the aroma suggests. Not that its bad, just the aroma is so appealing. Taste begins with hop bitterness and finishes with a smooth caramel maltiness that balances it without taking away from the hops. Seems to have a smooth and creamy mouthfeel that makes it quite drinkable."
Served from a 16oz.can acquired in a trade from stig (Thanks man!) into my 20oz. Stone nonic pint at the appropriate temperature. 
Thanks to BigBry for this one!

"Initial CANQuest (TM) review: CAN you believe it?!? I really thought that I had screwed the pooch on this one. Omar specifically brought some cans with him to Boston to give to me for review and I thought that I forgot to review them before drinking. Instead, I have copious notes encompassing numerous notebooks and I just got them back from a local transcription service. Lo and behold, here was my review!"
recieved a couple cans from BarrytheBear in a trade. Thanks. Drank this one solo and will share the other with a hophead friend. 
Many thanks to my buddy krisandajt for a can of this. You're a good man Joe.
"100th review milestone, finally feeling the urge to review more beers that I drink, but this beer is certainly a beer that my palate frequently visits, my friend Furious."

Big thanks to mnjeff for the awesome package of Surly products. Poured from a can into a Surly pint glass also obtained from mnjeff.
Enjoyed cask conditioned pint during a special meet the founder night at Sheffields in Chicago!
Got to enjoy this beer at the Firkin in IL thanks to my buddy Andy for the short road trip. 
I drank this from a can into a chalice.
"A: Dark reddish color, head retention is good"
"this beer is a hop head's dream,however i am not a fully devoted hop head.i enjoy some balance. "
Served in a pint glass at Durty Nellies.
Color is a rusty reddish brown with a decent head and average lacing.

"Thanks to Avolon68 for his extreme generosity, Poured into some duvel snifters and split with a friend and had another one for myself for a review. "
"on tap at Sheffield's in Chicago. pours a fiery amber color with a solid finger of tight, light tan head that leaves solid lacings and has great retention."
The appearance is amber-orange with a one finger white head. It has a great oily body with medium lacing. I give it a 4 because of the hazy nature of the brew as well as the head leaving quit fast.
Received as part of a Surly sampler I received through a trade.
Acquired via trade...thanks Bill. 16 oz can poured into a pint glass. Comes in at 6.2% and 99 IBUs. No bottling info is given.
A beautiful thick white head atop a copper orange body. unfortunately this was served in a plastic cup and I wasn't able to examine it fully.
"Appearance: orange brown in color, 1/4 inch head, clear, moderate carbonation"
"Pours a very amber/chestnut brown color with golden orange hues and a two finger frothy yellowish beige head that lasts, leaving soapy chunks of lacing in it's path."
EDIT: Some individual just merged Tea Bagged Furious with regular Furious. This review is for Tea Bagged Furious. 
"Had a chance to sample this fine brew at Darkness Day 2009. Deep copperish red color with a nice layer of tan foam. Smells of pure hops. Citrusy and piney. Comparing the taste to regular Furious, this has a larger hop profile and a lesser malt profile. Hops dominate. Sweet and bitter citrus and piney hops slap the tongue silly. Smooth as can be and soft on the palate. Hops can overwhelm a bit so drinkability is good. A nice variation to an outstanding IPA."
Reviewed at the day of Darkness on tap.
"I had this on saturday's darkness day, I'm reciting from memory. "
Review #600. On tap at Clark Street Ale House.
A:Dark red amber w/ little to no head. Little tiny bubbles of active carbonation. Some white lacing.
Bright clear red-orange with a frothy head.
"Came to the table with a dark amber color and a foamy white head which left a nice ring lace on the glass. The aroma is pure hops. Grapefruit and floral hops are the dominant smells. The taste is the same, but as with the can, I can taste a bit of a malt backbone, but not as much as from the can. Medium bodied, dry, and nicely carbonated. Nicely drinkable, and what a steal, $2 for happy hour. Can't beat that."
"The second Surly can I got from my man Joe aka Ineedabeerhere. Canned 5/22/09. About 5 months old, on the far side for an IPA, but I'm still impressed. "
A: Pours a cloudy yet vibrant copper color with a slightly off white head that leaves thick lacing as the head dissipates.
A - Lighter copper with a nice white head.
Got this as an extra from skinnyguy. Thanks!
Thanks to mistofminn for the trade.
Sampled from a 16oz can in a standard pint glass. Acquired in a trade with LarryG.
"This beer pours a beautiful amber/copper color with a big sticky tan tinged cap of foam, leaving lacing all the way down. A strong hoppy aroma. Pine, grapefriut, lemon all contribute to the nose. "
Another Minnesota staple... The best damn beer in a can. Period.
Got this awesome lookin can from either grub or rjacklin. Thanks to both of you for the great Surly cans. Poured it from the bigboy can into an oversized DFH snifter.
Pours red-amber with a thick creamy head that leaves sheets of lacing.
"Poured a nice clean amber color with a thick and sticky tan head, nice lacing."
A) two inch head. dark amber/orange. looks well carbonated.
"Poured from the can to the glass (as suggested on the can) this brew has a great burnt orange color with a foamy (almost airy) head that leaves thin sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma fills my nose with wonderful citrus, bold floral hops, fresh pine, and a mild roasted toffee smell. I cannot wait to take my first sip..."
This beer poured out with a really nice head. It's a mildly dark amber color with a heavy lacing on the glass.
Big thanks to drhinehart as part of the Football BIF. Poured into my Short's pint glass.
"This is a well above average IPA. Great hop balance, not too bitter, great back-end hop additions. The important attributes - mouthfeel is good for an IPA, not too dry, but you can taste the zing, appearance is just right, most importantly it tastes great. This is near the top of IPAs in my book, a definite A/A-."
Received a can in a trade from Beersis81.
"This beer has an angry-sounding name, and it's fitting because it was ""mad"" good! Can acquired via trade thanks to deliriumfest."
16 oz can courtesy of mnjeff.
16oz can via mnjeff in recent trade..
Pours a deep amber with a short milky beige head. Slow recession with decent lacing towards the top of the glass. Darker than expected. 
Poured from the can into a North Coast nonic.
"I would have to say that this is probably the best beer I have had from Surly (haven't tried the Darkness yet though.) Easy enough to drink, I finished the whole growler myself in a few hours. Nice and hoppy, just the way I like them. Rich reddish tan color with a light and medium fast head and a hop scent to hang with the best of them. I have visited this brew time and time again since it hit the market in my city. Only available on tap here but that's fine with me as I can fill a growler again and again. Not bad Surly, not bad."
I poured this from a can into a pint glass.
Served on cask at Sheffield's in Chicago.
"Tap at Highway Mike's: Pours a deep amber/copper color with a large beige head and light lacing. Aroma is medium sweet, very floral with citrus, grapefruit and caramel. Flavor is grapefruit, floral, orange, some caramel and a bit resiny. Very nice hop bite. Medium bodied, creamy texture. Finshes as hoppy as it starts, great American IPA."
From notes:
"Pint Can thanks to photomike. Another great beer from surly. Dark red amber in color with a creamy head. Really nice hop nose with lots of tangerine and flowers and a spicy edge. Nice darker toasted, dry malt profile with lots of citrus and pine flavor but with a relatively soft bitterness up front. As the beer goes down, there is a firmer resiny, grapefruit peel lingering bitter flavor. Pretty light in body and very drinkable."
"Can pours a hazy dark amber/red color with a thick off white head. Has a sweet caramel pine smell. It blends together nicely. Has a medium mouthfeel. Tastes like sweet caramel candy, pine, and has a nice sticky hop aftertaste. Overall I really like this beer and would have it on hand for trips all the time because of the can."
Serving type- 16 ounce can poured into a flute glass. Recieved this in a trade from mnjeff.
got this can from a trade w/ mikeyv35. cheers mike!
"My first surly beer. Received a 4 pack courtesy of younger35, thanks again Dan."
"Pours a beautiful amber color, decent clarity, but still a little bit of haze, maybe a bit copper, a dense rocky head forms on top. Leaves some decent lacing. Really a nice looking IPA. The smell is amazing, orange, grapefruit, lemon-lime all together upfront. Then it gets really floral, slightly herbal and leafy. The malt body comes on bready, but slightly dry. Toasty, crackery, and a hint of pinapple cake with caramellized malt sugar. The beer comes on nice and cakey, like a dry citrus cake, lemony, bready, toasty. There's a nice caramelly glaze. There are resins, floral notes, powdery pollen, The alcohol isn't noticable, but this one warms you up a little. This has ther kind of flavor I love in an IPA. The mouthfeel is a liittle around medium, maybe lighter, with a nice tickle of carbonation. The resinous feel was good, the dryness was very good, but there was just enough malty sweetness. Fairly quick drinking, very enjoyable. I could definitely see getting through a four pack of cans in a long night and never getting bored."
This is a review for Tea Bagged Furious
Pint @ Stub & Herbs.
"From a can poured into a pint glass. Nice reddish, amber color. Off white head with some nice lacing. Smell of pine and some citrus. All hops in the taste. Pine then maybe grapefruit. Nice bite at the end. Delicious. No complaints in the mouthfeel. Perfectly carbonated. Not too thin and not too thick for me. A fantastic beer. If only I didnt have to drive 3 hours to pick some up. Ah well, I like driving and I see more road trips up north in the future."
Wow this is a good hophead beer. Thanks to Remilamy for bringing me some from MN. 
"A ringer in the IPA category, Furious is a ""tweener"" that can stand up to many of its Imperial cousins. Pours an alluring dark copper that has a ruby glow when held up to the light. A finger and a half of smooth downy head develops and slowly deflates to a thin layer of white lacing. The smell is, not surprisingly, pine forward, but beneath that the floral and caramel wiffs combine to smell a bit like pure dulce de leche."
Super nice...you like this quite a bit
"THIS... is a killer IPA that absolutely lives up to the hype. I've been wanting to try this beer for quite a while... and now that the time is here, I couldn't be more excited!"
Got this can as an extra from younger35. Poured into Stone India Pale Ale stemware.
This is Tea Bagged Furious.
Huge thanks to PhiDelt for this one
"Lets make this very clear. This is the review for ""Tea-Bagged Furious."" The two were recently merged (understandably so) but I want my reviews seperate."
Poured from can to tumbler.
"Pours a deep amber body and the bubbles actually churn furiously under the pillowy white head as it is poured. Aroma is inviting leafy, earthy hops and a hint of amonia. Medium bodied and surprisingly not overly bitter. Great hop flavor especially in the finish. The malt seems to be keeping the bitterness honest, but I can't really detect any distinguishable malt flavors. Good drinkability for 99 IBUs."
From a 16oz can into a Perfect Pint Glass.
"Poured a burnt orange color with lots of carbonation and a billowing tannish head. Nose is pine, citrus and lots of caramel. Taste is rather chewy, thick with pine, citrus and caramel. Mouthfeel is heavy for an IPA. Lots of malt here,even tasted chewy and toasty to. Drinkability is good."
"A: Very red, a hint of brown to it. Pours with a nice half inch head to it that hangs around for a few minutes. Crystal clear."
A- A brown-ruby-bourbon color with about an inch of white head. Laces nicely. Very dark for an IPA. So glad I got my hands on this one.
16oz can poured into a Portsmouth goblet. Received in a trade with arvjunk. Thanks! No date code to indicate freshness of this one.
Yeah! I got some more Surly! Thanks to my mother-in-law for picking it up on a recent trip to MN!

The first beer in a can I've been excited about since I was 18. Thanks to cvaypai for sending one my way.
Proof that some of the best damn beers do come in a can. Getting down to brass tacks:
Thanks User0317 for the trade!!
"Hooray for trading and good friends, finally got a can of this to try. "
"Easy drinking American IPA. Draft served with about one inch of offwhite head. Deep amber color, with a strong citrus hop aroma. First sip tastes like it smells. Lots of citrus hops exploding in your mouth. Very drying, not a thirst-quenching kind of beer. But I would still go back for more."
"A - Poured with two fingers of head, the color is dark amber and impeciabbly clear."
"Pours a deep copper, nearly opaque with a medium bodied couple millimeters of off white head."
"Received in a trade from Onenote81 (Thanks, Jon)"
Had on-tap at Kuma's Corner this afternoon.
"A: Bright blood-orange with a crimson shade. The thick, creamy, white head falls slowly to a nice 1/2 inch cap and leaves incredibly sticky lacing all over the glass. Great appearance."
"Pours a woody bronze with a silky tan head. Nose has big piney hops, citrus fruits, caramel and bready malts. Taste does not have the same hop explosion, but is still quite good. Well balanced with bitter hops up front followed by grapefruit, candy malts and more hops through the finish. Medium body is well carbonated, but a bit thin. Tasty stuff."
"I have had this beer many times, more from cans, many times from tap as well. I would say it is my favorite beer to date!"
"Beer for a glass, from a can."
Thanks to Justn for this one!
"A: Poured into an imperial pint glass, it's a semi-opaque dark caramel, with a foamy but thick 2-finger head that leaves rings after every sip. "
16 oz can acquired in a trade with RustyDiamond (THANKS!) poured into a Sierra Nevada Hop Tulip glass. 
Chilled can into a glass. Courtesy of a trade with busch03. Thanks Waylon!
"a very streamline IPA with a bitter finish. reddish amber with quite a small head and good lace. nose is grapefruit and a bitter grapefruit palate that is well back with malt. like sweet malt and a orange fruit, pineapple aftertaste. mild doughiness and chestnut malt finish. very drinkable."
From the cask at Dark Lord Day 2009. After all the guest taps and special released FFF my palate was completly trashed but I had room for this one the last of the day for me. 
"A big thanx to Buebie for providing this gem... Also on a personal note, this is big #300 on my review list... Cheers..."
16 oz can poured into an imperial pint glass. Enjoyed on a rainy Friday after work while reading Brewmaster's Table.
Pours a nice amber color with a nice dense foamy head leaving nice lacing as this beer quickly disappears. 
"A: Rich reddish-amber body... dense, massive off white head comprised of minuscule, tightly packed bubbles... great retention and lacing.."
"A: Served in a standard pint glass with just a 1/8"" inch of bubbly head. Light walnut in color. Slightly hazy. Absolutely no lacing "
"Pours a deep amber topped with an even, tight head that dies down to a 1/4"" and then won't go away. The English language lacks the words necessary to describe the beautiful, sloppy lacing."
"A- Great looking beer. cloudy, amber-brown color with a nice and thick tan head that lingers for awhile and laces the glass."
"this brew pours up straight outta the tallboy with a murky rusty copper color with a nice tan head. great sticky icky on the sides of my Trix cereal cup. the nose is bread n' yeast, floral and piney hops, subtle honey (dew or suckle). the taste is very smooth, piney and floral hops uh-gane, sweet smooth malts, medium to full bodied, medium to low carbo, just a damn good IPA. Try it! Im not sure how long this one sat in my closet for...but it is still a fresh banana."
Thanks to fogdog for this extra during a heavy imperial stout trade.
"Appearance: A slightly cloudy amber appearance. Very little head on tap, but sufficiently carbonated."
Thanks to MBABJJ for a 4pk of this one in a trade.
"thanks to natasharai for the fresh can. (additional thanks to vwcraig for sending this as an extra, but it ended up being not so fresh. not his fault, since surly doesn't actually have a dating scheme, according to the brewers themselves.) tasted in early april 2009"
Thanks to (esch & SrMonkey) for the cans of Furious! I'll be BMing you again very soon for another Surly platter of beer! 
Obtained from TheReaper16!!
Appearance: Poured with a large creamy frothy head dissipated leaving nice lacing at the top of my glass. The beer is clear with a deep amber color. 
"This beer is pretty much a regular for me, it's always in the fridge, I often start a night of beers with a furious. It's kinda my control beer, I always find myself saying ""furious is better"" or ""this reminds me of furious"". Basically an all around great beer. "
"Can into red wine glass, served just a hair cooler than cellar temp and up from there. Thanks once again to Dev (buckeyesox) for the chance to try this one!"
"Bought at Apollo Liquor (local Surly, and other micro-brew carrier in Rochester, MN). Poured into a Stella Artois tapered pint."
"this ipa pours a dark cooper color with a nice creamy head and great lacing thru-out..one of the darker colored ipa Ive had.. soon as you pop the can and pour its WOW the smell is great ..its huge pine and citrus first then floral smells and grapefruit, spice/hops..you can also smell sweet malts you know this brew is a great one..very nice..the taste is a pine and grass forest hit on the taste buds then you get some great citrus hits with delicious hops it finishes with a sweet malt backbone..this ipa is well balanced and very drinkable its defiantly a hoppy, piney ,driven ipa one of the top ipas in the country ..one that im glad is right in my backyard and available anytime..which is always...highly recommended"
"Whoa, is this unexpectedly dark for an IPA! its not quite brown... more of a burnt orange. Fluffy head that dissipates quickly to a one-finger ring."
Served out of a 16 oz can into a standard pint glass.
"16oz tall boy full of delicious IPA. Sweet. Appearance is on the darker side for an IPA. Deep orange amber color. Good head, lacing. Aroma is mighty strong, loaded with piney and grapefruit and a caramely malt. Hoppy flavor, yes. But not quite as sharp as I was hoping from the strong aroma. Nicely balanced however with a ton of malt. Full bodied. Very sturdy - I just wish a little more of the piney and grapefruit hinted at in the aroma powered through the dense malt. Anyhow - a solid beer, of course."
Drank from a cask at Dark Lord Day 2009
"Had this on two different occasions, on tap both times. Did not want to review on my first time as I did not like it, and wanted to be sure before. "
EDIT: This is Tea-Bagged Furious before it was merged.
This beer pours a hazy copper with a finger of off-white foam that showed decent retention and laced in sheets. Big hop aroma doesn't even require you getting your nose close to the glass. Freshly grated grapefruit rind mixes with a pine forest and a decent dose of caramel. Everything about the nose screams quality and fresh. Its hard to hold off drinking this beauty.
"Big, tall, fire-filled can poured into my pint glass. Not the first time I've danced with this devil. Pours a deep amber red with an aggressive thick, frothy head that just kinda hangs out for a while leaving tons of lacing. Throws off a beautiful strong citrus and pine smell with just a tad of sweetness backing it. Strong piney hops with the bite of a mildly sweet grapefruit, leaving a little bitter sensation on the back of your tongue. A little thin on the mouth, but coats your mouth leaving you wanting more."
A transcription from notes taken at Great Taste of the Midwest.
From notes @ DLD 2009. Poured from the firkin into a plastic cup.
Probably the best beer of the weekend for me at DLD. Poured a murky off centered brownish dirty amber with a spritzy off white head.
Serving glass: Poured from can into Nonic Imperial Pint.
"A) Heavy chill haze, deep amber body that holds a solid cover that laces some."
Poured from can into Tulip glass.

dark glowing amber with a good bit of haze. A thick creamy off-white head has amazing retention and leaves behind some pretty good lacing down the glass.
"Thanks to tprokop7 for the can, poured into a snifter."
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a giant mug. Thanks, br3wmeister!"
"Feels odd pouring from a can. A darker almost like a golden light maple syrup color. Pretty nice head, solid lacing. Strong grapefruity hop aroma."
Poured a dark orange/red with a head that held for the duration of my time with this beauty leaving lacing all the way down the glass.
"This is what it's all about. Furious is a tough beer to improve, but this version manages to do it. The appearance is lighter, a pleasant orange with some nice haziness to it. The nose is full of hops, no surprise, with a little more earthiness than the original."
Poured In: Tulip Glass.
A - Reddish with a white head that fades quickly and laces
Received from phreak1983 in a recent trade. Thanks!
Thanks mikereaser for the opportunity.
"excellent color that is deep dark red - very unexpected! whispy foam that caps the brew quite nicely. bright hop aroma of citrus character with a malt background. mouthfeel is just a tad thin, but exactly on style. wow, I think I may have just experienced the benchmark AIPA!"
Thanks to Greggy for this tasty brew.
"Appearance - Almost identical to a hot caramel sundae topping in color. Some fading orange highlights give it a good backlight. The head was just about as good as it gets, snow white and a good finger length in size. Lacing was superb, and added to the splendor and beauty of this brew. Would have liked the color to be a little lighter, but thats just nitpicking."
Big up to crazynelson for the trade (this was an extra -- an extra!).
Thanks to tprokop for this one. Poured from a 16 oz can into my Sam Adams glass.
Served in a tulip from a bomber.
"Drank this with mothman, thanks to him for this beer!"
"This is probably around the sixth time I've cracked one of these open over the course of a couple months. I've held off on reviewing this beer until I've tried it enough times to really form an opinion about it. The first time I tried it, I went batshit crazy over it and decided to trade for more, so I really wanted to temper that first impression and try to be objective. "
"Review and beer courtesy my lovely bride, who thought of me when in Minnesota, thanks Honey!!"
"Had Furious tap in pint glass at pub. Nice dark copper color with decent head. Smell was highly vegetal; strong hop aroma with pine overtones. Strong, but not overwhelming, hop flavor. This is a highly hopped beer and very good for its type, but I the hops really overpowered the malt. Although I enjoy a hoppy beer, I would have liked a bit more balance. Good mouthfeel. Overall a quite drinkable beer."
Poured into a Maudite snifter this beer yielded an exceptional head. A absolutely gorgeous dark amber body with a pale white head that stubbornly sits atop its bounty. 
"I acquired this via trade with wery0001. I poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter. Furious pours a deep copper with a rock hard white head and lots of lacing. The smellis big time pine, it has the aroma of a much bigger beer. The flavor profile is strong on pine, but is very balanced. The finish lingers with a thick piney flavor. The beer is medium bodied, perfectly carbonated, and very smooth. Furious is a great beer!"
"Pours a dark, nebulous orange with a great one inch while head. Retention and lacing are excellent."
"Thanks to akokandy for trading this. Pours a medium copper with a 3-finger thick, frothy white-yellow head. Lots of lacing. "
On tap at blue Nile restaurant in Minneapolis. I've had this several times before but I feel the need to finally review it.
"16 oz can brought back from Minnesota by my dear friend Kathy. Pours a dark amber with a one finger white head. Interesting melange of hop aromas, some flowers, some grapefruit and a nice pine bite at the end. Hefty orange flavor with some lemon, grapefruit and pineapple behind it and a pine snap in the finish. The flavors linger for ages after the can is gone, which is good since I ran out of the stuff!"
"Poured from a 16 oz. can into a pint glass. Thanks to natasharai for this one, unfortunately my last can of Surly from our trade!"
My first Surly.Thanks DRINKNDRIVE.I really love and appreciate a real ipa. Not overboard on the hops.Nice balance.
Thanks to Natasharai for a few cans of this.
"Poured a beautiful amber with a light tan head - aroma is amazing! Citrus, fruity - awesome!"
Huge thanks to deliriumfest for this beer.
"I can't recall who sent this my way, but thanks. Poured from a 16 ounce can into my nonic pint glass. Appears an amber/copper color with a healthy two fingers of fluffy, sticky ecru tinted foam. Lacing forms on the inside of the glass with each sip. Smells of grassy, piney hops, grapefruit, lemon and orange. Tastes of bitter grapefruit, orange, pineapple, pine needles and sweet caramel malt. Medium in both body and carbonation. Finish is pleasantly bitter. A solid IPA, check it out if you have not yet done so."
"Cans from DBhog and JDV, thanks guys!"
"this beer is a 10. i really cant think of anything wrong with this hop filled beer. always a hit and super tasty. one thing i look for is the consistency in tastes which i believe can differ from tap to tap, or can to can. when drinking this can i always pour into a glass. i dont think you can drink it out of the can and get all of flavors and smells. going rate for this tasty treat is usually 2.5-3 a can, good deal!!"
Enjoyed in a pint glass.
Can trade from shigadeyo. Poured hazy amber with an average off-white frothy head that lasted with good lacing. Solid pine and sour citrus aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Heavy smooth bitter flavor with a heavy bitter finish of moderate duration. This is a standout beer.
Surly Furious is everything an IPA should be.
"A - Reddish amber in color, not much head"
"I've had this twice now - at Darkness Day, and at Night of the Living Ales. It's always a huge treat to have this one. Served in my NLA taster glass."
A: Pours a cloudy reddish-brown hue with a small off-white head with good retention but almost no lacing. 
"A- Solid deep amber color, quarter finger head."
"Tough on appearance as I drank the 4 cans all from the can just because. 1st can was Ok, drank right off the delivery truck. Others were really great. Suprising beer for the quality. Assumed it would be just Ok, maybe the 1st can make me think that about the other 3. Wish I had more. Awesome IPA and at the price for 4 pack and tall boys, really nice!"
"Another generous extra from Dbhog (thanks Bill). Served in an SA Sensory Pint. Poured a translucent burnt orange with a two inch frothy off-white cap. Bands of thick, yet delicate, lacing are revealed as the head slowly dissipates. Copious tiny bubbles adhered to the sides of the glass during the initial few minutes post-pour. Aromas of grapefruit and piney hops waft up from the glass. Taste consistent with nose; amazing flavor and balance. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied. Lightly carbonated and smooth with very little bitterness detectable at the back. By far the easiest drinking IPA I've ever had. Six months ago, I shyed away from the style, but brews like this have caused me to seek them out."
"16 oz. can tried 16 Jan 2009. Courtesy of hogwildliquor, thanks!"
"Pours a murky amber orange with a half inch white, fluffy, soapy head. I love the head of an IPA better than any other beer. Wow, there is almost a complete curtain of lacing with this one. The smell is very hoppy. There are citrus and pine notes and a slight caramel toffee malt. The taste is amazing! The mouthfeel is the first thing that jumps out though. This is one creamy brew! I usually use creamy to describe a beer but none have ever been like this. The taste is not overly hoppy, there is some sweet citrus and some pine but it is mostly balanced by the caramel malt. This is more balanced than an American IPA should be. I still love this one and wouldn't mind having a case around at all times."
A tasty IPA. This falls somewhere between an IPA and DIPA in most aspects.
"The label reads true...great beer out of can, meant to be poured in a glass! Per the owners, great marketing, cool design, and awesome logo."
Got this from a buddy over on my cigar forum. He surprised me with this and 2 cans of coffee bender which I have yet to drink.
"Received a tall-boy can from TurdFergison in a recent beer trade. Pours a hazy, dark-brownish-amber with lots of quick tiny bubbles, a huge rocky off-white head and some crispy lacing. Lots of caramel malt in the aroma, grain husk, honey oat dinner rolls and hints of dark fruits. Some citrusy, pungent, and spicy hop aromas. Medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. Some caramel malt sweetness up front with some toasted character. Hops flavor is citrus as hell like fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. The beer finishes with a spicy bitterness and a flavor like Halls menthol-orange cough drops. I am a raging hop-head but did not love this one. I'm not sure how fresh this can is but I would rate this IPA ok at best."
Thanks to vwcraig for the opportunity on this one!
"some don't see what the hype is about, but i'm in heaven here. dark orange with an off white head that holds and leaves sweet lace. nose is toffee caramel with citrus pine. the hops really hit you right off the bat, but there is a good amount of caramelly/toffeeish malt for the burly, surly, heavy handed hopping. this is what i think of when i think American IPA. 6%abv makes it extremely drinkable. very impressive."
GLASS: Pint Glass
"A- Had on tap at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL. Served in an imperial pint. Served a yellow-orange with a 1 finger head. Really nice retention and lacing. Very enticing."
"I was able to try this last night and have been looking forward to it for some time. It is a great American IPA! It has a nice floral and citrus hop smell. It tricks your mouth into thinking it's going to be just over the top huge, but as soon as it hits your tongue, WOW. It's a very smooth drinking beer and it lures you in for the next sip right away. I couldn't put it down! And at 6.2% I could have 3 or 4 of these and not mind it at all!"
"Received from a nice trade - big thanks to ScoobyDank. I empty my trade bounty, this can of Furious, into an oversized tulip. This is the second can I've tasted."
I got this one from Crazynelson in Cincinnati through a beer trade. Awesome brew my friend!
"Wow. Pours a caramel, burnt orange color with 2 fingers of sticky white head that fell to about a centimeter; this beer is a real beauty in the glass. The aroma is full of piney, citrusy (grapefruit) notes with a little hint of caramel on the end. This is, in my opinion, one of the most perfectly balanced beers in the world; 100 IBU's so the bitterness is there, but the subtle nuances of the hops shine through because of the great malt character (they use the same malts as Macallan scotch). This is a beer I could drink all night and not get bored. "
"Thanks to justn for this one! Finally, my first Surly!"
I had this on-tap at The Firkin in Libertyville IL.
"A- Inch and a half light tan foamy head, with fair retention and some lacing. The beer is an amber almost red color."
"Ok so I would recommend trying the standard Furious before attempting to decifer this one. And by the way, that one is best in the can. Appearance is very good, lots of hazy orange floating around with a nice head and lacing. Smell is wow, a blast of citrus and floral hops. A bit spicy and then the sweet herbal tea on the back. Very complex and very nice. Taste mirrors the smell but hops get a bit more balanced by the tea and I like mine very one dimensional. Still fantastic however. Mouthfeel is just a touch above medium in body, lots of carbonation and oily movement. Drinkability- I don't think it can get any more drinkable than this."
A= darker amber color that's hazy and delicious. Little to no head and almost no lacing
"Acquired a can of this thanks to tytoanderso. Caramel orange with nice white head. Smells like crazy amounts of hops, and I was also getting a touch of cat urine, which was a bit off-putting. Taste is more crazy abundant amounts of hops. There's a decent amount of malts to balance this out, but the excessive amount of hops just crowds everything else out. With lots of other great beer to drink last night, we didn't even finish a can of this split between three people."
16 oz. can poured into tulip glass
A: Dark orange with a nice frothy head.
my first surly not sandwiched by samples of oak aged dark lord and more oak aged dark lord
Thanks to mully for this one. 
Thanks to beveritt for sharing this little treasure.
On-tap at Churchkey DC
A: Crisp and clear looking honey gold . A magnificent head with a huge stickiness... leaving big walls of lacing
16oz can
"Thank you OHLRangers for the sample of this outstanding beer. Poured out of one of the baddest ass cans I've ever seen. Pours a deep cloudy reddish orange that produces a nice 1"" head that sticks to the glassas I drink. I'm hit with scents of citrus and pine with a malty undertone. Very well balanced with strong hoppiness up front followed by some malt and finishes clean and bitter. Sticks to the mouth very well. It's excellent taste scores high with me and raises drinkability. I love it."
"I reviewd this in can form, but got a growler from the brewery and thought I'd review it again as it was that day fresh."
My 200th review! I picked up a four pack of cans while in MN over the holidays. I loved it on tap a couple of years ago so lets see how it stacks up compared with my memory.
"Pours a lightly hazy burnt sienna (thank you crayola) with a topping of froth with a few soap bubbles... that sticks around, and leaves evidence of its presence with a sizeable wall of lace. Through the haze a few adventurous bubbles can be seen skulking up the walls of the glass, and"
My first Surly!
A- Great amber/copper color. Lots of thick foamy tightly knit head. 
A- Pours a beautiful dark amber body with a two finger head. Head retention is marvelous.
Thanks to delriumfest for this one! 
"Thanks to Jeff, beckje01, for the hand delivery."
Thanks to Mikesgroove for the BIF goodies...
"Can courtesy of Phocion - great trader, thanks!!! Poured into a Duvel tulip (need to clean some glassware!)."
"My second Surly, received in a trade with MasterSki - thanks! Here goes the only can in my beer fridge..."
"This is just about the reddest IPA I've seen-- rich copper color with a quarter-inch yellow head. Smells strongly of pine and citrus, great aroma. Taste is extremely bitter, and not as much citrus as most IPAs, at least not as much as the west coast IPAs I tend to favor. Perhaps a bit out of balance here, but they do make bitterness into an art form. This beer's bitterness deserves its own zip code. It's a statement. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable beer, though the bitterness detracts slightly. Still, it's an impressive alternative to the west coast IPAs. Thanks to Tyler for the trade."
"Received in trade from Prototypic, thanks for the opportunity. "
Generally clear crimson brass colored with a modest beige head that slinks away to a collar with some haste. Great lacework. 
Thanks to someone for this can ... I can't remember who.
I happened upon this on cask at Buster's tonight.
"My buddy was fortunate enough to receive this as an extra in a trade, and after tasting, I immediately set up a trade for a 4pack of my own. Thanks treyrab and hogwildliquor!!"
"Pours a foggy ruby hued amber with a crème head. Nose is strong citrus (grapefruit) and stronger piney resin. Flavor is quite sharp. Brings the expected bitter tone with firm leafy tones and a supremely hoppy presence. Almost comes off as a very hoppy amber ale. Like I said, a sharp flavor profile. Feel has a biting carbonation and the liquid is thicker. Nice to drink. Very heavy, but this is what the hop heads like."
"This beer is absolutely bursting with hoppy aroma and flavor. The moment you open the can it gives off such a resiny citrus hop aroma. It pours into the glass a dark amber to copper color with a nice creamy head that appears to lose nothing from the brewers' beloved canning method. The taste, oh the taste! This packs as much flavor as many of the DIPAs that I have tried. It is so citrusy, piney, and bitter. It doesn't forget about the malts either. The one knock that I have is that the mouthfeel is not 100% where I think it should be. I think it could be a little more full bodied, not to say that it is bad by any means. Man is this beer drinkable though. If you are ever in St. Paul or your beer store gets a case of this beer you should have no qualms about buying a full case or too. Plus, how many times can you say that you have had an A overall beer out of a can?"
"Can, thanks to mreusch. Pours a slightly cloudy dark amber with a small white head. Aroma of grassy hops and grapefruit. Flavor of citrus, sour grapefruit, lemons, iced tea, grassy hops. An alright IPA, but somewhat one-dimensional. Doesn't make the ""great-IPA"" cut for me."
Got a couple cans in trade from DonOsborn. Thanks man!
Poured from a growler via trade into my DFH tulip glass. Growler was maybe 2 weeks old.
"Had on ""guest tap"" at Lunar outside of Chicago."
"Pours a very pretty somewhat dark orange/red with a thick foamy 1 inch head. Smells of intense fresh citrusy hops dominate the nose. First sip is all hop bitterness that is matched by a just strong enough malt backbone providing an excellent mouthfeel. Very hearty, very clean, very robust. Nice."
"Surely this can of Surly couldn't compare with a bottled beer. You are correct. It doesn't compare. It is actually better than most bottled IPA's. Aroma and flavor is full of piney hops and rich malts. Pours a dark amber with a nice sized head. Pine, pineapple, big hops and big malts. A sticky brew and I loved it. One last thing.... Did I mention anything about BIG HOPS!!! It is like my nose was smashed into a pine tree!!!!"
A: Pours a light amber with a decent white head and a lot of bubbles.
A: Amber to crimson and slightly cloudy beerage pours out with a nice lasting eggshell head.
"Surly Furious has a dark copper colour and a decent sized head with pretty damn good retention and good retention. Since the beer is canned, one would expect the beer to have a slight tin nose or taste, but the beer definitely does not. The nose comes accross of a deep citrus flavour with a slight grapefruit and peach hint. The fruitiness comes entirely from the hops, but smells wonderful. When drinking the beer the huge bitterness of 100 IBUs hit you intially, but the Amarillo and Simcoe hops jump out at your tastebuds, making you want to have another drink. The beer is so incredibly hoppy, but at the same time, it's balanced! The flavours and aroma while drinking this beer, just blow me away. With the complex malts and hops that jump out at you, this is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. The mouthfeel is creamy and exactly what I'd expect on an IPA. This beer is stupidly drinkable."
"Cheers to HogWildLiquor for this one, thanks Cody!"
"1 pint can poured into an imperial pint glass, Furious is a chill hazed rusty amber with a tight, creamy egg-shell head, with long least leaving heavy lace. I love red IPAs!"
16 oz. can split with atsprings...thanks to deliriumfest for the trade. 
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the share! 160z can split into two Brooklyn tulips. Pours a nice deep amber with a nice frothy head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves great lacing. Aroma is a wonderful abundance of sweet malts and Earthy citrus hops I could smell as soon as I started pouring. The taste is nice balance of sweet malts just slightly overpowered by citrus hops, reminds me of Oscar Blues Gordon only a little lighter and sweeter. The beer is certainly light and crisp with slight carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer, I want more!"
Thanks to deliriumfest for the trade!
"Wow, what a brew. Poured into a tulip pint glass, this is the most beautiful beer ever, lovely orange-copper color with a rich, creamy head. The smell of hops hits you before you even lift it up to drink, but close sniffing brings out classic pine and citrus hop aromas. The taste is fantastic, big hops up front, followed by an explosion of sweet malts, and rounded out with great hops bitterness which lingers until your next slug. This beer doesn't cheat you in any way. The beer is pretty crisp considering all the flavor and alcohol you are dealing with. They go down easy, but a couple of these can sneak up on you in a hurry. This would be my standard beer if I could get it on a regular basis. Bravo Surly."
thank you unclejedi for this.
Big thanks to deliriumfest for the hook up.
From Old Notes:
Thanks paco for this beer!!!
Thanks to gratefulstu for the great trade! Two new traders proving that awesome trades can happen no matter who it is with!
Thanks to Scoobydank for hooking me up with this! Split these last night with jac5084.
Wasn't what I expected out of a canned beer.
Just an awesome IPA.
Poured this beer from the can into a long stem. It pours a deep copper color and is reasonably clear. The head is off-white and starts out ~1.5 inches and just continues to stick around.
"My lovely wife brought me 10 cans of this from Minnesota checked in her luggage inside of an ice packed waterproof box...yeah, I know...I better hang on to this woman!! Furious pours a reddish copper color, relatively cloudy with a billowy head that was pretty active as I poured into the glass. The lacing is clinging to the sides of the glass in rows as I drink it down. The dominant hop aroma jumps out of the glass as if you are sniffing fresh hops off the vine. It is almost breathtaking to get a whiff! The hop profile is more piney than citrusy. There is a slight aroma of malt but the hops are the big thing here. The flavor does not disappoint for hop heads. There is a well balanced sting of hops coupled with a medium carmelly body. Flavors like white pepper, pine needles, and very sour orange juice loom in the background. Exceptional for big flavor lovers and hop heads like me, but this probably isn't for everyone hence the slight lower ""drinkability"" rating. Get Surly!"
I picked this up after Darkness Day '08 at Blue Max. I love seeing great beers in a can! With that said I poured this from a can into an Imperial Pint glass.
On cask at Darkness Day. I went to this one first before the palate was completely shot.
"A - Somewhat hazy amber color with a frothy light brown head. Head is on the small side and quickly fades to a thin layer of foam, but leves sheets of lacing on the glass."
"On CASK at Darkness day. The guys serving it kept giggling whenever anybody said ""Tea Bagged."""
Pours a clear ruby color with one finger foamy white head.
"First try of the furious. Looks a nice, clear, amber color with good beige head. Beige has never been so exciting. Smells on the pinier side of citrus. Sports the sharper notes of the West Coast IPAs."
12 oz pour on-cask @ D-Day on 10/25/08..

One of the most complex beers I have EVER had the pleasure of trying. Thank goodness there are brewers in Minnesota that know what they are doing. Brau Brothers should take note.
Thanks to KeefD for this one.
"Beer for a glass, from a can."
"Clear, caramel-brown color with pleasing red-orange highlighting. Tan head is strong and stiff, jumps up initially to an inch or more in the goblet, and leaves full, thick, tough lacing as the glass is drained. Super impressive. "
"Served in a nonic, golden amber with an inch of substantial white head. Instant blast of citrusy hops before I even got my paw on the glass, with a light touch of malt once my schnoz was an inch or so away. Flavor is true to the aroma, with plenty of hop bitterness and flavor, with a solid malt base that is just not quite up to the task of balancing all those hops. Pretty good effort though, for only 6.2% ABV. Drinks a little heavy for a 6.2%, seems to have a lot of unfermentables for that potency. I still give it good marks for a drinkablility, considering that this is definitely in the hop-bomb category and never will be a session brew."
"Courtesy of hero27 as part of one insane LNBA BIF haul - thanks, man...poured from can into Reidel Cab glass..."
Thanks to theisti for this one.
"A - Really beautiful head that starts huge then turns into a bumpy, frothy foam with pretty lacing. Sticks to the sides thicker than any beer I've head. Deep amber color almost like sap."
Pours beautifully into my glass from the Surly can. Nice slightly cloudy reddish amber with a big foamy head. 
a good reddish brown color with hardly any head very littlle retention but some lacing
Pours cloudy and dark amber with copious white head that recedes fairly quickly leaving decent lacing behind.
"Got a 4 pack of cans from a friend in MN, and poured it into a pint glass."
16 oz can of love received from Reino for my Birthday. Poured into a pint for my drinking pleasure. 
"From the distinctive red can this beauty poured a deep mahogany color with a big fluffy off-white head and fair lacing. The aroma is a pungent piney hops with that urine-like bitterness, the good one! The taste is a smooth mid-bodied blast of piney piss and earthy malt. Soooo drinkable, mildly carbonated. Beautiful! A new favorite, if only I didn't have to travel half way across the United States to get some more!!"
"Pours a murky copper color that shines orange when held to the light. Tight tan head is slow to settle, kicks back up with a few swirls, and leaves behind some sticky lace."
"A-Deep russet, murky brown with a supremely sticky and rocky off-white head. Major lacing and cling. "
A - Straight from the red can with silver flames behind an image of a happy camper below and a mad man above.
"Presentation: My third Surly sampling. Much thanks to Packforever1976, an awesome trader! Poured into an Imperial pint glass. "
"A: Poured from the can into a pint glass. Body is dark amber/mahogany with a 1.5-finger, foamy ivory head. Great head retention. Some foamy lace left behind."
"wow, 377 reviews as of this writing. I'll take a slightly different tact to this review. love the can, graphics and saying ""beer in can for a glass"". so, how did it tatse? It was good! Malty, sticky, resinous, citric... all things you expect in a solid american IPA. Definitely worth a try."
Pours deep caramel color with a frothy off white 2 finger head.
Thanks to starofindia for another Surly beer!
"A - Pours a glowing deep orange pekoe tea. Large, thick, sticky head, leaves slowly. Sticky lacing abounds."
Thanks to sholland119 for the generous extra in a trade.
"Shows up in the glass a deep bloody red with suprisingly good clarity for such a hoppy, unfiltered beer. Dense head with lace so thick and sticky that one would need steel wool to scrub it from the glass. Great retention that lasts to the last sip, er gulp. Aroma is unbelivable. I swear I just got a hop bale dropped on my head. Very pungent and piney with some grapefruit and a faint toffee malt profile somewhere in the back. Flavour is off the chain hoppy. Resinous pine and grapefruit and dank cannabis. Loads of agrressive but pleasing bitterness as well. All the while that almost sweet toffee flavour backs up the whole thing and doesnt let the hops make your head explode."
This one is courtesy of Packforever1976.
A: A med amber/brownish color with a fleating off white head.
I have tried Bender and CynicAle the past two nights. Both were good but didn't rock my world. Furious is different - this is one kick-ass beer.
"This beer pours a very dark cloudy amber with a 2 fingered head with nice lacing. The smell if of citrus and nuts. The taste is different from most other IPA's they must throw a little more toasted malts into this one, its nice. A very nutty taste with a stong malt overtone. The mouthfeel is nice until swallow then a dry feeling overtakes the majority of what I had in my mouth. A highly drinkable beer, minus the aftertaste."
"Appearance is slightly hazy copper with red hues and a frothy orange-tan head. Good lacing. Aroma has massive pine and grapefruit hops up front along with interesting aromas of fresh cut grass and dried biscuits. Flavor is bursting with, again, massive hops like grapefruit, pine, and orange. A touch of a lemony sourness from the moderate hop bitternes but this brew is surprisingly smooth due to a decent malt bill and it's not at all harsh in the aftertaste as you will find in many mega-hopped IPA's."
"Vigorous pour, big sticky beige head with good retention, huge lacing. Cloudy ice tea appearance, looks like it was sprinkled with nutmeg from the sediment in the 16 oz. can. The head was so fine and over flowing, it almost looked like an ice cream cone in the glass. Not a big smell. Big bitter start with a dry hop finish. The bitter taste stays long in the mouth. This begs to be drunk. I'm getting a slight sweetness around the tongue with a dry bitter taste on the tongue. Great sipper because it tastes so good you don't want it to end. A friend split this with me( thanks Jeff) I think a couple of cans of this would rock you."
Huge thanks to SrMonkey for sending this one.
"Had on tap at Grumpy Bulldog in Naperville. I am told this is a rare treasure to have on tap. Additionally, I understand the last barrel lasted only 2 days in such a small bar. When drawn it looked like a nice cool iced tea with a thick beer head on top. It has quite a bit of pin hops smell. There are some smaller citrus undertones. However, what makes this beer great is the hops. The taste is big and bold. Wow...a guy can really get into trouble with this beer. It drinks remarkably smooth and has a wonderful. This beer barries the typical Dogfish head 60 minute that is often on tap at several craft brew pubs/taverns."
This 16 oz. can came as a generous extra from bakerslp with a high recommendation. THANKS! After an afternoon filled with a bounty of spectacular new beer....I broke out this little gem & split it with a friend.
I had this one on tap at Sheffield's in Chicago. 
Pours a nice dingy orange coppery color with a full two finger head that hangs around turning into big bubbles in a mass over the top of the beer. A smattering of spotty lace is left nicely all over the glass.
"pint can, 6.2% 99 IBU =)"
"This is my first can, received via trade."
A. Pours a hazy orange with a pale yellow head. Lacing? Check
"Holy Lord, this is phenomenal. Thanks to my mother-in-law for this 4 pack of Heaven."
"My first experience with Surly. Thanks Jeff, much appreciated!"
Had on-tap at the tasting room in the South Loop Binny's in Chicago.
Dulcie had this once at the Hop Leaf in Chicago but we took no notes. It was an absolute must on our beer trek across America when we reached St. Paul.
16oz can provided by jasinviso. Served in a pint glass.
"It's really hard to reconcile the intense deliciousness of the beer with the punishment in the accumulating bitterness on the tongue. The deliciousness always wins, and you take another swig."
"Picked this brew up in a trade with Akorsak, thanks Adam!"
Thanks to sholland119 for this brew.
I've had this on at least 5 occassions and I find it to be a decent offering but nowhere close to the style I like.
"A - Served into an imperial pint glass, this brew pours a deep, clear amber. Almost brown. "
What more can I say that hasn't been said? 
"I'll have to double check, but I do believe this is the first beer I've ever reviewed out of a can. After tasting the furious, I'm not certain but that this wouldn't always be my beer of choice if I had to bring a sixer of cans some place."
"Pours with a slightly cloudy murky brown. The darkest American IPA I've seen. Small head , some lacing."
Surly is an interesting brewer. I get the cans at a couple of the local beer stores but can also slide over to their brewery on Saturdays (12-2pm only) to get a couple of growlers.
"Pours a slightly cloudy, deep copper with a two-finger off-white head and a good amount of visible carbonation. Head fades slowly to a thin cap, but leaves lots of sticky lacing behind."
"Pours a very dark amber, brown in color with a huge, frothy, off-white head. For an IPA this has a very intense, piney hop flavor! Very nice. Taste is huge hop flavor. There's no way this is only an IPA. This is better than most DIPA's that I've had. Huge, and creamy on the mouthfeel. I don't know what else to say, other than this is easily one of the best IPA's I've ever had. I've been wanting some Surly beers to see for myself what the hype is about. This one exceeds my expectations. Very well done!"
16 oz can poured into imperial pint glass
"Dark amber in color with frothy head and some prickle. Hoppy nose. Hop forward flavor and smooth mouthfeel. Undertones of malt but beautifully hopped. Extremely hoppy! I had to downgrade this on my own scale from A- to B- because a full pint ends up being too much hops and starts to numb the palate. Would be great with food but not really a ""session"" beer for me. The first half I loved. . .then it was too much for me, but I am only a casual ""hophead"" and drink lots of big malty beers."
"Well, I both see how this gets everyone in a tizzy... and recognize how if this were the IPA of my local brewer I'd be all over it all the time... and then have to acknowledge that I don't think this is the pinnacle of IPAs for me (I prefer West Coast style IPAs), nor do I think it's the best of the more malt-forward IPAs around (although this isn't really strong criticism... I think I'd take a Masala Mama or HopDevil over it... and maybe put it right on par with Smuttynose)."
"Picked up on a recent trip to MN. Had this on tap a lot, but I think I actually prefer it in a can, due to the inadequacies of many tap lines and the freshness of a nice, well refrigerated can. Pours a very pretty red with hints of terracotta, creamy yellow white head. Beautiful. Smells fresh, of grasses, citrus fruits and pine sap. Taste is a hop-forward blast of changing flavors, pert bitter citrus, nice caramel malt backbone, lingering bitterness. I think the magnificent thing about this is just how well this beer is put together...its just so well balanced. Mmm. Medium bodied, slightly sticky. Highly dinrkable and delicious."
many thanks to timbro81 for generously donating this one to me. very kind indeed.
"This is a staple of mine, and I'm supprised I've never reviewed it. The beer pours a deep amber with a gorgeous creamy head that dissapates slowly. On the nose is all hops. Pine and light citrus notes shine through over everything else. The taste is everything that the boquet presents. It starts with a huge presence of pine and citrus, followed with a light finish of toffee. The beer is medium to full-bodied, and the aftertaste remains for quite some time after each sip. Probably one of the most drinkable IPAs I have ever tasted."
Much thanks to KeefD for the trade!
"Thanks to ""Masala Mama"" for transporting four cans across state lines."
"Pours a dark amber color, almost ruby with a huge light tan head sitting on top. Great retention and some nice lacing."
"Pours a clear rich amber color with big 3+ fingers of frothy light tan head that lasts a long time, but not ridiculously long. Nice retention throughout leaves lots of sticky lacing behind. Smells even better than on tap, lots of pine, citrus oils, earthy hops, and toasted caramel malt. Tastes of toffee, sweet caramel, and lightly toasted malt are followed by flavors of orange peel, pineapple, tangerine, grass, pine, and earthy hops with a little bit of spicy hops mixed with grapefruit in the back end. Medium in body with perfect carbonation. Smooth and hoppy but very balanced with sweet caramel malt supporting the beer throughout. It's packed with hops, but not mouth puckering bitter like some IPAs."
Sampled on cask at the Map Room in Chicago
"Out of a pint can into an imperial pint glass. The head on this bad boy is enormous. A few minutes later and it become ridiculously rocky. A few more minutes later and it finally begins to settle and I can pour the rest of the beer into the glass. Lacing is gorgeous. Aroma is like unspoiled pine forest. Taste is slightly sweet, lots of hop bitterness, hints of orange and grapefruit, and wonderful malt background, with the slightest hints of caramel. Actually seems a little less hoppy out of a can. Mouthfeel is even smoother than on tap, extra creamy, nice tingle on the tongue. Carbonation levels are much lower in a can, but the smoothness on the palate makes up for it. "
Outstanding. Simply outstanding.
"A: Hazy copper with a light tan head, some retention, great lacing."
Color: Pours a dark amber-red color with a thick and foamy head that fades into a one-finger head. 
"Got this one during CanBIF 4, thanks Demcorhip!!!"
this beer poured a brown/orange wiht two fingers of head and decent lacing.
"Appearance - a cloudy orange amber brew. Ample pale orange foam above, creamy, pocky, and very sticky. Looks like a great IPA."
From a pint sized can...
Real Deal Holyfield of a beer. Thanks to Phawk for the oppurtunity.
"Enjoyed this beer from a growler that I took out of the fridge and let sit for about 10 minutes so it could warm up to around cellar temp. Have had it right out of the fridge, too, but the brewery recommends drinking it a little warmer and I find that it tastes better that way."
Huge thanks to kkipple for sending me this wonderful surprise.
A : Nice copper color with a decent head
"Overall this was a pretty good beer, but a one trick pony. Hops hops and more hops, that seems to be the surly motto, and on that front they got there. Very nice hop nose and flavor, all american hops for sure. The taste hits you bit with hops, but finishes just a touch too bitter for my taste. Balanced is always the key to IPA's and while this is far from undrinkably bitter, it need a little more malt backbone to reach a higher level. Good, but not great. I'll likely try some more surly to see how it matches up."
Thanks to some generous BAs at the Captain Lawrence Anniversary party.
"Crimson Scarlet big white head with large bubbles, similar to the bitter brewer I had previously. Very hoppy piney, resiny aroma but you can smell the Scots malt too. Well balanced. The taste is Citrus hoppy up front with pine, resin, orange and nice toffee-pine-caramel malt back notes. Mouthfeel is light and dances on the tongue to enhance the flavors. Drinkability is retarded I could easily put away a case of these cans on a summers day in Minnesota."
Thanks to bsu4beer for this beautiful extra. 
Thanks to iconoklaztor for letting me try this one.
Cheers again to atron67 for this brew. Amber in color. Huge hop smell. Taste is mostly piney hops with a good bit of bitterness which I like. Mouthfeel is smooth but is affected by the bitterness. A must have for a hop head. Highly recommended.
My first furious! Thanks to kplynch for the trade.
Daddy like. An IPA money shot in the mouth! Best beer from a can that I have ever had.
12oz can courtesy of leftmindedrighty (and sholland119) poured into a snifter.
"Wow. What a great IPA! Normally I'm not the biggest fan of beers with lots of hops, but this one hits the nail on the head. Served on-tap in a pint glass. It has some nice brownish-ruby coloration, topped with a thick white head which left copious lacing down the length of the glass. Lots of hops in the nose. Taste is what floored me about this beer, though. The hops seem to hit with a one-two punch; a nice flourish at first, which subsides and is then replaced by a second wave of hoppiness in the aftertaste. All of this is balanced brilliantly by the malt character which puts this stuff ahead of any IPA I've tried thus far. Mouthfeel is probably best described as somewhat viscous, with a satisfying rich character. I could drink this one every day, not something I usually say about this style."
"I've had Furious in 3 forms; can, tap and cask; and I love all three. It is a great IPA, light sandy brown in color with an extremely aromatic head. I describe the taste as very hoppy, but not in a biting way, if there is such a thing. Each time I've had it I've wanted to say it was almost creamy in texture, both in mouth and going down. A wonderful IPA that comes in a can. Different but totally worth it."
Thank you maximum12 for a 4-pack of these. I find these to be outstanding.
"This is an amazing beer - I've had it on draft and in a growler, but am reviewing a canned one. The appearance is just amazing, especially when poured into a glass that can hold all 16 ounces and a head. The head is dense, and it subsides slowly, leaving plenty of lace down the sides. I get a good whiff of hoppiness here, which considering I rarely smell anything is a plus. The taste is explosive, with an initial assualt of citrussy hops, followed by a solid base of malts to balance it out, with a strong hoppy after taste that lingers for quite some time. The beer has a great, rich mouthfeel, as if it were almost too big for itself. There is nothing watery here, yet it remains sprightly and non syrup-like. Again, this beer's nearly perfect balance shines through. It is quite drinkable, but going beyond a couple cans can be a lot of alcohol. If I could sip, it would be a great session brew, but as I guzzle, I need to limit myself. This is an outstanding IPA."
"Can: Amber/copper in color with a soapy off-white head. The nose shows lots of citric (especially grapefruit) hops with just a touch of balancing sweet toffee/caramel toward the back. In the mouth it is well-balanced and shows tons of dry and bitter piney/herbal hops vs. the mainly citric hops the nose showed. This one gets bonus points for packing in so many hops at a ""lower"" alcohol."
Got this from a can and poured into my GI glass
"Nice looking mostly-clear copper beer with a nice finger of tan head that dissolves fairly slowly and leaves a solid bit of lacing in its wake. Nose is delicious, fairly drying hops but then hits of fruit in there as well. I've heard they throw a ton of varieties in here, and the aromas follow through with that. A good bit of caramel hops too. Flavor is fairly drying, piney hops up front. Some darker toffeeish malt, and then some weird fruitiness, maybe dried fruit, pomegranate. Interesting as hell. Certainly dominated by those hops, but incredibly complex. Feel is nice and full, with perfect carbonation. Had this one along with the Masala Mama this week, and they were both absolutely excellent. Can't believe it comes in a can. Wish these'd show up out East."
A- perfect 2 finger head into pint glass. hazy orange color with small sediment in suspension. nice cap and lacing after a few visits to the glass.
"Special thanks to ""Turbine2475"" for this brew."
Big thanks to Lordsloth for throwing this in the Virgin BIF!
This was an extra from Mully. Thanks!
"16 oz can, undated poured into a pint glass"
"Poured into a snifter. Furious pours a really murky burnt sienna color with a nice thick frothy off-white head. Outstanding head retention, which leads to good lacing. Wonderful sweet citrus aromas with a hint of spruce needles. High alpha hops, I am thinking Centennial, control the palate with bitter citrus flavors with some evergreen tones. The sweet malts balance out the bitterness perfectly. Mild carbonation with a smooth and clean backbone. Very complex palate. Nice and crisp with a dry finish. Very nice drinking IPA. I can see why Surly is becoming a big name in the craft beer market."
"Thanks to tytoanderso & maxximum12 for a chance to try this one out! Poured form can into a sam perfect pint. light brown/red color with a creamy white full head. Head was a good 2"" and lasted for a few minutes. I was dying to get into this one, but had to wait!! Smells of light citrus hops with some pine y hop to follow. Wonderful hop aroma- right up there with the West Coast beers. First taste- de-lish! I was expecting a hop infusion, but it was a bit mellower, with a wonderful malt balance finish. this one did not burn my taste buds (which i definitely do not mind, being a hop head) Nice consistent medium bodied mouthfeel. Not overly slick or bitter. WOnderfully drinkable- I am extremly pleased it is a 16oz can, not 12!"
Thanks to Junnila for the oppurtunity to try this beer.
"After all the extremely overbearing hype here, I was finally able to try the Surly Furious on tap at the Blue Nile in Minneapolis."
In sampler glass at the 1st annual Firkin Fest at the Happy Gnome.
"Got a 3 oz. pour at the First Annual Firkin Fest at The Happy Gnome 2008. Golden Red, slightly cloudy body with nice foamy head. Smells strongly of citrus hops. IF - nicely balanced hops and slightly sweet malt. Grapefruit and other citrus flavors come through in the dominantly hoppy aftertaste. Not sure about tea. I am guessing this means dry-hopped. Nice and hoppy. Medium to full bodied with smooth finish. Very tatsy and awesome to get on cask. Notably different from the normal Furious, more smooth and slightly better balance. Both are great."

"This beer pours a hazy, mild brown with a soft white head. A great caramelly hop aroma is followed by a slightly bitter, creamy taste when it hits your lips. It finishes with both sweet and sour notes and leaves a great aftertaste in your mouth. It's definitely among the best canned beers I've ever had."
Pours with an off white head that stays a good two fingers thick for most of the brew. Nice amounts of lace mark the glass. Very good looking hazy brownish orange color.
"Dark orange fading up to brown toward the top, meeting with an off-white head. Smells of pine, biscuit and some floral notes. Tastes very West Coast, hop forward, a tad intense. The citrus quickly gives way to pine before opening up to a peppery accompaniment to sweet malt. A piney resin remains on the tongue with a teensy bit of toasted oat. Fairly well balanced, even considering the initial onslaught. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full bodied, though perhaps not so shocking when taking into account the thickness of the Bender I had the prior eve. Very rich, wouldn't pick this as a warm weather quencher, but its lovely for a cold day watching hockey. I enjoy it, but the Furious assault of hops is wearing out my tongue, a little heavy for not being a dipa. Still nice and warming, and again, well balanced. Big thanks to mully for the can. I'm quite happy to have another waiting in the fridge."
The Scene: 
Poured from can into imperial pint glass.
Furious indeed...
"Poured from a 16oz can into an Imperial pint glass. Poured aggressively, resulting in a 2 finger head of rocky foam that lasts quite awhile. Cloudy and dark copper in color, it left great lacing on the glass. HUGE grapefruit nose initially that lasted throughout with a faint bready aroma. There is a pronounced fop flavor with lingering bitterness. A slight 'Tootsie Roll' taste in the background tries to balance out the prodigious hop flavor. The hop bitterness lingers well into the aftertaste. Medium in body, Furious is an outstanding beer that is hard to pick out flaws. I'll have another after I'm done writing and try to find some!"
Pours a murky mahogany in color. Slightly tan head that slowly vanishes to a scattered film. Lace just coats the inside of the glass. Nose is full of dark malts and aromatic and pine hops.
Appearance - Appears semi-hazy and opaque amber in my half-liter mug. Definitely not the palest IPA I've seen. The head retains very well.
16oz can received in trade from mully .. very nice trade if I do say so.. I must try the Raspberry Eisbocks sometime soon.. Tonight Steven and I are sampling the final Furious... Cheers Matt Thanks a bunch... Mine poured into my New Belgium Snifter.
Pours a dark ruby amber into my Nonic. Head rises a bit and settles quickly.
On cask(I'm pretty certain) at Winterfest 2/8/08 in St. Paul. A 3 oz. pour.
"1 pint can, contents poured into a Stone OG tulip glass"
Thanks to Scoobydank for this fine beer.Oh wait...
16 ounce can
1pt. can into half pint glass on 1/25/08. Thanks to BA Deuane for sharing.
I've been drinking this for awhile but just recently joined BA and thought I should review one of my local favorites.
"A- poured a pretty cloudy amber almost brown, had a huge fluffy head that slowly faded and left huge lacing."
Received in a trade from the very awesome and generous Younger35.
"Beer #11 in my 366 Days of Beer Quest, tasted on 1/11. Big thanks to esch for this one! I've heard a lot about this IPA, I'm excited. "
"Big props to Pitmonkey for the chance to drink this one. To begin with I've have heard ghost stories about the bitterness of this beer so I was expecting alot. And boy was I not dissappointed! It pours a beautiful deeply hazed brown/orange topped with a nice little fluffy head. The nose.. well the nose is intense. It smells very big. Like a handfull of Warrior pellet hops. Big and acidic and maybe some amonia too. The taste is way off balanced and I'm not complaining at all. I think there might be a touch of carmel malts, maybe. Who cares let me enjoy my hops. As the beer warms the nose matures more refined spicy piney hops. This beer is so good I would inject this beer into my veins and walk around all day with a drip but I wouldn't get to enjoy it as much. The Mecca for hopheads."
Wow I popped open the can (thanks MuenchenerKindl ) and the floral aroma just filled the room poured into my pint glass a nice cloudy orange brown with a full two fingers worth of head 
"Had this on tap at the Map Room awhile back side by side with a FFF Alpha King. It really makes the FFF taste like the Pale Ale it is rather than the IPA this is, wheras on its own the FFF always tasted super hoppy to me. This is much more so. Pours a slightly hazy amber with a head that fades to a cap that sticks around and generates some good lacing. Fruity aromas with lots of citrusy hops, including a good dose of pith-like smells. Tastes similar- big and bold with lots of citrusy hops, a lingering bitterness, and a brighter fruit finish with sweet citrus and cherry, and a slight hit of metal right at the end. Mouthfeel is slightly thick but not grainy or sweet. Just delicious and a pleasure to try this. I just wish the distribution were a little wider. Also, I love good beer in cans, so I'm glad they went that route for packaging. I'm sure it must hold up as well that way as on draft."
Big 2 finger head with excelletn retention. Cloudy amber color.
world-class IPA. I really need to get back up there and get some more!
16oz can
"Pouring from the can (strange to say can with a great bear like this) results in a glorious orange'ish color with a 1"" light tan head that fills an english pint glass to perfection. The aroma is of citrus and hops, it makes my mouth water! The first first taste that hits you are the hops, and then the sweetness of the malt creeps in..but not for long, the palate is left with a hop bitter that lasts for a while."
"A- Burnt orangeish, medium brown color. Non transparent. Head is 3/4"" off white head after a semi conservative pour. Lacing is very sticky all the way down the sides of the glass. Very unique color."
"Deep red body topped by an off-white head. Aroma is mostly American hops with a bit of malt background. Flavor is strong on hops. Not just bitterness, but nice pine and citrus flavor as well. Also strong malt notes of caramel and toasted malt. Mouthfeel is solid, perhaps a bit too strong on the carbonation. Drinkability is aso good. From the first drink to the last, this reminds me of Arrogant Bastard. Maybe a bit fresher take, but remarkably similar in inspiration."
On tap at Clark St. Ale House. The beer pours a totally opaque orange-amber with at least two fingers of creamy off-white carbonation that tracks lacing all over the walls of the glass. This is how IPAs are supposed to look.
On Tap @ Map Room
"Pours a hazy amber color with a tan head. In the aroma, grapefruity hops and a scottish ale malt. In the taste, sweet piney malt, scottich ale like. A slightly bitter mouthfeel and a piney malt aftertaste. A hoppy scotish ale? Interesting with the malt, tasty, feel bigger in ABV than really is though."
"Bought this at Surdyks in Minneapolis on a recent trip home to Minneapolis. Poured from a 16oz can into a Chimay chalice. Dark hazy amber color with a brown hue. One finger thick, light tan, dense head with good retention. Lots of sticky lace down the glass."
Appearance: Reddish orange with a nice foamy white-tan head. Leaves nice lace. 
Thanks to oakbluff for this one.
I got this can in a trade with leftmindedrighty. Thanks Aaron!
"Poured with a nice thick, creamy head with quite a few big bubbles and leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The color is a murky, golden copper."
"I was able to try this on tap at the Blue Nile. Served in a standard pint, the beer is a hazy dark bronze with a skim of off-white head. Nice lacing on the sides of the glass. "
"Pours an orangey brown with a huge sticky cream colored head. Unbelievably thick and sticky lace. The aroma is caramelized fruit, pine, well buttered toast. Superbly balanced flavors of toasted malts and piney hops. Perfect mouthfeel. Just big enough to not be watery, yet thin enough to be easy to drink. Really a fantastic beer."
"Deep brownish amber body hosts a slightly rocky off white head that leaves even lace as it fades. Nose is a very spicey, invigorating hop loaded party for the sences. Just a preview of what is to come. Enters the mouth with an initial short sweetness, but this quickly yields to the hop onslaught. Palate actually stays pretty even hop wise untill the finish when the grassy, sappy hops thru sharp and mouth bruising. It does mellow a bit as it warms a bit. Mouthfeel is very spicey hop laced. This one is nicely drinkable for lovers of hops."
Thanks to Eric Bart for hooking me up from his Twin Cities trip.
16oz. can served in a pint glass. A bit of a gusher when I opened it.
Surly- Furious
Cask at the Muddy Pig on Smoke release night. Nice surprise.
On cask at The Happy Gnome! 
"This is a fitting beer, because as I'm reviewing this, I'm waiting for a stupid phone operator. Thanks to bwatson for this brew! Furious is the only thing keeping me on an even keel."
Dont drive angry. I just have to say I love the tall boy wide mouth can. The pour was a clear coppery almost red color with a good head. Retention was good but did dissipate to the side of the glass.
"16oz can, received in a trade with tavernjef, served in a pint glass."
"On tap at MacKenzie's the day before Thanksgiving, just getting the review down..."
"Pours a 2 finger caramel brown head over a dark orange-brown liquid. Clingy with a few small streamers rising to the surface. Rough co-ho grassy. beneath is hoppy lemon, pine, winterfresh, oranges. The rough has an old sock quality about it."
Sampled from a fresh keg. 
Appearance: Fiery golden-orange-red with a dense light tan head. 
Acquired a 4-pack thanks to a friend who happened to be in Minneapolis for a day. Thanks also go to Chaz and other BAs who told me where he could pick it up. Poured a can into my Duvel tulip
"Pours a hazy amber. Pretty opaque stuff, can't really see through it. Attractive with an inch or so head that quickly settles down."
I've been drinking this stuff for well over a year - don't know why it's taken me this long to review it....
Thanks to leftmindedrighty for this very sought-after beer. I loved Bender and can't wait for my first taste of Furious.
an easy pour with a nice dark golden reddish hue. 
"16 ounce can acquired in a trade with scoobydank, thanks a lot for this great beer from Surly, I wish I had more"
"Pours brown with orange highlights and a thick khaki colored head. Citrusy hop aroma with sweet malt, caramel and toffee. The mouthfeel is medium-to-full-bodied and soft. Furious is malty and hoppy. Unique IPA simply for the different malts that were used. The taste is hoppy and citrusy upfront. There's a nice caramel maltiness midway that gives way to a piney bitterness. Scottish malts add an great touch to it and provide a feint peatiness to the finish."
Hand delivered from MN
"franksnbeans sent this one over along with a bottle of peche mortel, man what a trade."
"This beer pours a surprisingly slightly dark reddish brown color. It boasts a thick, fluffy light tan head. The head fades very slowly, leaving a huge lacing. "
Poured a dark brownish copper color with a small white head. Left very little lacing.
Sampled through the efforts of Imstillthegman and 1000 Miles (or East/West again) BIF.
"Had this can waiting for me on my porch after a long bike ride. I knew it was a package from vjslow and I expected it to contain Alpha Kong and 120 Minute IPA, the agreed upon trade. I find both of the afore mentioned beers plus a Seven Mules Kick-Ass Ale and 2, yes 2!, cans of Surly Furious. I have never had the beer, but I hear it is pretty good. Oh yes, it is very good, quite remarkable in fact. Easily the best beer I have ever had from a can, and possibly the best beer I have ever had, period."
"Sigh. This is what an IPA should be. Period. This and Dreadnaught. The others are just posers. It's like squeezing the oil out of a bushel of hops and injecting it directly into your veins. My god. Yet the bitterness is juuust barely balanced with some thick malty sweetness. It's not one dimensional like Ruination. I like Ruination, but i like the subtle balance of Furious better."
A: Pours a deep hazy copper with a finger's worth of foam. Nice sticky lacing.
Appearance: Pours a hazy dark amber color with a sturdy head that leaves shards of lace
"16oz can, my first surly beer not consumed at the great taste of the midwest - thanks nchrist13"
"This can sat outside the fridge for about 20 minutes, and once opened it exploded, resulting in froth all over the kitchen floor (not even my own kitchen floor, but all over msubulldog25's...yeah, I felt bad). After a bit of mopping up, the head pours soapy and sticky and huge, with voluminous lace forming as it drops. The color is a hazy caramel-copper. "
"Second session with this beer: May 19, 2009. Along with the impressions from my first meeting with Furious, the maltiness (Scottish?!) gives a flavor somewhere between sun-kist malts and fresh toast. The creamy body lightens at mid-palate for a silky smooth and ultimate refreshing beer. Always a pleasure. Thanks to Arvjunk for the trade!"
"Poured into a nonic. Very dark for an IPA, I'm expecting it to be malty. Head is tan and an inch tall. Lots of sticky lacing."
"A-Red brown, hazy appearance. Off-white to tan big head. retains well. Fals very slowly to a 1/4 inch covering that is quite lumpy and attractive. Very attractive lacing."
"Appearance: Dirty ruby-orange body with lots of carbonation and a head that just wont quit. The beige crown is exceptionally thick both in dimension and in density. This froth reminds me of a trick a Czech broad taught me years ago when I was staying with her in France. If one could balance a small coin, the pre-Euro Czech equivalent to the dime on the head of a beer for ten seconds, then the beer was good. Well this beer looks like its froth could balance a half dollar for a minute!"
"Thanks to barefootbrewer for my first can. Pours a murky copper with an almond colored head. Very nice looking in the glass...surprised this came from a can. Smell of faint pink grapefruit and scotch. Taste had a wonderful hop taste, delicately balanced by the malt. Very impressed. Again, faint pink grapefruit hop taste, with a dry semi-bitter finish. Really impressed by this beer...all the accolades seem to hold up. I'd like to line up the Furious next to Hop Rod Rye and Big Hoppy Monster next time..."
A: Bold red/amber colored body with a fluffy 1/2 off-white head. The body is crystal clear and looks great when held to the light. This is one of those beers that wears f*ck-me pants.
A- Pours a deep reddish brown with a 2 finger head that sticks around for quite a while and leaves a huge amount of lacing.
Pours a deep copper color with a smallish head that retains well and leaves lacing down the glass.
Served cold from a 16 oz can into Boston Lager glass.
a: a caramel color with about a half inch of head that doesnt dissapear fast leaving a lot of lacing stuck to the side of the glass
"Pours out a reddish brown color, almost purple. Creamy tan head leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Very nice floral scent eminating from this brew, syrupy. Some nice caramel malts get dominated by a killer bitter/floral hop mix. Citrus and pine elements as well. Creamy mouthfeel, the hops stick to your teeth. A hint of alcohol mixed in. A very good beer, try it out."
Thanks to leftmindedrighty for this one
"Thankyou tavernjef for making my beer dreams come true. Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a big ass can. Poured out a deep dark copper amber color that had a nice red tint to it when held up to the light. was topped off with about an inch of tannish whit head. Pretty good head retention, and tons of sticky lace left behind on the glass. Smell: Mouthwatering aromas of floral hops, sweet malts, and delicate citrus notes teamed up with a bit of pine and orange peel. Just a notch below perfect but damn close. Flavor in fact was perfect in my opinion. Nice smooth yeasty, malty, bread like flavors, and then a nice bitter hop rush that takes a bite out of the palate. Also citrus, pine, and a bit of grass. Very earthy. Just the right amount of carbonation, and very nicely balanced. Has a nice sticky, but smooth mouthfeel. I love how canned beers really showcase the hops. Awesomely drinkable. This now has to be my favorite IPA."
"Ok so I am finally able to get my hand on a CAN of this wonderful brew here. Why it took so long to get something, anything from Surly is a mystery to me, but what is even funnier is I ended up with two! So not only did I have one to try, but hopefully, if its good I have one to enjoy as well. So last night I figured it was about time to pop this one open, and had a nice long pur into my Phish glass."
"Thanks to franksnbeans for sending his last extra Furious my way. This beer shall be enjoyed in the memory of the late craft beer great, Michael Jackson."
"My brother brought me a 4-pack of this from Minneapolis a few weeks back, he's a very appreciated sibling. I first tried some at Dark Lord Day this year, and was looking forward to some full servings. Here goes:"
Surly Furious pours pours a stiff finger of tawny foam over a hazy
"My Third taste of surly in just a few days. Loved every offering and I was looking forward to this one! From the 16 oz can a dark orange cascading color forms a thick white head that lingers throughout. I was surprised at the creamy head that stuck around through the entire session. Smell is intoxicating with many different smells filling the nose. Piney, Citrus, malt. The taste is a balance of delicious pine, citrus hops with the smooth balance of the hand picked malt from Scotland. I have another favorite IPA now!"
"Got in a trade with Faro - many thanks! Poured from a 1 pint can into my pint glass. The back of the can had a blurb about the beer - did a good job describing the fury within. It was a cloudy reddish-orange with tons of carb bubbling up. It had a good light tan head that settled into a constant film. Heavy lacing. The aroma was hop attack with citric and pine. Could smell a little of the malt in the back but not the buttery toffee that some describe. The taste was also a hop attack. Very piney with a bitter, but not too bitter, aftertaste. It's listed as an AmIPA but I could easily see this as an ADIPA. The mouthfeel was creamy with an all out assault by the hops. Overall, a great beer and glad I got to try it. Only caveat for me is that it is so strong on hops that I'd really need to be in the mood for it before trying again. This is not a beer to just wipe out unless you are prepared for a ton of hop shredding. Highly recommend. (4, RB-OAY, T, Y, MBIM)"
"Pours a deep ruby orange with a good 3 fingers of ivory head that dies slower than normal and laces nicely. This already looks like a knockout. The smell blows my mind. Yes it smacks you with intense hops but the variety is wonderfully noticable along with very intense citrus. Piney, fresh grass and a hint of malt. This is not your average IPA. The taste makes my lower lip quiver and brings a tear to my eye. So many intense hops, citrus, grapefruit, some awesome malty balance with a bitter finish of perfection. Feels crisp and medium in the mouth wih perfect carbonation and has the drinkibility of an ultimate session beer. This brew smashes the IPA mold, a feat in itself, and opens my eyes to what a great beer is compared to a good beer. Minnesota BA's will be recieving a lot of mail from me in the future. This is a classic."
"I got this beer on recommendation from John Dennis of Dennis Brothers Liquors in Cottage Grove, MN. Comes in a 16oz. alumnium can. Pours a deep copper with a great light beige head in my pint glass. Pine hops and more pine hops welcome my nose. Solid malt body with very balanced bitterness. No harshness for 99 IBU's. Finishes with a great hop flourish. Great beer!"
Thanks to oakbluff for this gem!
"A darker colored IPA, more of a dark brownnish/burgundy color with a full, wispy head. Extremely fragrant hop nose, its extremely piney and sappy, also a bit medicinal and foresty. Hints of lemon and lime as well come from the sensational aroma. Sweeter and maltier than most IPAs, but with a lovely, fresh hop flavor. Awfully complex and well brewed. This is deserving of its high score."
A - Deep burnt orange/copper with a thick off white head and tons of sticky lacing.
"Ok, so I read all the recent hype about this beer. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical about it, so I decided to trade with Scoobydank. "
Many thanks to umustdrink for this beer.
"Been wanting to try a beer from these guys since reading the Bros review in BA Mag, and autumnaldave has hooked me up."
16oz can received via I Want That BIF from flexabull. Thanks for the opportunity. 
Big thanks to umustdrink for this one.
Im reviewing this beer twice because Ive now had it in the can and on draft (draft was definitely better).
Appearance:
This is a pretty good beer from a can. The best I've had since Dale's.
"Acquired via trade from ClockWorkOrange, so a big Thank you goes out to him. Poured from a 16oz. can into a US tumbler pint glass."
"The beer pours a hazy dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is excellent. It has a nice malt scent that boasts of pale, special roast, and bisquit malts along with a hell of a hop aroma that really blends well with the malts; well rounded. The taste is great! This is one hoppy beer. It starts off bitter, but balanced with the malts provided and then just explodes with hops in the finish. It's quite intense and leaves a residual hop taste in my mouth several minutes later. This is a true hop lovers beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. It's deceptively drinkable with loads of hop character."
Thanks to grassrootsVT for this treat. And thanks to the chain of beer traders who put this gem in his hands originally. 
Thanks to non BA Bob for bringing this north.
"I was a little skeptical about it coming from a can, but the sticky sweet smell emanating from the popped top was enough to open my mind."
"A: A murky, rusty dark amber with a thin, dissipating ivory head."
Poured a rich tea color with a hint of red. Nice big three finger frothey tan head. 
"From a 'Big Boy's' can, this fella pours a deep, dirty bronze that generates a thick white head that really holds and leaves good lace. Initially I'm feeling very positive about this selection."
"Pours with a frothy, initially two-finger thick, tan colored head. The beer is a brilliantly clear, dark amber color that shows amber-tinged copper color when held up to the light. The aroma as the expected, zesty hoppiness characteristic of American hops. Sweet citrus notes of lychee, bergamot, ruby-red grapefruit, and candied orange peel mix with a backdrop of pine and a light herbal character. A light maltiness finishes off the aroma with a touch of toasted malt, and a solid crusty bread character."
Thanks to brdc for the chance to try this one. Poured this 16 oz. can into a becker glass. No date. The body was a beautiful hazy amber color. The head was two fingers of oatmeal colored cream.
Poured a slightly hazy darker tea colored amber with better than a finger stiff light tan head that resists fading. Good amount of lacing present.
Special thanks to tavernjef for these cans of brew.
"A - Pours a dark red amber color, with an off-white head that recedes quickly"
"Can. Poured a cloudy amber color with a medium off-white head. Aroma of hops, pine, and citrus. Okay mouthfeel, but not nearly as nice as the Bender. Flavor is very hoppy and bitter (grapefruit-like), with pine-like aftertaste. Very nice beer. Love the canned beers from the Twin Cities! Wish they sold them locally."
Thanks to Faro for this can...part of my package from The Great BIF Race 2007.
"Clear, deep copper with a rich and abundant creamy light tan head that leaves a whole lot of lace."
A 16 oz can from a trade with JAYW.
Received in a trade from jeffkrenner. Mucho thanks goes out to him.
16 oz can poured into a chalice.
I've only seen Oskar Blues put good beer in cans...we'll see about this one.
"Pours slightly hazed copper with a thick, off-white, lasting head."
Revist: 24 Oct 17
"16oz can that I split with a friend on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The beer was a very dark amber-orange, almost brown. The head was decent and off-white. The taste was very bitter but delicious. Not much fruit flavor but I think I detected a small amount of pine. Overall, this was a pretty good beer."
"I split a couple of cans of this with Flyer and SurlySober, and I have to agree with the sentiment of Flyers review (below); this beer is agressively hopped, very bitter (99 IBUs according to the can), and quite dry. However, there wasnt a lot else to its flavor (no citrus, pine, grass, flowers, etc - all the other stuff that IPAs taste like). However, it was a very smooth 99 IBUs, if thats at all possible. Mouthfeel is quite smooth up-front, and the bitterness comes in slowly as the beer sits in your mouth and slides down your throat. I found this beer smooth but not quite to watery. The most drinkable very bitter beer that Ive yet tried, although I agree that it would have benefited from the addition of some other flavor notes."
"The deep orange-red color and creamy head probably raised my expectations, and this beer fell a little short of those. This is a pretty good IPA, but just didn't crack my top tier. It's very bitter, and I like bitterness when it's complemented by other hoppy flavor notes, but I didn't get a lot of those -- some grapefruit, maybe a little pine, maybe even a little lemon (?), but mostly just bitterness, over a solid malt backbone. A little bit of a one-trick pony."
"thanks to wankerweasel for this one. hands down the best beer i have ever had out of a can. was much darker in color than i expected-a deep, reddish brown. lots going on in the bouqet: roasty, toasty notes from the scottish malts, piney hops, toffee, nuts, and more that i can't recall due to being shlitzfaced yesterday. just a bit of residual malt sweetness but still plenty of malt backbone. medium to full-bodied mouthfeel. long, dry, bitter finish. brings a lot of flavor and body to the table for a beer of this abv, so plenty good in the drinkability dept."
"Thanks to my new BFF Akorsak for hooking me up with this as a trade, which he obtained from someone out at Dark Lord Day!! I've been waiting to savor this beer for a long time...so here it goes..."
"This is a good all around IPA, but I really don't see what all the hype is about here. I think it would make an excellent Scotish ale with the exception of the intense hops bitterness. Much better when not taking styles into consideration, but it is still not something I would rave about. I still want to see what the Darkness is all about, and I would love to get a proper sample of the Bender as well, as my previous Surly experience is limited to a 2 oz sample of Bender in a plastic cup."
"Pours from a great looking can, a bright clear amber color with a large head. Nice looking beer!"
"Oh, what a treat to have had this one, on cask at The Happy Gnome"
"16 oz. can. 6.2% ABV, 99 IBU. Dark copper and hazy appearance. Thick off-white rocky head. Great head retention, and a few patches of lace left on the glass."
"Thanks to WankerWeasel for sending me a box of these. Pours a very clear, brick-red/copper color, with a full head of soapy, tan foam. The head holds very well and leaves some thick lace giving it a solid overall appearance. The aroma is strong and hoppy. The hop nose is clean, grassy, and tangy with a toasted nut malt backbone. Not citrusy at all, more like an APA. "
Wow! A canned IPA?
16oz. can courtesy of JeffKrenner at DLD.
Very deep orange/amber appearance with a nice tan head. Very pleasant beer to look at. Nose contains a lot of citrus and very strong hop aroma. The taste ... very hoppy with a little bit of lemon zest. 
"Welp, good ol craft in a can. Excellent 99 IBU beer in a greener environment. Double win. Only small drawback  no canning date ;("
"A- About a 1"" tan head on a cloudy orange/red body."
Many thanks to tangfoot for this experience.
"Pours a dark blood red with an impressive tan head that sticks around for a while. Aroma is big hops with an emphasis on the pine and citrus. Taste is sweet carmel malts up front with earthy and citrus hops behind it to clean off the palate. Very nice taste. A bitter aftertaste lingers and gets a little on the nasty side which hurts the mouthfeel. My first drink of this I was thinking 5. After finishing the can, it's not quite there, but it's damn good."
Can courtesy of Sammy: Poured a deep dark brown color ale with huge dirty white foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of piney and citrus hops is huge and dominating the aroma. Taste is a mix between strong caramel and toffee malt with some sweetness balancing the strong piney and citrus hops. The ending is quite bitter as you can imagine but some subtle floral notes were providing more complexity which was appreciated. Body is full with some low filtration which was quite enjoyable.
"I tried beer at the Craft Brewers Conference in Austin. This was after having a few other beers that had some hops to them. This beer stood out from them all. 16 oz. Can. The beer pours hazy amber pine, citrus, and caramel. When you taste it there is a big hop bite at first that is followed by swirls of pine, orange, and sweet caramel malt flavors. Very nicely done beer. They named it well."
"16oz can with some badass artwork. I would love to see more brewers do these big cans, they're quite nice IMHO! Pours into my glass a deep amber orange with a nice pillowy white head on top. Pretty good clarity with plenty of carbonation. Lookin good. Aromas start off with some nice caramel malts and sweet candy scents. Big hops burst out with lots of citrus and pine all over the place. Lots 'o hop oils in this one with a definite grapefruit accent. Draws me in...."
"Exactly how beer should taste. It is simply the best beer I have tasted, and quite possibly the best in existence. I only gave it a 4.5 for smell, not because it doesn't smell amazing, it does, but I think Masala Mama, as the best smelling (and right after Furious in taste) smells slightly better. Stop reading my review and drink some Surly."
"Amber in colour with medium carbonation. Enormous American hop aromas with elements of mandarin orange, pink grapefruit, tangerine, black pepper, earth, and cut grass. The citrus fruit character is quite dominant in the mouth as well, but are balanced out nicely by a smooth, but not overly sweet or caramel-like, maltiness. Theres a bit more of a herbal/leafy touch on the back end, with some fairly assertive bitterness. All of the elements are in balance, but the intensity of all of the flavors are off the charts. An amazing beer!"
Poured a murky deep copper hue with a two finger creamy white head. There was good retention and very good sticky lacing.
"1 pint Can brought from Minneapolis by rudge75 and kindly passed along to me. Don't worry about Kris there Dave, he's got his own can at home!!"
"Never given a 5 to anything yet, this comes pretty close."
"Pours a murky amber copper, pretty dark for the style. Lots of lacing down the glass. Smell is an interesting hop combo. Somewhat piney, grapefruit, and some good malts to back it. Light caramel and bread. A very reserved nose for an IPA. Taste proves the nose wrong. Don't judge a beer by its smell. Big hops up front, quite bitter. Good moderate malt sweetness to follow. Finish is dry and bitter, quite dry in fact. Very easy brew to drink. A unique IPA, not like many others out there. I quite like it."
"This beer pours an amber, brown beer, darker than the average IPA. A steady stream of CO2 rises to the top to form a thick, creamy head which settles in half-way the glass."
"This is beautiful, surprisingly dark. Sort of a honey-amber body with a light, off-white head. Nice lacing left behind and a ring of head that lasts all the way to the end."
Thanks to Akorsak for hookin me up with a can of this exceptional IPA!
Furious pours a pleasing red-orange color with a rocky off-white head about two fingers tall. The head falls to about an eighth of an inch and leaves some nice lacing.
03/11/07- Received in a trade with BA member Truthbrew.
"A crisp fresh salt of pungent hop kicks my nostrils into gear. Wowzer. Cascade citrus orange peels meld with bright lemony hop resins and a nip of pine. A wonderful quaf of floral and citrus, with rising heat and a nip of malt caramels in the nose. Pours a crystal clear ruddy amber, with sunset fire fringe. Foamed with creamy tan sticky lacing, sheeting the glass and floating high. On the tongue a deft hand of hops, with articulate loblolly pine resins, burning red pine sap and a whole bouquet of floral orgasm. The hop flavors are right there, as if off the vine. So fresh and ripe. Scarcely does an IPA seem to hold onto the crisp resins and hop sugars as this beer does. Maintaining a biting alcohol-fueled hop frenzy in the middle, this is a bitter beer, but only in a good west coast cacophony. Luscious, wet and sappy. This is a damn fine IPA. The malt backbone kicks in with light caramels, sweet maple syrup and drying raisin bread. A top IPA for sure. I do think that the canning has helped preserve this beers better qualities and many have said that it doesnt differ from the tap version all that much."
No best by date. 
Cans...gotta love 'em...tall boys of beer should be a standard...
Big thanks to JeffKrenner for hooking me up with some Surly.
"Poured from a 16oz ""tall boy"" can into two 20oz imperial pints. Thanks to Killer for the assist. Extra special thanks to JeffKrenner for the MN hookup. I owe you brother!"
"Poured from a big can to a pint glass. The liquid is a over whelming Red with great carbonation. The head is 3 fingers off white and creamy. It fades leaving nice lace, What a great looking brew."
Poured a brilliant clear copper into my glass with almost no head.
"My first ""non-macro"" canned beer, a 16 oz. poured to an imperial pint glass (the rarely used ""Bermuda Triangle Brewing"" one). ""Beer for a glass, from a can."" 6.2% ABV, 99 IBU's."
"appearance: 16oz. non-nitro can. Intense red/black reversible graphics can be read sideways, upside down, right side up, or in fixed gear bicycle crash whilst neck deep in a slow-motion apocalypse. Ultra thick meringue-like head of foam. Even non-Jesus type beings could walk on this liquid crown of glory. Multi-layered belgian lacing assimilating the sides my imperial pint glass molecules. Fasten your seat-belts ladies and gentlemen. This is gonna be one hell of a ride."
many thanks to beckje01 for this trade
Thanks NorthYorkSammy!
"Cans! Pours a clear red/brown, thick off white head, nice lacing, good retention. Smell is wow. Ass ton of hops, big citrus and floral, toffee, grapefruit, flowery, some pine, very hoppy. Taste is nice toffee up front, varied hop blast, lots of pine, citrus and grapefruit, unbalanced in a beautiful way although IBU's are a big too high. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, crazy bitter, I enjoyed it. Thanks northyorksammy!"
"A- Poured a hazy light amber, nice 2 finger head.Light carbonation level- the can was a little soft before it was opened."
"Whoah!!! I'm starting to like this brewery! Citrus and pine wrapped up in a wide-threaded deep caramel satchet that's ready to go wherever you are! Great beer, great design, and I love the fact that it's in a can! That said..."
"On tap at The Gunflint Tavern in Grand Marais, MN."
A - Big head. Amber hue.
"pours out of the growler a slightly hazy dark bronze. ample head dies down to a skimming sheet. lots of lacing...looks like a beer should when drank...rings aplenty. intense hop aroma, but lots of sweet doughy malts to offset the pine and citrus. quite inviting. the taste is all massive chewy citrusy hop madness. like a stick of that thirst quenching chewing gum. my saliva glands are just going nuts. lots of piney bitterness, too. and lingering bitterness. this ""imperial amber"" or ""india red pale ale"" has all the bases covered when it comes to hoppy goodness. 100 IBU's and it's all that for sure. the malt base stands up meekly, but respectively...sweet and syrupy, just enough to further the furious hop onslaught. there is an alcohol spice, cleverly intertwined in the bitter mushroom cloud of hop heaven. the body seems huge, the mouthfeel is all about the assault on the tongue of the spine tingling hop profile....holy cripes. i love this beer...it's hoppy as hell and definitely over the top a bit. drinkability has to suffer a bit just because it's so gargantuan in the hop profile."
"Burnt orange colour and a little cloudy, the pour produced a thin cap of tiny bubbles. The aroma was crammed full of pine resin and grapefruit rind, backed up by some tangerine, but a bit of caramel appeared as it warmed. Scorching bitterness, little balance was all I thought on my first sip and things really didn't change. The hop flavour was very resinous with some citrus character, and there was just a faint caramel sweetness that was inadequate to tame the bitterness. A bit of alcohol was present too. Medium/light bodied with average (and appropriate) carbonation and a dry hop finish. There just isn't enough of a malt backbone here to support the bittering hop charge in this beer. Quite harsh - not a complete disaster for me, but not something that I really enjoyed. Thanks for sharing northyorksammy!"
Served from a 16 ounce can into an imperial pint glass. Poured out a hazy orange tangerine colour with a very large creamy head.
16oz can received in a trade with RobertDwight
"I enjoyed a couple of free pours at a special event at Acadia Cafe. The beer pours a nice, copper-orange color with a huge creamy head that very slowly dissipates into nice lacing. The aroma is huge... grapefruit, punch, pine, citrus. Very nice. The Amarilo and Simcoe really shine here. The flavor is surprisingly well-balanced for a beer of this caliber. Again, more sweet malt backed up by a nice, floral hop presence. More citrus and punch. Damn. This is THE beer I've always wanted to brew. The mouthfeel is just plain smooth... almost creamy thanks to the hand pump. Drinkability? I had two and would have happily consumed more if needed. :) Sadly, the pin ran dry. Watch out for this one. You won't see it every week, but if you have the chance, enjoy it."
"It's a rising brewery, this is a good American style IPA, but what's the fuss? Unbalanced, can-conditioned, great aroma c-hoppy with bubbly head and grapefruity body, carbonation and mouthfeel average. A hophead feed, but I have had higher IBU that is more drinkable."
"pre-holiday tasting at my place attended by me, DrJay, Viggo, biegaman, and northyorksammy. northyorksammy contributed this bottle. thanks sammy!"
Thanks to zrrbrrt for this one...real excited to see Surly pumping out a few canned offerings.
"Wow-the smell of this beer is something like I'd imagine an orange orchard growing in the middle of a Swiss meadow to be. Overpowering, flowery hop smell along with pungent, fruity cirtrus accompaniment. It appears the solid, ruddy yellow tan of a nice IPA, with a pillowy, inviting yellowish head. The taste is a thirst-quenching molestation of the inside of your mouth, like somebody is throwing a bitter snuggle party - and hops & the sides of your tongue are invited. Heavily carbonated; perhaps a minor negative, as there was almost a slight champagnelike character. But the full mouthfeel and rolling bitterness leaves you little doubt as to the school of alcohol your imbibing. Clean, dry finish. It was a 16-oz can (here's to hoping they start bottling this sucker), and the alcohol content snuck up on me a bit. Maybe it was the beer talking, but I was wanting another. Well done, Surly! If you're into IPA, this is what you really hope for when you try a new one."
This 16 oz can of Surly Furious poured a slightly hazy (though not bad for 99ibus and a ton of flavor & aroma hops) copper to red and had a fluffy off white head which dissipated slowly leaving traces of lacing on the glass. 
Received in trade from feloniusmonk. This one has been lurking in the fridge for over a week. It's funny how I have been conditioned to keep canned beer cold....sat at room temperature for about 90 minutes. Poured into my Duvel tulip.
Thanks to zrrbrrt to introducing me to this one. 
Thanks to MeLikeBeer for this one.
"Rustic orange-butterscotch with a gorgeous infusion of sunset coral red when backlit. A few stray bubbles rise slowly through the hop dust haze to plonk into the underside of a heavily cream cap of pastel caramel foam. Although it isn't quite a lace monster, the array of abstract patterned lace definitely qualifies as eye candy."
"Presentation: 16 fluid ounce, 1 US Pint Can which stands about 6 tall. Metallic silver, red and a black angulated design decorate its sleeve. Listed at 6.2% Alc/Vol and 99 IBUs. No freshness date. Listed as Furious Beer."
"This beer is all hops, all the time. Amber body with an off-white head and lacing. Smells of citrus grapefruit with pine and melon. Although the taste isn't the most complex I've had (that's not to say it isn't complex) but it's very long-lasting. Again, more grapefruit, pine and similar citrus flavor. This beer is a must for hop heads."
This beer comes to me as part of BC-2. A big thank you is in order to bax72. This beer comes in a can. You will be tempted to drink it out of the can. Drinking this out of the can would be a waste of good beer. The beer was served in a pub glass.
I am furious... and don't call me Surly.
"16 oz can, no freshness date, poured into a pint glass"
"Oh man, i love this IPA. (thanks to beckje01 for the trade)"
Awesome fresh aroma of citrus and pine along with some tobacco....a bit of a toasty maltiness is also evident
Another great beer from JeffKrenner
"From the can the liquid pours a beautiful dark copper-tawny ruby color. Impressive faintly beige head, at the apex there was easily two fingers of foam. Head retention was awesome, the bubbles very slowly faded to a chunky, soapy cap. The subsequent lacing was somewhat spotty and unorganized. Overall, this is a lovely beer to look at. "
Furious 16oz can from the Liquor Barrel in Golden Valley.
"This brew pours a hazy blood red color which fades to golden-orange around the edges of the glass. The head is a massive three-fingers in height, and recedes very slowly into thick lacing. The aroma screams hops. Pine, citrus are everywhere; so much so that it reminds me of a DIPA. The taste is more bitter than any other IPA I have had. The sip starts of with citrus then morphs into pine leaving a rich aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a great IPA. If only I could get Surly down here in Rochester, it would cetainly take over the spot in my fridge that is usually occupied my Bell's Two Hearted Ale, or Sand Creek's Wild Ride."
"Pours copper in color with a creamy off-white head. It leaves a good amount of lacing when sipped down. The aroma is of juicy, citric hops, grapefruit, with a toasted malt backbone. "
Well...I just had Furious. At home. 
"On tap at The Muddy Pig. Coppery-orange in color with a nice fluffy white head. Smell was very hoppy, with some medium sweet malts. Lots of grapefruit in the taste, and initialy, the bitterness was supprisingly low (which is not to say it wasnt hoppy), but a few sips in the bitter aftertaste became assertive and lingering. Sweeter malts were present initially, quickly gave way to the intense and complex hop flavors. Mouthfeel was medium, with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was medium as well, and I say this only because I'm not a huge hop head, and I can only do so much IPA in one sitting."
"This is the second time I've visited St. Paul and tried this beer. I had this on tap at the Muddy Pig and it was much smoother than the last time I had it back in May when it seemed almost undrinkably out of balance. This is one heck of a hop bomb for sure, with a huge blast of piney hops and more hops and more hops through to the finish. Piney, citrusy and fruity hops that come in waves and give their own kind of buzz apart from the alcohol in this beer. I believe that hops, in the right quantity, can be intoxicating. This beer is proof of that theory. The malt in this beer merely is a foundation for the hops and to keep the beer drinkable so that you can have more than just one. If you're a hophead, you need to seek out this beer."
"Enjoyed at the brewery before, during, and after a tour. Awesome time, by the way. Golden orange with a crimson edge. Dense, long-lasting cushion of bright, off-white head. Nose is a refreshing blast of PNW hop air. Citrusy, intoxicatingly bitter, and floral too. A scant hint of malt, but I don't care. I love hops. Taste follows suit; big--no, huge--hop profile. Fresh, herbal, citrusy, bitter, numbing. Malt is there, playing third fiddle. The hoppiest regularly-brewed beer in the state? I think so. Mouthfeel is creamy, moderate bodied, with a dry finish. Very good."
On tap at Old Chicago in Eagan.
"Geez Louise is this beer gettin' the reviews! I was expecting a BubbleJack easy goin' grease-beater and instead I get WHOOPED on the head ugly-stick style with hops, hops, and a great big can of Pineapple (sans the syrupy gunk that fills up the can.) Big hops on the nose . . . swear I could smell this as it was being tapped, and I was outside on the patio! Cascades and Amarillo? Simcoe and Chinook? Pushpins and pineapple and Ticky-tacky? Aww banana oil, all I know is for such a hop-bomb this is surprisingly well-balanced, with just enough juicy malt to keep the juicy hops in place (I was reminded of the Avery IPA, a personal fave . . . take that as a compliment, guys!) I will say that this beer ain't for everybody but if you eat sleep and dream hops it IS for you. One last thought: Golden Promise malt seems to be buried by the hops - Give 'em an A for effort anyways. This beer almost makes me wanna buy the tee-shirt, swear ta God . . ."
Consumed at the brewery open house May 13.
"Damn, this is a good beer. It has a nice amber/coppery appearance, deeper and cloudier than your typical IPA. The girl at the bar I ordered it from said, ""you know this is really hoppy right?"" and I said ""Sweet, bring it on."" She was right, and I wasn't kidding. Upon smelling this beer you can tell it's citrusy and fruity, but upon tasting it there is a flavor explosion. The grapefruit-like and strong floral aroma/taste work well with the cloudy and sweet malt. It reminds me a lot of beers that have simcoe hops in them, this might too, I havn't seen a list of the hops yet. I might be understating this but the flavor is quite pungent, which reduces the drinkability a bit, but damn, this is a good beer."
What an apt name for such an unruly beer.
"This is one Hoppy son of a bitch. Enjoyed my most recent last evening at the Old Chicago in Blaine. Guy across the bar said his was the worst beer he ever tasted. Paul and I in unison responded, ""Its not for everybody!"" LOL"
"This beer is categorized as an american amber / red ale, but this is the most IPA-tasting american amber / red ale I've had to date. It reminds me of all the great qualities of SN Celebration Ale, but it goes further in every way--better taste, better color, more intense nose. Lordy, is this a great beer. "
"Slightly hazed copper. Thin creamy ivory white head that is quite dense. Retention is very good. Lost of nice looking lace is left behind on the glass. Really nice aroma. Fresh lemon zest, grapefruit and other bright citrusy goodness. Underneath lies a nice toasted malt quality. The mouthfeel is creamy. The beer's medium bodied. Alcohol traits are absent. The flavor is nicely balanced. Tilts toward the hoppy side though. Brightly citric with grapefruit pulp and pine sap noted. Nice little lingering bitterness. Hop qualities are quite juicy. And there's some caramel and toffee based malt characteristics giving this beer a foundation underneath. This is quite good, but in my world, it's more of an Extra Pale Ale or IPA than an amber. But hey, that's just me!! What matters is that it's a damn nice brew."
"On-tap at the Happy Gnome: Cloudy rust with dark honey highlights. Smooth, firm topping of lighly stained brown foam. Out of two pints I had, one was slim, one was a finger high. Tons of layered lacing score the glass with heavy sheeted rings."
On draft at the Happy Gnome
"On tap at the Happy Gnome, St. Paul, MN..."
"This is one of two beers brewed by a brand new brewery in the Twin Cities, and I must say, I am impressed. This pours a slightly opaque reddish amber, with a half-inch whitish head and substantial lacing on the glass. A slightly hoppy smell does not adequately prepare one for the incredible citrussy hop flavor. There is plentiful malt backing, which helps to provide this brew's fine balance, but it is the hops which take center stage. Along with the bitterness, one can taste a juicy grapefruit flavor, which dazzles the tongue. This is very easy to drink if you love hoppy brews. I can hardly wait till they bottle it. A fine effort!"
"There will be quibbles, arguments, teeth-gnashing, and bare-fisted brawling over the style choice, but I am going with what the brewers lean towards, although they admit it's not quite an ""amber ale"" like any other. There was talking of calling it an IRA, or ""Imperial Red Ale"", a humorous reference to violence in Ireland, but I'm glad they didn't."
"Hazy golden color. Aroma has dough notes with some grassy and floral hops. Taste is balanced, a bit acrid, dry, astringent. Decent but not Tree House level."
"this was super clean and crisp... some citrus peel and grapefruit notes, a mellow sweet and bready malt profile balances it out and the mothfeel is very soft. smooth easy drinker!"
Poured on draft at the brewery. 
"Pours a clouded, bright to golden yellow color with a froth, huge white head."
"This beer almost goes orange. The nose is melon, tropical and juicy bubble gum. Flavor is similar but with significant citrus in the finish. The dry bitterness is a welcome change from done juice bombs."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a big fluffy white head. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of honeydew, melon, bubblegum, and grapefruit. It tastes of honeydew, melon, bubblegum, and grapefruit. The mouthfeel is medium light. This is another excellent IPA from Tree House."

"Drank a few of these over the course of the weekend. Typical hazy brew, slightly darker than your average (say Green or Haze), lots of dark orange. Flavor and aroma is definitely mosaic dominant, lots of dankness and floral notes. Citrus from the citra. Some malt sweetness. It's a solid beer, easy to drink, but I've had better Curiosities."
L - pours a bit on the dark side for a TH brew. Ruminating orange and a buoyantly fluffy head. 
"hazy, neipa"
"The look is hazy, typical NEIPA."
"Picked up at Brewery a few hours ago. Hazy orange honey color with nice fluffy head. HUGE tropical nose - peach, mango, passion fruit, a little pineapple at the end. Taste same as nose - tons of tropical love. A little orange juice and a little bit more of a bitter hop kick at the end than the standard TH IPA. Mouth feel - standard TH IPA soft silk. "
"Just got this from the brewery 10 minutes ago, canned and released today."
"Pours a hazy light golden color, like watered down orange juice. Weak nose, faint orange, citrus, sharp pungent aroma. Very hop forward, not a lot in the malt department. Sharp and crisp, loads of mango, papaya, pineapple, orange, lemon. Big mixture of citrus and tropical flavors. Crisp and refreshing, nicely carbonated. Overall this is a very drinkable IPA, just not my style (tastes overly dry hopped)."
01/03/17 stamped on the bottom of a tall can
Poured from can. Dark golden color. Hazy. Not getting much nose. Taste is thick and juicy. Slightest linger on the tongue.
"A: Chalky gold to start. Starts to glow over time, burst of orange more and more apparent. Creamy off-white white. Frothy, whispy lacing. "
"Deep muddied gold, opaque, topped with an ivory head of foam. Aromas and flavors of dank orange citrus pith, has earthy and musky undertones with brighter points of tangy juice. Medium-light weight and feel, smooth with a slowly gripping bitterness. Moderate sweetness and soft carbonation. Spot-on for a Citra IPA. 3/10/17 canning."
Poured a nice hazy orange color with a white head
"On tap at Other Half Brewing in Brooklyn, NY."
Poured from a 32 oz growler into a tulip glass. 
Poured from the can into an Other Half tulip glass.
"Picked this up Saturday along with the other releases, having never had this before and psyched to see the date on the bottom as 2/26. After also having the Equinox and the Simcoe single-hop IPA's from Other Half, it's obvious that this easily surpassed them when it came to the taste, mouthfeel, and overall enjoyment that I felt when crushi-er, drinking this today after last night's slow-as-molasses shift at work!"
Pour at Other Half.
"On tap at The Jeffrey during Other Half tap takeover. This is, not surprisingly, one of the best Other Half single hops I have had. It is hard to go wrong with Citra, but Other Half did a really nice job with this one."
"Poured from can into tulip. Canned 9/25, drinking on 11/02. I let one mellow, but this one was a bit better fresh. A tangerine orange hazy body. No head but some lacing. Some nice fruity aromas, grapefruit, pineapple. Taste matches. Good beer, solid example of the Citra hop, although I've had better. Most notable HF double Citra which is pure candy and incredible."
"Poured a 16 oz. can into a tulip glass. Pours a light golden cloudy color with a very thin white head that disappates quickly and does not cling to the glass. Aroma is Pure Citra, my favorite hop! Citrus, grapefruit, kiwi tropical hints hits the nose. Taste is a little bit subdued, was hoping for more of a powerful Citra hop taste but still very good. Can't believe it's 7% ABV. Mouthfeel is very crisp and light but not enough head and a little too light. Overall an excellent offering although I enjoyed Otherhalfs Amarillo more as well as Kanes Citra which may be my favorite beer!"
"16 oz can. Pours hazy yellow gold, thin head fades quickly. Mild citrusy aroma. Taste is hop forward with light malt backbone. Grapefruit and lemony citrus peel is dominant up front, with pine and a touch of earthiness in the finish. Thin but soft mouthfeel. Very easy drinking, clean, light bodied hoppiness, drinks lighter than the abv, dangerous. Glad to get to try this one."
"What a great way to showcase citra hops. The pour is an awesome shiny bright yellow that glimmers in the light, with a nice murkyness to it. The nose is ok, not as amazing as I've smelt from other single hop citra's before, but acceptable. The real remarkable part of this beer is the taste. Wow, this is the best representation of the different flavors citra can impart. The first thing to hit your palate is a melange of citrus, and it is in your face and wonderful, followed by a crescendo to a limey bitterness that eventually turns into nice pine trees. Covers the whole realm of flavors that comes from citra. Nice creamy mouth coating but still crushable feel."
"Wow. Tgis may be my favorite OH brew after AGE. The flavor has that dank effect you excpect from the Citra hops, but it also is bursting with mango, guava and citrus. Might be my favorite citra only IPA so far."
"Very aromatic - popped the can and an orchard emerged from the can. Primarily citrusy; I don't get much grain, much herbaceousness. Head leaves little lacing though the foam cap sticks around for a while. Flavor lacks depth, moderate bitterness. Flavor and feel are quite light, reminscent more of a session IPA than a regular. Solid but not superlative."
16 oz. can poured into a snifter. Hazy pale yellow. Medium white head. Doughy malt and citrus hop aroma. Simple and very nice. Taste is lightly sweet. Surprisingly dank. Medium body. Well carbonated. Excellent.
Poured out of can. Very hazy and orange look to it. Great smell. Taste of grapefruit to start with a nice piney finish. Has a nice bitter bite. A really good IPA.
"L: beautiful hazy glowing orange with a nice creamy 1"" head that fades with some lacing. S: heavy notes of citrus and fruity esters. Huge guava, pineapple and grapefruit. T: starts off with a bitter pithy grapefruit that is traced by a harsh bitterness and a hint of booze (the next can i had was smooth and no booze flavors at all). M: crisp and smooth. Perfect carbonation. Slight bite from the bitterness. O: another amazing offering from Other Half. Not quite as amazing as their Mosaic IPA, but damn close. I'll have this any time."
Poured from fresh growler into tulip.
9/25 can
Look is hazy orange with slight Amber highlights. 
"Other Half did this single hop RIGHT. Got them fresh from the brewery at their Saturday can release. in a glass, it is a hazy, beautiful lighter orange/yellow color with a head that retains pretty well. smell is straight citrusy orange goodness. the taste matches the smell, and then some! not light and balanced like your typical IPA, but thats the correct way to do a single hop. they showcase the Citra hop extremely well. slight malt backbone to finish off the fruity taste and carbonation was perfect. even the cans are dope looking! cant wait to try more of their single hop series because they truly know how to put single hops up on their own pretty little pedestal!"
"Pulled up the overall here because I love the citra hop profile. Orangey pour, and the malt backing masks the bitterness. Well balanced, and very smooth."
"slightly thin on the taste, that has to be my only complaint. awesome unfiltered look, reminds me of Trillium goodness, the smell is heavenly, lots of orange juice on the nose. Taste and feel is a bit thin and muted, I feel like they could go bigger here but overall a great IPA, nothing to be taken lightly, this is a really awesome beer."
"A very good citra IPA, which is my preferred style for these. Good clean finish, not too malty or bitter. Much like the New England IPAs. Lacks a little on the nose but makes up for that in crush ability. Very good, would be happy to drink more."
Thanks to mrbubbler for sharing this one at his tasting.

Canned 4/21/15
"Beauty of a pour with a hazy straw gold color. Nose is hoppy, sweet, pungent and floral. "
Doesn't really smell very strongly of hops.
This is quite the refreshing IPA! The Citra hop has always been one of my favorites as it's not an aggressively bitter varietal. Very easy to drink! I wish I could by more! Thanks Jammery for the hookup!
"Super fresh and juicy. Can't find anything wrong with this whatsoever. Lots of citrus... pineapple, mango, peach etc. completely quaffable and enjoyable."
Can shared by Lunch. Thanks Paul.
"This was a very disappointing beer. I had high hopes for it as I heard a lot of great things about it and had tried green diamonds prior and thought that was amazing. This was very far from that experience. The taste reminded me more of a pale ale then an IPA. It seemed very flat. Was not bursting with particular flavors or aromas, and had no hoppy bite at the end. Without atleast 1 of those 2 characteristics, the beer just seems like just another. ."
"Smells good, tastes okay. Liked more than Nelson but not crazy about either."
The beer comes in a golden yellow with a touch of orange.
16oz can (4/21/15) into a Heady Topper stemless pint. 
swung by the tasting room this morning to grab the fresh cans...enjoyed from an OH green diamonds snifter
"So after hearing much hype, had two of these on tap at Blind Tiger Ale House in NYC. Color was typical orange/gold with a white sticky head. Aroma wasn't too strong, but I don't have the best nose."
"I hate writing reviews for Other Half, because I don't want too many people to catch on."
From 06/09/14 notes. Had a 16oz. pour of this in a tulip at Fools Gold in NYC.
"Had 3 different growlers of Other Half stuff this weekend and rated them in this order : Hop Showers , Galaxy IPA, and Citra IPA. Very happy we have a local brewery who knows how to make excellent IPAs."
"I'm not an ""identify every little subtle flavor and try to cleverly describe it to the masses"" kind of guy. I am a guy who is fully on-board the ""modern"" citrus-driven west coast style IPA train though, and coming from that place I am happy to report that this is my new favorite NYC local beer. "
"Wow. Citrus is fantastic but not at all overwhelming. Delicious, strong flavor (not overpowering). Delightful (but not weak in a weak way). A hop taste like I never had before. There was an beautiful sniff with each and every sip. I would recommend this beer to all."
You had this beer. 
"Had this on cask, not bad actually. "
Fresh at Stone today. Deliciously dank and hoppy.
"Poured into a small chalice a nice clear golden dark yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a small off white creamy head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with a slight malt note, nice citrus and piney notes. The taste is very nice, hoppy with a nice blend of malts, with some citrus/pines. Medium body, chewy, with a nice dry/bitter finish, the ABV is hidden very very well. Overall, a very nice brew."
"On tap at the 2014 Most Arrogant Bar Bash (Barleys in Greenvillle, SC) "
"This one was double dry hopped with Motueka hops and part of a tap takeover at Tap + Bottle in Tucson, Ariz."
"Had this on-tap at Barley's in Greeneville, South Carolina during an IPA event they were having. Wow! I loved this beer! A very nice pour. Amber with a very nice head that leaves near perfect rings of lacing after each sip. Smells a bit grainy, but with some nice pine notes becoming more present as it warms. The taste just explodes with pine- very resinous and dry, with a long spicy finish- just awesome. I expected some graininess in the mouthfeel after the aromas, but I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth but firm feel of the beer. A great beer that really shows what dry hopping can accomplish."
Picked up a growler at the Stone Liberty Station Store last Saturday for $15.74.
A-Pours a rather dark copper. Nearly zero head. Nearly zero lacing.
Growler from FreeBridge.
Scored at brewery one week ago.
"On tap at the Better Weather Fest at Golden Road Brewing in Los Angeles, CA."
I had this on-tap at Max's. Poured into a standard pint glass.
Growler poured into a pint glass. 
"Citrusy. The hops taste very fresh and very bright. I'm not a big fan of the normal IPA, too basic for my tastebuds, but this was definitely a treat. I had this with a bunch of other Stone hop bombs at the Stone Tap Takeover at 1702 in Tucson, AZ. I liked the double dry-hopped Ruination more than this but I liked this more than the 10th Anniversary Ruination (which is saying a lot)."
Served on tap in a 10 oz pint glass
"On tap at Tribes Alehouse & Grill - Mokena, IL"
"A: Crystal clear. Golden pale yellow body. Bubbly white head, thin yet lively. "
On-tap at Salty Pig in Boston (if you live in Boston and love Stone this is a great place to go- it seems like they always have something fairly rare on tap from them). Bartender said this was just tapped last night. Served in a tulip glass.
"The beer pours a nice opaque golden orange color with a nice 2 finger white head, excellent retention and lacing. The aroma is fierce and huge with an in your face assault of hops, it's beautiful. Citrus and pine and floral and extremely hop forward, to the point that the base malt isn't even in the picture. May be the best aroma I've ever experienced. Terrific. The flavor follows suit though presents the malt base in a more prominent fashion. A biscuit cereal grain flavor as the base from which the hops grow and dominate, actually fairly well balanced and approachable, extremely enjoyable. The hop flavors are outstanding. Extremely good. Medium bitter. The beer finishes with a light 2-row malt flavor and huge hop character. Overall, this is hop-forward and aggressive and excellent. Highly recommended."
"64oz growler courtesy of Mjmoon15 in a great recent trade. Poured into a Duvel tulip. Been looking for this one for a long, long time. Hope it lives up to my own internal hype."
I believe this is the version that I had at the Pony Bar on 12/15.
"Pours a beautiful hazed out orangish hue that held to the light appears lemon colored, A pillowy white head leaves sheets of lacing."
Stone Brew 
"Copper colored with a thick and firm white head that lingers long, even after many sips. Aroma of bright floral and citrus hops. Luscious flavors of floral and citrus hops, moving to a piney finish. Subtle malt flavor provides a good balance. Hops dominate without lending too much bitterness. A very flavorful beer. Even mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a tingly finish."
I recently had a couple of glasses of this at one of my favorite pubs. This is one of the better ipa's I've had in a long time and a little less extreme than what most have come to expect from this brewery.
Poured into a pint glass on IPA day!

Poured into a tall pint glass on draft at the ColLAboration event in Hollywood.
"Delicious...the first Stone DDH i tried. Intensely hoppy nose almost lets you taste the beer from smelling it; Very aromatic...floral, almost pot like. Knew it was going to be great from the first smell."
Poured from a growler into a tulip pint glass.
Poured into goblet...
pour was a light hazy golden yellow with a light foamy head. 
"Appearance: Very light orange, looks nice and malty"
"Stone gives a resiny facelift to the ever-sturdy IPA by infusing more hops- more bitterness, more flavor, and more aroma. It's everything you like in a world class IPA, just more."
"Filled up my growler for the second time on a recent trip to Stone. Pours a slightly hazy gold in color with thick white, rocky head. Good lacing and retention. Smell was amazing, a true West Coast IPA. Citrusy hops abundant with some flowers, a little sweet malt and fruit. Taste, in my opinion, wasn't as exciting as the aroma. It was great but the aroma seemed more complex. Taste has a very pineapple element to it with some more bitter hops than it seems in other Stone brews. Nothing wrong with this but it almost seemed a little more mellow than their regular IPA, perhaps its just the melding of the flavors. Mouthfeel was fine, smooth and a little oily. Overall a great beer and glad I got to experience it. I should note this was in my car for 2 days before drinking. Never in any sunlight and the carbonation still seemed good when I opened so I think it survived the trip ok, I had no complaints!"
Thanks to my main suitcase carrying man!
Pours cloudy gold orange in color with a creamy / cloudy off white head that faded very slowly and stuck to the glass leaving great lacing and a creamy ring around the top of the brew after the head fades; another good looking IPA from Stone. 
Picked up a growler three days ago at the brewery and split it with my roommate (JustinA1) last night.
"On-tap at Beachwood BBQ,"
"On tap left over from the Legendary Duckworth's Stone Total Tap Takeover in October 2010. Poured into a proper pint glass for the low price of I do believe $6. I have had this before and it has been good, but this time it simply blew me away."
"Stone IPA Double Dry Hopped on tap at Alewife in Baltimore, MD, served in a 12-oz specialty glass. "
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured golden yellow with a minimal pure white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of malt and massive pine hop. The flavor was of malt and a light pine/citrus hop. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Ovearll this was a very nice addition to an already good IPA. Made a very nice difference from the original. The aroma was awesome for any IPA fan with the massive hops kicking you in the face, but on the flavor it is toned down to give you a very nice balance. Very nice."
"WOW. Actually liked this one better than the double dry hopped ruination. Pours a clear amber with a one finger off white head that dissipates in a minute or two. Leaves slight lacing behind. Smell is great, starts with pure bitter and then shows a massive bouquet of tropical fruit followed by more straightforward citrus notes. Pineapple, passion fruit, grapefruit, lemon, orange, and pine are all very noticeable and discernible. "
A: Poured a glowing orange color with good carbonation and a nice white head
On-Tap at Blue Dog in Lansdale.

"Had this one with my sirloin at Ebenezer's in Lovell Maine on Friday. Menu says ""Self Explanator and we got lucky to land this one""..."
"I love me some hops, but this beer was about as unbalanced hop-heavy beer that I have had."
"Reviewed from my notes. Served in my small Lion's Pride goblet as part of their first annual hop fest. The beer has a big white foam head that leaves lots of lace. It has a slightly translucent appearance with a golden yellow color. There is some carbonation rising within the glass. It looks perfect. There is a big fresh hop aroma, with some citrus notes. It has a clean hoppy taste. It isn't very bitter. I find it to be very balanced and nuanced. There is a great lingering hop flavor. This is an all-around great IPA. The mouthfeel is especially impressive. The coating is not very prominent, but it is certianly there. It's not very sticky, which I like. There is a medium level of carbonation; enough to feel but not distracting. This beer is incredibly drinkable. It goes down very easy and is quite refreshing. I could drink this one brew all night. Definitely worth seeking out."
This is from the notes I took from the Lion's Pride in Brunswick Maine today. This was on tap today what a great beer.
Received this brew from PeprSprYoFace after months of waiting for this beauty to come on tap. I'm a big fan of Stone IPA and I can only imagine how much better this beer can get with a couple rounds of dry hopping. Drank from a nice generic mug at Lake Wausau in Wisconsin.
Wow. This might be one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Got a growler of this last week. Cracked it open today.
4/16/2010
"A - Pale straw yellow, somewhat hazy, not a whole lot of head on this. "
I drank this on tap into a pint glass at the Map Room. 
"Had this on-tap at the Twisted Spoke Stone launch yesterday, 4/01/10. Reviewed from notes."
On-tap at the Twisted Spoke for the Stone Chicago Release celebration. Poured into a plastic cup (argh). 
"Growler fill from Stone on 3/13/10. I already love the regular Stone IPA, and the Double Dry Hopped is even more fantastic. A deep gold color with a nice white head, and a killer pine/citrus note. Hoppy and bitter with a malt backbone without being sweet. A dry finish and if it were not for it's ABV, totally sessionable. It has the aroma of a Double IPA without the strength. Well done."
On tap at the Toronado. Poured into a pint glass. No abv info is given.
On tap at Toronado SD.
"Back story: Stone IPA (regular) was my introduction to craft beer. I've always loved Stone and for years I would describe it as my favorite beer. When I heard about Stone double dry hopped IPA, I figured I would never get it. Then I set up an in person trade with BS68280 at the Sexual Chocolate release day for a growler. I couldn't make it out of DC due to three feet of snow but BS68280 still sent me the growler, along with a couple of other great gems. Awesome guy...now to the beer."
Served from a 64oz. growler acquired in a trade with kkipple at the Sexual Chocolate release in North Carolina (Thanks man!) into both my Stone Ruination Mug and Stone Levitation tulip at the appropriate temperature (02/12/10).
"Pours a light gold, maybe a hint of orange. Kind of surprising. I guess I was expecting more of a double IPA color. "
Got a growler of this at Stone a few weeks ago when it was on special and immediately told 2 of my buddies to come over and try this nectar with me. 
Thanks to Deuane for sharing a growler on 2/8/10.
Thanks to BS68280 for sharing this and other good times throughout the long wait in line at Sexual Chocolate Day 2010.
Big thanks to kkipple for hooking me up with a growler of this west coast nectar!
Insanely good beer. Made the two hour trip from Anderson to Columbia to make sure I could grab a couple growlers of this while it was still on! Served cold and opened for lunch of Superbowl Sunday! 
"On-tap at Stone this weekend. I love their IPA as it is, so this one is a must try."
"Hazy bright orange and yellow brew poured into a tulip glass at the Stone Brewery. Amazing aroma, smells like lemon with pine and grapefruit. The taste is bitter up front with a nice warming dry finish that cuts the bitterness and allows for increased drinkability. The beer poured a fantastic frothy head. The carbonation was good but not as soft and frothy as the foamy appearance initially suggested. Excellent beer reminiscent of Pliny the Elder. Highly recommended."
"Probably one of my favorite, if not the favorite casked ales. I think I had this at both Hopfest and the Bistro IPA fest. "
"1L growler hauled back from San Diego by bring, thanks Barry. "
Big thanks to khiasmus for sending a growler of this my way. Served in my Surly pint glass.
"Growler from a rare keg tapping at the Piney Grove Green's in Columbia, SC."
Thanks to Alex (MasterSki) for busting out this 64oz growler at New Beer Sunday vHoppy Edition.
Shared with acute comic timing by the extra stout Mauerhan.
"Growler shared by bring. Wow, this is great stuff. The ""other site,"" as of now, lists this as an alias for Stone IPA. This is not correct. Stone IPA this is not - it's a different, awesome animal."
A: Golden-amber body... nice clarity... thick whitish cap with good retention and nice sheetlike lacing.
"Reviewed on CBS day @ Capone's on 8/15/09,"
"A- Nice light-honey/amber. Head stood well, 1-1 1/2 fingers, decent lacing."
"Here it goes for my first review, and a great beer to start out with. "
On tap at Capone's.
I had this at Capone's during the Canadian Breakfast Stout event. Poured chilled into a standard pint.
"On tap at Stone, special brewing to benefit Peter Reeves."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp bubbly orange with a decent off-white head that diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma is a decent amount of citrud hops. The hops come through in the taste, wonderful blend with the sweet malts. The beer has a smmoth dryness and decent carbonation. This is a wonderfully enjoyable beer."
Appearance: Arrives with a clear light amber color with a frothy head that drapes the lace
"A - clear golden yellow, lacy white head hangs around the glass."
Thanks Mauerhan for sharing what was left of this growler...you're just a swell guy. On to my review...
picked up a 40 oz growler of this on my girlfriends birthday after dinner at stone. wasn't allowed a taster of it so i had to gamble. pours very similar to the standard ipa from stone. nice sheets of lacing line my glass. 
"It was quite the night over at the Blind Tiger, wasn't it? Easily everyone's first choice of the evening was the Double Dry Hop. Although there were a lot of seductive offerings there, the crowd made it known that this was their favorite. An extra half a point goes to appearance for Mike personally handing me the glass & toasting all of us. Thank you Grover."
"On tap at the Blind Tiger, 12/13/07."
Served on-tap at the Blind Tiger on Stone's 12/12/12/12 day. This beer is double dry-hopped.
"On tap today in NYC as part of the Blind Tiger's 12/12/12 Stone brewery event. Mike/Grover, Slander and I all agreed this was the one to start with. It arrived in a Belgian style tulip, near clear, slightly orangy. The head is medium in height, tiny bubble, off white and then leaves plenty of fine, well webbed lacing. The nose is intensly hoppy, gobs of amarillo/pineapple fruityness and resiny goodness. Fairly light in body, the expected load of fruity/spicy amarillo laden hop goodness. Easy drinking, pleasant and snappy on the tongue and easy on the entire package of beer apreciation sensors. Loved it, could drink this one all night."
An update on my last review..
"This beer pours a very attractive golden color with a thick, fluffy white head. The head fades slowly, leaving a thick sheet of lace."
Had this at the World Bistro. Impressive deep golden color with a pungent aroma similiar to the hops close cousin. Taste is a fresh hop blast that doesn't overwhelm the palate. I would drink this over Ruination in a heartbeat. Worth the trip to Escondido.
Growler purchased during Stone Winter Storm on Dec. 23.
Strong tasting IPA
I had this one at the brewery and liked it so much I brought a growler back to my hotel. 
"Soapy head and apricot opaque color. Aroma is caramel, bready malt, and pine. Taste follows the nose, but quickly disappears with no lingering bitterness or aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and watery with prickly carbonation. Harsh and not very balanced. Overall a rather unremarkable IPA."
Big thanks to richj1970 for another hoppy treat form Al.
Great combo of malt backbone and hoppy fruity flavor. Unbelievable GP doesn’t make this a year round option
This is by far the best IPA in Birmingham. Great color with a Citrus punch that does not disappoint on taste. Well balanced carbonation that feels like a hoppy IPA is supposed to (Sculpin). Seasonal in cans is a big mistake IMO. This needs to be a Signature brew enjoyed by the masses year round.
I usually look to Good People when I'm seeking a more hop forward IPA in Bham. Hitchhiker takes a step back from that a little and showcases a little more citrus and fruity notes while still preserving that piney hopiness. This is a quite balanced beer with good amber/apricot color. Medium carbonation and is my favorite of their IPA arsenal.
"Golden near amber draft pour to shaker, no head but good lacing. Pineapple, dank nose, a little kiwi. Full flavor that is mainly bitter, some fruit and malt notes follow. Above average body and below average carbonation."
12 oz can with a 2017 date stamp. 
"Big, floral nose. hoppy taste with a punch of citrus. Lingering aftertaste."
"This is a pretty good little beer that I got as a extra in a trade. Pours a golden cooper with huge white head. Nose is floral and light fresh citrus. Floral up front on taste followed by fresh cut grapefruit, light Lemmon zest, grass and caramel malts. A small bit of that sticky quality I so love. Medium body with a crisp finish"
Poured from a 12 oz can into a clear glass tulip. PKG 03/02/17 on bottom rim of can.
"12 oz can. Pours beautiful bright amber orange with thick foamy white head that just sits there, coating lace. Big tropical aroma. Tons of flavor, sweet malt is met by tropical fruit, pineapple and orange, finishes with some piney hops. Outstanding balance. Thin to medium soft feel. This is one tasty West Coast IPA."
"Canned on 3/3/17, poured to Yeti on 3/29/17."
Poured from a 12 ounce can dated 3/3/17. The beer pours a beautiful orange color with a nice full white head that left very little lacing.
On draft at the Draft House in Auburn. I have to say for being a top 5 Alabama beer I was not very impressed. The beer looked and smelled like a typical IPA. The taste was nothing but bitter and these days that doesn't go very far. Perhaps it was an old keg. I'll give it another try at some point.
Poured on draft at local pizza place. 
As far as balanced IPA'S go....this is the closest thing to Jai Alai I've ever had. Honestly I think this one might better. At least it is for my taste.
So lucky to have this local. Everything I love in an IPA.
"Just had this again for the second time. The first time I was a little underwhelmed, but this is truly a work of art for this brewery. The hop flavor is full frontal and brutal and absolutely deliciously punishing. I really feel like I am in IPA heaven drinking this one. I really hope they start canning this so more people can experience it."
"Served on tap into a plastic cup (!) at the taproom on 5/5/13. Despite the plastic cup, this beer looked very pretty. It was a deep brassy orange like a ripe cantaloupe. There was 3cm of thick off-white, frothy head that left thick cob-webs of lacing all over the cup. The nose on this thing really was a highlight of the beer. The smell was bright and effervescent with tons of citrus and tropical fruits highlighted by the ever-present grapefruit along with orange, tangerine, and maybe some touch of pineapple. There was a slight smell of caramel malt in the background as well, but this is definitely not a beer with a hefty malt profile. The taste was pure west coast IPA with tons of citrus hops. The malt side was very muted, but there with some caramel sweetness. This beer was a big, gorgeous buffet of grapefruit, lemon oil, and some tropical notes; maybe the pineapple again, but it was very hard to pin down on my palate. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and quite dry with pretty much no alcohol burn. The bitterness was very smooth and not overly astringent or abrasive. This was a very well done beer. The bartender told me that it was a freshly tapped keg, and I think the freshness of the beer really made it such a good beer. There really is something to say about a beer that is well done and very fresh."
"This is a very good IPA. It was complex, tasty, and dry. But mostly it was hoppy. This was a hop head's dream. Citrusy and dank. There were all kinds of hops in this one. The chalkboard at the taproom just said 100+. My kind of beer."
"Hitch (as the kids call it) is a fun departure from the lands of GP IPA. If you could cut Hitch it would bleed hops. It brings a heady plethora of citrus-y American hops with it on the nose and mouth to the battlefield of your palate and it doesn't apologize. Those of you with ""alternative tastes"" will recognize a distinctive ""dankness"" to this brew. Its hoppy forthrightness gives way to a pleasing malt backbone that balances the show, much like a McMahon to a Johnny. If you like the hoppier beverages then Hitch is a destination for you."
"I love GPBC's approach at this american IPA with a west coast push. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew. I love the citrusy, pineapple hints and the bitterness. I thought the brew was refreshing and at the same time had enough piney notes that went well with the smoothness. Not much malt backbone which I also liked. Most definitely worth seeking out."
served from a growler into a chalice type thingy
"Listen up hopsters, Zarathustra thus spake"
One of my favorites beers. I wish Good People would crank this thing out incessantly. Give me the Hitch Hiker can. I'd stop and pick it up.
Had this beer at J Clyde's in Birmingham on September 4th. Enjoyed it while watching the first Alabama game of the year with my dad. I typed up these notes and e-mailed them to myself so I could post this. Poured into a standard pint glass.
Unbelievable beer! Finally got a growler from Highland Package Store in Birmingham. I believe this is a very fresh keg.
"There are too many IPAs on the market. In my opinion. And the problem is that many of them seem like they were phoned in. Throw some crystal malt in the mash, some Cascade in the kettle, hit 7ish ABV and 50ish IBU and call it a day. I've lost track of how many IPAs seem to be brewed like that. Why bother?"
Half pour at brewery. Clear golden color with fluffy white head.
"On Tap at Mike Taproom Largo,FL Pours a golden color with a fresh small white head. Smell was floral,citrus and dank hop. Taste followed nose was crisp with hops and citrus forward . Mouth feel crisp with some pine bitterness in finish but floral/tropical hops are in charge here. A delightful IPA."
"On-tap at Cycle Brewing, St. Petersburg, FL"
"Received as a gift from a fellow BA. I was quite impressed. This beer had pretty much everything I look for in an IPA. Not as in your face hoppy as some-which I happen to like, just a very enjoyable topnotch IPA"
"Sent a crowler by my brother for Christmas. Cloudy, dark orange, very little in the way of foam or lacing, lots of sediment at the end of the crowler. Dank, citrusy notes on the nose. Taste is a balance of mildly bitter and citrusy hops. Zesty and dank, gentle alcohol presence. Pretty good."
Exceptionally good.
"Great IPA. Nice intense citra hops, and a solid body and flavor. 7-7.5% abv is the sweet spot for me, so this was perfect. Little bit of malty goodness in there too."
"Very good, almost as good as space dust"
On tap at The Marco Island Brewery in Fl.
32 oz crowler. Mix between east and west. Fruity n bitter.
Pours a brilliant sun golden orange with a touch of haze and a finger of fluffy off-white foam.
"Poured on tap at the brew pub, the beer is a slightly hazed, golden coloring, with a foamy, light, clingy, white head. Nose of resinous pine, tart and sweet grapefruit and lemon, sweet caramel, and subtle roasted notes. Well balanced. Flavors are smooth and balanced forward, with a blend of tart grapefruit and lemon on a grassy and piney backbone. Subtle cracker and caramel notes, all on a robust, slick, and slightly astringent body. The aftertaste is citrus and resinous pine pitch. The finish is slick and bitter, with a drying feel. Really good IPA."
I seriously think I'm the 1% with the citra/mosaic craze. It must be similar to the cilantro thing. I get it for what it is. And I really appreciate it. I just want some centennial/simcoe/cascade. Classics-ish! Mouth feel and aroma on this are outta this world.
Pale gold and fairly bright though there is mild haze. 2 finger chalk white head with decent retention. Lots of sticky lacing.
Very drinkable. The more I drink the more I like this. Very smooth lingering finish. Light hop grapefruit not too malty finish but really stays pleasantly on the palate. Definitely will drink again.
Fresh crowler drank in a chalice on 6/16/2016
"Nice cloudy appearance, reminiscent of a lot of New England IPAs. Solid lacing throughout the drink. "
"Poured this hazy goodness from a crowler and enjoyed it very much. It's super juicy with a bright orange color that glows. Yes glows! I would quite put it on level with Tree House's best, but it's almost there. Can't wait to enjoy at the brewery some day!"
Bright yellow with minimal head.
Cycle Brewing Company -- Crank IPA
"Appearance: pours a golden orange color. finger or so of a white head forms, decent retention and leaving behind a slight lacing. slightly hazy and opaque. nice brightness "
Cycle does two things incredibly well......bba stouts and ipas.. This is my 2nd favorite Florida IPA..head juicy mouth feel and carb. Good aromas and lingering bitter
"Poured from a crowler. Darker orange color with a thick white head that lingers some throughout drinking. Some lacing on the glass. Smell of citra comes through nicely. Taste reflects the same as smell with some malt and bitter fruit. Feel is super smooth with a nice resiny mouthfeel, similar to Lawson's. Very nice beer"
Crowler. Nice frothy head with good stick and lacing. Gold with just a bit of haze. Nice smell. A nice malt element with some funky hop. Sweet. Mild grapefruit. A bit simple but in that enjoyable classic way. Super smooth. Some resiny stick. Perfect level of carb.
"Pours (from growler filled at the brewery the day before) a nice hazy light orange with a foamy white head that persists as it's consumed. Smell is more tropical fruit than pine, and the hops definitely smell fresh. Flavor follows the nose, with a good balance as it's not too bitter or hoppy. Tastes very good; I would definitely make this a mainstay if I were in the St Pete area. Strongly recommended."
Hazy gold pour from a crowler/ nice lacing on glass with good carbonation and head. Subtle hints of fruit but hops are evident. Slight bitterness from hops that lingers on the palate but the fruits are as subtle as the nose. A good beer with a nice lingering flavor.
"On tap at Cycle Brewing in St. Petersburg, NY."
"A: Lacey, clear, clingy IPA with a nice head. From a growler and poured to a snifter. Good retention of head and lacing."
No idea how this is a 4.45
"L: Lemon yellow with big white head, copper hues"
32 ounce crowler poured into a snifter.
pours a nice orange hazy color.. really nice over ripe orange and dankness on the nose.. taste is dried orange and mango.. maybe my favorite cross over between a NE and West Coast IPA.. mouthfeel is there too.. very very well done!
Thanks to JLindros for sharing.
Crowler thanks to osnapson (Reddit) shared with rudzud.
Fantastic IPA with Citra goodness. Hope this goes into distro in the Sarasota area soon.
L: Pleasing golden yellow hues with a half inch of head at the top of the glass
"Drinks light, crisp, semi sweet. Loads of tropical fruits, papaya, mangos, some tangelos. Super drinkable. Nice cracker malt backbone that lets the hops shine. Good stuff."
"Poured from a 2 day old Crowler. Nice semiclear light yellow, white foam with solid lacing. Nice fruity nose I get less resin than I do with some other top IPA,s - This is good."
Fantastic IPA. The Citra hops really rule this beer. Beer is better than CCB Jai Alai and honestly on par with NE IPAs. The rating is not a hype.
A shaker glass of dark golden liquid topped with a quickly receding layer of white. Some lace.
I've had the chance to try a lot of great IPAs. Treehouse trillium Maine RR ect. This is one of my top 3 along with Alter ego and DDH Congress. This is a hoppy citrus tropical flavor bomb. Well done cycle
Drank fresh from a 32oz crowler. Pours a beautiful amber brown with a medium white head. Lots of hops on the nose with floral notes throughout. Slight touches of tropical fruit and hops make this very fun to drink.
"Smells like Sip of Sunshine, but lacks the juiciness"
"Incredible IPA!! Unfiltered, hazy and juicy. The profile for the beer really showcases the hops. It tastes like straight hop juice, fairly dry with minimal malt."
"Far superior to Jai Alai for my tastes. Pours a hazy yellow / orange with a creamy head. Looks fabulous. Nose bursts with papaya, guava, pineapple, an herbal dankness that's devoid of pine notes. Flavor follows, modest bitterness, lingering tropical finish. Medium creamy body with some clean biscuity malt in the middle. "
Out of the park IPA. Truly on par with Jai Alia in my opinion. Had it fresh out of the tap at the brewery and could not love it more. Wish I could get this in Ohio!
I was lucky enough to have a good trading partner send me a fresh Crowler of this Citra single hop gem! Was wonderful as expected!!!
"One of my favorite ipas, smell is amazing and the hop profile is juicy, fruity goodness with not an over malty taste, average carb , citra makes this beer."
"Very juicy, very drinkable IPA. Definitely reminiscent of the hoppy stuff coming out of New England, just a bit restrained in every way. If this had a touch more bitterness and had a bit more citrus to it, it'd definitely be up there with the beers Trillium, Tree House and Hill Farmstead is making."
Citra bomb! One of my favorite IPAs this one is really lovely. Flavors are very floral and fruity which is exactly what I like from a beer of this style. Cycle does an awesome job with this beer and I recommend trading for a crowler or two of this if you get the chance.
"Appearance: Arrives very cloudy, with an impressive and perky head capping the amber colored liquid; nice sheets of lacing"
"This is an unbelievable New England style IPA from Florida. The look is a hazy orange. Smell is pure citrus, very prominent Citra hop profile. Very soft on the palate with a hoppy zip but not overly bitter. This is my favorite Florida IPA and is right up there with the greats from Alchemist, Hill Farmstead, TH, and Trillium."
"This beer looks like hazy orange juice. Insane tropical fruit in the nose and taste. It's sweet, but not in a malty way. The Citra hops really shine in this one - an outstanding beer from Cycle."
"Had this from a crowler a friend picked up from the brewery. Great beer. Very grassy and hoppy, like juice. This might be the best Florida IPA I've ever had. at 6%, it's very crushable and perfect for the Florida heat."
I enjoyed this beer at a nice little pub on the St Pete pier called Hops and Props. They had a great selection of local florida beers with the very knowledgeable staff. The beer is a great florida style ipa and is actually better than most of the more recognizable breweries flagship IPAs.
"Love it. I am all about IPAs like this. Unfiltered, heavy citrus, smooth flavor, crazy easy drinking. I'm having a moral dilemma in that I was going to give someone my crowler of this beer. Hmmmm... What to do!?"
"Excellent IPA! Reminds me of the New England IPAs, not as good, but damn good beer. Very drinkable."
"Perfect IPA! smells very hoppy and piney as a good IPA should. Taste is incredible, just the right amount of bitterness and sweet malt. It goes down so smoothly, unlike Jai Alai. This is one of, if not the best Florida IPA's available. Perfect IPA."
poured from a crowler fill 7 days old
From a 32-ounce Crowler filled at the brewery. 
huge thanks to greg for the hookup in a crowler! filled prob about a week ago.
Received a Crowler on a trade very well balanced ipa. Up there with the best.
"I remember this beer being pretty good, along the lines of anything from MBC not named Dinner. "
Hazy gold appearance 
As good as it gets...love this IPA....tremendous blend of hops flavors and drinkability.
"Reminds me of HF IPAs and pale ales with that grassy character along with the soft on the palate mouthfeel...so good...This beer offered in 16oz 4 packs would be killer...make it happen, cycle!"
"Cloudy citrus bomb, great smell, a little piny, but not bitter. I wouldn't call it balanced because the city's is so in your face, but that's a good thing. Everything you want in an east coast IPA and Florida's best IPA IMO."
"received a crank-case in trade, hazy light peach color, nice foamy head, and a hoppy-citrus nose. Flavors of pine and citrus hops with mild bitterness. Love me some hazy citra hoppy deliciousness!!! reminds me of the best of NE... TH Haze, Trillium, HF..... A Winner and well worth seeking out!"
"All kinds of flavors in this one. Its very grassy with pleasing hop bitterness and fruits abound. I get pineapple, lemon-lime, guava, mango, and peach. Its both fruity and earthy. This is a fantastic IPA."
"Pours gold. GIANT mango pervades every inch of the beer's flavor and aroma. Mango up front, mango in the middle, mango, passion fruit, and grapefruit in the back end. Big, bold, bright, but never too sweet, never gimmicky. "
Poured a cloudy yellow. Smells and tastes of lime with a hit of hops blended in right after. This is right behind Jai Alai in my IPA books. Excellent beer.
The beer comes in a completely hazy golden color.
"Poured into a Haw River Farmhouse Ales teku glass. Crowler filled 2-9-15. Thanks a bunch, colt3ninja!"
"Sampled from a fresh 32 oz crowler - thanks Travis. Pours a hazy yet bright apricot color with a huge fluffy white head. Nose has hints of pineapple, mango and lemon. Citrus flavors come through but are quickly followed by nicely balanced hop notes. Very nicely balanced and highly enjoyable IPA. Crisp clean finish."
"Fresh Crowler from the brewery. Pours murky bright yellow with a big creamy fluffy white head that sticks around a whole and leave a lt of lacing. Aroma of pineapple, some pine, sweet malts, lots of tropical fruits but of citrus. Flavor follows the nose closely with big citrus pineapple flavors, pleasantly light bitter, juicy. Slightly dry body after the big juicy tropical fruit, medium carbonation, creamy. Wish these guys were closer as this is easily the best IPA I've had in Florida."
Hat this IPA at the brewery. Citrusy and delicious.
Thanks to Cam for sharing this 32oz Crowler of Crank. Drank and phone-reviewed in the good ol Portland hotel room.
"Crowler brought back from Tampa. So many duplicate listings on here, this one has more ratings. Full notes taken to IPad during consumption."
"This is a great beer. The aroma is so piney. It's like putting you nose in a bag of hops... I could not stop smelling this beer through the entire experience. As a hop head, the bitterness did not match the aroma. Still a great experience."
Crowler that's ~10 days old
"This is one SOLID IPA. Just seeing it in the glass got me excited. Pale orange-yellow, very hazy. Looked almost like orange juice! The smell was entrancing. Ridiculously hoppy, citrusy, and endlessly drinkable. Each sip left me craving another and I ended up bringing a crowler home to have it the next day. This was the only beer I tried, but I do wish I'd stayed for more!"
"Crank is pretty close to perfect. Citra pales are some of my favorites, and this is up there with the best. (Pseudo Sue, Zombie Dust, Trillium Fort Point)"
This is just a perfect Citra hopped pale ale. Just intense aroma of citrus with a nice dry hop character and cloudy look that doesn't at all detract from the beer itself. On par with any VT IPA in my opinion
On tap at Cycle. Served in a pint glass.
Exceptional IPA. Citra hop hardcore in your face with a barely in perceivable malt balance.
"Crowler from only a week ago but flavors muted, almost watery. Remember really loving this a year ago. Will revisit again though"
Reviewed from notes. Had on-tap at Stein & Vine. Served in a pint glass.
"Cycle makes the best IPAs in Florida IMO, and this one is their best. I make weekly 2 hour round trips to the brewery to keep some crowlers on hand at all times."
"I absolutely love this beer. Very refreshing IPA, like the ones made up north in Vermont."
Lightly-hazed golden color with a finger-and-a-half of off-white foam head. Decent retention and nice rings of lacing.
"On tap at Lawson's Finest Liquids in Waitsfield, VT."
A-Pours a very nice amber color with a slight head and lacing
Poured into a becher pint glass.
"16oz can from the brewery. Pours a golden brown with an inch of head. Tons of lacing. The aroma is lots of sweet pine and citrus hops. Bready malts as well. The taste is grapefruit, citrus peel and grassy hops along with a big punch of pine. Piney finish with a good amount of the malt flavor. Tastes boozier than the ABV. Oily mouthfeel and nicely bitter."
"grassy, dank, floral, slightly spicy pine, some grapefruity and orange notes dancing around, mellow bready/crackery malt, and a hint of mango in the background. very clean and balanced, a classic west coast style IPA."
"GREAT COLOR AND AROMA IN THIS IPA. LAWSON'S DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. Hard to get on Ohio, usually have to have someone guy for us and send to us. Very nice Brew!"
Wish this was more readily available! This fucker is delightful and I'm a bigger fan over their sunshine line
Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. 
11/25/2016
"Poured from tap at Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock, VT into their flute."
L- Pours a hazy yellow with a modest 1 finger white head. Lacing is patchy.
"Orange amber in color. Hazy in appearance. Piney, resinous and lots of grapefruit bitterness. Not too sweet and finished super dry. No Sunshine (Sip or Double) but still good."
"Poured from a bottle delivered to the store this week, no bottle date, into a modified tulip glass."
"Amazingly smooth and balanced, maybe one of my favorite beers ever. Literally not a hint of bitterness or rough aftertaste. Super piney, more like a great pale ale then an IPA. Maybe that's just because I'm so use to the world of doubles and triples and super hoppiness that we live in and have forgotten how great a simple IPA can be."
"I've had this before, but just getting around to reviewing it now. Bottle from Warren Store, served nice and cold, poured into a Lawson's becher. Hazy amber color, topped with two fingers of frothy off-white head, which receded to a rocky layer of bubbles, leaving random sheets of lacing on the glass. Aroma obviously showcases Chinook, piney, herbal, and citrusy, with a bready malt backbone. The taste is similar, grapefruit pith, pine resin, herbal and leafy notes; bready pale malts in the background, keeping the beer fleshed-out but not too sweet. Medium body, crisp mouthfeel, assertively bitter, moderate carbonation. Very good overall. If you're following this with anything else, make sure you cleanse your palate, because these hops don't quit."
A- Has a deep burnt orange color with a off white pencil width head that separates quickly. Clean lacing all the way around the glass. 
A: Amber in color with a beautiful creamy 2 finger head good retention and great lacing. Only minor complaint is not great clarity but thats ok.
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an oversized tulip.
"A-golden orange color, nice white head that leaves a hella amount of lacing"
"22 oz bottle, perhaps 3 weeks old, courtesy of Matt in a trade. Poured into an unlabeled snifter today, 10/6/2013."
"A - Pours a perfect amber honey-gold, with two fingers of frothy head."
"22oz bottle thanks to Mike, appreciate it man. Hazy orange color, good head. Aroma was slight pine and citrus but nothing exposive. Flavor was much the same, bitter, and then a mineral quality I did not like. Overall, eh it was ok. I'd revisit it once but I'm starting to wonder why Lawson's is so highly praised."
"A - 4.5 - Nice head and nice retention all the way down, nice golden color"
"I've had this many times. A fine and somewhat unique IPA offering by Lawson's. This baby is all pine, grass, and sweet on the nose. Some grapefruit, but mostly an earthy and subdued kind of vibe to it. Bitter and refreshing taste."
Hazy golden colour with a moderate sized white head. Great lacing. What you'd expect of a good AIPA.
"Pours a dark gold color with a thick fluffy head on top. Good lacing. The aroma shows a combination of pine, biscuit malt, and quite a bit of grapefruit. This is just a flat out tasty IPA. There’s a light toasted caramel and cookie malt backing for support while still allowing the hop to shine. This is oily and bitter with pine and grapefruit hop flavors. It gets rather dry in the finish with some sharp bitterness on the backend."
On tap at the Farmhouse Tap. Served in a wine glass.
Appearance: Arrives with an amber color verging on copper; a modest head caps the liquid and leaves a few dots behind
Poured this into a DFH IPA glass.
Lawson's Finest Liquids - Chinooker'd IPA
Date: 05/17/2013
"Soo uhh... Yeah... This beer, well, uhhmm, uuhh, ok did I oversell the whole ""I'm speechless"" shtick? First of all, huge fuckin props to my boy MikeyV for hookin this GEM up. Where do I begin? Well, I can start by saying this beer was an extra in a trade for Heady Topper so you can imagine my palate is already biased with the Nectar of the Gods. To be honest, the initial taste is very similar to HT IMO. It starts with the ever so slightest bit of maltiness then travels into a perfect balance of an oh soooo smooth hoppiness that is so damned tasty it'll make you wanna slap yo mama!!!"
"I had Double Sunshine a long time ago and was glad to see this beer on-tap around VT this weekend. Reviewed from notes. Blackback Pub, Waterbury."
"Ultra fresh bomber from the Mad River Valley, poured into a Lawson's snifter with a creamy one finger head atop a dense honey color ale that appears a glowing orange when held up to the light. Crazy lacing."
"From notes, 1/28/11. Excellent IPA. The beer pours golden with a nice white head. Aroma is grapefruit, pineapple, pine and marijuana. It’s a much more nuanced hop aroma than expected from a single hop Chinook beer. Taste is medium bitter and mildly dry. Some light caramel malt presence, but it’s really about the hops. Light mouthfeel. Medium to medium-low carbonation. A very pleasant surprise."
"Thanks to Phil for picking this one up for me. 22oz. bomber into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter. Shared with schen9303. Pours a slowly cascading 1.5 finger frothy light cream colored head with good retention. Beer is a clear dark amber. Lacing is stringy, thick, layered with good cling. Excellent looking beer. "
"Drank on-tap at Lord Hobo, Cambridge, MA"
Bomber to long trail pint glass 
"From notes: Chinooker'd IPA pours a clear amber with a small, frothy white head on top. The foam disappears quickly leaving behind spots of lace on the glass. No bubbles seen in the beer."
"A : Poured a hazy deep orange with a nice white cap, moderate bubbles and lacing. Decent head retention on this."
"22 oz bottle courtesy of Mike, an extremely generous guy and the epitome of a true BA, Thank you so much for this opportunity. Poured into a Duvel tulip."
"22 oz bomber poured into a large Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. Liquid is pretty dark for an IPA. Looks close to amber in color with some lighter tones in the area where light passes through. The beer is well filtered and has excellent clarity. Orange cremecicle colored head, better than average lacing. "
A-medium amber color with a nice white head and good lacing
I snagged a bottle of this on 01SEP12 at The Warren Store and quaffed it yesterday while enjoying the end of summer...
"Poured from tap into pint at Three Penny Montpelier, VT. "
Bottle opened on 8.15.12.
22oz bottle sent to me by Valdieu2. Thanks!
22oz bottle purchased at the Lawson's bottle release this past Saturday (2 days ago) at the Waitsfield Farmer's market. Poured into snifter. Drank back to back with Double Sunshine.
"bomber picked up outside of Burlington, VT from a trip 2 weeks ago. no bottled on date, but tastes very fresh. "
Bottle from July 20th; fairly fresh. Poured in to HF stemmed tulip. 
"22oz bottle into Duvel tulip. No bottled on info that I could find, but I bought it a week ago at the Warren Store, and Lawson's beer doesn't sit around on shelves for long."
Cracking this in honor of IPA day.
22oz bottle poured into tulip - thanks alex
Bright golden body with a nice touch of creamy white head. Always liked chinook for use in my homebrews and this brew just reaffirms why I like that hop so much. Aroma packs a nice bit of resiny goodness with just a touch of fruitiness to round it out. 
Small pour at the Vermont Brewer's Festival on 7/21. Waited about 30 minutes in line for this sample.
A-Pours a bright marmalade color. Head is about a finger high and off-white. Moderate lacing. Body is lightly translucent.
"Picked up a bottle of this at Hunger Mountain Co-Op in Montpelier, VT. Poured into my Duvel tulip."
"22 oz, gold foil topped bottle. Thanks to Tucker, Ashley, and Josh for hooking me up with bottles of this. "
"This bottle opened thanks to a trade with Emily, a new BA! "
22oz bottle poured into a DFH signature glass. No bottle date present but this was picked up for me about 2 weeks ago in VT.
From 22oz bottle to snifter on 2/4/12
"Thanks Michael, long time huge want of mine here. Wow, thanks. "
Thanks goes out to Hojaminbag for this brew.
Bottle shared by yourefragile. Thanks Michael.
Bottle courtesy of youbrewIdrink. Thanks Joe!
"Bottle shared by IrishColonial. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tasting glass. It poured a bright orange/amber color with a thin, white, sticky head to it. Great looking beer, loved the color. "
Bottle shared by yourefragile. Served in a SAVOR wine glass because I already packed my Lawson's glass. Damnit. 
Chinooker'd IPA has an orange body and a rocky tan head that leaves behind a few tendrils of lacing after showing off solid retention.
A 22oz bomber poured into a DFH Signature Glass.
"Had a glass at the Farmhouse in Burlington VT. Oddly enough, this beer reminded me of the all-Centennial Bell's Two-Hearted Ale. The hops here are certainly bigger, but it's a similar cutting citrus hops chatter with hits of pine and grassy lemon. It's an excellent example of an IPA, but lacks the depth and complexity of a truly great hop bomb. That said, most bars will not have a finer pale ale on tap."
On tap at the Blackback pub. Served too cold - I tried to let it warm up as long as I could.
"22oz bottle batch 217 bottle #18 poured into Hair of the Dog tulip, reviewed on 8/31/11."
had this beer on cask at the vermont brewers festival what a treat.
"wow... i mean wow. this is the beer that you have after you build a house. an IPA that hits every base with a bitter kicker. yellow orange very light hazy with a completely white head. some lace. nose of exotic citrus mango passion fruit hints. a bit oil back of the tongue feel. evergreen, and chloroplast bitter. dandelion greens bitter and i'm in love with it. tingle pepper dry on the tongue. all around i think my top 5% AIPA i've ever had."
"Been looking forward to this one for a while, so I was naturally thrilled when I finally received a bottle in trade. Waiting around for a while but finally had to crack it open last night. Poured a very nice hazy amber with a nice thick and sticky three inches or more of head on top. The retention was fantastic and even when it finally did calm down some it still left behind lace that was so thick you could not even see the contents of the glass. Lots of carbonation was visible inside from the very beginning and the also a lot of sediment residing inside both the bottle and the glass. Smell was obnoxiously hopped with huge floral aromas of pine, orange, and grapefruit. A slightly sweet base was apparent, but totally overwhelmed by the hops. The taste was just absurd, such a good thick IPA.. Huge floral hop taste that was just sticky it tasted so fresh. A really huge hop presence with a ton of pine flavors and lots of sweet orange mixed in. Great medium body with a huge bitter dry and sticky finish. Great carbonation through out never let you down. This was just awesome and the bottle went in no time. No hint of the ABV at all which was very nice. Overall this was one of the best IPAs I have had, with definitely a west coast flavor to it. This is definitely a brew to be reckoned with and came off more of a double to me then anything else. But none the less it was fantastic and really a great experience. I will definitely be looking for more of this, and you should be too."
"Thanks, Barry."
"22oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Hand written batch #170, bottle #15. Huge thanks to SneezyAchew for hooking me up. "
Batch #170
"Batch 170, bottle 33."
"Purchased on a beer-run weekend to VT. Batch 170, bottle 43, poured into a Hill Farmstead pint glass. The beer pours a hazy copper with a frothy white head. As the head slowly fades the beer leaves sheets of oily lacing on the walls of the glass."
"Bomber (Batch #158, Bottle #40) into a Duvel tulip."
Poured from a bottle received in a trade with CooperEllis into my Bruery tulip. 
"From 08/26/10 notes. Had at a local DC tasting, thanks a lot Brad (ygtbsm94)! Bottle 89, batch 139."
"On cask at Three Penny in Vermont - a treat. This is a well-hopped, but balanced IPA that has a long finish. Floral aroma, cloudy unfiltered appearance, highly everscent for a cask (maple syrup as priming sugar!!), somewhat thick mouthfeel but not overly so, and just a great citrusy finish that lingers beautifully."
Darn fine beer.
22oz bottle from Shawn..Thanks!
"Got this one from Andrewinski1's recent trip to Vermont. Thanks! Poured into a pint glass. Pours a clean golden orange color with about an inch of frothy white head. Lots of really nice lace on this one! Visible carbonation is drawing me in on this sweltering summer night. The nose is a big smell of chinook. Very piney and earthy! Faint citrus aromas are in the background, but mostly this is hop city! The hops give a big bitter taste in this relatively dry beer. A little bit of grapefruit citrus and some rich malts add to a wonderful finish. After I swallow sweet malts and hop bitterness linger on my tongue. Mouth feel is great, with good carbonation and a nice dry finish, this IPA drinks easily. Very refreshing choice at an attempt to destroy the heat."
"Got this on our recent trip to Vermont. Poured into a tulip glass. About half an inch of head that shrinks to lacing. Nice golden color, not quite amber, not super light either. Smells typically of pine mostly, but the taste is certainly dominated by grapefruit. A swish around my mouth and to the sides of the tongue reveal a nice smooth bubbly mouthfeel and lots of bitterness. This was a real treat and I know the freshness has a lot to do with its deliciousness. Bummed I didn't buy more."
"Thanks to jedwards for bringing this one out. 22oz. bottle - Batch #129, Bottle #30. Poured a bright orange with a semi-hazy clarity and a bright white, skim of a head that quickly dissipated. Big tangerine presence in the nose with some earthiness behind. Taste is somewhat consistent with the nose; however, it is not as sweet as suggested, with an ashy bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with an easy carbonation and a semi-dry finish. A very solid IPA; but the ashy bitterness at the finish got to be a little much after a while."
A-Beautiful amber color. Great white head. A full finger that settles to a half finger that stays for the whole glass. Head hangs all over inside the glass.
Batch 121 / Bottle 2
On tap poured into a 10oz lawsons flute.
"Appearance: clear, orange-brown, 1/4 inch head"
"A gold foil wrapped 22 ounce bomber. Much thanks to brothercannon for bringing a few of these down to PA for me to enjoy. Rare batch #96, bottle #48. Uncapped and poured into my Adnams nonic tumbler. The ale appears a hazy pale golden amber color with about two fingers of creamy off white foam. The head leaves a size-able lace in its wake with each sip. A very nice looking pour. The nose and flavors consist of bitter white and red grapefruit peel and juice, orange and tangerine peel, some lemon, just about the right amount of sweet caramelized malt, lightly toasted bread, somewhat earthy, resinous pine, dank weed, another wave of grapefruit, a pleasant lingering bitterness. The ale falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation. A great example of the style. Thanks again Tim!"
Bottle shared by jophish17 - thanks!
"Received this in a recent trade with TheRowan. Great first trade man, and I hope you enjoyed the goods I sent back!"
22oz gold foiled bomber received in a trade with MtGoat thanks!
"Big thanks to stowehop for this extra(!). Served in a Sierra Nevada pint glass. Batch #57, bottle #5."
Pours a medium golden color with a one-finger head into my glass. Looks good so far.
"Ahhh- finally got my hands on some Lawson's Finest stuff. Sure it added 45 minutes to my drive up to Burlington, but taking the scenic way up rte 100 alone was worth doing that. Let's see if the beer is also worth it. Oh, and on a side note: Review #300 for me."
"Out of a gold foil wrapped bottle (#16 of Rare Batch #39) this beer was a tangerine orange/gold color with good clarity and a little amount of rising carbonation. The yellow-tinted head was a full three-fingers thick and displayed very good retention as a cap. The lacing was very thick and consistent all the way down my glass. The aroma was an excellent blend of 'citrusy goodness' provided by the Chinook hops with some light green and floral notes along with pale malt in the background. The flavors were at first very citrusy, lots of grapefruit and orange peels notes, in the middle I tasted some pine and towards the end the herbal bitterness really came through. The citrusy oils from the hops left a slick on my tongue. Totally a hop-head beer and it fully captured the flavor of this complex hop strain. Though hop dominated there was enough doughy malt and pale malt to keep it balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation delicate. Personally, I love a bold beer and this was just that. Another winner (in this case, literally) from Sean Lawson."
Poured a Medium copper hue with a one finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing.
Nice malty backbone. This beer has changed over the years but still an excellent IPA.
Canned on 07/31/18 stamped on bottom of 12 oz. can:
Very fun of the mill IPA. Really nothing truly special about this IMHO. The stouts from Cigar City Breweing are something really special. This was mundane.
"ABSOLUTELY MY FAVORITE IPA OF ALL TIME!! Had the pleasure of trying this on draught multiple times on vacation in Clearwater, then I moved to Tampa shortly after. This beer is so great on draft and surprisingly great out of a can. Unfortunately they don’t bottle it but if you don’t live in an area that sells it often you should get your hands on it. You won’t regret it if you truly love IPA’s."
Solid beer for what it is
"Don't understand the 4.0s and higher. This is a run of the mill west coast style IPA, dime a dozen in my opinion. Very simple taste profile, mainly bitterness. Not that it's bad, but not a 4.28 average at the time of this review. That's getting into Treehouse range, and there's simply no way this beer flies at that altitude. Much prefer Sam Adams NEIPA and Rebel to this, as well as Voodoo Ranger, SN Celebration Ale and Torpedo, Lagunitas Sucks and Maximus at this price point or lower."
"L: coppery color, clear"
Love Cogar City
I drank and loved classic east coast ipa. my early years were ballantine ipa. that said this fruity ipa with
Nice IPA. Solid drinkable IPA
"Poured from 12 oz can dated 8/23/18 , so about a month old. into the test glass."
A very tasty IPA.
"An easy to find IPA that is refreshing and from first to last. It's not overly bitter, but maintains its taste thru the glass. It never loses flavor from first sip. Reasonably priced."
"On tap. 16 oz. into a plastic cup. It was at a pool bar in Key West, so I'll let the plastic cup slide."
Very nice balance of mostly citrus fruits with some pine hop and not overly bitter at first then a punch of tangy orange hop flavor and caramel malt sweetness finishes this beer. Well done from the Sunshine State. Cans FTW!
"12oz can dated 7/25/18 purchased at Town Center. Hazy amber color and citrusy nose. Citrus taste with orange, a touch of caramel malt and orange peel/grapefruit on the finish. A very good enjoyable beer."
One of the best beers you can find in shitty stores across the country
"It was an old can of Jai Alai, unfortunately."
Delicious ipa with notes of tangerine.
"Best Florida beer I've had. Readily available, and pretty high quality. As a Bostonian, I'm always worried about not having craft beer readily available in new places I visit, but Jai Alai has made my trip down south one to remember. "
"On tap. Dark orange color with frothy white head. Smells of citrus. Medium feel. Grapefruit-like hop flavors dominate, but it's well balanced with malt. A great IPA."
Really good. Little lingering taste or I would have rating higher.
WOW another fine brew from Cigar City. Perfect balance of citrus and malt.
"Solid IPA, now they come in 12 packs which is ideal for hosting parties or if you’re looking to supplement your weekly pick-up"
Pours a pretty clear medium Amber with an all white head with good retention.
"L - Hazy, opaque, burnt orange/copper with a medium to thick, frothy/creamy light tan head that sticks around and leaves a nice amount of lacing behind. "
"Delicious. This is a staple for me whenever I venture down south on vacation. Fantastic taste, the mouthfeel is a bit on the lighter side which really highlights the hops. Try to get your hands on the cedar aged version if you can!"
"Mesmerizing clarity, with a medium amber body. The frothy, off-white head melts slowly...yet surely...leaving evenly spaced rings of lace in its wake. "
"This IPA pours a dark coppery color with a medium frothy white head that leaves some nice lacing. The smell is nice and crisp with some nice citrus hop presence, but with mild malt scents as well. The flavor is quite nice with some citrus flavors from the hops; orange, papaya, and a touch of grapefruit. There is a significant malt presence as well with some bread flavor and a mild caramel sweetness. The body is medium, but on the high end for a standard IPA. There is a nice smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel to it also. I would call this a malt forward IPA, which would undoubtedly be considered a slight by some people, However, I think that while many malt forward IPAs feel forced and fall into a trap of diminishing the hop character that is so essential to an IPA, this comes off as balanced and makes it clear that this is in fact an IPA and the hops are the star of the show. In that respect this is an impressive IPA. That being said the flavors are in no way exotic. This is just a classic, well balanced IPA done really well."
"i saw someone else call this the IPA by which they judge all others, and I agree. "
"Good, did not change my life."
"This is the IPA that I judge all others by. Admittedly, I think the more hops the better. This is the perfect combination of ABV & IBU. Great citrus notes! Delicious!"
"Really enjoyed this one. Flavorful and ABV well hidden. Less boomy grass/fruit and more tea. Never tried Cigar City before, but this is a winner for sure!"
"12oz can. Poured out a clear, golden amber color with a large, off-white head of foam. It smelled of pine, orange peel and roasted malt. Piney hop bite with a citrusy kick. Strong roasted malt backbone with caramel."
"Finally found this- in Eastham , Mass!? Not sure if my taste buds were so screwed up from the ""Cape Crap Breweries"" but this stuff is fantastic. If you are from the CT area this is Sea Hag on HGH- Awesome"
Absolutely love this beer. Super balanced and smooth. 7.5% is hidden well. Tropical smell on the nose and exceptional taste. My new go to beer.
Deep copper gold color with white cap and lacing.
Deep burnt orange color and a one inch off-white to tan colored head.
A beer of legend around the craft community. To be quite honest my hopes aren't all that high seeing as most highly regarded brews don't turn out to be all they're cracked up to be once they hit a larger distribution. BUT I will remain optimistic.
"Pours a medium amber color with a frothy head, lots of syrupy lacing. Aroma is mild and doesn't really give anything away. Tasting, an explosive blast of resinous hops with a strong, slightly sweet malt backbone - definitely gets your attention. Tingles a bit on the tongue and then slowly fades to a lingering hop bitterness. This is an outstanding beer and a pleasure to drink. A really nice alternative to all of the juicy, fruity NEIPA of the week."
"Love the look of this Florida IPA...big frothy head and beautiful copper color...the taste does not disappoint as it is full bodied and yummy. Not sure on the after taste, but overall a big thumbs up!"
"Pours a fairly clear, golden color. It has a 2 finger white, and insanely frothy head with some nice lacing on the glass. The retention is decent. "
"Dangerous at 7.5%. So delicious; could crush a 6pk like nothing! Not among the very best ipa's I've had, but clearly stands above the majority out there! Wish I had this on the regular here in Louisiana as it would be a repeat but often."
To me its just another IPA. Decent and worth a sixer but nothing that will blow you away.
"Jai ALai was a welcomed nicely balanced ipa on a hot summer day. From Florida, it’s made to give you a quick hit of citrus and a very pleasant finish. It looks nice, and certainly a nice ipa which is not overly bitter for those who are sensitive to such. In short, I loved the beer and wouldn’t hesitate to have it again and again."
"Came across this beer while golfing with some hosers (duffers) in FL. It was my gateway into the world of IPAs. Out of the 30+ IPAs I've tried since then in VA, only a few beers compete. The taste is light malt and heavy hops with a citrusy balance. The aftertaste is what makes this hoppy beer gold. The fact that jai alai made it's way to VA (wegmans) justifies my rating. Golden amber ipa with a flavor that can't be beat."
Very good beer. 
"Dated 5/18/18 on the bottom of the can, 3.5 weeks since brewing."
"I'm not sure how it pours or what the color looks like since it comes in a can and goes directly in me. The flavor is great. It's a citrusy tropical fruity one with notes of caramel and a subtle hoppiness. Now available in the Chicago area, so it’s one of my regular go-to beers."
12 oz. Can purchased from local market.
Look: Amber
"Orange and hazy, white long lasting head."
"west coast look, reminds me of pliny elder.. really!"
"Very nicely surprised by this beer - was worried that with its hype and reputation the reality couldn’t possibly live up, but I was wrong. Nice golden color with some moderate head and lingering lacing. Smells mainly of hops, more fruity than floral. Tastes of some citrus hops - orange zest, lemon zest, grapefruit - as well as floral hops, caramel, malt and a trace of herbal hops. The more intense hoppiness was definitely balanced by the malt backbone. Finishes clean with just a little bitterness but it was very pleasant. Mild mouthfeel, decent carbonation throughout even as the beer warmed."
Well poured from a 12 ounce can 45 days new into a tulip glass. Looks clear orange with a modest head but excellent lacing. Smells sweet and juicy. Tastes even better. The first sip was sweet and smooth. Thick mouthfeel and sticky on the lips. It tastes tropical with just the right touch of malt to keep it in check. It is sweet and fruity with a very slight bitter finish. A winner in my book. I have nothing negative to say about it.
Canned 14 days ago.
solid west coasty ipa from the eastern west coast (think about that for a minute)
Cigar city has been long awaited in my area.
"Looks golden with nice creamy dollops of head remaining. Smells of grapefruit pith,pine cone,biscuit, orange marmalade. Taste is refreshing and mildly puckering. Nice malt backbone to compensate for this hop bomb. I have had triple IPA's that don't have this hop zing as this. Feels nicely carbonated, (not oily or slick) Almost a semi dry finish. Overall I would have again and recommend it."
12 oz. can into tulip. Dated 5/21/18.
"Solid IPA, has a nice citrus quality and likely mosaic? Has that blueberry like fruitiness to it. Really what I like about the flavor though is a nice malt backbone, toasty and slightly caramelized sugar note, provides a nice backbone without being overwhelming. Mouthfeel is a tad heavy but still for the most part easy drinking, a bit dry however."
"My first time trying the fabled Jai Alai. Cigar City is new to MD and the can is 18 days old. From what I hear, this may be the only time I see this beer fresh. Haha. Anyhow, it looks great with a nice white head. Smell is of citrus and tropical fruit with a touch of pine and alcohol. Solid but not anything special. Oh well."
"Just wow. The moment I saw this in Whole Foods' fridge, I was struck with desire. I recognized it immediately because it was in a can, and the image on here is of a can. The bottom depicts a canning date of 2/20/18 followed by the clearly rhetorical question: HOW JAI ARE YOU? This quirky phrase apparently indicates that Oskar Blues brewed this beer for Cigar City, which explains its distribution in my state of sunny Southern California."
Dark orange with large frothy head.
Exceptional IPA
"Look - 2 week old can into a tulip. Deep and vibrant amber-orange with a towering soapy 3 finger head. Not quite translucent but certainly not a ""milkshake"". I'm more than okay with that."
"Poured from 12 oz can into pint glass. A 2"" sudsy off white head drops slowly with moderate lacing. Color is cloudy orange with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aroma of citrus, pineapple, and bread dough. Mouthfeel is medium, sticky, and puckering with a damp finish. Flavor of very strong citrus, grapefruit, and pineapple. Malt is definitely kept in the background on this one. The alcohol is also well concealed and I would never guess the ABV is 7.5%. Overall an excellent IPA."
"Poured from can to tulip glass. Amber-tinged orange in color with a finger of nice foamy head that leaves clingy lacing. Aroma is sweet orange, grapefruit, papaya, and biscuit malts. Tastes follows with a good amount of citrus expertly balanced against the malt. A nice welcome to Michigan."
Appearance: Hazy dark blonde holds an eighth of an inch of rocky white foam.
"This has been my go-to ipa for years. They just introduced 12 can packs under 20 here in NY. I have my personal favorites but there's no way you'll get this quality at this price. ***Lt. Archie Hicox: I must say, damn good stuff, Sir.***"
"Nice citrusy above average ipa. The woodlands, TX April 2018"
"I acquired this beer in a beer trade from a gentlemen from Florida. We are getting it here in Minnesota in a month but, I couldn't wait after reading all of the reviews on it. Poured from the can into a pint glass."
"Maybe my favorite IPA, certainly the best from Florida. Lots of power, citrus, and hops but goes down really smooth. It's commonly on tap in pints in SW Florida, which is slightly dangerous if you don't stop at two. But it has so much flavor that it's nice to sip slowly, so two is plenty for three hours listening and dancing to the Mudbone Blues band."
"Pours a substantially hazy gold to copper. Aromas of ripe tropical fruits, oranges, and chewy sweet caramel but veey subdued. Nose would benefit from more prominent hop aromas. Beer is bitter with bits of mango and tropical fruits. Well balanced between bitterness and sweet malt, but I'm left wanting more hop flavor. Medium body."
Favorite Florida brew
A - Pours a lightly hazed amber with a two finger foamy white head. Tons of soapy lacing.
"Reminds me of Deschutes inversion, but not quite as flavorful."
"Beautiful lacing with a thick puffy head.Pours with a medium copper appearance. Hops,citrus and pine resin up front on the nose. Body is quite thin with a sharp grapefruit finish. Quite drinkable."
"A great session IPA, one of my go to beers if nothing more substantial is available and I think that really counts for something. Even though I don’t put this is the same league as sculpin or dogfish 90, it’s cheaper (in my location) and I’d drink it all day."
"This is a nice ipa. Crisp clear and packed with citrus. Smell is dank and has citrus notes. Has some heat for being 7.5%, but it actually is kinda nice. Flavor is citrus, pine, some caramel malt. On the bitter side, but not too dry for me. I'm enjoying this. I don't know that I'll buy it a lot (due to having so many options) , but I'm glad I bought it."
2 finger head. 
"The verdict is in, Favorite IPA. Look, Great; Smell; Fruity, citrus; Taste, Best; and Feel, Fantastic."
"Having ridiculously high expectations for jai alai I thought maybe this batch would be different. Zero aroma, minimal hop presence. Total letdown again"
Type: 12-oz. can
it's okay. It's medium-bodied but dry like a true IPA. I would say it's kin is Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA which I would buy over this. Probably won't buy again.
"Jai Alai has made its way to Chicago and it turns out it's as good as they say. Nice copper color, pleasant citrusy aroma, but taste and feel are just phenomenal. Great balance of citrusy hops and caramel malt. Fantastic texture. Feels and tastes almost like a DIPA."
Dark and a little hazy. No nose. Nothing exciting about the taste or leave with this.
As expected ipa
L) Pours a lovely honey amber with a creamy white head. Decent retention and great lacing.
"It pours a nice copper orange. It's smells of tropical fruit. Great aroma. Taste is citrus fruit, slightly sweet with a nice hope bitterness. A lot of hype around this IPA and it's very good. But the more I find these the more convinced I am that nothing beats solid local craft fresh off the tap and this can is dated 3/6 so it's fresh."
"Look: orange, semi cloudy, dense head, good lacing. Aroma: passion fruit, mango, flower bed, those chalky heart candies from Valentine's Day. Taste: nice, sharp bitterness up front, passion fruit, grapefruit, mango, pineapple. Finish: dry with lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel: silky texture, lively carbonation. Comments: this is one of the best IPAs I've yet drank."
"Dark-orange colour, cloudy, pouring with a nice head."
"Can dated 03/01/2018. Pours a copper orange with a bit of white head. Aroma is mostly citrus fruits - tangerine, grapefruit, orange, slight tropical fruit. Taste is similar - dominated by orange, tangerine, grapefruit flesh, clementine. There's also a sweetness that gives it a dried orange slices/orange marmalade note as well. Notes of pine and resin as well but in the background of all the citrus flavors. Feel is slightly thick but I think near perfect for the style, which I would call classically West Coast. Overall, I was excited to see this on the shelf and I'm happy that Cigar City is now distributing to California. This beer definitely lives up to its reputation and I found it very enjoyable."
"I must have gotten a bad can. I love IPA’s. I was very excited when I found this on the shelf. Anyway... not for me, which is surprising! I’m not going to get into the undertones as I only had 1 can and that wouldn’t be fair. Given the reputation, I will try it again someday."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, deep amber coloration with a small. fizzy head. Smell is a pleasant mixture of caramel malts and citrus hops, with notes of orange rind, grapefruit and a strong pine aroma. Taste follows the nose, with a very nice balance of caramel, bready malt and resinous, citrus/tropical hops. Quite a resinous character, with notes of orange rind, grapefruit, tangerine and just a tiny hint of pineapple as well. Finishes with a medium/strong bitterness, lots of pine and a little booze. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and strong carbonation. This seems like the perfect marriage between and west and east coast IPA with its resinous character, piney bitterness, but also strong maltiness and citrus and slight tropical fruit notes. Probably even nicer when not 4 months old..."
"Taste: crisp, non bitter, balance blend of 6 hops that work together well, mellow clean finish. Fresh and mellow floral hop nose. Amber/gold hue, semi clear,tall foam head with partial ring lattice. Medium body. Easy drinker. 65 IBUs"
"Let me start by saying I live in Tampa so I am partial to this beer. It is literally at every store, every bar and every party you go to. People in Tampa love it. Joey Redner has created a brewery that everyone in the city is proud of. Damn good beer"
Cigar City Jai Alai
Gotta try this at the brewery. The cans (especially out of state) just don't seem to deliver the aroma you get when you order a pint at the brewery. A local go to IPA when in Tampa.
"Poured from 12oz can into Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned on February 22nd, 2018."
"Piney, smooth, alcohol hidden well"
It’s good to see some east coast IPA on the west coast. I’ve lived and worked on both sides. This IPA will do well on the west coast. 
"Had to start visiting Tampa for work when I tried this beer. Hard to miss- it’s everywhere down there. Love this beer. Some classic IPA elements, but reflects the quasi-Tropical origin. There’s citrus in there for sure, but there’s a juicy maltiness balancing it out. Perfect for drinking outside on a hot Tampa night. Thankfully I finally found it on a shelf here in Cali, where it tastes just as good indoors on a crisp sorta-winter night. So glad I don’t have to load up a suitcase with this stuff for my flight home. Now if they will just release the white oak edition out here I’ll never need to visit Florida again..."
"Good beer. Been enjoying this for over 10 years. I can fetch this beer locally for $8.49 a sixer every day of the week. Found it on a visit to Disney on a trip for my girl Angela a few years back around 2010 or so. Fla has this everywhere, including gas stations. If you're in the mood for the citrus taste of the tropics, as I am when visiting Fla, you know what I'm talking about, mid summer, Jai Lai simply taste like your visit when you get there. That's why you visit. Cheers, hop seeker."
"Lol, watching Jai Alais rating tank since Stone became their distributor here on the West Coast. Just yesterday this was 4.8 (3/08/18), now today it's a 4.3. Man F U casuals. Go grab some haze and claim the other gimmicked trashed is the best you've ever had."
Great Citrus IPA without being overwhelming. I had this beer in Disney World and was excited it was available to dull the pain from crowds and screaming kids.
"Pours a clear golden orange with a white head, good retention and lacing."
"At first rather thin looking once poured but with a generous head, lasting and with a bit of lacing. Its strongest and most imposing trait is a strong piney aroma perceivable at a distance. It’s taste is certainly very piney as well, with a rather moderate bitter kick behind it but a less-than-full body that, while below standard for category, plays out more like british pales and is pleasing to those of us recently put off by ever more violent IPAs. In all, a decent brew."
"Slightly hazy light coppery color with a frothy white head, quite lacy. The hops are just noticeable in the mild aroma. Smooth mouthfeel. Mild flavor with a hoppy aftertaste."
Very solid IPA and 7.5% is very well hidden
"A - Great looking hazy orange body, full white head, lots of lacing."
L- Pours a two headed dark golden beer. Very deep and sophisticated color.
Finally having my first Cigar City and enjoying it but reminds me a lot of Stone's Ghosthammer as well as their Hop Revolution Hercules. Not a bad thing I suppose:
Had my first Jai Alai on a trip to FL sucked down plenty while staying at a Disney property for a work meeting. Now I live in FL and I'm never disappointed to see it on tap. Solid IPA....7% standard IMO.
"12oz can, tulip, canned 1/3/18. "
Awesome IPA. Can’t wait until I can try this fresh in Florida in a few weeks time.
This finally made it to Texas. Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Slightly cloudy golden yellow with a fluffy white head and great lacing. Fragrant citrus smell. Grapefruit and orange flavors. Some nice pine bitterness. Excellent beer!
Probably my favorite “old school” IPA! So good!
This is very nice IPA. Had it from a can purchased at the Sheetz by my house. Freakin’ Sheetz! Could not have imagined such a thing when I was a younger jerk. Beer and gas stations have come a long in the last couple of decades. I mean back in the day it was Old Swill and a hot dog from a roller at Dairy Mart. Now you can a good IPA with good character (but not as much citrus character as promised by the can or the smell) and a made to order(ish) chili dog and cheese curds from the local gas station. We’re living in a wonderful time my beer drinking friends.
"Solid, great taste, one of my favorites"
Serving: 12 oz can (stamped “canned on 01/03/
Canned 1/5/18 from the brewery. Consumed on 2/5/18. 
One of my favorite IPAs. 
"Okay, it's not as though we need any more reviews of this acclaimed brew. But after cracking open a can a few minutes ago I was moved ... nay, INSPIRED to rate it, having never done so before. I live in the Baltimore area, where I've never seen it available. Luckily, my mother-in-law lives in Fort Myers, so I grab-n-guzzle a sixer (from the nearby Publix) whenever we visit. Every time I get reacquainted with Jai Lai it's like deja vu all over again. It's just SO delicious. And that's all I have to say about that."
12oz canned on 1-3-18
"Pours a somewhat hazy amber color with a 1/2 finger width foamy head. Head retention is decent. Lacing is good. Has a nice citrus and tropical fruit aroma with some piney resin. Nice, mellow taste. A little more on the malty side. More tropical fruit taste with a good transition to a bitter piney resin. A little soapy at the end. Good beer. Light to medium bodied with mild to moderate carbonation."
"heavy and citrusy, not dry. one of Florida’s best"
Pours a bright gold with a fluffy white head on top. 
"As with many IPAs, this one is certianly subject to how fresh it is. Ive lowered my total score by (0.5 points) purely based on having a can that was four weeks old."
"Fantastic ""Go-To"" IPA. Priced reasonably. Great citrus flavor. Pours darker colored, nice lacing. Great tasting with a pleasant aftertaste as well."
"Pours a nice lacy head in a tulip glass, Smell is awesome with a great hop nose, taste is world class balanced malt and, hoppiness . Feel is balanced from start to finish with no off flavors. A solid almost perfect offering. This beer is always consistent even being from a can."
A great beer. The tropical flavors explode. Tasted pineapple and a cornucopia of blended tropical. An amazing beer available in my supermarket.
"I have to give Oscar Blues credit, whether it's from Tampa or Asheville the taste/color/smell is nearly identical. It's one of the top 3 beers I can buy day in and day out."
"12oz canned 11/22/17 poured into a tumbler glass at fridge temp 7.5% ABV. The beer pours bright light orange honey in color with off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap with some nice lacing. The aroma is orange, grapefruit and tropical fruit. The taste is slight caramel with accents of citrus and tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is a nice bitterness and balance to this beer. Overall, very good. I always look forward to finding this beer fresh."
"Nice powerful citrus pop in the mouth at first mouthful, but not overwhelming. Continues with orange, tangerine , grape, grapefruit in that order . Beautiful pour into a pint glass creating a clear light orange - amber glow in the sun. Drinking this one on a golf course in Boca Raton. Life is good"
"Great taste, and even better kick"
"I love this. Pours a light copper, hoppy citrus smell, grape fruit bitterness tempered by a brown sugar sweetness. Refreshing mouthfeel, Kind of perfect."
"I called it 4.75 overall because there may be something better out there, I just haven’t had it yet. My all time favorite, all styles. Perfect citrus bitter bite. Ruined all others for me, most of all “a-ipas”. Maybe because Jai Alai was my first memorable ipa, but I always find myself saying, “still wish it was a jai alai.”"
"Smells of caramel and vanilla, almost like it was aged in oak barrel... good taste (scotchy) solid finish ... overall good beer but not a favorite... 1-2 is limit at any given time"
"In Florida and have had a few and they are all bad. Did the Hedge Fund ruin Cigar City? And for that matter, I am having a Dale's bought by the same Hedge Fund, and it sucks as well."
Poured to an Ora et Labora taster.
Jai Alai is my favorite beer and it’s not really close. It has the perfect blend of bitter hoppiness and sweet citrus flavor.
"Absolutely delicious. Packs some nice, toasty vanilla and citrus flavors... mango, passionfruot, guava, melon. Very well balanced flavor and texture. Nice head that sticks around for a while"
"Pours a huge, soapy head. Fruity, amazing aroma; touch of candied tropical fruit. Hazy, straw-orange color. Starts with a wonderful, fruity front. Medium bitterness. Lots of fruit and citrus rind behind that."
This beer is really nice. 
had this on tap and from can (not fresh) 
Must try
"Poured from a 12oz can into glass. Stamped canning date is 07/06/17, by Oscar Blues NC for Cigar City. Not as fresh as liked."
Probably wasn’t fresh
A: Golden orange in color with a foamy white head and sticky lacing.
"I don't mind this IPA, but only bought it once. It looked kind of weird, and the can mentioned something about some game that no one plays anymore that the beer was named after and it recommended pairing it with spicy food. This beer is pretty good with food I must admit. This beer was a bit syrupy for me, a bit too sweet and caramel malty, but it is still a very bitter beer, and a tad spicy, which I like."
There is no IPA from bottle or can that I like better. Excellent IPA.
"Pours a hazy gold with thick head and sticky lacing. Nose is full on hops, citrus, floral, and sugar. Taste follows the nose, this one is awesome, clean hops with juicy citrus, some sweetness on the back end, zero bite. I have wanted to sample this for some time and have to say I know why its so popular, its a world class beer. Clean finish light to medium feel."
"A thick, murky honey color. A very strong flavor of fruit and spices that lingers. Price is decent and it's readily available. This is a very enjoyable beer."
Pours fairly clearly; smells citrusy but not particularly overwhelming; tastes great - just the right amount of hops. My favorite IPA!
"Pours a fairly clear amber color with a thick, white head a little over a finger thick. Smell is citrus, malt, pine, and tropical fruit. Taste is bitter, pineapple, caramel, guava, grapefruit, and a hit of pine at the end. Medium body, quick clean finish. It's good, there is a pleasant balance between the hops and malt, Wide variety of flavors. Not my favorite IPA, but something I would certainly enjoy now and then."
"This beer is a party in a can. Amazingly flavorful citrus and spice without being overwhelming. It's kind of like an amped up Blue Moon with a lot more flavor and hops. It's not a party beer but it's like your own personal party, in that it is really enjoyable on its own. Fresh, original, and unique. If this beer was a woman she'd be an exotic princess and a keeper in all ways. Fun, satisfying, and worthy of lots of respect."
Pours medium amber with a thin persistent head
"Purchased a sixer of cans while at the beach. Either my palate has changed a lot over the years or the brothers were working on their 10th or 11th beer at the time they reviewed this one. Perhaps it is a little of both. IMHO, with the quality of American IPAs we have access to today everywhere, it is nowhere close to a 100. I'd put it right in the middle of an 80 and 90. It is a good IPA and has all the stops, but the aroma is lacking and the malts are a little out of balance. Not getting any pine on the nose - all malts and it was canned only a month ago. The beer does, however, taste better as it heats up. The best sips are about half way through a can. I think Jai Alai is a little over hyped or the stuff they are brewing in NC now just isn't as good as it used to be. Or maybe my palate has changed..."
Sampled from can
"12 oz. can reviewed, citrus smell and strong citrus hops, caramel background. "
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 12 fl oz can on July 24, 2017. Canned on 07/07/17. Look is copper. Smell is citrus and tropical fruit. Taste is bitter citrus, tropical fruit and caramel malt. Feel is smooth and creamy."
Rating: just drink it.
"Great ivory colored head that shows up, stays, and leaves tons of lace, and nice chunks. A relatively clear, coppery, dark oaken fluid. You know just by sight the hop content is serious and the supporting cast shows commitment. "
"FANTASTIC IPA. Looks nice. Smells not too strong on the hops. A well balanced mouthfeel. The taste is so very good. Up there with and maybe better than 90 Minute. This is an outstanding IPA. On draft at Miller's Ale House, Destin, FL. Need this one in Texas."
"Pours an orange copper with medium head that leaves some lace. Nose is not nearly as big as I expected from other reviews. Citrus heavy, with some earthy undertones, but even a 4 is being generous here. Taste has an initial fresh orange zest that fades to serious bitterness. Not really much malt backbone here, but enough to prevent it from being astringent. Finish loses the fruit and retains just bitterness and a bit of an ashtray mouth from some odd tobacco notes. Overall, a good beer but not as good as expected. I do like that it is a bit different than every other IPA."
12 oz can
"Pours a foggy, nearly opaque, orange with two fingers of white head. Good head retention, with a good amount of lacing. Aroma is citrus, and herbal hops with caramel as well. Lovely aroma that provides loads of aroma, but without being overwhelming. Flavor profile is citrus, resin, and herbal hops. Caramel hits in the back. Nice deep flavor profile, and yet is plenty quaffible. It may be 7.5%, but it drinks much smoother. Mouth feel is fizzy, with a medium thickness. Overall, an absolute delight to consume."
"This is my all time favorite IPA from the Craft Beer industry, thus far. For me, there is nothing not to like... color, smell, TASTE suits my pallet just fine."
Look: Translucent honey orange with a thick eggshell head. Mild activity. Very nice lacing. 
compliments of my brother Tom...thx Bro!
Amazingly floral and citrusy. Pours a see through golden with a white head. Smells of citrus and pine but the taste is very floral with citrus and again citrus with a dry finish. A very solid IPA that's goes down smoooth with a light bitterness.
I like. Can't pinpoint why it is so smooth.
"I have got this brew a couple times now down in Alabama. Today I poured 3 of them into a thermos and jumped into the pool sipping on them for a couple hours. The tropical fruit stands out. And a biscuit flavor comes through at the tail end. Perfect for in the hot sun. I can see why Cigar City, Flordia loves to brew this one. This is now one of my go to ipa's when I come down south..."
"Cigar City's Jai Alai enjoys a stellar reputation-- and with good reason. This is an exceptionally well balanced beer with a deft hand managing the balance between hoppiness, malt and citrusy notes. I can only imagine the pairing of this beer with equally well made empanadas or deviled crab cakes-- both of which Ybor City produces with deserved pride. If you can find this beer, get it for the true IPA lover in your life. Unless that's you. Then don't share it at all."
"As a Disney nerd in addition to a beer nerd, this is the beer I seek out whenever I'm in Florida. Nice balanced beer with an excellent mix of hoppiness and citrus. On my short list of ""buy it if ever you see it"" beers."
Golden to orange in color that only appears richer once sipped. The aromas don't do justice to the well combined tropical and hopped flavors. The feel is rich and also delivers great effervescence providing a wonderful balance of depth while maintaining it's delicateness. All in all a beautifully balanced IPA.
Good citrusy base with a good hop load! Better on draft than in the can.
On vacation i picked up a 6er in Lakeland. Its delicious. Kinda burnt out on IPAs but this one is a winner. Citrusy floral aroma matches the taste. Easy drinking makes for an enjoyable IPA. Well done.
Perfection!
A 12 fl oz can with a canned on date of 21st March 2017. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.
"Canned on 6/1 so about 6 weeks old. Copper color that had a nice fluffy head when poured in a teku, must have a bit of chill-haze as a little amount of light comes through initially but it clears as it warms. Good lacing on the glass as the head settled. Had a very citrusy smell when the can popped but it faded so quickly, getting a little more bready smell now. Flavor is underwhelming for me. In all fairness I bought this from a Total Wines off the shelf, not out of a cooler. Not sure for how long it had been warm but I have to imagine it's impacting the flavor. Very malty, substantially bitter as it lingers in between sips, a little bit of pine, Drinks lighter than most IPAs, decent amount of carbonation. I am going to blame the conditions this was kept in prior to purchase"
"On tap at the Hangar restaurant, St Pete Airport. Golden bubbles in the glass, and a nice subtle head. Instant hops presence in the nose, with a piney rich flavor on the tongue. Nice malt backbone, but this beer is all hops. Well balanced and enjoyable--and perfect with my spicy shrimp and grits. Loved it!"
"Clear orange-gold pour with a dense and slightly off-white head. Strong hoppy aroma and flavor with lots of pine, resin, tropical fruit and orange peel. Medium bodied and somewhat juicy."
"Look: Apricot gold colored body with super fluffy head and lingering carbonation, slightly off white. Looks great."
Excellent IPA... Hard to find in Michigan
"DATE: July 1, 2017... OCCASION: chilling with Jer after Spikes game with a Liqour Factory growler ($5 off--criminal!)... GLASSWARE: Hopshop 20 oz. pint... with a golden amber body that forms a triple-fingered head of white foam that craters slowly, its creamy body substantial and lasting... mango, grapefruit, the classic citric aromas associated with an IPA (lemon, orange peel, resin)... pepper and other spices suggest a round, full profile... smooth, textured sips whose body belies its 7.5% ABV... a comfortable finish lasts between sips... the resin and tropical fruits build a lively, engaging taste that is at home and encouraging of its next sip... bitterness is short-lived... more than six years after the party began, I finally experience CC's JA's greatness, a balancing act of malts and hops that delivers a nuanced, flavorful IPA..."
Bottle Date: 5/20/17
Very smooth and delicious
"I'm able to get this super fresh in NJ, and it's reasonably priced. It's no Stone IPA but, it's pretty damn good"
"Found this in OBX, NC today randomly; cans dated 6/16/17, so for a MA guy who cannot find this beer on my home turf, this categorizes as a nice freshie find"
Excellent balanced IPA 
"Love this one, the fresher the better. Not good at adjectives, but my favorite warm weather IPA. Refreshing citrusy aroma, deliciously hoppy but not sharp, delightful, not too bitter finish. Wears its fairly serious ABV very well. Enjoyable right out of the can, very, but a glass shows of its hazy golden color, creamy head, lacing, and of course its aroma best."
Look: Nice orange color - quite hazy. Only about a 2 finger head pouring from a can. Nice head retention.
16 oz Pils glass.
what a surprise down south. Especially when you can get it at the Rays game!!!!!
"This is my go to beer. I've tried to find another I like better.. but so far this is the one I keep going back to. It looks good, smells good, taste great and very refreshing with just enough buzz juice to keep you toasty."
Great copper orange gold with a slight haze. Rocky head that dissipates to a small lacing after a few minutes. Nice hop nose. Great clean malt taste and intense pine and citrus hop flavor with an intense but pleasant hop bitterness. A classic American IPA done right.
"The appearance is a somewhat hazy though clear light golden amber/somewhat light yellow and clear colored body. There is a super small carbonation is seen rising at an adequate pace; the head - well holy moley dude this thing absolutely defines ""rockiness"" in the head and how it sustains itself at least to me is quite a show (practically never seen anything like this). The smell has well, this takes a somewhat kinda downfall here, and I realize this is an AIPA that I had after almost 2 months, ok, all I have to say is gee weez - where the heck did the caramel come from and why is it displacing so much of the bitter hops that I typically enjoy in an AIPA (this is why I did this now and not after I got through the entire 6 pack). The taste is super sweet through the caramel malts, and some light hop presence. The aftertaste is somewhat ""swarmy"" through the caramel malts trying desperately to combine with a bitter ""hoppiness."" For the most part, it really didn’t. Hmmm... did I have this too old? However, I will say there is a nice dry finish. The palate is sits about a sort of a medium body of sorts, and it leaves a super dry feel coating the mouth and tongue all around. Overall, in my opinion, I think I need to try this fresher."
"This is my ""go-to, impress my visitor (from CA) friends and family"" IPA. Readily available in supermarkets here, which is a good thing. The juicy tropical hops aroma and flavor are both just....delicious. It has just the right amount of sweetness to counter the wonderful bitterness. Color is a bright copper/orange with some nice haze. This is a 9.9 as far as IPA's go...I rounded up to a 5/5. My favorite Florida beer, hands down."
"12 oz can, canned on 5/9/17. Pours slightly hazy golden orange with a big fluffy white head that retains well and leaves little lacing."
"After this last experience, I had to edit my review... First let me say, some of the cans I've had have been perfect 5's in every category. But then some have been about 4.5. I think the key is having one less than 3 months old and letting the can sit at room temp for about 20 minutes or so before you pop the top. If you get it right, Jai Alai, judged in the category of IPA, has the potential to blow your mind! This review describes Jai Alai at its best. "
Unique can info: CANNED ON 05/09/
"12 oz. can, canned 20 days ago."
Very nice sweet fruit aroma. Citrus and other mellow fruit. Moments of excess that seems to grow as it opens up (too bad). I little earthiness in the hop presentation too.
12oz can dated 4/12/17 poured into a hotel water glass
L: Clear copper gold color with a creamy white head and rings of lacing around the glass.
Crisp fruity smell. Great hop combinations and finish. No bitterness only citrus smoothness.
"Tough to beat when on tap. Wonderful citrus flavor, no bitterness. Well-balanced and incredibly smooth for 7.5 percent, maybe too smooth. It does lose a little bit of its luster when it's more than a few months out, but what IPA doesn't?"
"Look: Yellow, with big fluffy head that sticks around."
"Great balance in this IPA. Reminds me a lot of Founders Centennial. Caramel malts, floral, pine, orange citrus. A bit of sweetness. Really nice but it seemed to lose another of hoppiness after a few weeks. yb"
"Bought a six pack while on vacation. The beer pours with a large head and a very clear, dark golden copper color with eventual thick lacing on the sides. Aromas are rich in pine wrapped in medium citrus. Taste generally follows the nose with a tasty, light but flavorful orange citrus. Mouthfeel is decent with the carbonation, allowing for a very refreshing IPA. Overall, a great look and taste makes this enjoyable and refreshing."
"Copper-bronze with a white head, not much retention but it leaves some lace."
"Look - slightly hazy golden amber with a gigantic off-white head that is rocky and creamy, the bubbles dissipate to a solid ring, there's great retention, and tons of lacing."
"I'm lucky enough to be only 40 minutes from Cigar City Brewery. This IPA is great and I highly recommend it to any beginner in IPA beers. It is very drinkable compared to other IPAs I've been told by non craft brew drinkers. It has a strong, hoppy aroma that can be picked up with quite a distance from the glass or can. Very refreshing on a hot Florida day. A taste that keeps you wanting another with its slightly light taste compared to other Beers in this category. Cigar City really accomplished a lot with this beer."
"I have read a bunch of reviews on this beer and I must have a very unsophisticated palate. Perhaps it is because it is 5 1/2 weeks old. I bought this in Cape Coral and brought it up to New Jersey where I have been really enjoying the local IPAS like 609,Double Nickel and Spellbound, which for me have high marks on all categories. "
Pretty good
Absolutely wonderful and delicious beer I received from my Dad and Sherrie when they were in Florida for this last year's winter vacation of 2017. They gave me a 12 ounce can. Tried it right away and was not disappointed at all. Tangy and tasty..... More than any IPA I've ever tried. A MUST HAVE! Thanks Dad and Sherrie!
Poured into a pint glass
A: Already my kind of IPA. A classic semi-clear light amber with a fluffy and sticky white head.
"Hazy orange color, foamy white head. Tropical fruit aromas, very West Coast in nature. Earthy hop profile, notes of orange. Somewhat sweet, resiny, lingering finish."
Poured from a 12 oz can dated about 3 months out.
"Clean brass and golden yellow color with creamy lacing that seems to hold substantially. Smells like spices as well as blended hops and malt. The citrus is there in the nose as well of notes of pine and floral plants. The taste is effervescent with a strong malt tanginess. I am also finding a little mango as well as orange marmalade. The spices are blended well with the hops and make this IPA seem complex. Definitely not something to guzzle down, but enjoy with all its flavor."
In Florida so I decided to give this popular brew a try. Nice looking slightly hazy copper color with an off white head. Citrus and pineapple scent with some slight pine and malt. Good IPA flavor with my first impression is that it is very much like a Hopdevil. Lively carbonation and slight bitterness on the finish.
"We had this at least twice, trying it at different temperatures, and overall we were underwhelmed, perhaps because the rating is so high. It's good, but nothing about it stood out (note: the last little bit in my glass that came to about room temperature showed some promise in the complexity in the taste and aroma, but that's not the temperature I want to drink this beer at)"
"12 oz can 3/5/17 poured into an IPA glass. Cloudy copper/orange with a one finger head that dissapates quickly to a thin layer of retaining foam . The aroma is tropical fruit (pineapple/mango) and pine/herbal notes. The taste is balanced, lemon citrus piney hops with crystal malts. The mouthfeel is solid, medium carbonation and medium heft with a bitter finish. Overall, glad to finally see this in the area and try it. A well balanced IPA."
"Purchased at a Publix in Naples, FL on spring break 3/23/17 and drunk straight from the can. Pours a hazy bright orange copper color. Smells of mango, tangerine, orange and pineapple, plus other citrus fruits I've never heard of. Taste is citrus and mild hops, but not bitter, similar to a double IPA due to the sweetness. Very refreshing on a warm spring day, definitely worth the hype."
Very rich and hoppy.
"Yellow, white foam."
"Pours orange gold/copper. Medium, thick, off white head. Lasts shortly"
This beer is delicious. I've never had it on draft but it is delicious directly out of the can or poured into a glass. Not overly bitter hops. Just a damn good beer.
Draft with a rich copper color and one inch of a dense white head. The smooth creamy head gives way to a crisp citris falvor. Mild bitterness easily handled by a non IPA guy. Enjoyable!
"On tap at Libations. Delivered in a tulip glass with a nice golden hue, minimal foam. Citrus and pine notes were evident, but didn't overpower. A complete IPA, nicely done Cigar City."
CANNED 03/01/17
This IPA pours a golden amber with a bit of haze. Steady streams of carbonation keep the two fingers of fluffy and chunky white head afloat. Lace is left in chunks.
"Second time trying this one. First one was canned over a month before I got to it which I liked but found nothing remarkable about it, and I'd read that the flavor tends to fall off after 3-4 weeks. This time I got to try one 2 weeks post canning and what a difference. Deliciously balanced IPA"
"It's no juicebomb, but bright, a bit resinous and delightful front the front to the back of the mouth."
"Word to the wise : Jai Alai fades faster than a junior high crush. It also seems some batches last longer than others, which means buying this beer is a lot like playing Russian Roulette. I had a can recently of 6/1/18 that was excellent 10 days out, but just yesterday (7/10/18) I cracked the can and it was just an awful mess of stale caramel malts and onions. I have never encountered a beer that fades that fast and drops off that dramatically. To make matters worse, Jai Alai is HARD to find fresh, but when you do (meaning within one week of canning), buy it up, and drink it THAT NIGHT. I can't express to you how incredibly difficult it is to enjoy this beer. Invasion is that way also to a lesser extent. Expect to put all of your other fridge beers on the back burner while you rip through your Cigar City six pack like it's gonna vaporize tomorrow. A 12 pack flying solo is like risking sneaking a fart when you have food poisoning. It's not fair, and it will keep me from buying as much CC in the future. Due to its horrendous drop off I have to decrease the rating. Finding fresh Jai and having it remain fresh in your fridge when you're not a backyard tailgate smasher is a rare whale poaching indeed."
"Citrus bouquet (maybe grapefruit or orange?), Bold hops...Smooth."
12oz. canned 11/25/16
From Saveur-Biere. In Teku glass. Playing Technobabylon. Smoothness and refreshness are its more remarkable qualities. Full.of tropical fruits with a non-agressive bitterness inciting to drink more
"Bought at Krogers @ Swift Creek Midlothian Virginia on 2/15/17. 6 pack 12oz cans cost $11 plus tax with date on bottom of can - 2/02/17! Fresh as that! Great Find! Pours a golden copper color with 1 finger head. Nice lacing on glass. Great hop aroma (grapefruit, some lemon maybe? oranges peach and a hint of spice!) with a considerable underlying malt backbone to support. Awesome and very well balanced taste!! Tasty! 70 IBU'S but not noticeably bitter! Excellent job by Cigar City and Thank the Beer Gods they sold to Oskar Blues! Will definitely look for this beer in the future!! Enjoy more beers! SEH"
"I went to Disney during the '16 food festival. I'm not sure where I saw her or how the conversation started, but a stranger in Epcot told me she was drinking the best Beer to be had in the park... Jai Alai. I looked everywhere during my weeklong visit and never found it. A month later I was back home in Florida and found this beer in a Panama City Walmart. Loaded up on it and brought it back to try with friends. Finally getting around to review this fine beer. "
Poured the 12oz can into a teku glass.
I picked up a 6-pack of cans ($13.99) while passing through Wilkes-Barre PA a few weeks ago. Have had a couple but now it's time to put thoughts into the record while watching more snow come down here in Southern New Hampshire.... They were canned on 12/28/16....
"From the growler, it pours a lightly hazy amber with a modest head, lacing as you enjoy it. Some pine in the nose. The mouth revels in the well balanced flavor of hops and malt. Yumm!"
"Great balance that a lot of IPAs seem to lack. The bitterness has a place, and actually enhances the flavor instead of being there just to slap the IPA label on it. This isn't some gimmicky beer trying to take advantage of the popularity of IPAs. It was clearly well thought out and deviated from the regular IPA formula to make a delicious unique beer."
Tasted this along side the white oak version while escaping the snow on vacation in Florida. The hops are very present in both the nose and taste. Clearer look than the oak version. Overall a great beer for the hop heads out there. M
"This IPA is delicious with great fruity flavors and aromas from the hops. I wish that this beer was distributed in St. Louis, I make sure to get one every chance that I have."
"best beer at Disney, never heard of it before.Had no access to phone , and ordered this. Delicious, had it both on draft and from 12 oz can. "
Canned 1/5/17.. Pours copper with 1 finger white head.
"This is a classic of the style, and probably Florida's most famous beer. I pick up a sixer every time I can get down here. "
Plenty of reviews on this delicious IPA.
Canned 1/10/17. Pilsner glass.
"Truth be told I'm a bit let down with this one. I've anxiously awaited this for quite awhile so when my buddy brought home a pack from Florida after his trip to the CFP Championship game, I was super stoked. The nose was super subtle, almost non-existent, and the hop profile was very understated. I picked up just a hint of the orange, but the rest of the expected fruit/hop blast I had hoped for was nowhere to be found. The taste followed the nose, and it reminded me more of a low IBU pale ale. Let's just hope it was an old vintage and not typical of what this beer is like fresh."
"Awesome, juicy, fruity, and refreshingly hoppy IPA with an ABV of 7.5% which is why it is my go to IPA for any occasion."
"I’ve had Jai Alai several times and I had it again on my last visit to Cigar City. It is a really great IPA in my opinion. Fruity, juicy, crisp, with all the IPA hop flavors."
Orange color with one finger white head
"fantastic, wish i could have tried it a bit more fresh (8 weeks from canning)"
Still one of my top favorite IPAs. And now readily available in TN!
"Gold copper with a very small head. Kind of hazy. Smell is a wonderful mix of tropical fruit, hops, and pine. Taste follows the nose. Also very resiny. Goes down smooth. Little carbonation. Oily at the front with a semi dry finish. Definitely for the hop head. Excellent IPA. Had this six weeks after canning date. Would love to try fresher."
"The taste delivers immediately following a promising aroma. I have a bad habit of not trusting clear IPAs, but the amber color is certainly appealing. Jai Alai lives up to its reputation."
Delicious and easy to find.
Look- Pours a dark golden with a cream white head
12oz can into libbey tulip
"It has its own identity in the big world of IPAs. Pours copper, as stated and has balance of citrus and hop notes on aroma. Taste is exactly like the nose. It is a tad more of west coast style in terms of IBU and mid west style in terms of malts."
pretty good. not the greatest. but something different. can definitely see how the carmely citrusy thing goin on is something you may not constantly wana sip on but its still pretty decent brew.
"I love this beer. I'm a transplant from Maryland to Southwest Florida, this has become my got to beer and absolutely one of my favorites. Great copper color in the glass, hoppy without too much bitterness and goes down too easy."
"Poured from a 12 oz can,into a Cigar City IPA Spiegelau glass."
"Pours smoky copper with a rich thick head in a pilsner glass. Laces the interior as you drink. Aromas of citrus and pine. Up front taste is hoppy but not overwhelming. After taste of citrus fruit comes through slightly bitter and warm. Mouth is full and creamy. Overall this is an awesome IPA, right up there with my all time favorites."
"L: Translucent, slightly hazy dark orange, almost copper, with a creamy, off white head. Excellent retention and lacing."
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Lots of sticky, off-white foam. Transparent copper orange color with a fair amount of carbonation. Soapy lacing as the glass is emptied. Smell is pungent citrus and pine. Taste is overloaded with hops up front but does not linger very long. Seems to take a backseat to the underlying malt by the end of the sip. Far more complex than your average IPA. Mouthfeel is full and the hops continues to bite the back of your mouth after the initial sip. Very good IPA albeit not the best. Would definitely have it again if offered to me!"
Just had this from a can at bongos Cuban cafe in disney springs. Really enjoyed it.
Great easy drinking IPA.
Drink fresh! Don't buy if aged... still drinkable but malty and not as enjoyable.
Poured from a can with a canned on date of 10/5/16; into a pint glass.
"Nice IPA. Poured a nice copper-apricot color with fine white head that held for a while. Very nice body with fine carbonation. Not much of a nose, hint of pine. Pine resin upfront with some bitter citrus and some malt sweetness on the backend which is a nice finish."
"Fruity, piney and floral hops balanced with fine, almost peppery, malts make this beer a pleasure to drink. It's bold and could be consider as a dipa, it has the profil. It's west coast style even if it's brewed in Florida"
Very Tasty ipa!
Great hoppy up a from cigar city. 2016
12oz cans either poured into a glass or straight from the can. 
The best beer in the state and one of my favorites nationally. Beautiful light copper unfiltered color. Superb head leaves a full glass of lacing. Smell is all orange peel. Mouthfeel is full and enough hops to retain a smooth oily feel. Taste is orange citrus initially with grapefruit retention in the finish. 100 percent better on tap than canned. A superb IPA that warrants it's world class rating. And one of my three favorite beers of all time.
"Beautiful IPA. It is less citrusy than your average American IPA, but there is a subtle grapefruit that comes through. I pick up a nice malt balancing out the hops with a hint of tobacco. Overall, this is an excellent ale that will be a part of my regular rotation."
"Color is a deep thick honey with an orange hue. The smell indicates a heavy citrus/orange flavor, but the taste does not follow suit, and that is a great thing. I love this beer, full of hoppy flavor and just a hint of bitterness. Very well balanced beer."
"Well, this may be my new favorite everyday IPA. Smooth with a great finish, not too hoppy. I drank this so fast I need more. Just a solid year-round beer."
"Single can purchased at United Ale House in Ft. Myers. Pours a golden, copper, amber hue, with moderate frothing. Strong aroma of citrus zest with notes of lemon, grapefruit, and pine. Very similar flavor, with strong pine presence. Extremely well balanced and very drinkable. Recommended."
"As a Tampa native, I am so damn proud of this beer. This was one of the best beers I've ever had so far (although my journey has only yet begun). "
Just moving to Florida! Have had this before but am now drinking it more regularly. It has really grown on me and is now my go to beer? Love the fruit and piney tastes! Has a nice lacing head. Glad I came back to this and lucky enough to have it available fresh year round! UPDATE: This is a new Jai Alai! They have changed the recipe! It is not as tropical as it used to be and seems to be dumbed down on flavor some. IBU’s went from 70 to 65 - it’s just not the same - why mess with a good thing? Also I’ve found this same beer brewed by Oskar Blues in North Carolina! What gives Cigar City?
"Never heard of CCB but it's the only IPA on tap tonight at Ugly Oyster, Reading,PA Having my second one. Agree with all the positive reviews here. Served in a pint glass, nice foamy head. Great flavor. Never noticed that it's a 7.5 abv brew."
"On tap at the Mucky Duck, Captiva Island, FL."
Purchased a growler from a local beer store and poured a glass the first night in a regular beer glass. Beer poured a golden color and you could taste a slight bitterness (not much though). I would drink this one again in the summer or the winter.
"Can dated 06/30/16 into a Speigelau IPA glass. Pours a bronze orange with 2 fingers of variable density white head that left substantial lacing. Nose is great, nice balance of citrus with some tropical fruit, including mango and pineapple. The taste is good, mirrors the nose with some sweetness, but honestly the nose built up an expectation that I didn't feel the taste matched. Substantial astringency on the finish with some bitterness, bit of a citrus (perhaps grapefruit) that lingers. Mouthfeel is nice, just enough body but yet still easy drinking, carbonation is medium. It's a damn good IPA!"
"Juicy juicy ya ya yeah yeah! Beer so good you sing disco. Gorgeous color, smells divine, and the flavor, piney/tropical up front with a rolling cascade down the tongue leaving a mellow yet increasing bitter at the back of your palate. Not as deadly as the sport but we'll played Cigar City"
"Canned on 7/5/2016. Poured into pint glass. It pours a cloudy orange-amber color with one finger of milk-white head and lacing. It features a nice strong, fruity aroma of lemon peel, orange, pineapple, and floral hops. The taste is very fruity: tangerine, lemon, and mango; with a malty backbone and a hint of caramel. It also has an interesting spicy finish that complements the hops. It's really a unique flavor that I can't compare to other IPA's I've had. The mouth feel is rather chewy with moderate carbonation, and its 7.5% ABV is barely noticeable. I could see drinking a few of these by the pool or at the shore. Overall, Jai Alai is a well-crafted, delicious, and unique IPA that merits its outstanding rating."
I have to admit there is no other beer like this one . I have sampled a 100 or so IPA styles and only a few have the overall drinkable satisfaction this has to offer. Blessed to have this remarkable beer made 20 miles from my refrigerator. Cheers. !!! Must try it to believe yourself.
"A very damn good IPA - all the things I look for -- citrusy and yes - rather bitter!! Good, lasting head and copper color. Had on tap at Tria at Rittenhouse, Phila where, btw it was reasonably priced at $6 a pint."
"Great IPA that is refreshing and balanced....perhaps if not a big hop forward. However, I don't mind that."
Poured into snifter
Draft in pint glass
"An outstanding example of the IPA class of beers. Living near Tampa, I receive very fresh samples of Jai Alai (pronounced: ""Hi Lie""). Last sixer was 7 days in the can - wife says that tonight's sixer is dated 7 days old as well (she called from store to ask if date was OK). From the pop of the top - you KNOW this is going to be something special. The aroma fills the room! Fruit - citrus and wow! I understand that CCB uses Ahtanum hops for aroma - and one can tell. Head is off-white and lacey. Taste has to be experienced.... It is the World Class IPA that other IPAs try to be - just like the Bros say. A deliciouse beverage that is up there with the ABV pushing the IIPA boundry - but it is not noticed due to the sensory experience of the beer. A bit pricey - but worth it. Not my everyday beer - but a sixer on Friday is to be expected in my home (and it IS Friday!). This is my favorite IPA."
"This beer is weird. Looks nice, smells like citrus hops and wonder bread factory and tastes floral and minty in addition to the citrus and bread notes. Not bad but .... Weird."
"I paid way too much for a single on-tap pour of this earlier tonight at a Rays game at Tropicana Field that my wife and I went to with some friends of ours during our currently ongoing vacation in Sarasota, FL. We have to leave early Friday morning, so I figured this might be the only chance I get to drink this awesome beer this time around, so I went for it since I do really like this beer and haven't reviewed it here yet. Served to me in a plastic pint glass cup, this beer draws a slightly cloudy/hazy, medium copper color. The color and level of haziness/cloudiness of this beer reminds me a lot of apple cider, only the beer's color is slightly lighter than apple cider typically is. Had a head that was a good 2/3 inches thick when first served to me that settled eventually to a medium sized cluster swirl of foam floating around in the middle of the beer's surface along with a fairly thick ring of foam lining the inside of the glass. Has a slightly bready/biscuity, somewhat toasted sweet caramel malt aroma that immediately gives way to a big citrus and mango hop aroma. The taste is pretty much exactly the same, only even better than the aroma, with a bit of a bready/biscuit, fairly toasted caramel malt sweetness along with pungent citrus and mango hops. The hops certainly dominate, but the pungent, juicy hop flavor is not overly bitter either by any means. An excellent flavor profile indeed! Has a fairly crisp, yet smooth, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a very nice aftertaste. A real winner of a beer here!"
Love this beer and never rated it. 
"One of my favorite FL brews. Light and refreshing, but packs a lot of flavor. Tropical fruits & mango flavors stand out enough to make it unique, but are not overwhelming. I've had it out of the can and on tap, and never has it disappointed! A good solid IPA year round, regardless of the occasion."
This is a truly amazing IPA. After a few years of wanting this beer finally had a trade go through for Jai Alai and the year of so of waiting was well worth it.
"Smells delicious out of the can, tropical fruits and nice pale malts. There are enough reviews to describe the flavor - which is really nice - but what stands out to me is the mouthfeel... its kind of thick/oily, but drinks really clean. Almost like drinking juice, but without an harsh acidity. A+"
"Had this on tap at Dick's Last Resort in Panama City Beach. I usually don't drink IPAs, But this was the best IPA I've ever had. In fact It was so good I had 3 of them at the bar."
I enjoyed this beer very much. Good balance in the body w/the profiles. An initial scent of pine & citrus (orange?). Flavor follows the nose w/ sweet malt & some bitterness. Goes down creamy & smooth. A very solid IPA
"Poor's a great, copper color, nice citrus, bitter flavor. A little fruity finish. Top of the line in Florida"
"Golden in color, light lacing. Aroma is floral hops with light scent of oranges. Citrus presents itself first on the tongue, quickly shifts to sweet malt that ends on a spicy bitterness. Feel is smooth, almost creamy. Very nice ale. Wish I had more than one."
"Great IPA. Strong hops, but done well. Great beer for any hophead."
"A beautiful and hazy pour hits the glass in a vibrant, orange color. The head that forms is frothy and about 2 fingers thick with great lacing. Scent is of mild, pine bitterness up front, with a touch of citrus hop profile towards the end. Along with the citrus, there is just a touch of a sweet smell at the end as well."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a one inc white, well retained head that left a lot of lacing. Strong citrus aroma , predominately orange with hints of tropical fruits. Taste is strong, sweet orange followed by slightly bitter grapefruit, nice malt flavor and tropical fruit notes. Very well balanced, moderate to high carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. Excellent IPA especially for the price."
"A hazy copper color with a huge cap of white foam that was very persistent and lead to great lacing. Big citrus hop aroma with grapefruit and tropical fruit dominating. Tastes well balanced, the high ABV, nice body and strong citrus hops work well together. Mouthfeel was crisp, finish a bit resinous. Really well made IPA."
I dunno why nearly all the FL beers are in cans. Very good.
"Pint on draft at Brass Tap in Oldsmar, Florida."
"Pours a quite hazy, copper-orange with lots of carbonation. Also, a white, foamy head that leaves lots of lacing."
"12oz can poured into ""IPA"" style glass. Canned on 05/05/16"
"Excellent citrus hopped ipa. Pours a slightly cloudy mixture of tans and golds with a beautiful frothy head. The hops addition tastes as it smells, but the inherent malt flavor either doesn't jive with me or is just a bit too far in the background, even for an ipa."
Absolutely a lovely beer that pairs well with heavy meats and Italian.
"My cousin mailed a sixer of this to my house as a wedding present. (He's young and single, but somehow must have known that marriage may sometimes require some quality beverages in order keep the wheels spinning smoothly.) And this is no doubt a quality beverage. (As for whether the wheels will actually continue to roll smoothly is another matter.) Great hazy/orangey look to this stuff. Nose is fantastic, bursting with tropical fruits.. Pineapple, orange/tangerine, maybe some banana. Taste follows the nose with a satisfying hop presence and strong, but appropriate citrus overtones. A great summertime IPA. Mouthfeel is crisp and nice, and pairs very well with the flavor of this beer. Not bad for a selection from a 21 year old.. or an 81 year old for that matter. Good stuff, different, and highly recommended. Cheers!!"
"New to reviewing beers...but one of the best IPAs I've enjoyed. I can't articulate it as well as many. But, I will say it has the intense hoppy and citrus flavors I want in an IPA. Additionally, it finishes smoothly -- similar to a nice cream ale."
A: Amber body with a thick white head. Head gets a bit sudsy as it dissipates.
"A really solid IPA, but also distinctive. It is exceptionally smooth, sitting somewhere between an east and west coast IPA, but being something totally distinct. It is bitter like an east coast IPA, but without the earthiness that characterizes the style. At the same time, it doesn't go all-in on the aromatics. Very good beer."
Excellent IPA that is finally available in PA. Yippee!
12 oz. can poured into a tulip glass. Canned in Feb 2016. 
Draught. An especially dank ipa. West coast style. Citrus notes. Very flavourful.
"Very tropical with citrus overtones. Had it in can and finished pithy with a bit of metallic which I think came from can, couldn't find date; may have been old."
"Canned 4/25/16, poured 5/11/16"
"Pours light copper in color with a soapy white head. Aroma is huge tropical and citrus fruits, and it almost smells exactly like pog juice. Taste follows with citrus rind bitterness up front, followed by citrus and tropical fruit flavors which are rounded out by some caramel malt sweetness and hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and easy drinking, with just enough carbonation to scrub the palate and make you want more. Overall, this is a wonderful ipa that hits a great balance between fruity and bitter."
Can poured into a BarrelHouse Brewing Co pint glass
"From a can into a pilsner glass at Trump's place in Doral, Florida. I would say this is one of the three best IPAs I have had the pleasure of drinking. Wonderful juicy hops with tons of tropical fruit but also a dankness that reminds me of our storm/canning/pickling cellar when I was a kid in Oklahoma. That part seems more like a DIPA and is always welcome in any IPA I drink. If you haven't had one, put it on your bucket list. You'll be glad you did. CIGAR CITY...send it to Houston!!"
"This is a nearly perfect American IPA with a signature citrusy, hop filled taste upfront, solid mouthfeel, and lingering finish. Try it and you will not be disappointed."
"Smell: loads of tropical fruit & citrus, floral hops."
Sampling a cold 12 oz can poured into a tumbler. The beer pours a bright and mostly clear copper to orange hue. 
"This one is darker than average, almost a light auburn color. Aroma had a small amount of hops. Nothing massive. Couldn't even discern if there was dry hopping."
been wanting to try this for a while. nice nose and taste of orange and tangerine with slightly bitter end. overall a nice ipa but a little overpowering with the orange.
I love this....it's a standard....I just drank a few of these a couple days ago and it was awesome. Such a nice break from the NEIPA's....
Smell: orange mango honey some fruit sweetness.
"L: Pours orange-copper with mild haziness, creamy 2- finger head"
Reasons to visit FL #1
Re-rated and reviewed 4/4/17.
"Been wanting to try this for a while. First Cigar City beer. Can is fairly fresh dated 3-9. L: copper. S: nice tropical smell. Sweet malt, citrusy hops. T: tangy citrus washed down with a watery hop finish. F: light-medium. O: not enough hop bite for me, and too sweet. Also, second can I consumed had a really wierd flavor going on that I didn't like. Like peat smoke. No bueno."
"This is a top notch IPA. Slightly more fruity than expected on the nose. Great Hop hit at first taste along with more malt than you would expect however the Hops win the battle. Very well balanced. Like every good IPA, this one makes me happy. If you are questioning if you should try it; don't waste any more time. You should."
A true go to IPA. Cigar City nails it. Rock and Roll Hoochi Coo! Best can of IPA with the freshest dates available. 
"I love this beer, great bitter hop flavor and aroma. If you are looking for fresh beer you can't get much closer than Jai Alai. It seems Cigar City prides themselves on fresh beer. I'm located in north Florida and all I've seen is at most a week old. Great beer but a tad bit pricey $10.99 average."
This beer really packs of punch of hops to the face.
Sharp. Citrusy.
One of my favorites of the Florida brews.
"Kind of a chameleon beer for me. I get a 6 pack of this every time I go to Florida on vacation. It has always been a great beach beer for me. It was usually citrus forward with bitter orange peel and grapefruit type hop vibe. I just got back last week from Florida and had my usual 6 pack. Seemed like a different beer to me. it was DANK...as it warmed, it tasted more and more like liquid pot. no off tastes, nothing wrong quality wise, but it seemed like a different beer. It was brewed 3 weeks prior, so it was fresh. it was much more of a slow sipper than a beach banger. Still a fine IPA, but with much more sticky, dank qualities of a DIPA. I must admit that I missed the citrus beachy version, though."
This beer is really good. 
"Much better fresh, which isn't shocking..."
"I was shocked with how malty this beer smelled/tasted initially - not what you'd expect from an IPA. Its a very hoppy beer, yet somehow the predominate taste was carmel-y biscuit malts with a bitter hop aftertaste. Not very balanced to my palate. Tried this in conjunction with a Sunshine City and the Sunshine City blew this one away in my opinion."
Superb
Solid fuckin 5
Amazing example of an American pale ale. Real depth of flavour from the grain and well balanced. Like liquid marmalade.
"Dark orange pour one finger head. Beautiful flowery hop aroma. Citrusy as well. Kind of a candied fruit. Pineapple. Strong malt first sip. Truly balanced. A kind of piney, sappy, bitterness. Bit of a lemony taste. Bitter oranges. Mouthfeel, well carbonated. Kindly of frothy. Overall, like standard oil. This is what most IPAs wish they were."
Clear orange body with persistent and sticky off-white head. 
"Canned 3/19/16 but it doesn't taste like Jai Alai I remember, seems to be a bit more malt rather than citrus flavor. Not sure if this is just a bad batch I'm drinking but disappointed in this one here."
"On tap at Three Forks in Jacksonville. Side note, it is great to see a good beer list at these high end restaurants."
Cigar City Brewing - Jai Alai. 7.5% ABV. 12oz can into a snifter. Canned on 2/11/16.
Pour: On draft at the Jeffery in NYC. Poured into a tulip. Appearance: Dark amber and orange in color with a finger of white head. Very nice bit of lacing present. Aroma: Citrus upfront. Dank and juicy hops. Floral and herbal notes are present as well. Taste: Follows the nose with dank and juicy hops. Some bitterness and a subtle malty backbone. Aftertaste: finishes sweet and a little boozy. Malt character is very present on the back end. Overall: My fist foray into Cigar City Brewing. Really liked the offering and will seek out their other beers.
Canned 3/11 and poured 3/22. Thanks to Tony for picking this up for me when in Tampa for Hunahpu Day. Needless to say... I've wanted to try this beer for as long as I can remember. Looking forward to this almost as much as the Pliny!
Dark orange with a massive head that dies down to a tigerstripe surface and sticky matt lacing on the glass.
"Looks like an IPA should. Solid head when poured from can, and it sticks around. Juicy taste, refreshing but sticky mouthfeel. If you like the tropical fruit taste pineapple sculpin but want something not flavored, here is your beer, and it's delicious!"
"Can into a snifter. Vibrant gold/orange with moderately good clarity. Good carbonation, and topped with a 1 finger head of fluffy, sticky, white foam. Beautiful notes of citrus, grapefruit, mango, hops, pineapple, and light malt on the nose. Super juicy aroma. The taste follows perfectly, bringing tart grapefruit, sweet citrus, slightly bitter hops, and all with a soft, delicate malt backbone. This beer is not complex, but it is masterfully well-balanced. Super juicy and wet, the only way this beer will disappoint you is if you over-hype it in your head to be something it's not. This one is amazing."
Another winner. Florida has shown me a bunch. 
Canned date was 2 months ago. Relatively fresh poured into a tulip glass.
"This is a good beer, but I was a little disappointed once I finally got a try it (yes, fresh). Very pretty beer but the smell is a little boring. The taste is a decent blend of citrus and tropical flavors that are overpowered by malts. Feel is nice enough, but a little too sweet and boozy for my preferences. Glad I finally got to try it, but I doubt I will go back for more."
"I first tried this in March at Cigar City in Ebor/Tampa. It wasn't bad but it was served a little on the warm side for my taste. I was recently in the Cape coral/ Ft. Myers area of Florida and had it several times at various venues. Ford's Garage, World of Beers and Doc's in Ft. Myers and The Boathouse Tiki Bar & Grille in Cape Coral. A little colder and I liked it more. Easy to drink on a hot day."
"Orange, with just a tough of copper. Smell is malty with some citrus notes beneath the sweetness. Taste is Orange candy. Much better than the smell led on. Little bit of stickiness on the feel."
"This has been my go to IPA. I still branch out and try new stuff one actually topped Jai Alai for me. I've been drinking IPA almost a year now and can't really tolerate mainstream beer like bud, bud light, miller etc.."
"Had this on tap. Hazy orange amber in color with a fluffy white head, left a lot of sticky lacing. Smells resinous, citrusy, and with some malty sweetness. Taste is more malt forward than I expected, with the hop flavor and bitterness developing across the palette. Big orange, tangerine, and mango flavors, sweet enough to counteract the strong hop presence. Feel is smooth with a sticky aftertaste, lots of lingering bitterness on the finish. Overall this was a good IPA. I don't think it QUITE lived up to the hype for me, it wasn't the runaway winner of the ""best IPA in my life"" award. But it's still a very good beer. Somewhat hard to find in PA, so I probably wouldn't go out of my way to have another."
Very smooth and remarkably well balanced for containing six hops. Found it to have a pleasant aroma upon opening. Maintains your average IPA mouth feel.
L: Pours a mildly hazy golden-orange with a white head.
"A tie for my favorite extra hoppy ipa. I may be a little biased as it is regularly available in local stores and bars and is brewed and bottled just down the road in Tampa. Had my first one with a fish taco...the taco was good but the beer was absolutely tasty. Totally agree with most reviews re..orangey, floral, honey, hoppy, delicious! Very bold but really easy to drink. A little pricey at about $10 for a six pack locally, but worth every penny. If you get the chance, try this little slice of heaven."
Fantastic IPA. Very well balanced. Citrusy and Hoppy on the front end. Nice bitter punch in the mouth.
Can. Raglan Road Orlando
"Pours a clear golden hue with good foam. Aroma is high of floral hops, very delicate & enticing with notes of honey blossom & tropical citrus. I found it to be a very elegant & well balanced IPA. The notes are predominantly tropical citrus with passion fruit & mango being detectable. There is some hop bitterness through the end but it isn't over-the-top. Overall this is an excellent, eminently drinkable IPA, one of the best"
Fine ballance. Gives Vermont a run for the money
"This IPA really hits the senses! Very noticeable scent of pine and citrus fruits with taste that matches. Great lacing head and mouthfeel. I'm not going to say it's the best tasting IPA I've had, but it's very well balanced!"
Finally found this in VA. Canned 1 month prior.
"Copper colored, white head, sticky lacing. Smells sweet with orange blossom aroma and caramel. The taste is sweet caramel orange and flowery hops. Medium body with medium caucusing. Dangerously drinkable beer."
"12oz. can served in a shaker pint (thanks Mike!). Canned 01/06/16. Pours a lovely golden orange with a tight, half-inch, cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th cap. Light spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is somewhat subdued - evidence of citrus notes and yeast as well as a kiss of tropical fruit. Taste expresses citrus, an earthy/herbal quality and a trace of caramel malt. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of lively and a light acidity. Overall, a decent IPA - I'd be happy to have this as a readily accessible offering; however, it didn't knock my socks off."
"12 oz can. Bright clear orange, thick creamy white head with good retention and coating lace. Sweet fruity citrus aroma. Juicy tropical taste, like biting into a tangerine. Just enough cracker malt balance. Medium slick mouthfeel. Such a clean taste, get this bad boy any time I go to the Sunshine state."
"A really nice IPA from cigar city, a little high on the abv, bordering a double, which is not a bad thing. Super juicy hops on taste and aroma, a must have if in FL"
Canned 1-11-16.
"I love this IPA, I have tried IPAs in 47 of the 51 states and prefer one from my home town over anything I have ever tried,\. I am on my fifth one this evening. The Jai Alai is smooth and I like."
From the can: Canned 01/15/16 Made in Tampa 12918
"This beer pours a beautiful, slightly hazy golden orange color with a two finger off white head. Retention is decent and there are many rings of lacing. Smell is orange, tangerine, mango and pine with a little bit of sweet and bready malt to balance it out. Taste is the same, but very complex. The flavors really blend together in quite a magical way. There is a good deal of bitterness on the front, but the finish is sweet and so smooth. Feel is light side of medium with excellent carbonation. Overall a great IPA. This to me is a perfectly balanced beer. The malt compliments the bitterness perfectly without getting in the way of the hop flavors."
"COD 1/2/16. Pours a clear orange/amber. World class head volume, lacing and retention."
"I've heard and read about and of course wanted to try this beer. I flew down to ATL for work and bought a 6er at a local spot in little 5 points. I'm kinda disappointed. Nothing really special. I'm from the Chicagoland area and We have better. I just read a review comparing it to two hearted. That's not saying much. My craft beer taste buds started with fat tire when you couldn't get it past the Mississippi and then turned to two hearted ale. So far I'm way past the taste and didn't do anything special. Wasn't bad, but wasn't great"
Love the orange color. How do they do that? Good thick head and retention. Aroma gets you right away with the citrus and slightly tropical hoppiness. Taste is the same and so flavorful. Will try to find some more as a go to IPA.
Just like a heady.
LOOKS: Cool looking orange/amber. 2 fingers of foamy off white head that lingers. Moderate carbonation rising. Very clear beer. Leaves good looking lacing down the glass.
"Very rarely do I come across a much hyped beer and feel it lives up to expectations. In the case of Jai Alai, right off the bat, out of the can, I wasn't impressed - weak head, minimal lacing, but it did have a nice ochre color, very appealing. That's where all the disappointment happened. The odor was just enough citrus mixing well with the strong hoppy scent. I really liked the lightly carbonation - it's perfect for my tastes. Speaking of tastes, it was amazing - almost sweet, citrus (mostly oranges), all of it blending well with the bitter hops. Like I said, rarely does a brew much hyped live up to expectations when I get to it, but Jai Alai did just that."
Had at Lani Lai resort restaurant in Ft Myers Beach. Really nice IPA this one. The aluminum can was awesome too.
"Pours identical to so many other IPAs out there, golden yellow with a subtle orangy/amber hue and a finger of slightly off-white foam."
"Stellar ipa. Hoppy nose, tons of citrus, nice medium mouthfeel."
Great to find a beer like this on the east coast! Tastes like a west coast IPA.
"Fresh Jai Alai is a thing to behold, I wish I was closer to Florida so I could have it more often. This could definitely be my go to six pack. A no frills hoppy, citrusy, sessionable IPA. What's not to love"
Draft in Tallahassee at Cypress.
"pours a clear dark orange almost brown color. white fluffy head that actually sticks around for a decent amount of time. smell is very tropical and fruity, mangoes, citrus fruits, stone fruits, with a caramel/bready malt smell that is very light. taste is everything I wanted from this beer: tropical, mangoes, peaches, slight orange, bright citrus, with a semi sweet caramel malt backbone that eventually turns into a toasty one. this beer is like a new england haze bomb, without the haze, so it has a level of ""cleanness"" that a lot of these new hazy beers dont have. But it sure has the hop flavor profile of a New England IPA. Mouthfeel was great and carried the tastes all the way through to the end, almost no coating or slick feeling from this beer. very happy that I live so close to stores that get this now, i will grab it anytime I see it on a shelf."
Very tasty IPA that I picked up at Walmart. I'm new to Florida and was excited to try this brew. It's very good and great that you can get easily.
"pours from a 12oz can golden orange with a good head. fragrant flowery aroma. resin, lemon and a hint of pomegranate balance out the sweet malt. finish smooth with more resin."
"Fortunate enough to try this on tap at Craft Beer Co Covent Garden. Big, heavy hitter. Resinous, fruity, spicy hops held up by a huuuge body of dry, caramel malt. Clean yeast leaves you with an immensely long hoppy finish. Amazing stuff. Getting it in good condition like this means I can really see the hype over American IPAs."
"Damn good stuff here. Kept seeing this on the trading forums and glad I got this as an extra. Very nice feel, beautiful feel and taste very unique from most IPAs I have had. Bit of citrus, tad bitter from the hops but nothing crazy and a solid finish. Worth the trouble."
I had it in Disney. 
"Jai Alai is a uniquely robust IPA in that it's got the typical piney scent and taste, but it feels so full bodied that I feel like I'm drinking a heavier beer than I am. It's smooth yet it's somewhat overpowering. It's a very good beer."
super fresh!
"Description: Copper, light brown appearance with a white head that quickly dissipates. No significant lacing or legs on the glass. The smell is a fruit bouquet with strong notes of pineapple, mango, orange and a bit of pine/resin. There also seemed to be something else sweet (honey?) that I couldn't quite put my finger on. I love it when a beer tastes just like it smells and that's the case with this one: lots of tropical fruit up front with a bit of bitter hoppiness on the finish giving it a nice balance between the two. Alcohol was not really discernible. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with medium carbonation so...medium?"
Poured 12oz can into glass. 7.5% abv Appearance- Pours an orange amber. Semi clear with a nice medium head that remains throughout.
Had in punta Gorda Florida. Surprised by high alcohol percent. Easy to drink and alcohol not noticeable. Nicely hopped. Tasty
"Appearance: slight transparency, deep orange. "
"I was underwhelmed at Three Floyds in the fall of 2015 when I tried this ipa during the Cigar City takeover. Perhaps, it was too hoppy for my taste and lacked balance that I often look for in a brew."
Perfect for any occasion
East coast IPA all the way. I prefer west coast. that being said. This is a great classic IPA bitterness balanced with matiness.
"L- bright copper orange in color, and a white head that pours about a finger thick head, which settles into an attractive white layer on top. beer is very clear."
"Pretty well balanced with good amount of hops, citrus and nice malt finish. Would try again."
Maybe my favorite IPA (that I can regularly get). Just a superior ale in every way.
"Appearance: pours an orange color with a 1/4"" head that falls to a thick surface covering."
Not much of an IPA drinker myself but CCB's Jai Alai introduced me a while back to what a truly masterful style this is. Citrus notes predominate and the mouthfeel is elegant and welcoming.
2015-12-23
"Nice big rocky head and citrus aromas greet you on the pour. Flavor is more citrus, and pineapple, pine tree, sourdough bread. Hazy light amber with lingering bitter finish. Excellent!"
"Total hop-machine here. Pours with a generous head and nice lacing, with shiny-new-penny copper coloring. Smells as good as you would expect a hop-heavy IPA to smell, with some grapefruit, other citrus and peach/apricot/mango notes subtly in there, and a pervasive wet cardboard smell, which is what I suppose a lot of people call ""biscuity."""
Looks great. Copper hazy. Brilliant fluffy white head. 
"Not dank or piney but more passion fruit-forward than anything else. Reminiscent of Hawaiian Sun or Aloha Maid passion orange drink that I used to enjoy when I was a kid. Sugary, sweet, citrusy with a light malt body. Interesting beer."
Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Relatively dark amber color. The smell is inviting. The taste even more so. My wife is not a beer drinker per se but she shared this with me and found it to be a very good beer. The after taste that lingers is a nice light hop bitterness. This beer lives up to all the hype.
12 ounce can poured into a tulip glass
A: Orange-amber. Frothy head with good lacing. 
Poured 12oz can into glass. 7.5% abv
"Dark orange pour with a sticky off white head. Retention is excellent. The nose is grapefruit, tropical fruit, earthy. Hops are powerful in taste, with the tropical fruits really coming through. Also a little pine and a nice bitter bit on the swallow. The mouthfeel is excellent, medium body, medium carbonation, and supremely smooth. An all around excellent IPA."
Taste the hops from the get go and the finish activates the bitter taste buds towards the back of the tongue. Prefer the taste of A Victory Dirtwolf.
"Citrus aroma and flavor. The more it ages, the more citrus comes through. My go to IPA in Florida."
L-Muddy oak colored...nice lacing
"Reddish Amber hues, regardless of how ""gently"" you pour it, you will have the yeast suspended in it. orange citrus aroma. Citrus, slightly bitter taste with clean minutely bitter finish, no strong alcohol flavor. Lightly carbonated. No overwhelming malty notes when you finish the experience, you just need to get another one."
Poured from the can into a snifter.
"Gifted this from BoldRulerVT...Thanks! A month-old can poured into glass, pours a clear light-copper color with a creamy light-tan head that leaves big lace. Aroma is a little juicy, a little piney, not super aromatic, but smells nice. Taste starts out really juicy. It reminds me of a kind of tangy orange juice. This is followed by a significant and lasting bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right....zesty, medium-bodied, crisp. Overall, this is really nice. I'm glad I got to try it."
"Great IPA, and I'm a stouts guy. My go-to beer when I'm in FLorida. Too bad it's not distributed to Ohio."
"Got these from some friends who traveled to Florida, canned mid October so relatively fresh"
Had this when I was in Miami circa 2014.
"Pours clear, copper in color, with 1/2 inch head. Grapefruit, pineapple, and pine hops mix with a rich caramel base. This makes for a very well balanced semi-bitter beer. Really tasty and juicy. I will get this again...One of the better IPAs I have had in a while."
"Treated as an American IPA, I poured this into a pint glass."
On tap at Tampa brew pub. 
"My first brew from Cigar City and I must say it lived up to the hype. Superb flavor all the way through. Nice hop hit at first then smooth the rest of the way. Nice citrus/fruity flavor throughout. Excellent beer, highly recommend."
"From a 12 oz can: pours a beautiful hazy honey-gold with a half-finger or so of frothy but dense head. Smell is initially pine and grapefruit, but quickly switches to a more malty, earthy smell, with tropical fruit mixed in. Also a little burnt sugar/cotton candy in there. Taste is very complex, with the malt coming through stronger than hops at first, before a piney, citrus aftertaste that is nicely dry and bitter. Downside is a slightly metallic flavor in the aftertaste. Just some off-putting note that I have trouble with. Feel is medium bodied with decent carbonation. Good IPA, but quality really varies by batch."
"This brew pours a mostly clear copper color with a fluffy white two finger head, some of which stays on top until the end. There is moderate lacing and good carbonation. "
"I just purchased a sixer tonight. I've heard of this beer but had never seen it to any of the Kroger stores that I typically shop at. Poured from a can into a tulip, says it was canned 10/07/15."
"Poured from a can into tulip. You can smell the malt and melon like fruit right away. Beautiful sunrise orange color. Tastes of melon, grape, pine, sweet malt. Awesome beer."
My favorite
"Only since ive tried this beers competitors do i truly appreciate this beer, fruity, hoppy, clean and crisp with some definite sweetness to balance out the citrusy hops, this is a great ipa."
"What a wonder, great low key hop expression without the bitterness ."
"Pours out of 12 oz can into Pint glass and its color s a burnt orange gold color with a nice white thick head that laces the glass very nicely. Aroma is like sticking your nose in a flower & fruit basket. Taste varies by can. 1st was super citrusy and mango fruity. 2nd was sweet with hints of mango, grapefruit but with a more malty backbone present but both were outstanding. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and refreshingly crisp yet also creamy. Overall, this deserves all the hype it gets! Can't wait to find some more. It's a great Citrusy IPA!"
Great balance and feel. Love the the smooth fruity hop taste and mellow malt backbone. Just a refreshing IPA. Thank you Cigar City.
Excellent Indian pale ale. Full of flavor.
My buddy received a lot of these in a trade and we decided to drink a lot of them. They never got dull
"The beer has a dark orange color. The aroma is citrus and malt. The taste is fairly balanced with citrus, pine, and a sweet bready malt that lingers on the palate. I remember the beer being juicier but this can is almost 3 months old at the time of review so it has aged a bit."
"Golden honey-amber color with two fingers of near-white foam and heavy lacing. A zesty orange hops aroma with quite a lot of sweet pineapple behind. These notes are little less pronounced in the taste, which is somewhat watery in the middle when cold, with hops bitterness on the backend. The pineapple flavor definitely increases as it warms though, becoming, perhaps, too sweet. It's light bodied, but with enough bitterness and carbonation to make due. It's fine for what it is, but I'm not the biggest fan of this whole genre of Juicy Fruit IPAs."
"this is nice, great looking amber hue with a slight orange coloring, smells of tangerine and pineapple, taste of caramel, citrus and a great feel and mouthful, very light feel for the ABV and very smooth, a dangerous mixture here, don't fool this for a session brew. but it is drinkable for a session job."
Poured from a can (dated three weeks ago) into a tulip glass
"A – Caramel-orange; fairly clear. One finger thick white head, nice lacing"
"October 3, 2015"
Just tried this for the first time and I am impressed.
L - Typical copper color for the style. Medium head fades fast.
Had several cans and drafts . On many occasions on vacation !
"Super citrusy, orange, mango, papaya, grapefruit on the nose, smells like fruit juice. Nice juicy overly ripe fruit, orange, papaya, kiwi, melon, with grapefruit in the background. Mouthfeel is medium, alc covered, aftertaste is bitter grapefruit, the overripe juice starts to fade away. Overall this is an amazing IPA. Fresh as f*** too - canned 9/25/2015 drank 10/1/2015."
I had this beer for the first time today. It had an exceptional aroma and it went down very silky! I can see why this beer is so highly rated. I highly recommend this beer!
The beer pours a nice and white bubbly head that dissipates quickly but leaves a bit of white stuff on the surface. The beer itself is a clear pale amber color that looks wonderful in the light.
Eww
"This is in the top 5% of IPA's if had, and I've had quite a few. From the color, to the smell to the taste. The taste is where it's at. The most wonderful balance of citrus and hops. The flavor just bounces around your mouth. I can see why this scores so high.."
"Concord Grapes! It took me a while to place the flavor, but there is a very upfront concord grape taste to Jai Alai. May not be for everyone, but I love it. In fact, now that I've placed the flavor, it's hard to taste much else, but that doesn't bother me. Otherwise, this has a light amber color, pleasant smell (not as concord grapey smelling as it is tasting) and has moderate astringence. For an IPA, it's light enough to be highly drinkable by me, a relative lightweight with low tolerance who doesn't like the reeeally bitter and heavy IPA's. One of my favorites! For my taste, better than Racer 5."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark straw color with a two finger head that recedes at a glacier's pace and leaves two inches of lacing. Aroma of pine hops, floral hops, and pineapple. Taste follows the nose with a pineapple and piney hop front followed by floral and citrus hop finish that is just slightly bitter to balance out the pineapple. Medium body and medium carbonation with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Very crisp and drinkable without diminishing the hops."
"Canned 9/2/15. A very well done citrus forward IPA. However, I didn't find it terribly exceptional. I've had a number of IPAs with a similar flavor profile that were just as good. Nevertheless, still incredibly drinkable."
"Super fresh canned last week, cheers!"
"Had growler. Nice aroma, good taste but faded. Great in cans."
Poured cold into a tulip glass. Can date of 6/4/14 consumed on 7/18.
Been looking forward to trying this for a long time. It did not disappoint. Superb citrus smell when opened. It is just perfectly hopped and amazingly drinkable and refreshing for the abv. A top of the heap IPA!
Canned.
"Cigar City Jai alai IPA was an India Pale Ale that I was really looking forward to before I got the chance to try it. After multiple attempts at trying this beer to give it the benefit of the doubt, I am still left unsatisfied."
"Canned dated 8/21 poured into a glass. Outstanding appearance on this. Aroma of citrus, grapefruit and peach or tangerine. Taste follows the aroma with bit of bitter pine and nice caramel malt backbone. I will definetaly be on the look out to get more of this."
Go to beer
"This has to be my favorite IPA. Very drinkable with a strong abv. Nice head at the pour and thins all the way of your drink. Typical IPA hops, citrus, Carmel with the right amount and nice full bodied finish. I treat myself with a 6pk once in a while. Local brewed across the bay from me so it arrives fresh in all the stores and flys off the shelf."
Holy cow. I had this a few years ago for the first time and wow it still doesn't disappoint. Pineapple mango hoppy piney goodness. The feel on this is great and the malt to back up the hops tops it all. Not many better.
"Appearance - typical of the style, orange in color with solid lacing. Smell - hops and citrus. Maybe grapefruit. Taste - bitter hops then hit with citrus. Slightly lingering bitter on the back end. Overall - very solid beer. I would love to have this again. Lucky enough to grab it on tap too."
"Just grabbed a 4 pack of cans.... Very tasty, easy drinking IPA, the canned date was 7 days ago, it doesn't get much fresher than that."
"From a growler filled in ATL at Hop City KSM, poured into a tulip glass."
12oz can dated 8/25/2015
A little to boozy on the after taste but the hops are piney citrusy and delicious.
"Pours golden with a short head. Smell is of floral hops with some citrusy rind. Taste is bluntly hoppy with some sweet malt flavor. Bitterness stays on strong with a peppery mouth-feel. Overall this beer is, to me, very much like an ""old school IPA."" It's not quite good enough to fully compete with the breweries making ""top-tier"" IPAs, but it's certainly going to be better than your average beer."
It pours copper with a huge orange-hued head that sticks around for a long time. The aroma is equally hoppy and malty. Some pine and floral notes. This is indeed a bridge between an IPA and a DIPA... Such a tasty beer! Amazing.
"Received this as an extra in a trade from Gdirt, thanks Greg!"
"Maybe eating a Pub sub (which I'm currently doing) while drinking this thing, adds on to the love I have towards the beer,,, but regardless; awesome IPA!"
Pours a nice golden color and had an aroma of citrus and tropical fruits. The body has a soft citrus taste with a little bit of malt sweetness and light bitterness. Really drinkable.
"This was a great tasting beer outside of the ""big boys"" from treehouse, all of Vermont and other big players in the IPA game right now. Insanely crushable and would love to have regular access to this brew. The only drawback is 12oz cans."
"Tropical, lots of mangoes. Overall just a wonderful beer."
"Pours a light golden color with a slight white head, smells of pine, hops and malts. Smell is the weakest point in my opinion. This is one of the better balanced IPA's I have tried in a while with a nice amount of citrus hops, and earthy malt. Mouthfeel is medium body with slight carbonation. Overall a very good IPA."
"This stuff looks like carbonated fruit juice when it's poured. Nice head, as well; fluffy and persistent, with lacing that hangs around awhile."
"The perfect harmony of fruit/floral-forward IPA and earthy/piney, the hops dance on the tongue in this beer like few others when fresh. The malt base isn't invisible either, propping this flavor bomb up and making its full 7.5% well known."
"Had this on tap at district tap. Color was a soft copper, little light for my taste. The flavor was good, definitely some citrus notes, but also a bit mild. Effervescent nose, very crisp. Mouthfeel was a bit harsh, lost of carbonation. Think this is a bit overrated."
One of my favorites
"Appearance: Cloudy, golden copper."
Surprisingly really good beer. Buddy brought me some from Tampa.
"Walnut Creek Amphitheater lot - Raleigh, NC - pint can"
Currently in my Top 5 IPA's. Unfortunately not available close to home. Makes for a nice treat when visiting Florida. Well balanced between citrus hops and malt. Grabbed a six of this without knowing a thing about it. Glad I did. Found a place in NYC that always has it in stock.
Very balanced IPA. Bitterness isn't overwhelming and the aroma is amazing. Wish this was a available year-round in texas.
I have read about this beer but never had until I vacationed in Florida - from NJ - really tasty - great beer - perfect for really hot Florida summers - can't really understand why the NJ craft beer club (Snobs) do not like.
"Jai Alai is the best ""east coast styled"" AIPA I have had to date. If this was in a ""The Alchemist"" can, it would probably be one of the highest rated AIPAs on this site."
Just a really good IPA.
This beer has a cloudy orange look with 3/4 head
Canned 7/17/2015 enjoyed 8/3/2015 in a Mad Elf tulip/snifter.
"A: light amber in color, with about a fingers width of white head. Leaves nice lacing."
"Sweet and funky. I can see a lot of southern character in it. Would not call it well balanced, it has several very strong characters in it. Might want to chill down that one to keep it less in-your-face."
"Has a nice amber color, is pretty murky. It has a very hoppy smell making it hard not to drink right away.It tastes just like it smells, hoppy but with some sweetness to it."
"Fantastic IPA. Not too bitter or hoppy and very drinkable. Would be a very good IPA to introduce someone who has never had th style to. Either way, this is one of the very top IPA's I have had so far. Wish it was available locally as I would buy it all the time"
Very hop forward IPA with an excellent balance.
"I love this beer. Up there with top IPAs I've tried to date and I've had a ton. Perfect balance of citrus, tropical fruit and slightly bitter pine. The malt is there, but really lends itself quite well to the beer by still allowing the hops to play a major roll in the taste of the beer by providing a subtle sweetness."
"all time favorite IPA. true florida style. tropical fruits, just the right balance of sweetness and hops. could be a double IPA if it wanted."
"This is just a great IPA. Has a nice color and a hoppy citrus smell. The drink is smooth with a great hoppy, citrusy taste and pretty good balance. Overall an incredibly drinkable beer"
"A-Pours yellow with a hint of orange, off white head that lingers"
"Hoppy, guava, mango, sunshine in a glass with a cool, breezy, grapefruit bite on the finish. Rich, delicious, sticky finish that lingers on. An amazing reflection of the tropical state where this brew is crafted. Great stuff that all those cruise ships heading out of Tampa don't deserve."
Everything you could want in an IPA. Beautiful balance between hops and malt. Slightly hazy and drinks very easy for 7.5%. Very tropical taste and smell. This beer is heavily dry hopped and is best enjoyed fresh.
"Pretty great IPA. Well balanced, tasty fruityness citrus and tropical fruit. A little too thick of a body"
A:A golden blonde color with an orange hue that settles into a thin white head 
This was the first East coast brewer to make a true West coast IPA that I had. Remarkably good.
"Amazing beer. Beautiful light orange color with white foamy head. Really nice aroma, with notes of citrus, orange, and a hint of malt. Taste is outstanding, with a bright citrusy bitterness followed by great balance with the malt. Nice dry finish and a great mouthfeel. Could drink this every day."
"Considering it comes in a can, Jai Alai is my to go to for every beach run."
"Perhaps my taste is changing or I got a ""bad"" batch, but this one was much more malty than I remember in the past. There's still quite a lot of bitterness in the back; however, that's about it. Kind of disappointed."
Great ipa. Smooth. Doesn't feel like a heavy drink
Had on tap in the Keys
"Great beach beer, but there are better ones out there. Was seriously hammered after drinking seven of these in 1.265 hours. Decent taste and nose. Did not spill in sand."
I may edit this later but have had 2 12 oz cans 3 months after pkg date.
"Great beer! Nice tropical fruit on the nose and tongue, although not in your face about it."
Pours a deep orange color with no haze. A white head with a good retention and laces the glass. The smell was really nice with a burst of pine and grass coming in immediately. The taste was similar with a lot of hop notes coming through with pine and herb flavors dominating. A very clean finish though made this one a very drinkable beer despite it's aggressive start. Very happy my cousin lives in Florida and sent this one up to me.
"Look: Light, orange amber color with some carbonation bubbles. One to two finger white head that slowly diminished into light foam on the top. It left something to be desired in this area. Smell: Grapefruit came up and smacked me in the face. Passion fruit and mango followed up afterwards and then came the piney-hop notes. Refreshing, citrus forward and inviting. Taste: Wonderful, crisp, slightly dry and wonderfully grapefruity. Basically, what you smell is what you taste. There is a nice malt backbone that gives it some depth and very faint caramel notes. Feel: Medium body, medium carbonation. Smooth, alcohol is well hidden. Goes down dangerously easy. Overall: It lived up to the hype. Down in the Tampa area on vacation and had it on tap. I liked it so much that I bought a six pack of cans right after. It was awesome."
"Does this one live up to the hype? Well, it comes pretty close! Can was kindly provided by a colleague of mine from Tampa after a Stanley Cup wager. Freshly canned 2 weeks ago. This pours a vivid burnt orange/copper color with a significant off white head. As absolutely fantastic looking beer. Tropical fruit wafts from the pour. Nice full mouthfeel without being too heavy. A truly well balanced IPA which brings everything together extremely well."
Still my favorite IPA. Nothing better to have on the beach. Great citrus taste with a good smooth malt backbone. Highly recommend.
"appearance is hazed amber orange aroma citrus orange grape fruit and some pine.taste is grapefruit Boozy orange with more pine. nice malt backbone, an excellent IPA"
"A: Hazy, orange, large 2 inch off white head, great lacing "
"This beer was wrongly presented to me as a Pale Ale by a misinformed waitress, but it was unmistakably an IPA upon the first sip. This IPA was solid all around. The hops were the star as they should be with any IPA. Great beer."
Coming from the northeast I was anxious about vaca in Fl with no local craft IPA .... This beer stands up to many of my favorites including heady !!!
"Solid, very good, smooth, but not spectacular"
"Smells and tastes just like a filtered orange juice. Highly recommend on a hot day, super refreshing. Would definitely search out this beer and recommend it to those who like citrusy IPA's."
"Very juicy with hits of grapefruit, mango, and orange. This pup is on the sweeter side and has a definite malt backbone to it. Smooth, not much bitterness. Medium bodied. Would actually like a little more bitterness, but good beer."
On vacation in Orlando and came across this delicious ale. Truly lives up to the hype.
"Tale of two beers. Had two from the same 6 pack, one was OMG excellent, one was dull and not nearly as good. It was an odd thing. Some, the great one had an almost orange juice like taste. Very citrus forward aroma. The dull one had a muted citrus aroma. Was more on the bitter side with way less citrus taste. Still good, just not as good as the other can."
"This is all fruit and hops. There are layers of citrus, tropical fruits such as pineapple and mango, and a nice hop presence on the back end. Not a super hoppy IPA, but a great representation of the fruit forward side. My favorite type of IPA."
Look: Hazy orange appearance. Head that dissipates quickly but has lovely color.
"Updated review, after having had a couple six packs ranging from 5 days old to 2 weeks old. "
"12oz Can dated ""04/20/15 CHEERS 40657"" thanks @floridadrift"
"Finally found my way down to Tampa and had to get some. Was not disappointed. Must say ill be taking a few six packs back to jersey with me!!! A nice balance of maltiness and tropical hop flavor, and especially on tap, this beer is a treat."
"Mango orange and slightly hazy brew topped by a sticky foam. Looks delicious. Smells peaches, floral, citrus. Taste is papaya, nectarines, floral, tropical. Moderate bitterness is refreshing. Medium body is creamy. Delicious. Perfect way to enjoy a day on Ft Myers Beach."
"ok see I rated this but never reviewed it. Poured from can into NB chalice, good 2 finger off white head, good retention, excellent lacing. Crystal clear amberish golden in the glass. Smells of caramel malt, pine/pineapple and citrus. Starts off with sweet caramel, pine and pineapple, the citrus shows up in the middle and it finishes off with a good sharp citrus pith bitterness. Body is thick, good malt bill and it shows. Oskars did a good job with this over in Austin, better that any I had from cigar city last year in the panhandle. FYI the beer was canned 1 month ago"
historical ratings from personal notes
This was very enjoyable after mowing the lawn. Thanks Kevin! 
This is an exceptional IPA. I love the fruit on the nose and the hoppiness in the taste.
Amazing brew from my friends in Tampa. Subtle pine notes with some tropical fruit in the background. Beautiful Amber color with nice lacing and good head. Mine was canned 3 days ago and the freshness shines through . Just drank a 6er and feeling pretty good about myself
"Look--beautiful golden color. Pours out with fine white head, which reduces to a nice collar aroma is hoppy and fruity. Taste is hoppy. Feel is light and smooth,"
"Legit local beer, lucky gal right here to get freshies daily. Pours copper in color with notes of citrus and tropical fruit in the aroma. Flavor has upfront citrus bitterness with a hint of caramel and citrus and tropical fruit hop notes in the finish."
L - Amber color with foamy white head
Outstanding IPA. One of my favorites
Cigar City Jai Ali 
"What a beer. If you are in or around Florida, you've gotta try this out. It fits the atmosphere perfectly and is a great treat, you've gotta be there to get it and you've gotta be there to ""get"" it. "
"In my opinion, Jai Alai IPA doesn't live up to it's hype. I've had it on 2 occasions and both times I was underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it's a tasty IPA - lots of pine, citrus, and hops, but I've had much better IPA's - think Dogfish Head IPA's or my new personal favorite IPA, Creature Comforts Tropicalia."
"Most beers fail to live up to ""the hype"". I bought a 6 pack of Jai Alai while traveling in Florida and assumed this would be the case, once again. But to my pleasant surprise, it lived up and then some. Grassy, citrusy, piney, hoppy... everything I want a complex IPA to be. The tropical fruit forward finish as the hops trail off takes this a from a good beer to a great beer. (I am told this is what is lost when no longer fresh) Now I just have to get my hands on some of the oak barrel version."
"Look is orange with a nice thick inch and a half head of white foam. Smell is of grassy hops, citrus, and earth. Taste of bitter orange citrus, piney resin, and grassy dank hops. Nice full mouthfeel and a crisp slick hoppy aftertase."
This beer was damn good. I received one in a trade... will trade for it again :)
Decent beer but not a favorite of mine (call me crazy). It was canned leas than a month ago but i want my next one to be from the tap.
I could drink this all summer long...tropical fruit for days
"Pours clear honey orange color with fluffy white head, smells of dank piney hops slight pineapple, tastes of bright spicy hops on the front and continued bitterness as malts cool in the background for a dry finish, mouthfeel is superb, wonderfully silky smooth and rich."
"12 oz canned 4/14/15. Deep amber color with a huge creamy head. Sparse lacing. Big tropical fruit aroma. A little sweetness from the caramel malt rounds out the flavor. Hoppy and bitter, but fairly balanced. Dry mouthfeel from the judicious use of hops. Medium bodied. A well made India Pale Ale. "
"Poured on-tap, clear orange under a 1"" thick white head which fades to the rim and leaves nice rings of lace. Aroma is tropical and citrus fruits. Flavor is pineapple and tangerine with cracker malts. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Finishes semi-dry and slightly bitter with a malty finish."
"Absolute rock solid IPA. Lots of fruit, enough malt but not too much. Great hop profile. I can drink it on a chilly night or a hot day. A plus beer."
Had on tap 
"Lite auburn pour and off white head. Thick lace. Pine and orange juice nose. Orange slices and pine nut flavors with great malt balance. Full bodied IPA, yet still light on the tongue. Malt balances nicely with buttering hops. A very good IPA."
"Poured out of a can. Nice color, but lots of floating sediment. Nice hop flavor up front with some sweet maltiness. Finishes pretty smooth and balanced. Excellent beer. The hops were a little more muted than when I had this fresh at the brewery. Liked it much better, not sure how old the can was."
"The second micro brew i got while in florida...loved it! Quite possibly among the best AMERICAN india pale ales i've ever had...shared one w/my brother in-law,Bob (he enjoyed it too,& that man KNOWS beer-even lives in the PNW too!)...One of the highlights/best things to say about it,is that the Jai Alai has a fine, non-lingering after taste & is one of the top two beers i had while on vacation in 2015...tampa beers! cheers!"
"Tasty, full bodied IPA. Deep citrus taste with a malty, toasted caramel backbone. A real highlight out of FLA. Appears on some top 10 beers in USA lists, and for good reason."
"Had this beer for the first time tonight, very smooth and hoppy! A great IPA"
"solid flavors of citrus ,tropical fruit citrus bitterness with a hint of caramel on the back end solid brew but I've had better ipas but this one drinks pretty well"
Ordered a keg of this for moving day. Fresh Jai Alai is hard to top. This is a malty IPA with fruity notes. The first beer was just as delicious as the last. Great beer after a day of hard work.
"12oz can, canned on 03/31/15. Served in a milkshake pilsner glass. "
"Quick review. One of a kind IPA - deep citrus & tropical fruit aromas envelop you on the nose & carry over remarkably well to the palate. Carb & mouthfeel are perfect. Just enough malt to offset the fruity, slightly resinous hops."
My first Cigar City beer and unsurprisingly it's a very malty east coast IPA. Resinous hop and citrus flavors make themselves present at the front of the tongue and finish with the creamier malty characteristics at the back. A very nice change of pace from some of the west coast hop bombs.
Bought can at cigar city brewery. 3 days old!!! 
"Pours a beautiful ultra clear gold color with a decent head and clingy, spotty lacing. Aroma is up front with citrus and pine, nice. Taste is bold with hop bitterness, ruby red grapefruit, tangerine and other faint assorted citrus. Also getting a touch of caramel or toffee, something sweet.....Mouthfeel is good and bitterness and citrus are well balanced. I like this beer, a nice IPA from Cigar City."
Not impressed with this beer
Nice citrus bitterness with fruity finish.
"Pours honey/amber color with a rich white/caramel head. Smells are of fruit and honey. Tastes are citrus with honey in the background and a somewhat strong hops finish. Mild carbonation with a very balanced taste. Overall, a very good IPA!"
"I don't like the extremely hoppy aftertaste but it is great going down and despite not being an IPA fan, very good beer"
"Tropical fruit sweetness, a hint of pine bitterness and enough of a malt presence to keep it balanced. This one has it all. World class."
"The real deal. Fruity, hoppy, crispy deliciousness."
This was really good. Next time I hope to get it even fresher.
"I spend a couple of months in Florida during the winter and the ABC folks down there do have a great selection. I usually just pick up a few brands I haven't tried but this time I asked about what was popular down in Florida. The guy told me this Jai Alai so I got a six pack. As you can tell by the ratings - many rate it high. Can't do it. I found it oddly sweet and lacking a good hoppy flavor. Rather flat in its carbonation as well. So, in all fairness, let me say I like a strong IPA with a real hoppy bite. I bought it in a can and usually don't do this. I hope the difference isn't that great. Didn't finish the six pack. But again, with a rating of 95+ I must be the oddball. Good Luck."
If you are in or around the Florida area and you don't try this IPA you are missing out big time!
"Happy to get 3 x 6packs while on vacation in Gulf Shores! Good beer, not Heady Topper amazing but good!"
"Very nice, some mango and other tropical fruit notes, I could drink the hell out of this"
Pours a amber-orange with mild haze. 2 finger head cream colored head is rather frothy. Doesn't last terribly long but leaves good sticky lacing behind.
A phenomnal ipa. Loads of tropical fruit in the nose and on the palate. A bit boozy for everyday sessioning but overall a great ipa. Nice full body and mouthfeel with a gorgeous Amber color and foamy head.
Too much foam. Smell is pretty lacking but not the worst smelling beer. Taste is great and smooth. It's kind of like wolf among weeds but I like wolf among weeds better because wolf is refreshing and crisp
In a 12oz can. Much better than the oak-aged Jai Alai
Super hop! Excellent End to any day
I'm a huge IPA fan. I live in Tampa about 20 minutes from the brewery. It is always a treat to visit the tasting room. I enjoy and home brew double IPA's and this is a nice full bodied brew. At 70 IBU's it is up there near the (undefined) double IPA level. Really enjoyable.
"This beer smells of grapefruit and hops, great on a hot day and finishes smooth. For 7.5 it feels like a 9%'r"
"Shocked at how underrated this IPA is on this site. Simple put, the best, most balanced, drinkable IPA on the planet. Quite possibly the perfect IPA."
Near perfect IPA. Not over the top with hoppy bitterness. Great citrus notes. Nice long finish. Very sessionable. Cheers!
"Appearance: Copper with a slight haze under a persistent 3” off-white foam cap that produces thick clumps of lace. The beer turns brilliant as it warms. Smell: A light earthiness, pitted fruits, light biscuit, some tropical elements. Taste: The attack begins with creamy malt with a mild sweetness and then grapefruit rind bitterness followed by apricot and citrus. It dries out on the finish with a repeat of the citrus rind bitter accent. Mouthfeel: Creamy, clean, medium body and carbonation."
"Very nice. Discovered by chance, on vacation."
Probably the best local beer I've had!
nice citrus finish. hoppy and very easy to drink a few
From a can into a tulip glass. Beer was canned 8 days ago.
Refreshing flavor. Beautiful color. Great in the morning.
Love this IPA! Wonderful aroma of grapefruit and awesome citrus taste. It's Florida in a glass!
"This has been my default beer of choice for awhile when I can't make a decision... I might be a little bit prejudiced, being from FL though.. but it IS delicious.. just sayin..."
"Lots of flavor, good depth. I'm good for 2-3."
"Pours a very nice copper/orange color with a 2 finger head. The citrus hops are very prominent and give it a wonderful aroma. Taste is very smooth, the bitterness fades quickly and has a nice balance. Overall a solid IPA."
"Long been one of my favorite and go-to beers but it fell out of availability in the DC area, sadly. Recently got some in a trade and realized I hadn't reviewed it, so here it goes. "
This is my favorite beer.
"A: Slightly hazy golden-orange with ample carbonation, deep soapy off-white head that sticks. "
"An outstanding beer and an outstanding IPA. Significant amount of carmel malt. Very, very juicy and sweet. Tons of orange and tropical fruits. A unique flavor and associated aroma that I can't pinpoint, but would describe as kind of musty/earthy, but not an ""east coast"" thing necessarily. More like a dank, wet pine tree. Low bitterness in the finish. Comes across a little more balanced than some others in case you are looking for a hop bomb. Reminds me of Deshutes Fresh Squeezed a bit. I also have found that I enjoy this more from the can than poured, which I have only had happen with a few beers. I think it is because the aroma is a weaker point, where the flavor is significantly better. A world class IPA, but be warned, it does seem to fall off drastically after a few weeks. Finding it fresh never seems to be a problem though. Hands down my favorite beach/hot weather IPA"
Look- dark golden and copper. A big bubbly head gives way to a patchy lace. The carbonation is visible and there is sediment that looks like small chinks of grapefruit. Very interesting look.
"From the fresh can into a tulip glass, beer is rich bright orange with a good sturby head and solid lacing and film retention."
Dark amber almost ruby tone. Tight opaque bubbles
Really piney bitter taste at first but leaves a slightly sweet after taste.
Very tropical. Tasty but nothing too amazing.
"First time trying this beer, I was totally happy. It had that ever so appealing grapefruit, resin pine aroma,"
"Poured from beer into a pint glass, a copper body with a white head that's a finger thick. "
"Poured from a can into a spiegelau ipa glass. Enjoyed with some super spicy indian food and they complimented each other perfectly. This beer is incredibly balanced, just bursting with tropical fruits, peaches, apricots, and tangerines. So easy drinking. The taste lingers but never bitter or biting. I love this beer and could drink it all day. It's juicy but balanced and feels lighter than the abv would suggest."
"Not as hoppy or fruity as is anticipated, actually alittle metallic tasting"
Good lord tops was a good one! The awesome citrus and tropical aroma and fantastic taste. I'm lucky to live where this is plentiful and in every grocery store and now I will take advantage!
"Pours Cooper, with a fluffy, lacy head. Smells sweet, roasted, citrus hops and citrus fruit. Tastes of citrus fruits, citrus hops and finishes with a caramel malt. Feels creamy and lasting."
"Great session beer. Fruity but not overpowering. Well balanced with a clean finish. It isn't a west coast hop forward beer, but it hits the mark strong."
12 oz can
"This beer is straight up delicious! Citrusy, hoppy, and delicious. I wish they distributed in the Chicagoland area."
Very lucky to get this fresh. Aroma is amazing!
Poured from can into pint glass.
Drank from a can dated 2/11/15.
"Can poured into tapered pint glass with a 3in head. Beautiful Amber orange color, with lots of carbonation, and the head held well. Smells citrusy sweet and light. Malty caramel flavors up front with a nice citrusy hoppy note on the back end. Very drinkable, very pleasant IPA. Would love to drink these regulars, great go-to beer but probably not the hoppiest IPA if you're looking for that over the top bitter bite."
Nice hoppy flavor with a slightly fruity undertone.
As solid as it gets. I can drink this beer any time of day.
"Can into shaker pint. Pours clear copper-orange with a finger and a half of white head that leaves great lacing. Aroma is full-on citrus hops with tangerine and apricot notes, and some caramel malt. Taste is briefly sweet then a moderate to strong citrus rind bitterness takes over. Medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish."
This one of the most well balanced best tasting beers I've ever tasted
"This is one of my favorite beers and favorite IPA so far. I've had it on tap, from the bottle, and from the can; delicious every time. Malt and hop characteristics are well balanced and a hearty 7.5% ABV compliments this pairing. Smells of tropical citrusy hops and has a clean finish, not too hoppy. Overall taste is crisp and has notes of tropical fruits. Overall a well balanced and fantastically executed IPA. While both are world class IPAs I prefer it over Heady Topper, just sayin."
I was sadly underwhelmed by this brew. I do not think it holds up to some of the world class quality IPAs. Very heavy on the malt and the hops did not really pop to me.
"A - clear orange, off white almond 1 inch head"
"Poured in Belgium style pub glass. Color is medium amber pour with quarter inch acing head. Nose has hints of tropical fruit, citrus zest, and citrus hops. Taste comes remarkably close to the nose as citrus hops are present with hints of caramel and pineapple. Not a terribly bitter after taste and is fairly sweet. A very nice IPA from an outstanding brewery."
Good. Not great. Deck was probably stacked against this one as I recently had a few Headys - a tough standard to live up to. Would not turn one down though.
"Very bitter finish, off putting aftertaste"
"How they got 7.5 abv to taste so smooth I will never know? I live on the beach in south Florida and drink beer all day everyday, this is my new favorite beach beer. You only need a few and your where you wanna be! I love beer and Really think Jai Alai is the best beer I ever had! Hands down!"
For the greatest selling craft beer in Florida this is just ok. It is a very refreshing pale ale though.
"Although I see many good reviews, i am expanding my taste buds. Not quite use to the extra hoppy taste. Moving forward, looking at the description it is hard to note the citrus tones. I feel like I smell and taste the hops from start to finish. I didn't give it a bad review because it isn't a bad beer. In fact it may take me some time to get use to IPA style beers. So I give it a middle.of the road rating. Sorry if this offends anyone."
It’s got a caramel like sweetness with a really nice green front to it but even that strong green front has a citrus taste with it. It finishes with citrus and almost a tropical mango on the backside. Great balance of piney greenness and citrus flavors. Easy on the tongue with a light feel.
"Tons of tropical juice flavor and sweetness start off with a minimal hop bite at the end. Pours a clear light copper body with a bright white head, with very fine and sticky lacing. At 7.5% this is very smooth and the alcohol is well hidden behind the flavors. Perfect beach beer. At only 3 weeks old Im excited to have gotten some."
Golden brown piss color. Medium hop body. Extremely floral/fruity hop taste. Tropical like. Dragonfruit. Starfruit. Guava. Fruity malt sweetness with a crisp fling before a smooth rolling finish.
Really surprised me on this one. A very delicious beer.
"Had this on tap on vacation recently. Have had it in the can as well on vacation over the new year. Wow was it good on tap, better than the can for sure. Was impressed at how the hopps was real apparent and fresh. I'm used to a stronger hopp presence and was happy that the fresh Jai Alai had it more than i recalled from the can. Very sweet ad fruity finish. Wished I had a keg in the cellar. Keep up the good brews."
I had an aggressive pour into an IPA glass. Had 2 inches of head / foam that very slowly dissolved into a fine 1/8 of inch. Lots of beautiful lacing on the glass as I drank the contents. Color was a dark honey and I could not see my fingers on the other side of the glass. 
A new favorite beer in the fridge.
"Great IPA. Pours a nice Amber color with a great three finger head. Very present citrus and hoppy aroma but not overwhelming. Has a nice bitter taste but leaves a dry finish, begs you to have another drink. Overall great beer."
May be the best beer I've had to date. Really hits a great after flavor of citrus/grapefruit . I just enjoy it!
I was able to pick up some 2 week old Jai Alai while I was passing through Florida. This beer was awesome.
"Bought a case of 12 oz. cans in the summer of 2014 in Allentown, Pa. Illegible canning date. Very good but seemed to have a ""chemical like"" aftertaste that I didn't like. Will try again at next opportunity to rate again."
"Just a great IPA. Cigar City comes through again with another great beer. Thin head, full bodied and tropical flavor gives the bitter hops a unique twist throughout the tounge."
This is a very tart beer
"Woody, smokey, hoppy! Drink it daily when I'm in Key West, Florida."
12 oz. can imported from Florida to California. Pours a clear deep copper in color and blasts a good dose of hops from the can. Sports a nice iinch of soapy foam cap which shows good retention. Touch of muddled caramel on the nose along with a balanced op character. 
I hate IPA's and I'm giving this an extremely high rating...'nuff said.
From a can- brought back from Orlando by a friend.
Poured from a can to a glass.
"I enjoyed this beer, and I think it held up throughout drinking the whole beer for sure. It's sweet and light, but still with enough hops for the IPA fans out there. It's very well balanced and drinkable."
Poured from a can into a tulip.
"I really like this IPA and has my type of balance in the 70ibu range is where i find the best ones. Fruit forward and very tasty, hops are not dry at all."
I am generous on reviews at times but I have reserved the really high scores for outstanding beers. This one is one I have wanted to try for a long time and thanks to a fantastic trade I have acquired this one. I might have to keep this one hot on the pipeline! Jesus its good!
"wow. one sip in.... nice balance. the other guy said it perfectly....""caramel malts, citrus and spicy hops..."" why not a 5 in taste? this is definitely one of the best I have had.... maybe a little 'dense' or 'syrup-y' but I think I could drink these all day...."
"Pouring a yellow-orange in color, Jai Alai gives off a subtle creaminess to the background of it's nose. The hops are citrusy but smooth and give none of the aggressive bitterness there's a mild malt note in the note as well as though vanilla or caramel. The nose is amazingly balanced and has a touch of tropical fruit as well. On the palate the carbonation is smooth, keeping the texture remarkably creamy. Flavors of citrus, pine, orange and a hint of honey drive the profile. There also a subtle spiciness. The balance of the entire experience is what makes this IPA special. There are elements of malt that keep the hops from overtaking the beer, even on the finish, which has only a small amount of bitterness, but lots of flavor."
Got this in a can only 14 days old. Pours a hazy yellow orange color with a very persistent foamy white head. The smell is dominated by very fruity hops as is the taste. Initially the citrus (particularly grapefruit) flavors dominate but there is a quick transition to a rich malt flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich and the finish begs for the next sip. This is my new go to IPA.
"A very good IPA, worth the trip to the closest place who sells it"
"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 11/4/2014. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, peach, mango, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, peach, mango, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate amount of pine/citrus peel bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of big juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome IPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; and very smooth and fairly crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
On tap poured into shaker pint 
"Wow. Best IPA I've had in a while, well crafted, and a great take on the style. Glad to finally get to try it on a trip to the Keys. Spent two weeks getting to know this gem. Pours a dark honey with a half inch creamy head, and great lacing. A big nose of tropical fruit and hops. Taste is plenty of fruit, mango, pineapple, and tangerine, with a great hop presence and a nice bitter finish. A touch of caramel malt balance it out nicely. Not boozy, but full bodied. A truly great IPA that I will look forward to on my next trip to Florida. Room for some in my suitcase home for sure."
"First Cigar City beer...in Puerto Rico, no less! The can was old because craft beer isn't nearly as popular here, but it was good nonetheless. Found at a store in Aguadilla, near the airport."
12-oz can into Belgian ale glass
12 oz can a few weeks old
If you like a citrus style IPA this is very good. Great nose with Citra hops and very drinkable. Smooth finish with a great tatse throughout.
An amazing classic. Delicious IPA. Can drink it over and over again.
"Don't see what the fuss is about...good, not great beer. Almost a little dark of an SRM for an IPA, smells of straight Centennial hops but the taste isn't as appealing as the aroma. The malt detracts from the hops and didn't meld well IMO and effects the mouthfeel as a results. Good beer, but just seems average compared to most current IPAs...I'd rather homebrew a better IPA than seek this out again."
"What can I say...just a delicious IPA. Nice tart grape fruit, citrus nose. Bitterness hits the tongue first followed by grapefruit again. The perfect balance in my opinion of citrus and hoppy bitterness. DELICIOUS!!"
"A: Magical, when it pours, its a hazy dark amber on the top with the ingredients moving around and then it lightens up towards the bottom and stays this way while you drink it."
"Reviewing from notes - had it a good while ago. Family traveled to Florida and brought me the sixer back. Used to be available on a hit or miss basis around here, but haven't seen it in a while. With all said....."
"Simply put, this is what an IPA should be. I only wish I could get my hands on it more up here in Maryland."
Very nice IPA in can. Nice amber color small hint of citrus.
Big bright and delicious. A great beer.
Absolutely the most perfect balance of hops
Just wish it was lower in abv
"6 pack of cans brought back from a trip South. Has high numbers, so had to give it a try."
"Found this beer in a can six-pack while I was staying in Orlando a few years back. Hadn't heard of Cigar City back then (I had just turned 21 so I was new to craft beer). Honestly, I picked it out for the design and by a local recommendation. This beer blew me away. Such a great complex IPA. "
"Poured a four finger head with a gorgeous amber body from a can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. A tropical nose, if that makes sense. Presents with a citrusy hop blast, with a pervasive and fruity sweetness; there are pine notes, but they are almost too subtle to mention. A refreshing and light mouthfeel, resulting in a session-beer-like drinkability. This is a unique IPA, and one at least in the top ten. I'll fight anyone who says otherwise."
"Cigar City Jai Alai India Pale Ale has a thick, off-white, spongy head, a mostly clear, very bubbly, deep amber appearance, and significant lacing left on the glass. The aroma is bold- strong, piney hops and vibrant sweetness. Taste is of a out-front, piney hop bitterness, sweet, white bread malts, and and maybe sugar. Mouthfeel is medium and slick, and Cigar City Jai Alai finishes crisp, bold, and not alcohilic. Great and wonderful! "
"CAN: 33cl. Aluminum, with a standard pull-tab."
IMO merely OK. Too sweet. Not very distinctive hop flavor.
"Pours a clear light amber with a thick white pillow of a head that lingers, finally receding to a thin cap that leaves lots of lacing. Aroma is a mix of citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is light caramel malt and citrusy hops. Feel is crisp and well carbonated. Overall a nice beer fresh, updating my previous rating which was obviously not a fresh beer."
Thank you Cyrushire! Canned 08/08/14.
12oz can poured into an IPA glass. Canned on date puts it right at the two month mark.
Drank from a can
"Great beer. Typically, living in Colorado there's co beer and west coast beer. But Florida beer? shit. this is great."
A - Nice amber appearance with perfect carbonation. Nice lacing from a thin but persistent foam layer.
Poured from can into snifter.
"Deep orange to copper hue with a slightly off white khaki tinged head. Head sticks around for a few sips then dissipates leaving a ring and big chunky lacing. Nose has some major hop action. Earthy, tobacco, grapefruit and a touch of tropical fruits. Taste has brings big hop flavored to the front. Grapefruit, tobacco, mango and papaya. Some caramel and biscuity notes are there but they don't get near balancing the resinous hops. Bitter on the finish and a nice grapefruit linger. Medium body and sticky feel on the palate. Somehow, this finds a way to crud pup and finish slightly dry. Overall a fantastic IPA with a unique flavor all it's own."
6-22
"Jai Alai is the best IPA I have ever had. A phenomenal brew that ""wows you"" from the minute I cracked open the can and poured it into a glass, Aroma, appearance and taste were all max scores. A must buy if you have not tried this IPA."
"Beautifully copper-orange, like so many of the jingle shells found on the beach here on Marco Island, Florida. Nice white head looks like sea foam clinging to the sides of the glass. "
"Beautiful amber color pour. Awesome citrus smell. Fruity, hoppy and freaking delicious. I love this beer. So well balanced. Not too bitter. Super easy to drink. Smooth from start to finish. The only problem with this beer is that I don't drink often enough."
Poured into a Riedel tulip from a can dated 8/11/14. The liquid is a dark-ish golden orange with plenty of bubbles and a nice off-white foamy cap that leaves a good amount of lace.
"Fruity for an IPA, without sacrificing the hoppiness that I so very love. A truly excellent beer."
The beer pours a copper colored amber with a nice thick frothy khaki head. Nice citrus tones in the nose. Strong scent of oranges. A touch of caramel sweetness in the background. The taste is full of hops. A nice smooth bitterness that comes in waves of citrus and maybe a little piney resinous quality. A touch of caramel sweetness rounds out the flavor. Neither sticky sweet nor bone dry hitting the middle perfectly. Medium bodied with a nice richness. A little bit of melon comes and goes in the flavor. 
"Revisiting my review...havibn a day old Jai Alai stright from the source...when this fresh, its among the best IPAs Ive had...yes, it falls off fast...but if you can get it within a few days of canning, youll LOVE this beer. So juicy, hoppy, tropical, and delicious."
This gives IPA a new perspective it has a perfect balance of taste and isn't dry at all the citrus hits in many many levels great brew only bad side I cant find here in tx
"Pretty tasty. You get the citrus tropical fruit nose that you get on most IPAs these days but it's a little more assertive in the bitterness category. I like that! Plus I'm a fan of beers in a can. A really solid backyard, lawnmower, bbq beer."
Beer had a great copper hue. Immediately you were hit with a nice hoppy smell which is to be expected from an IPA. Taste was not as hoppy as expected but still very good. Nice after taste with not too much bitterness. Overall this is a wonderful beer and folks who do not like IPA's will enjoy the beer!
"Thanks to Paul for picking this up for me in Tampa! Slightly hazy amber-orange pour with a two finger foamy off-white head with good retention and great lacing. Big fruity, tropical nose with lots of resiny hops along with hints of pine, caramel, tangerine and mango. The taste follows suit with mango, pine, and resiny hops up front along with hints of sweet caramel, peach marmalade, and subtle grapefruit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation and balance and a nice slightly syrupy, subtly bitter finish. Overall, this is one bold and flavorful IPA with huge drinkability."
"12 oz can poured into pint glass, after realizing I've never reviewed after many years here we go"
"S: lots of tropical fruits and citrus. Mango, grapefruit. orange."
"Had on tap. So let's start with the elephant in the room, this beer is overrated, which is a shame because I am really enjoying it. The smell is grassy grapefruit with some hop bitters and pine lingering, very nice but nothing mind blowing. The taste takes those flavors and adds tropical fruits, sweet malts and booze. Good pound for pound flavor, but could use some refinement on the finish. Feel is right in the wheel house for a good ipa."
"Hoping that this review is more than just the pangs of nostalgia, I find that Cigar City is a brewery founded upon an eclectic assortment of beer. Jai Alai is a hop head's paradise."
12oz Can
This beer is about the only reason I would go back to Florida...
"Jai Alai has become my favorite beer after trying over 30 different IPAs. The can has a nice design to it and I always appreciate companies that list their alcohol percentage on the label. Haven't been able to find it in bottles, but it doesn't really make too much of a difference to me since I pour it into a glass. Has a great orange color to it, and unbeatable aroma of tangerines and other citrus. "
Jai Alai - Cigar city brewing 
In a teku
The best ipa. Yes I said it.
"Jai Alai is my favorite Florida IPA. I've had Jai Alai on tap at the CCB brewery, as well as on tap at restaurants in the Tampa Area, and from cans in Florida and Atlanta. It's slightly better on tap, but holds up really well in cans."
"My 2nd Cigar City beer! Huzzah, trades! Less than 2 weeks old, to boot."
"Pours nice and smooth. Perfect white head, nice amber/copper body with mild carbonation and mild sediment seen throughout. Mildly opaque, though still transparent. "
"Poor - nice sea foam/frothy poor. Two finger head, great lacing."
"I would definitely credit this beer for making me appreciate IPAs. I was lucky enough to live so close to the Cigar City brewery, going to USF's Tampa campus, so I was able to try Jai Alai right from Cigar City's tap. This beer has a very full flavor, with the bitterness from the hops blending smoothly with notes of citrus and tropical fruits. I highly recommend this beer to those who love IPAs as well as those who are skeptical of the style."
"This beer quickly became a favorite of mine when I started spending time Southern Florida. A perfect warm summer day beer. But honestly, when isn't it a warm summer day in southern Florida. Perfectly hoppy with bright citrus in both the nose and taste. Delightfully carbonated and damn near perfect."
"A-really a dark orange , burnt looking clean ale."
"Look: copper color, slightly hazy"
"Had this while on travel to FL. I saw a 6-pack in the local liquor store and - based on the hype - new I had to try. In my haste to purchase, didn't realize that the 'born on date' was &gt; 6 months. Despite that..."
"From a can which was 2 months old so have to do this review with a grain of salt, so to speak. Beautiful copper color with huge head. I really looked forward to the tropical fruit aroma and of course citrusy smell / taste go a long way with me in an IPA anyway. maybe it was because this can was 2 months old but it was very hard for me to pick up any significant citrus and tropical fruit notes from start to end. Just sort of there is all. have to have when super fresh to do a proper comparison but I would say just pay attention to the canning / bottling dates when pursuing just like any other IPA."
"Acquired via trade. Poured into 10oz glass. Funny, cans are usually 12oz., yet it poured perfectly into a 10oz. glass."
Pours copper with an aggressive yellowish head.
"I stumbled across this beer in an Atlanta, Georgia Greens, as I was deciding between Westbrook's One Claw and Unita's Hop Nosh, a seemingly monumental decision at the time made irrelevant by the florescent reflection off Cigar Cities' green and orange can. I could hardly wait to taste."
"So, this beer has been showing up roughly once a month in my area of Long Island. Each time it is about 2-3 weeks old. Fresh enough for me. The first time I bought it, I was so pleased that I went out the next morning to buy the rest of the case. Gone. Now every time I go to the store that has this, I buy up all of their stock (usually 2-4 six-packs)."
"12oz can, dated 5.22.14, poured into a Cigar City snifter glass. "
"12 oz. can purchased at a Winn & Dixie in Hollywood, FL, unknown canning date (may be on the older side because it looks like CC is currently dated their cans on the bottom), poured into a hotel-style glass and drank over 30 minutes"
"Cigar City's Jai Alai is the definition of an East Coast IPA. It's definitely malty, so much so that you can smell the caramel coming through along with the tropical fruits of cascade and simcoe hops. There is also is a certain amount of bread-y or toastyness to the malt backbone. Overall good IPA. It used to be my favorite until I drank Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA. I've realized that I'm more of a west coast drinker than east coast over the past couple of months. Follow me on Twitter: miamibrewer305"
"Tried this over nachos and World Cup soccer at On the Rox in Richmond's Shockoe Bottom neighborhood. This beer is definitely a new addition to my favorites list. Pours a hazy golden color with a huge floral, citrus and honeysuckle nose. The taste had citric hops, sweet malt, and a bitter finish. This is a sensory experience in the best of ways."
Can
"I got a can of Cigar City Brewing's Jai Alai IPA that my friends Ben and Jess brought back from their trip to the brewery, thanks guys. I've been wanting to try this beer for awhile now and this is my first time having a beer from Cigar City, but I have had a couple beers they have collaborated on and I'm excited to see how this one turns out, so lets see how it goes. No visible canning date, but I think it's fairly fresh. Poured from a 12oz can into a imperial pint glass."
Perfection in an IPA!
A- Cloudy copper with a large off white head that lasts and lasts with nice lacing.
Can date 5/13/14- pours lovely clean orange with foamy white head. 
Poured into a small glass from can. 
Received beer courtesy of Newman
You had this beer. 
Canned on 4/24 and poured into my nonic pint...
Poured from a 12 FL. OZ. can into a pint glass. CANNED 4/23/14. Exactly 1 month old!
Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for giving me a can of this
"What sets this beer apart from other IPAs is its great balance. A lot of IPAs are aggressively hoppy, which is fine, but what keeps me coming back to a beer is nuance. The biggest defining factor was how the orange-citrus touch to it gave the hops a nice uplifting buzz. It balanced out the piney hops and left a warm lingering aftertaste. This makes Jai Alai the perfect summer drink for an IPA fan. I could imagine making multiple return trips to a cooler to crack one of these open! Great beer."
Appearance - 
Pours stunning copper with a mild haze out of the can. A rising two finger tannish head caps this beer. Retention is excellent as is the copious amounts of lacing.
Appearance: a yellowish orange to burnt orange color. Lots of haze and opaque. Two fingers of an off white head that leave a strong lacing behind
Thanks to Skrypt for the can(s).
"pours a slightly hazy copper with a small, quickly thinning head. nose; big floral citrus hops (amarillo & cascade) and a light candied sweetness. taste; easy on the malts and mouthfeel, leaving the complex hop profile to fully run the show here. big citrus notes are immediate; grapefruit, orange rind, light pine, mango, then some caramel breadiness in the middle, and finishes a slightly sweet lime. strong carbonation. perfectly balanced, floral, hoppy and juicy. wayne wambles from cigar city has made the recipe public, so it's not really a guarded secret. it's a laundry list of grains and hops, and the beer it produces is magic. this has to be my favorite hop profile among all the ipa's i've tried so far and i have no choice but to give it a 5 score. simply incredible brew and it impresses me every time i have one."
12oz can from a sixer picked up at Publix. Poured into a DFH IPA glass...
Poured from the 12oz. can into a Sam Adams pint glass.
12oz can poured into teku glass.
Pours out a dark orange in color and a tiny bit translucent. Nice two finger head with good retention and some really nice lacing.
"So here goes my first review ... This is a fantastic IPA , at only 7% abv it packs a lot of flavor. Its a great anytime IPA and has become really popular in South Florida and is almost always available. Nice opaque orange color , great mouthfeel, and tons of citrus hoppy flavor. Is great out of the can but I prefer in a glass to really appreciate the color and aroma of this IPA. Has a great balance of bitterness and sweetness. I usually drink IPA's in the 9-10% abv range but this IPA stands up right next to them."
Appearance: Pours with a slightly cloudy burnt orange color. Light head on the pour and not really present while drinking. Very light random lacing left behind at each level.
"This was one of the first reviews I had done, (so basically, back when I didn't know what I was doing :) "
Can dated 4/8/14 into a pint glass.
Appearance is a hazed dark golden
A: Poured into a 12oz shaker glass. Pours pale amber. White head that dissipates in about a minute. Good head retention. Some sediment in the glass. I'm attributing it to a bad pour on my part.
This is my first review so forgive me for my lack of knowledge and verbiage ( new to good beer). 
On tap at the Dark Lord Day. Sampled before my pallet got eviscerated and my brain turned to jelly. 
Passed along to me last week in Colorado during a beer swap. Was more than happy to take it up. Haven't had a whole lot from Cigar City at this point.
Finally getting around to reviewing this. I think I have had it on about 5 different occasions over the past three years. Thanks to my cousin for sending up a fresh can.
"I will just say, this is such an awesome beer!"
"This is a very good tasting beer with high marks for drinkability, smell, and taste."
Poured from a 12 oz can into a standard pint glass. Moderately aggressive hand. A completely indecipherable blob is stamped on the base of the can.
"Canned 3/20/14, poured into a pint glass"
Upon opening this beer I first smelled mango & honey notes. Later some sweet biscuit malt. Very well balanced.
Acquired as part of a trade on 4/17/14. Poured into a Pint at cool temp.
Can poured into glass
"Burnished copper in the glass that pretty. Smell is sweet and tropical -- almost like you can feel the humidity. Lots of guava, mango and pineapple, but less on the citrus front. This is a bit less forward hop forward than a lot of IPAs. The hops are buoyed by a thick syrupy malt that sticks to the tongue. Overall, a very nice beer that is dangerously sessionable."
A - Pours a cloudy orange / amber with two fingers of off white head. Nice sticky ring after each drink. Spotty lace clings. 
"Had this last night. It was on my ""to drink"" list and rated higher than stone's to-go ipa I had in my hand. So I put the to-go down and picked this up. Big mistake #1. I also bought a Lagunitas Hop Stoopid for the long ride home (shhhh, don't tell anyone), which I'm sure didn't help Jai Ali in comparison, mistake #2. When I got home, my beer geek brother-in-law and I got to tasting and dissecting. "
Poured from a can. Dated 1/28/14 so it's a bit older. Pours a golden amber with a white head. A bit darker than most IPAs. The nose isn't too strong but there's a lot of citrus and just a bit of tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose mostly. Citrus up front with tropical fruit in the finish. Bitterness isn't too overpowering. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky. Hopefully this is just an age issue. It feels a bit heavy to me. Overall this is pretty great. I wish I could get my hands on a fresher can though.
"Sampled from a 12oz can purchased at The New Leaf Market in Tallahassee, FL."
Canned 3/20/14 - Reviewed 21 days later - 4/10/14. Poured into an IPA glass.

Poured a nice orange amber color with a white head. A great IPA that has awesome citrus and tropical fruit notes! I definitely need to get me a six pack of this great brew!
Jai Alai – IPA (7.5%) - Cigar City Brewing (Florida)
"Juiciest IPA I've ever had. Tropical fruit explode out of the can and hit you right in the nose. Orange, Grapefruit, maybe even peach flavors come through in the taste."
"Hands down one of my favorite ipa's that I've been able to try. I put down a 5 for the appearance because I have never poured it into a glass! This is great straight from the can. My family went through about 6-6packs while we were vacationing on Sanibel. This just tastes tropical. Doesn't smack you in the face like a dirtwolf but is dangerously sessionable. My wife absolutely loves this beer, and she is not an ipa fan. If you can get your hands on some fresh Jai Alai, do it!"
"Poured this into a Monday Night Brewing pint glass. The body has a somewhat cloudy brassy color, and the head started off at about two fingers then swiftly sank down but never gave up."
"Second time trying, first time in a while. Found at bottle shop in Denver. Can date 3/12/2014. Random and wonderful find. Would love to have this all the time. There's a spot in the beer fridge right next to Modus and O'Dell IPA that this would fit perfectly into. Kick ass beer."
This beer is great! It's got a nice sweet taste on the front end but the aftertaste has a floral-bitterness to it. I'm not sure what hops they used but they made the right choice! It's an awesome IPA! I recommend this beer to anyone who runs across it.
Appearance - pours a deep bronze color with off white head
"Nice to get a fresh can of this (canned in March), the only other bottle i had was clearly infected, this was not. Dark orange color, good foamy head, looks fine. Aroma is sort of hoppy, tropical fruit mostly but its not as robust as I would like. Flavor is very hop heavy,tropical fruits buta strong alcohol component that is quite unpleasant. Very strong astringency. Not sure why Cigar City is so popular I wouldn't drink this again and I plan on giving away my remaining can. I also think their aesthetics and branding are sort of tacky."
A: Pours a clear copper color with the perfect layer of frothy white bubbles sitting atop the body. This layer settles slowly but retains a good layering. 
Poured from a can into a dogfish spiegelau glass. Bottle exactly one month ago. 
"Pours a slightly hazy copper with a frothy, dense cream head that lingers."

Poured from a 12oz can into tulip.
"A prolific tan head leaves perfect, thin rings of lace in its wake. Color is bright orange w/ darker hues."
Canned 1/10/14
A: Deep and clean amber-orange color with a nice creamy one finger head. It looks almost like an orange creamsicle. Very pure with no clouding. The head lingers long after.
"I'm so glad I found this IPA. Jai Alai is my go to, year round IPA. Being on the East coast, we get super fresh Jai Alai weekly in Philly. Thanks Cigar City!!! I'm never surprised to go into my lbs and find Jai Alai that was canned within two weeks of my purchase. Jai Alai taught me to always look at those bottle on dates and with the exception of the local breweries, no brewery pumps out awesome, fresh beer like Cigar City. I can't get enough of this stuff!"
We have so many great option in the world of IPA's these days. Here is another one.
Parents went to Florida for vacation and what do you know they actually went to Cigar City Brewing and picked me up this beer. Never thought I would try this one. It was caned 2-11-14.
"This is my first experience with Cigar City, a friend gave me a can and I cant wait to try it. The pour is a somewhat hazy orange copper color with little head but very nice lacing. The aroma is pure hops. Lots of pine and citrus accented by some mango and tropical fruits. The nose makes it hard to believe that this is a single ipa and not a double. The body is medium and a little chewy with lots of hop resin beautifully coating the mouth. The flavor is an awesomely fresh hop bomb with all the notes that the nose promised augmented by just enough malt to balance the beer yet lend it virtually no sweetness. I still feel like the flavor is closer to a dipa than a single. This is a damn good beer and one that I would definitely try if it is in your area. Cigar City please come to Michigan."
"This is easily one of the best, if not the best, IPA I have ever had. I got a 6 pack as a present and I was surprised that I had never heard of Cigar City Brewing before (even though I work in a beer shop) When you pour the beer it has a very slightly opaque copper appearance with a fantastic foamy head. You can smell the hops, not overpowering but absolutely there. There are also some hints of a citrus and another smell I can't quite describe except to say it reminds me of fresh baked bread, but it is enticing. It is full bodied, but not to heavy. It found the right spot on the bell curve. The taste starts by hitting the salty and sweet taste buds then the hops hit the bitter receptors. However they made this combination it is amazing! Another great plus is a fantastic aftertaste and not overly carbonated. I would highly advise any IPA fans to try out Cigar City Jai Alai!"
"appearance: pours a monstrous, white, sticky head with unbelievaboe retention, color is a slightly hazy copper, ith very little visible carbonation."
"Good head with good retention and lacing. Nose is citrus and pear. Taste is smoothly bitter, with silky heat more than its purported 7.5%, not in a bad way. Medium bitter taste with fruity hop finish. Great beer, but perhaps not quite world class. This wasn't a super-fresh can, so I'll certainly taste it again if I ever have the chance."
"Pours a clear straw/orange color with a thin layer of foam clinging to the edge of the glass. The suds fall back into the drink, making lacing difficult and sparse, going more for the mosaic look than the ring look. Pine and resin accompany an overwhelming citrus aroma: grapefruit and orange are the heavyweights. There is some biscuit behind it, but you have to look for it especially when it is freshly poured and the carbonation is going well. The biscuit comes out a little more in the flavor, cooked well with some doughy presence, it comes first, then lots of citrus and resin, followed by a strong bitterness, but it isn't overwhelming. The citrus is almost tart and balances the bitterness well. The hop flavors are enough to knock me off my chair, they're so prevalent. The feel is quite dry, the body on the light side. This beer is focused on hops a lot, but there is some maltiness to it as well, balancing it out very nicely. The hop bite is a little harsh in this, so I'd switch to another drink sooner than, say, a Stone IPA or Racer 5, but the flavor is more of an experience so it's a trade off."
Drank from can in a moment of necessity. Still needed to review. 
"Purchased at my local Wal-Mart (yes, we're spoiled by Cigar City) in Tampa, FL. $9.49 for the sixer and they come in these nifty green & orange cans: "
From a can that was canned 12/13/13. Poured into a Samual smith pin glass
Serving Type - Can
Filled up a growler in New York on Sunday after having it on draft at Prost in Garden City.
Hate to not drive the Hype-Machine with my most notable local brewer. 
Canned 2/4/14. Pint glass.
A- Hazy light orange with a strong head that leaves tremendous lacing.
wow. fantastic stuff. the reputation this brew has is well deserved.
Thanks to Cane80 for the trade.
"This poured a hazy burnt orange with lots of sediment. A fat creamy head of off white foam that would have taken longer to fall than it did to finish the beer. Left scads of lace to look at. Nose is bombastic citrus fruits! You could name them all. But mostly grapefruit with the peel and the pith. Nice and earthy. Tangerine, a sweet hop herbal and stone fruit softness. Faint spice and faint nuttiness if you let the beer sit in your glass long enough to notice. Not a lot of pine more like a bit of earth on the nose. "
12oz can poured into a tulip. 1/27/14 on the bottom.
"Pours a slight dark orange with a bit of cloudiness. Half inch off white head that settles into some moderate lacing on the side. On the nose, it smells of a combination of citrus fruits and caramel sweetness. Heavy on the hops though and it comes through on the first sip. Strong fruity flavors; both citrus and tropical. Leaves a nice aftertaste at the end of the sip. Bitterness is on par with all great IPAs. Really enjoyed this one and hope to have again soon!"
"I've been fortunate enough to try a good amount of Cigar City beers, but never have had this brewery staple til now. Date on the bottom is smudged but looks like it's from 1/10/14. Thanks Kimdog."
"I have unconsciously passed this up on the shelves for way too long ! My first sip of this stuff got a 'WOW !"" reaction for waking up my otherwise hop-numbed palate - I've recently gone thru many 6-packs with pleasure - "
Poured from a can into a tulip glass.

"A: poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass, darker orange amber with a large off white head that lingers leaving good lacing, hazy"
"Along with Heady and Hop Drop n Roll, this beer is in a league of its own. So much going on. Mouthfeel is perfect; almost chewy. So many fruity, tropical flavors; citrus, pears, apricots. Super malty backbone that is unique and nearly perfect."
12 oz can poured into a pint glass. 
I try to keep some fesh jai alai in the fridge at all times. Great nose of tropical hops with a slight kick of sweet malt underneath. The taste follows much of the same. A great American ipa with a uniqueness to it that makes it stand out.
A - golden bronze
"Had this when I recently took a trip to Florida; bought a 6 of cans and was really surprised how good it was; a canned beer that really was noticably good. I drank one from the can and was very suprised and poured another into a glass and loved the way it looked and tasted. If this becomes a permanent presence in VA, I'll always have some in the fridge. If not, I'll always grab some when I'm down in Florida. It's nice when the rumors are true..."
"The body was orange-amber in color, clear, and gently carbonated; forming a two finger thick head that proved very durable. The first thing hit me as the can was opened was the tropical citrus smell, and it intensified upon pouring. Bringing the glass under the nose revealed a ton of grapefruit, mandarin orange, bitter orange, and a hint of papaya. The taste was very hoppy, revealing layers of grapefruit, pine, hay, and some butterscotch. The finish was spicy and earthy, and the body felt quite sticky. This straddled a line between a regular IPA and a DIPA, and should probably be considered a double. I am so glad I bought two sixpacks, as this would keep me happy for a while."
Deep amber with orange tint and a hazy look to it. Just a light touch of foam on top covers most of the top of the beer. Brussels lacing. The aroma is an intoxicating burst of citrus hops. I get orange and mango notes. The front of the palate is like biting into a grapefruit. Intensely fresh hop flavor assaults your palate. This is quickly followed by a good malt backbone. That hop fades slowly away and beckons further sips. The mouth is moderately carbonated and the hops definitely prick the tastebuds.
I had this a few of these and thought it was too bitter for my liking and I have it an overall rating of 3.25. 
"Picked up a can of Jai Alai from the Halftime Beverage down in Mamaroneck, NY while down from Upstate NY on business. I have been wanting to try this beer for some time now."
Reviewed from notes. 22 July 2013 can enjoyed on 8 August 2013.
"On tap at the Holy Hound in York, PA. Pint glass. Nice clear orangey-amberish with a modest off-white head. Initial impression is orange, mango, and pine, followed by bready malt with a hint of caramel. Very complex. Very good. Mouthfeel is medium thick and sticky. Excellent beer."
"A: Poured can into a .5 liter glass. Dark golden, copper color with 1 finger off white head with considerable lacing. Hangs around until the end."
"A: poured from the can into a teku glass. The beer built a soapy looking off white head just a hair over 2 fingers tall. Great retention on the foam, as it fell a nice spider web lacing was left on the side of the glass. The beer is a murky dark copper to almost a dull brown color. Little bits of what I assume are hop particles are floating in the bottom, otherwise a very clowdy beer."
"A: Copper color with the opacity of honey, some sediment, and a big fluffy eggshell white head leaving thin rings of lace as it goes down."
Beer was canned ~2 months ago. 
"Pours from the can a murky amber, with a prodigious head of off-white suds. Heavy-duty, thick, and ornate lacing. Wow."
Pours a copper color with two fingers of white head. The head enjoyed some decent retention and left nice lacing behind. The nose has notes of piney hops. The blend of malt and hops is quite tasty. The finish is appropriately bitter.
Bottle into Sam Adams glass.
A - Nice tangerine orange body. Light haze. Great retention and ok lace on a creamy off-white head.
Big thanks to Moyman for this one. 
Extra in a trade with Chad. More Cigar City... Who's gonna complain about that? Canned the day after Christmas. Still fresh. 
"Canned on Nov 13, 2013"
"I searched high and low for this, but before they began distributing to Alabama it was next to impossible. I ultimately found it at a gas station and made my purchase. Poured into a glass, I immediately noticed the beautiful lacing and the delightful aroma. The taste was intense, but exactly what you look for from an IPA. I couldn't bring myself to finish it, because I didn't want it to be over. Thank you Cigar City for this beautiful execution."
Finally found this beauty; super-surprised to see CC in PA! 
"Poured a chilled, 12 oz can that was packaged on 12/31/13 into an IPA glass ( Spiegelau Type)."
A- Orange golden hue. Medium lacing with minimal head for an IPA.
Reviewed from notes. Poured this 12 oz can into a Sam Adams glass. Canned Feb 11 2013 and consumed not long after. The body was bright orange/copper and had yeasty bits in suspension. The off white head left minimal lacing. 
"I had this before from a bottle, but the legendary woodychandler hooked me up with a can, and it was even better. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a orange/brownish color with a 1/2 inch head.Smell is very hoppy, some notes of citrus. Taste is the smae, big hops up front, some citrus, bitter and dry, a tasty beer. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
A: This poured a hazy dark gold with some off white head.
"A - Orange-yellow. I could care less about appearance, so unless it's really beautiful or really ugly, it will get the average of the other ratings. Who drinks a beer for appearance anyway?"
"I live in Florida and drink this frequently. Jekyll and Hyde kind of beer--each can (even within the same six pack) can be one of two varieties: one that lives up to the hype, with perfect citrus, grapefruit, earthy, hop aroma, medium mouthfeel and light bitterness; or one that is dull, bitter and boring. If you find yourself with the latter, be sure to give it another try."
Canned December 17th 2013. Three weeks old.
"A - copper, burnt orange, brilliant white head, pillowly foam"
"A: Nice copper color, has some haze to it. Lots of sticky lacing."
"It was canned on Nov 10,2013"

"Oh sure, with nearly 3,100 reviews already posted, not to mention nearly 200 CAN reviews, The CANQuest (TM) is late in getting to this one, but better late than never. "
"6 pack of cans purchased at DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Popped a few New Year's Eve this year."
On tap in standard pint glasses.
"Recommended by local Whole Foods guy. Amazing thick bready head for something that came out of a can, I guess it was glad to get out of the dark. It has maintained an 'island' of thick foam to the end, just like those old Guinness ads. Happy to accommodate you, Mr. IPA. "
I'd seen this awhile back at TW and had read good things about it in the interim. I'm really glad I grabbed a 6'er of cans on my way home from work today.
A-dark gold in color with a large white head that leave a good lace on the glass
"Poured into a small heavy crystal mug developing 3/4"" of foam which lingered for more than 50 seconds. Lacing developed, and clung to the sides, graphically denoting enthusiastic draughts. The head has different creamy shades of white and varied bubble sizes."
"Poured from a can (dated 11/6/13) into a SA Perfect Pint. Appears a nice copper color, with a thick, fluffy, off-white head that has great retention, and leaves great lacing."
"Loved the beer from the tap in orlando, this review is from the can"
Awesome West Coast Style IPA. 
Canned on 10/22/13. Extremely excited to try this as Cigar City now distributes into NYC. Thankfully my local bodega had a not too overpriced (at least by NYC standards) six pack or individual cans for $2.99.
"Excellent IPA, wish we could get it around here. Poured at a good temperature with a nice size, cream-color, foamy head that soon settles to a light cover and some lace. Color is a nice clear amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is equal parts hop& malt, some toffee, caramel, fruit, spice. Flavor's like nose, great balance, clean, and just plain flat out yummy. Body/carbonation spot on. Finish is like taste, average length, no off flavs, and I want to drink this till the cows come home. Pity we can't get it around here."
"From a can from 3 months ago, poured hazy orange, close to one finger head, really sticky."
"Had two of these at the Bahama Breeze in Tampa. Served in a chilled pint glass, probably affected the head a bit. Nice bright, hazy orange color with an average size white head and average retention. Good solid bands of lacing."
"A- nice bright deep orange (if that makes sense) I got a half finger head that goes away pretty quick, I'm also getting a lot of floating hop debris, looks very nice though"
"Consumed on 12/7/13 and reviewed from notes. Enjoyed out of a 12 oz can with a canning date of 10/28/13 stamped on the bottom, so this is about 40 days old. Poured into the IPA-specific glass from Speigelau for maximum IPA-ness."
"12 oz can. Pours hazy orange with huge, long lasting, fluffy, white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade and bready malt. Body is full and crisp. Citrusy hops, orange marmalade, biscuit malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long, fruity and bitter. Tasty, complex IPA."
In an overall way this beer is very balanced and impressive. 
Drinking it right out of the can.
"Enjoyed Jai Alai so many times, finally writing a review for one of my favorites. "
Had this both in a can and on tap while in Florida. A stellar IPA that can compete with Modus Hoperandi as one of my favorites (though it is a touch less hoppy than MH). A nice hoppy onset with an appreciable citrusy sweetness. Well balanced without too much bite at the end. 
12oz CAN
"Canned 10/29/13. Poured into a snifter. Thanks for the trade, Cliff!"
Appearance is amber or maybe dark orange with head of about two inches or so.
Hazy amber color with a thick head with good retention and leaving laces.
Appearance - clear orange IPA with 2 finger head. Nice all around looking beer.
Got this beer in Northern Va. first time in the area for cigar city. 
"Serving - Can poured into Speiglau IPA glass. Canned on 10-27, enjoyed on 11-23."
"Had this on 2011-01-14 and again on 2013-11-23 and 2015-10-19 in Columbia, PA. Updated review from the most recent tasting."
Shocked to find a 6 pack of this in VA. Bottled on 11/12/13 and poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass
"Slightly hazy dark orange color with off-white head. Aroma has some caramelized malt, piney hops and orange peel. Taste follows with light caramel, bitter orange peel, resiny hops, quite bitter on the finish with lingering grapefruit flavor. Light to medium body, smooth mouthfeel. Really well balanced flavors, classic and well made."
"Thanks to Three Fishes for sending a sixer over the summer. Reviewing from memory, but it's pretty well burned in. A crisp, aggressive blast of juicy mango and grapefruit. Personally I think the drinking experienced is enhanced a bit by the can design. The retro 70's green and orange screams ""juicy fruit"" and that's exactly what you get. If ya got it, drink it fast. I mistakenly shoved one can to the back of the fridge, and while it was still enjoyable, with a few months on it , Jai Alai is not the same beer. Unconditionally recommended for hopophiles."
"I had this for the first time 2 years ago at the suggestion from my local distributor and absolutely loved it, but when I went back to get some more it was gone and I haven't been able to find it around my way since up until recent. And now it was available in cans! Couldn't wait to dig into this and see if the wonderful flavor remained. "
"Just doing a comparison between Jai Alai and Dry-Hopped On The High Seas; both from the can, both in between fridge and room temp."
Can into tulip
I picked up a six pack while visiting Florida. Poured from a freshness dated can: bright and deep-golden with small suspended yeast sediment. The slightly off-white foamy head reluctantly receded leaving some intricate lacing on the glass. 
Appearance is golden yellow with a 1.5 finger head.
A nice clear copper color with deep white to tan lasting head.
Canned 10/22/2013. Served in a tulip glass.
"This beer is great, really citrusy and bitter. Tastes like drinking orange/grapefruit juice straight outta the can. More like citrus juice than the other IPAs. Most comparable to Elevated IPA from Le Cumbre or Sculpin from Ballast Point. Tried in Florida while there for an interview."
"Wow, this is a great canned IPA. Canned 10/16."
12oz can into a pint glass.
"Poured from a can, dated 10/3/13, into a Dogfish Head tulip. A dim, hazy, well carbonated orange-red color fills the glass. Splotchy lacing sticks to the sides with a frothy white head that receded to a thin ring. Dipping my nose into the glass reveals a huge citrus-forward aroma of oranges, grapefruit, and pleasant pine scent. It's nothing that you haven't smelled before in an IPA, just balanced perfectly to make you smile. The flavors mirror the smell with more pine on the finish. Medium-bodied and a little more viscous that I anticipated, but not in a bad way. This is very well-made juice and I hope that one day Cigar City makes it to VA. With this one being my first, I can guarantee it won't be my last. Cheers!"
Great beer! Stands up to its reputation. 
Appearance- Pours up a whole bunch of head which looks to have pretty good retention. The head is almost pure cotton white but has few hints of yellow. The body is a medium amber which looks pale amber when held up to the light. Good lacing is left behind. 
The aroma here is citrusy and resinous. Perhaps a note of pine. It's clean and hoppy. Definitely flower forward. 
"Appearance: Gorgeous 1 finger, super creamy head. Excellent lacing. Coats the side of the glass and hangs on. "
Can &gt; Mason Pint
"Poured into a sam adams glass, nice head developed, off white to tan in color. Head was more frothy than dense with mild retention and lacing. Appearance was slightly hazy with an orange, amber color. Aroma had hop and fruit notes. Hoppy taste with some malt notes on the back, hints of spice and toffee. Medium mouthfeel with a malty and lingering aftertaste."
"Attractive burnished orange-copper color, impressive head with good retention, strong grapefruit and tangerine on the nose, zesty hops-centric flavors of citrus fruits and pineapple on the palate, good balance with the malt for such a potent, hops-forward ale, excellent length. A terrific IPA with bright, zesty hops reminiscent of tropical fruits, an IPA that nonetheless offers good malt balance."
Canned September 18th. Month and a half old.
"Amazing beer, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a ""softer IPA""."
"Akira, The Corrections, Miracleman, Crack Pie, Illmatic, Gran Turismo 2 -- sometimes it's genuinely pleasant when something actually deserves to sit atop the swirling kinto-un of acclaim and breathless pronunciations that it seems eternally attached to."
Served from a tap into a pint glass
"First time I've had this one. Overall impressionist that this is a very nice smooth drinking beer. Nice deep orange color. Taste is citrusy with hints of fruit. This is a easy drinking, light, refreshing ipa. I could drink these all day, But was hoping for a beer with a little more ""Umph"""
The beer comes in a hazy reddish amber orange.
A-Pours a dirty looking orange color that is impermeable. Has a thin head that leaves a lot of lacing on the sides of the glass
"When this beer is fresh, its pretty close to as good as it gets for me. There is a noticeable drop off however, when not fresh. Dank, tropical goodness."
Amazing American IPA! beer pours a small head with a murky golden color. The aroma is hops and more hops. The taste is a hop explosion...not a Heady level but this stuff is very good. The beer is slightly bitter with a subtle after taste. Over all its an amazing beer worth seeking out. I would stock up on this stuff if it came to PA again in the next 100 years.
Thanks to TonyJ815 for the trade
"A: pale amber body, slightly hazy; fat tan head as high as you wanna make it; lace drapes left behind"
"Poured from a 12 oz can (dated Sept 24th, served Oct 19th) into a pint glass"
Picked up 4 cans off of Lets Pour for 8.00 per earlier this month. Brew was canned on 09.03.13.
A - Forms a really nice almost 2 inch thick cloud like head when pour. Hangs around a bit more than I expected which really adds to the first sip experience. Beer is a perfect honey color with just a slight hint of carb. 
"Appearance: Poured into a snifter. Pours a cloudy ruddy orange with a finger width head that dissipates relatively quickly, leaving a thin foamy cap."
From a 12 oz can into a tulip.
"12 oz. can dated September 11 ""Never forget!"""
"Pours a deep golden orange amber with a medium foamy yellow-tinged head. Decent lacing and retention. The aroma is interesting, not nearly as pungent or dank as I would have liked, however. A lot of sweet blood-orange juice and some strawberry, bitter grapefruit, and slighter pine and hints of a floral note. It has a clean bitter taste - grapefruit astringency and some pine. "
Review #100:
Poured aggressively into a pint glass. 
"Light amber,clear as a bell,minimal white head that leaves instantly.Average lacing at best."
"Good beer. Poured from the can into a glass. Comes out a nice golden type color with minimal head. You can immediately begin to smell the hops. Very citrusy. The taste is just like it smells. Very hoppy with just the right amount of kick. If you like hops and you enjoy a great ipa, this is your choice."
The appearance is quite filtered looking with a crystal amber to orange color and a light marangue like head.
"Pours a clear amber with a thick, white head that settles into a long-lingering cap. Good lacing. Aroma of pine, tropical fruit, and fresh cut grass. Big, juicy hops hit the front of the tongue with lots of pineapple and mango. Finishes with a bitter hop kick. Sweet malt balances all this bitterness quite nicely. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Overall, an extremely well crafted IPA. Great job Cigar City."
A- hazy copper since it is unfiltered
Canned on July 26 2013
"Thanks to Urielxvi for this one! Canned on Aug 14th, enjoyed on August 29th."
For what I am told we are spoiled with Cigar city only distributing in Florida. Jai Alai is most definitely enjoyed at 4 days since canned. Wow it is fresh IPA and when you crack open a can during a hot Miami summer afternoon its dammmn good. I have had this stuff from the brewery in Tampa and it's great on tap too. They don't ship bottles of this stuff so if you find it in a bottle you're probably having it old as f##K. Anyways CCB always prints the date on the bottom of the can when it was made. So anything less than a month its gonna be awesome. It still taste good after 90 days but they don't like selling anything past 90 days so CCb is serious about putting a quality product. MUST DRINK. OVERALL_Amazing beer
Shout out to rynosf2. Thanks Ryan! Great trade.
To date this is the finest IPA I have ever tasted. Discovered it at a small restaurant in Ybor City in Tampa. I found 6 packs available only at Whole foods in Tampa and no where else since. I judge all IPA's based on this one and Sierra Nevada my old standby which I gave an 8. Learning more each day about the brewing and chemistry of IPA beers. The beer was equally good in the bottle.
Finally tried the Jai Alai and was not disappointed
"Poured from can into HF snifter. Pours hazy darker orange, almost copper. Half finger head, great retention. I've always liked the smell of this beer, very citrusy, with a hint of bitterness. Taste follows the same. This can is about a month old, and it has fallen off a bit. The citrus doesn't have the same bite that it does fresh. It angers me a but when IPAs fall off that quickly, but this is still s great IPA."
"This was my first introduction to IPAs, found it available on tap at The Living Room Restaurant in Boynton Beach, FL a few years ago. Prior to that I was a pretty undiscriminating beer drinker, choosing anything from Bud Light to Heineken to Sam Adams. It was a revelation to find a new type of beer with a really great taste. The thickness and smoothness of this beer combined with the tingling bitterness made an instant impression on me. Now I've taken every opportunity to try different beer varieties and IPAs remain my favorite, with Jai Alai being one of my top five or so."
on tap at Mekong into a snifter.
"While not my favorite style, I recognize the superb quality of this beer. Great hazy and foamy appearance, strong citrusy smells, and piney and medium-hopped flavors. For the abv, this is a very easy-drinking IPA, with much complexity. Very floral and the right orange and lemon smells. this is the kind of beer that could change my mind about IPAs. Excellent."
"Canned 28 June 2013. Thanks to cubanbeerguy for the can. Tasted 1 August 2013, reviewed from notes."
"Poured into a snifter glass. not much heads, beautiful golden orange color. Aromas of pear, mango, tropical fruits, hint of citrus. First sip was quite magical, very pronounced citrus hops and well balance bitterness, dry malty finish. Little lacing but that was ok with me. As I agitate in the glass, the aromas of the tropical fruity notes are really vibrant! Solid beer, great job Cigar City!!"
Poured into a CCB Tulip
A - Pours a beautiful amber color. Fluffy yet lacy head of white. Minor sediment that adds to appearance.
"12oz can, thanks to Ken for picking this up while in Florida. The ale is a hazy tangerine color topped with a creamy, off-white head, good retention & lacing on the glass. Fresh tropical aroma of mandarin, mango, pineapple with some biscuity grain. Juicy tropical flavors of mango, passionfruit, mandarin, and pineapple gush on the palate with biscuity and toasty grain. Nice moderate carbonation allows flavors to meld, finishes somewhat bitter but not overly. Truly a unique IPA. I haven't had anything like this one before. Definitely gives a Florida feel with all the unique tropical notes. A must try if you get the opportunity."
Appearance- Pours a dark orange with a half inch white head. Leaves moderate lacing down the glass.
Big thanks to Pete for this can...
A- a nice deep cloudy gold with a thick creamy white head. Head leaves big lacing and lingers.
Pours a cloudy copper with an inch white head and solid lacing. 
A: Pours a slightly hazed copper color with a one finger cream colored head and some solid lace down the glass.

"As a Florida native and Jai Alai fan, I may be a bit biased on this beer- but hopefully my general feeling of ambivalence towards IPA's will even out my review. Let me start off by saying that it is not as well-balanced, in my opinion, as Bell's Two-Hearted or Longhammer IPA; however, it is amazing for a hyper-hop brew. As others have mentioned, it is distinctively fruity, tasting like grapefruits and passion fruits. The malt is very light without being unnoticeable, and the high alcohol-content is masked by some kind of . . . voodoo sacrifice? It is beautiful, truly. It is not the best . . . but perhaps among the best of the IPA's."
"A - Pours an amber copper color with a nice 2 finger tan head, ok retention, great lacing. Tons of yeasty sediment remains still throughout the brew. Big chunks, reminiscent of pulp."
"Canned on June 19, poured into pint glass. "
"a: hazy, bright caramel. 2 finger solid white head..slightly rocky on top"
"Poured from can into a pint glass tan beer with an orange hue to it , nice 2 finger head , streaky lacing"
Appearance: Pours transparent amber and carbonation is evidence after the pour as bubbles surface to a white head.
"Gently poured (as instructed!) from a June 5th 12oz can into shaker glass. Deep copper-orange but due to the pour, very slight one-finger head though that ring did leave some lacing right to the bottom. Light on the nose with hints of cracker, citrus, wildflowers and grass."
"A - This was a gorgeous beer from the first pour. Three finger, off-white head; bright but thick copper color, filled with carbonation; long-lasting head with tons of lacing. No floaties. Active and alive."
poured 12oz can into snifter. Canned 8 days ago!
"Revisiting this after a two year Florida vacation hiatus. This is a good ""reference"" beer, and reminiscent of Bell's Two Hearted. Anything better is really good, and anything worse isn't really worth drinking"
"Best IPA I've tasted. Not really such a profound statement since I'm pretty new to the craft beer world. Mine had lots of floaties in it, but from other reviewers comments I guess that's to be expected since it was not kept cold. It was brought to me from Tampa by a friend. As far as I know it didn't adversely affect the taste though (first one, so how could I know). This is not a one dimensional beer as I think is often the case with a lot of IPA. Jai Alai is much more balanced, with a healthy malt presence. It also has a much thicker mouth-feel than your standard IPA. A fantastic brew that I hope returns to Georgia very soon. Floridians should not be allowed to keep this to themselves (blatant jealousy intended)."
A- hazy orange and golden in color with a thick fluffy white head. 
Canned on 5/28/13; enjoyed on 6/16/13.
"In my snifter- Jai Alai India Pale Ale from Cigar City Brewing in Tampa, Fl. Twelve ounce can poured into a New Belgium snifter. Date on the can is May 31, 2013. This was a gift from my beer guy at Hops & Vines in Odenton, MD."
"Well since CCB removed their line up from the Atlanta market I look forward to drinking this on my 4-5 visits/vacations to Tampa and/or further north in St Augustine. I also attempt to ""stock up"" and I put it in quotation marks because it is becoming increasingly difficult to find this one in stock(was in North Florida this time) as I hear CCB is having a helluva time keeping up with the demand for this amazing brew."
"Had this on tap several times back in December when I was visiting the brewery before heading out on a cruise with the family. Reviewing this one based on a fresh can dated 5/28/2013, so it's ten days young. Poured into a CCB pint glass (the one you get free with the brewery tour). Thanks to RaffyS for throwing a few cans of this in as extras."
poured from a can into FFF teku glass
"A - Poured out of a can at a Marriot in Orlando. The beer is a beautiful deep murky copper color with two or so inches of thick creamy off-white head. Retention is solid, lacing comes in rich, thick rings."
"Great aroma, taste floral and fruits, light, very easy to drink. "
"it's balanced like a russian gymnast... nice bite, decent mouthfeel.... not too bitter but a nice hop taste."
Deliciously filled with Hops and has a great bite. No strong aftertaste since they stopped bottling it. Only served in cans now and Tap. I live in the area and it is a local favorite. 
"Canned on May 23, 2013"
Canned May 1 2013 poured into Shorts pint
The famous Jai Alai!!
"Pours a brilliant orange color. There are hints of copper and gold. I got a nice 1.5-2 finger off-white head . I was surprised at how well the beer retained its carbonation in the growler. It sat around for a little over week after being purchased at the brewery. I have had this beer in the can and bottle, but the growler is what I happened to be drinking as I write this review. "
A- Pours a deep copper with near white head of 1.5 fingers. Hazy look of a heavily dry hopped beer. Sticky lacing and retention. Good looking IPA
"Poured with a clear copper body and a 1 finger, rocky head. Great appearance."
Love the 6 pack holder that covers the entire top of each can. Take that liquor store can lickers! Im on to you! I digress.
Just got a shipment in from lets pour.com and they sent some freebees with my order. Canned on May 14th...doesn't get much fresher than that for someone way out in the boonies of Long Island.
"Poured from a can into a standard pint glass. White head with enough foam, nice lacing as the glass was emptied. Color was light orange. Looks very good. Doesn't smell as strong as I remember. But whats there is very citrusy. Love the taste, but again, not as strong as I remember it being. Very balanced with citrus, grapefruit and orange. Mouthfeel is just a tiny bit syrupy. Overall, love this beer and it is my go to IPA."
Poured from a can into a standard pint glass. 
I got this for free off a Florida Instagram follower of mine (my IG is StStrange). It was canned in January so it isn't fresh.
"I have been waiting for this one for a while, my good friend @Jmscowcroft hooked me up with this one. I'm moving from VT to FL in a while, and this is what I'm looking forward to most!"
Cigar City Brewing - Jai Alai IPA
Canned on date of 04/15/13
Poured from a can into a pint glass. Thank You shan8454 for this one from a trade.
"From the sunny gulf shores of Florida to the laid back coast of Southern California, Jai Alai has reached ""mega"" status on Raul's ""woot"" scale."
12oz can into a pint glass
"I'm finally getting to try this one. Popped up at Abe's in Bethlehem PA, in cans. I have sat on this for a little while (canned Jan 15 2013) but it still tastes rather fresh. The appearance may have suffered, but I can't be sure whether this is due to sitting in the fridge or not. It's a nice golden amber color, but has a lot of unpleasant looking sediment... and I mean worse than Heady Topper. Anyway, not a big deal at all though. The lacing is fantastic from the bubbly white head. Good amount of carbonation. The aroma is fruity, tangy, and juicy. When drank, the taste is no let down compared to the very pleasing aroma... although it is more bitter than the smell suggests. Sharp and resinous. The fade lingers for the finish, and is medium to full bodied... excellent. Overall, this IPA is up there with the best of 'em!"
Reviewed from notes
"Can from Total Wine. Canned April 4 and consumed April 10. There was a Happy Birthday message under the canning date as well. I had a less fresh 6 pack a week ago, but I decided to post a review of the fresher product. From notes."
Generously shared by Rutager.
"A-Cloudy bright orange, two finder white head that leaves behind some lacing."
"A- Pale amber body with just a hint of haze to it. Lots of floaters in this one, similar to a Heady Topper. Big, fluffy off-white head that leaves a lot of lacing."
"Can pour at the bottle share held at Chloe's inside Golden Road Brewing in Los Angeles, CA."
"Just picked up a six pack on Longboat Key. Canned two days ago. Smells like candied tropical fruit, tastes the same, creamy malty tropical citrus, very little bitterness, slight spice. My wife loved it too. Who knew they could brew such a great beer from Florida gator "
12oz can dated 12.27.12 poured into a Snifter. This has got to be one of the most beautiful looking IPA's on the planet. It's got a hazy dark orange body with a one finger white head that stays afloat and leaves light lacing. 
"The beer pours a ruddy copper orange color with a nice rocky head of smaller bubbles. The head leaves behind a lovely sticky sheet of lacing that forms a ring with some nice stalactites running from it. In the body, the beer is very clean and light, and completely clear of particles. On the nose, the beer smells of tropical pine trees with a touch of mango citrus. The beer smells even better from the can, where the citrus is amped up into pineapple range while the pine amplifies as well into dank resinous hops. The hops are big but not overpowering, and really quite inviting. The malt base behind it is warm and bready with a terrific yet subtle rye spice. On the tongue, the beer tastes bittersweet with a nice warming heat from the spice flavor. The flavors begin as bready spice, which builds into bitter pine and grapefruit flavors with a touch of pineapple. The finish is strong with bitters which move towards medicinal in flavor with a nice little hiccup of spice to close out the finish. The aftertaste also tingles with spice and bitter pine. This is not an in-your-face IPA flavor, and certainly not a big double IPA, but it is delicious and still fills my bitter-thirst. The nuances between the hops and the generic spice flavor continue to unfold different flavors on the tongue, and really make this beer fun to drink. In the can, this beer’s fruit flavors are intensified and made crisper while the spice is diminished. I get a lot of juicy pine and orange citrus hops with a touch of cool mint at the back of the throat. On the mouth, the beer feels medium creamy in carbonation with just a touch of tingle. The beer’s body feels medium light on the tongue, and the mouth is left properly dry and a touch sticky. Alcohol is present only as a soft tingle in the sides of the mouth. Overall, this is a damn fine IPA that stands out by being different. I love the spice and I love the mixture of the hops with the spice. This is a terrific in-the-can beer, and this is a terrific out of the can beer. It is my first taste of Cigar City, and I have to say that I’ve enjoyed it, they pack a hell of a lot of flavor into it, and they hide the alcohol brilliantly. Try this beer."
"This ale made my hotel nights at Disneyworld tolerable. Pours a hazy dirty orange color with rather thick and creamy off-white head. Nose is nicely enticing with some candied fruits, fresh fruits, and an herbal/grassy presence. On the palate there's a big juicy fruit hop quality right away with plenty of tartness, some decent malt balance, and a very good body. Savory, rewarding, and drinkable. Probably my favorite on the shelves in Florida."
This IPA reminded me a lot of Jockamo from Abita.
"Served from a can to a snifter glass. Cigar City's Jai Alai a crisp and refreshing IPA. It has a nice dark orange color. You can smell the tropical aromas jump out at you as you begin to take a sip. Smells of grapefruit and pineapple jump at you. The initial citrus flavors invade your pallet with a crisp hoppy finish towards the end. The mouthful is crisp and refreshing with just the right amount of hops, the bitterness doesn't linger in the back of the pallet. Truly another delicious beer from Cigar City."
Big thanks goes out to Immortale25 for this one!
"I've had this beer plenty of times, most of the time with about 3-4 week's of age on it. However I was able to get some 10 day old cans today and I thought I would review. Pours a beautiful hazy orange-gold with a decent amount of fluffy creamy head, great lacing. This is by far one of the most unique smelling IPA's out there, the aroma just says Florida! I'm getting a ton of citrus, pineapple, mango and slight canned peachy goodness! Taste is right there with the nose, this is a perfect beach beer after a long day of surfing. Overall a very well balanced easy drinking offering from Cigar City. A must try for everybody who loves great beer!"
"Glad to finally try this. Poured can into tulip. Pours hazy light orange with a frothy two finger head. Smell is bready, sweet fruit, tropical, slightly piney. Tastes is tropical fruits, biscuit , pine, very subtle malt backbone. smooth for the amount of flavor and the ABV level. This ipa is fairly complex without being overpowering, it is very very drinkable. Floridians are lucky to have this at their fingertips, great iPA that packs tons of flavor without overdoing the hop profile."
Poured from a can into a Gordan Biersch glass.
Cigar City Jai Alai
Kudos for great beer in cans. Esp for FL. Cans are so much better than bottles. 
Orange hazy appearance. Smell is citrus and tropical fruits. Represents exactly what I look for in an ipa. Taste is like juicy nectar. Citrus from the hops dominates the palate with a light malt backbone to balance. Hops definitely take the spotlight. Mouth feel is nice and light. Overall I'd day this is my favorite ipa at the moment. Gonna bring done back to Chicago for sure.
"Got a ""first run"" can as an extra in a trade with greghochsprung. Who send old ass IPAs as extras? JK I asked for it, thanks greg!"
Some guy said its not as good as Pliny or Hopslam. Well no kidding. Add Zombie Dust Abrasive and others to that list. That said this is a very solid IPA at 7.5 ABV not a session beer but drinks like one. When in Florida it can be tough finding fresh beer of this quality from out of town breweries (found some year old Two Hearted Ale). This is the best beer brewed in Florida. Cans are nice touch too for many of the activities people do when in Florida.
"12 oz can poured into a snifter. ""Canned on FEB 25, 2013 CHEERS!"" Stamped on the bottom (just over 3 weeks old!)"
Simply the best beer around
"Had both on tap and from the can. Pours hazy dark copper, nice glowing orange, with a one-finger, creamy, light-khaki head on top that just refused to settle. Fantastic retention on this one, with walls of lacing to match. Gorgeous IPA. "
A- pours a murky dull orange color with a two-finger creamy white head with good retention and some lace. Floaters swimming all around the glass.
"One of 18 beers from bostonryan on a stopover in Chicago. Cheers to you, good brother. No date on this 12 oz can, but Ryan picked it up a week ago so here's hoping it's fresh. Poured into a 12 oz Tulip glass."
Poured from a can into a pint glass.
Poured from a can into a pint glass at Chez Henahan - my house.
12 oz. can purchased at the Craft Beer Outlet in Philly.
this is nothing special its just average hardly any hop flavor no fruits characters
"have to thank my mom for this one, best fedex package ever! thanks mom. poured a rich coppery red color from the can, with sudsy off white foam that lasts forever. sticky and sweet is the nose, sappy, resinous, and fresh. the hops are very woody, pine-like, but maybe not so aromatic as some of the more spruce heavy IPAs. mid round caramel malt body underneath all the hops. the flavor of this one is huge, super fresh, and unique in the sense that its got a very foresty feel to it, and some mineral richness that are both uncommon for the style. not that location matters, but this feels more like a Canadian beer to me than one made in florida. its got the real sturdy bearded sort of fortuity that I just don't associate mentally with the sunshine state. this is super impressive. big creamy feel that keeps the foam going in the mouth but doesn't get heavy. its sort of soapy in feel, but not in taste obviously. bitterness in the finish isn't very intense at all, almost tranquilizing really, and the alcohol is invisible. I could not have asked for a better sixpack for cold weather drinking on the Furthur lot this weekend. truly one of the few beers that lives up to the hype, this is a gem."
I was surprisingly impressed by this IPA. Living in Florida I've had total access to CCB's line up of beers. I have to say that I don't love them all but Jai Alai Is my kind of IPA. The color is very golden and pure. The aroma is a terrific citrus smell with the familiar pine presence as well. The taste follows the nose with a up front citrus presence followed by the hops to back it up. Just the right amount of hops without getting out of control but enough to keep the hop heads happy. Excellent balance with the 7% abv completely hidden and all you can think about is popping another beer. Overall this is an excellent IPA and is now part of my regular rotation. I only wish it were a little less expensive.
12 oz can canned on 01/15/2013 poured into a Duvel tulip.
Poured from a 12oz can into a pint glass. 
"12 oz can, canned on Jan 15 2013."
"A great year round IPA by Cigar City, you can only get this beer in can or on tap. Cigar City has halted bottling this beer. A fruit bomb IPA that has a beautiful golden hazy color with a nice two finger head. Hoppy and sweet with a nice dry finish. This is truly one of Florida's great beers that the rest of the United States needs to discover. They are starting to brew some great beers in Florida."
Well looky here...
Canned on 12/11/12
A- Pours a hazy copper color with some interesting floaties in it. Head is off white and about a quarter of an inch high.
12oz can into tulip.
I suppose my tastes have changed since I first had this one. It has the nice balanced citrus from the hops with a long lingering bitterness that does not become unpleasant.
Appearance is cloudy with sediment of some sort. The color is amber with a smallish head.
"Finally, some Jai Alai - canned, of course. Pours a nearly copper, light-amber color with mild clarity - just a slight sheet of haze muddles the middle of the brew. Little, tiny, tiny bits of sediment circle around the beer; a cloudy, pillowing white head retains like a beast and leaves chunky-ass lacing along all edges of the glass, like a true champ. "
Thanks kpanter for hooking me up with this FL treat. Canned 7 Nov 12
"Canned 12/27/2012. Poured from a 12oz can into a perfect pint glass. I poured it sort of hard, and did not see the label on the can suggesting a gentle pour until it was too late. Oh well. I have another can so if this doesn't work out or whatever, I have another shot at it. "
"Canned 12/30/12. Pours a tanned leather with a frothy 3 fingers of rocky foam - nice head and legs. While i am writing this i already know how i want to score this but the ""bros"" 100 for this beer is amazing to me. As far as i know they havent given us sixes to rate with. This beer is nowhere near heady, pliny, anything by alpine, sucks, columbus ipa and the list goes on. Really, if 100 is perfection its unfair to rate this beer that high but it is a good beer; but i digress. The nose brings caramel malts, lime rind and honestly not much else this is very malt forward and struggle to find any tropical qualities to this beer (i love cigar city and have many of their beers i am just struggling to see why this is rated so high). Mouth brings a slightly herbal twinge, cat piss and some light shades of citrus - beginning to think my less than a month old can is past its prime (this is the second one i opened and both are consistent). Easy to drink much in the same way moretti doppio malto is, overall this is barely above average in my book."
Poured from a 12 oz can into a tulip glass. Acquired in a trade from RayUF07
Drank it out of the 12-ounce can. Very first Cigar City beer and I was blown away. Poured a copper to golden color. Drank smooth and had a great citrusy and tropical fruit aroma. Drank it straight out of the can most of the time. This beer has everything you want in an IPA. Has jumped up very fast on my list of IPA's. Great Beer!
"I hope it's OK if I freestyle here. Everybody else has summed up the basics. I really like this beer and can't believe something this good is available at my local Publix, in a can no less. A true west coast (of Florida) IPA. Super delicious. My wife is on antibiotics right now and it really pisses her off when I squeal like a little girl after each sip cause she can't have any."
Thanks to Momar42 for the can! 12 oz can poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass.
Received as an extra in a trade for some other CC stuff I had coveted. 
"12oz can (Happy Bday Joey canned 12/3/2012) into a tulip. Pours a hazy copper color w/ a few particles of sediment or some other crap, a nice sudsy bright white head that leaves behind some sticky clumps of lace."
Thanks to Dopplebockulus for this one. Poured into 9oz Pilsener glass. Poured a lightly hazy yellow-gold color with an inch of just off-white head that had good retention and very good lacing.
Pours golden-amber color with thick head that lingers well.
"Poured from the can into a pint glass, the ale was a copper color and producing a 1 inch head. Sediment was evident throughout the glass after the initial pour. The foam left lacing on the glass, demonstrating some retention. The nose was a big citrus hop aroma, an array of citrus fruit were present. In the initial taste one detects notes of ginger, grapefruit, papaya, guava, and a certain degree of earthiness. After the initial pour, the carbonation mellowed pretty quickly. This allowed the fruit to linger nicely on the tongue, giving the impression of citrus fruit skin. In the aftertaste, one detects grapefruit and pineapple continuing. A mild warming sensation lingers on the back of the throat. A very well produced American IPA with a diverse palate."
Poured on 16JAN13 into tulip glass
"Pale in color, poured fine with a good, very light colored head. "
12 oz can poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass. Canned on what looks to be 12/1/12.
"12oz can poured into a pint glass. CANNED ON DEC. 17th, 2012. Really happy I have access to cans of this, it really keeps the hops fresh."
"Pours a dirty copper with a big frothy cream colored head. An aroma that is biscuity and citric, nice interplay between malt and hops. Flavor follows suit but the citric is more upfront and is both juicy and sweet and some tropical fruits are also there. A touch of bitterness in the finish. A medium to light body, nice activity. Overall, this is a great IPA and right up there with Odell's IPA, Bell's Two Hearted, Brew Kettle's White Rajah for favorites of this style."
12oz can poured into a Ommegang chalice glass
"Pours a hazy copper, with dense white head. Settles to a thin ring, leaving a sheet of delicate lace halfway down the glass. Smell: grapefruit rind, tangerine with passion fruit and a woodsy note. Taste: sugared grapefruit, apricot, light caramel and biscuit, a little toast. Medium bodied, juicy into oily, finishing sticky and drying with a mouthful of citrusy hop flavor. Canned Dec 10th. Hadn't had one of these for quite a while, which was a mistake, because this is excellent."
"Poured into a Dogfish signature snifter. Bottom of can says ""Happy B-day Joey Canned On 3 DEC 12."" I know that guy!"
"Lasting, rocky head. Leaves ring lace after every sip all the way down to the end. It's hazy with a darker amber color."
"Being from New England (w/ lots of great micro-brews), my brother proudly took me to Cigar City Brewing in Tampa Florida. And I must say I was very impressed with both the quality and the number of excellent craft-brews on tap. The organization is very well run, and I fully expect to find their beers in the New England region in the near future ( I can see them expanding nationally)."
Chilled 12 oz. bottle into a pint snifter. No visible bottling date.
Poured into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. Golden orange color and a bit cloudy. Medium sized carbonation bubbles. Head is a small one finger and bright white and firm in appearance.
Poured into my trusty DFH tulip... I love this beer glass. (If you haven't noticed)
"Short review: Bottled served in a pint glass, clear golden amber with 1 finger head with great head retention, sticky. Nose has nice flora and citrus hops notes, very pungent. Taste full of light malts and moderately bitter floral, grapefruit citrus, and a touch of mango. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Really enjoyed it, solid IPA Cigar City has some great things going for it!"
Can to HFS sniffer
"Crisp looking and deep gold/amber with some sediment present; exceptional foam, nearly a full inch; heavy lacing as well; smell-wise, this beer is really floral; smells like tangerines and oranges; Jai Alai has a pretty subdued taste given the heavy hints of hop and citrus on the nose; I'm getting notes of hops, bitter orange and tropical fruit, and some kind of cream; there is depth here, but I can't pinpoint what the layers are; it's crisp, creamy, and makes my glands salivate when I drink it; there's a solid malt-hop balance in the mouth; the bitter hops linger long on the tongue; overall, this is a solid IPA...plenty of punch packed without tasting too boozy. Great can of beer that I liken to Ska's Modus Hoperandi...with a little less bitter-hop up front and a lot more creaminess."
A: Hazy orange-copper with plenty of small floaters; small off-white head.
Poured from a can into a clean tulip glass. 
Had this beer at Tallahassee brew-fest
This is beer is pretty much what I have in mind when I think of an IPA. 
The beer pours cloudy bronze. Maybe two fingers of head that recedes to very light lacing. 
"Straight pour from 12oz pry-off bottle to a 25cl Duvel Single tulip; bottling date of October 15, 2012 printed almost illegibly in red ink near the top, towards the back of the label on the yellow ring (“15 OCT 12” ??). Glad Cigar City uses bottling dates (especially with day, month, and year), but they could use something a little sturdier and clearer. "
Beer pours a cloudy orange color with a nice sticky white head.
Thanks Jayhoop!
Enjoyed this 12oz bottle out of a large snifter glass.
12oz extra sent by Willcarrera. Thanks! As far as I can tell this was bottled 12 days ago.
"Reviewing the Jai Alai IPA from Cigar City Brewing out of Tampa, Florida. "
A: Poured a hazy deep orange with a small white cao which fades leaving a small dose of white bubbles and light lacing
"12 oz can into a shaped pint glass. First Run, October 04, 2012 making it one week old. Thanks to robinsmv for the cans!!!"
Can thanks to robinsmv. Canned on 8/04/12 (first can date!!). Poured into a teku.
"Have had this from the can and the bottle. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a creamy white head on top. Aroma is huge mango and grapefruit, with some bitter pine. Flavor follows with beautifully tropical citrus notes, and a nice hit of bitter pine on the back end. Supported by plenty of malts, and no hint of the abv here. Light and airy, high carbonation, slick, and beautiful. Awesome beer to have regularly."
"I don't normally review anything but this beer is phenomenal when served from the bottle (more later on this). It pours a golden color with a very prominent head. It is unfiltered so I pour 3/4ths then agitate sediment and pour remaining. The result is a hazy golden brew with a wonderful head. The smell is dominated by the hops producing an ultra fresh citrus aroma. Upon first taste, the hops is also pronounced but what sets this apart from every other IPA is the wonderful malty taste and full bodied mouthfeel."
Poured from a bottle into a pint goblet.
Pours a cloudy copper with a foamy ring; head disappears right away. Medium-heavy even lacing. 
Obtained through a trade. Thanks miamichael2 for sending them my way.
It's been some time since I first tried this one; but that was from a growler. So I'm interested to see how this one ends up.
Serving Type: 12 oz bottle poured into .3 L tulip. Bottling date unknown.
A - Typical IPA look. Hazy golden orange with a good white head. Leaves fair lacing.
Appearance: Hazy to the point of being opaque. Light amber/orange color with a pillowy off-white head that leaves great lacing.
Thanks Chardlogic for the extra.
"12 oz bottle, no bottled-on date, poured into a tulip glass."
"So I'm sorry that I missed it but on of the top Cigar City guys came to Hop City a couple of Saturdays ago and brought us some fresh bottled Jai Alai, Maduro brown, and some other great stuff I didn't get to try. "
"Appearance -- Deep Gold to Pale Amber, little to no lacing. Head dissipates quickly. Little carbonation. "
Thanks to Mark and Joan for bringing this back from Florida!
bottled july 10 (8 days old!!) SA PP glass
Poured chilled in weizen glass
"Pours a very murky grapefruit color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is initially malty, quickly followed by citrus and tropical fruits. Lovely hop aromas with some nice pine and pineapple. A bit of melon with some grapefruit as well. Taste is bitter hops at first, which fades to tropical fruits (mango, pineapple, guava) and citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemon). Quite complex flavors here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic IPA."
"Served in a bottle at Cork City Pub in Hoboken, NJ"
"Pours a hazy, copper color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, slight yeast, hint of dough, slight floral, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hops, slight alcohol, sweet malt, hint of citrus, and a hint of caramel malt. The mouth feel is great for a strong IPA. The hops are bold, but there is enough malt and citrus to balance the flavor and not let the hops become overpowering. Great appearance, aroma, good body, and blend."
Pours a hazy orange with one finger of white head that dissipates in about a minute. Tons of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.
Poured from the tap a bright copper-orange color with two fingers of off-white head.
"A: Golden orangish light brown color, cloudy, 1.5 finger head. Good amount of lacing. "
"Consumed March 29th, 2012."
"I acquired this in a trade a while back and waited a little too long to try it. This bottle date was 2/2/12, so it's almost 4 months old. It was tasty none the less."
Bottle poured into a FFF tulip glass
"On tap. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on jan´12. Amber color, crystal clear appearance. White in color, rocky froth. Sweet malts & tropical fruits, resins & floral hops to the nose. Dry bitter flavor, slightly fruity with malty hues. Voluptuos palate. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Citric finish & fruity aftertaste. Refreshing, but quite fat drinkability."
"Clear, light brown. A thin but fluffy offtan head with decent retention and good lacing."
"A- 1/2"" tall head that fades to about 1/4"" rather quickly. Color is a little more caramel than I am used to for an IPA. Excellent perlage. "
Received as an extra in a trade with HeatSeeker. Poured into a Duvel tulip.
"Pours dark orange to light amber, one finger creamy white head with lots and lots of bubbles. This is also crystal clear."
Fantastic. So Tasty. The smell is great - candied grapefruit and peachy/tropical fruit and floral something. Wonderfully pungent. Taste follows suit and isn't particularly bitter. Enough to not be round but not so much as to be distracting. This goes on my long term winners list.
"Appearance: Golden, slightly hazy; somewhat darker than a generic IPA. Pours a small white head that recedes quickly."
Poured into pint glass
"Pours a nice clear dark golden with a decent off-white head. Aroma is strongly hoppy with an undertone of grapefruit and a hint of orange. Hoppy flavor has grapefruit and fresh-cut pine wood tones, not overly bitter, and a hint of Mandarin orange. Lively texture has firm body and good fizz. A good, if not outstanding, IPA, worth a try if you like this style."
"For an IPA, especially one touting the bold bitter taste, I found this to be amazingly smooth and pleasant, and really drinkable."
12 oz bottle poured into pint glass. NOTE: Review updated slightly from late August 2012 batch.
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into my Bruery snifter.
Appearance: Unfiltered golden body with a 2 inch eggshell white head. Laces great on the glass and head retains well.
A: Golden orange with a large foamy head. Very good retention.
"Light amber beer with tinges of red & a foamy, thumb sized white head with good retention."
"Bottle says 17 March 2012. Not sure if that's when it was bottled or when it's best by, and an internet search didn't help. It's 27 March today, so this is either really fresh or old."
"Jai Alai into a pint. Didn't think Cigar City had bottling info, but there is a date of 'JAN2012' stamped on the side of the bottle. Not sure if it's a bottle date or a best-by. Hoping it's the former."
Without a doubt one of the best IPA'S in the world. Lots of character to the senses and one of the only IPA's I consistently find myself enjoying and recommending to friends.

12 oz bottle Erin brought from Jacksonville. Bottled 1/20/2012.
I've had this beer which is as of the review unavailable in my home state of CT about five times now... consistently Jai Lai has delivered... this is among the cream of the crop as far as east coast ipa goes! I am greeted by cloudy glowing orange brew a light lacing resting on the edges of my glass. Earthy and Fruity on the nose the beer is a mouthful of grapefruit candy that finishes with great focus... The finish is what makes this beer... dry and hoppy your left with an uplifting foresty & piney goodbye.
12 oz bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead chalice.
Pours a very clear light amber with a good amount of head and really impressive lacing.
got this in a beer trade through reddit. gave up 2 bottles of pliny the elder and received 4 grolsch bottles full of jai alai poured from a tap in Alabama.
"A - Hazy copper and gold in color with a one finger slightly creamy offwhite head and some small bubbles coming to the top, pretty beer. "
Appearance: Nice crimson/ amber. Pours a beautiful fine head over an inch thick.
"12 ounce bottle dated Dec. 2011 courtesy of markwise poured into a pint glass. Opaque bronze color with a sticky tan head. Smell is rich in malt and hops alike, with gobs of caramel weighing down a piney citric hoppiness. Flavor is along the lines of your typical ’balanced’ IPA, plenty of crystal and caramel malt notes with a complementary hop profile instead of a showcase. Nice big bitterness in the finish, with a chewy mouthfeel that dries out well. A perfectly adequate IPA but I’m left wanting more hops."
"Pours a hazy deep Orange/copper with amber hues and an off-white head. Huge aroma of pine and citrus hops with some sweet malt and caramel. Taste is a citrus hop bomb that has a hint of tropical fruit with a touch of pine and grassy hops coming through in the finish with a touch of sweet malt and caramel. Medium mouth feel with a moderate to strong amount of bitternees and well hidden alcohol. Freakin delicious. This reminds me more of a Double IPA, full flavor."
From notes on 12/13/11:
"Got this as an extra in a trade, and all I can say is wow!"
"Served in a pilsner glass at Bonefish Grill, Plantation, Florida. Pours an orange gold with a thin head. Aroma is passion fruit and sugared grapefruit. Taste is a bit rough - grilled grapefruit skin, no sweetness here. Paired decently enough with my grouper and mango salsa. However, this will not be a go-to IPA for me. Plenty of much better stuff out there."
very nice ipa... be sure and leave about an inch in the bottom of the bottle and swirl vigorously to get all that cloudy goodness @ the bottom... i also like the 7.5abv for it being marketed as only a straight ipa and not an imperial... oh damn... not enough characters... how about now?
Pours a clear copper color with no head or lace. Tha aroma is of bread crust and grapefruit. The flavor begins with grapefruit and caramel notes with an overpowering hop bitterness in the finish that's almost medicinal. There's a strong bitter aftertaste long after it's gone. The mouthfeel is medium-light. Cigar City Jai Alai IPA is a so-so beer that fits the style ccriteria. Not recommended.
"I've avoided evaluating bottled versions of IPAs because it is a style that needs to be enjoyed fresh. Being that bottled beer seldom reaches the drinking glass fresh, I can't consider my tastings fair source for evaluation. This is an exception."
"Aroma is nice, I immediately pick up citrus and pine on this one. Nice sweet tropical fruit on this one too."
"A: Copper, sort of rust color, with a finger size eggshell color head. Lots of lingering carbonation"

Got this at De Bierkoning in Amsterdam. 
"Pours a clear golden amber with a good cream head. Good head retention, but no lacing."
"Thanks to FishGetter for grabbing me my first Cigar City brew. Served this chilled, in a pint glass, from a twelve ounce bottle. Thanks again Shawn."
"Pours a hazy orangish-amber with a half an inch of dense, foamy, white head that has great retention. The nose is citrusy and floral. The flavor is citrusy, piny and floral with a strong malt base. The malt is slightly bready and a little sweet and the hops are mostly floral but there are noticeable notes of grapefruit and there is a strong pine, bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and well carbonated."
Super excited to be in Tampa trying these beers!
"A: Pours warm copper with a medium large off-white head, kind of soapy but still nice-looking. Dissipates quickly into nice lacings."

"A: The beer is a very nice cloudy gold, with a nice thin white head."
12 oz. bottle brought back from visit to FL and CCB in Oct. No freshness date. Tasted in a Duvel tulip glass.
Pours a hazy orange. Thick white head. About half inch. 
A - Pours a light mahogany color with lighter shades at the bottom of the glass. Two finger head.
"revisiting this beer since i went back to alabama. bought a single can packaged on 9/9/15, making it about 6 weeks old. may have lost some aroma potency, but already better than the bottle i tried almost 4 years ago. amber colored beer that is noticeably cloudy, with a thin, but persistent head. loads of apricot, some mountain herbs, and a little caramel on the first couple of whiffs. more stone fruit, orange marmalade and jalapeno jelly across the palate; there is definite sweetness from the malt bill, but the fruity, floral qualities of the hops rise above. medium bitterness at the back, and deceptively easy to drink. i get why folks in the south praise this IPA from cigar city."
"Pours a clear copper with a big white head and sticky lacing. Carbonation is evident throughout the drink, bubbling up from the bottom."
Pours a cloudy orange with a white head that fades.
A - pours a golden orange with about an inch of foam. Good retention as well as a lovely opaque looking texture.
"I avoided this beer for a while since I'm from Florida and figured no Florida Brewing company could actually brew great beer. I was wrong? This American IPA is one of the best I've ever had. From popping the cap to the last drop, it is one excellent IPA. It will become a regular in my beer refrigerator."
Enjoyed from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. 
Filled growler at Whole Foods - DFH Snifter
"A-pours clear amber with a thin, brilliant white head."
"A cellar temperature bottle is poured into a pint glass. Has a bottled on date of 6/23/11, so the beer is a little old, but other bottles in the six pack tasted fine, so I am going ahead and reviewing (and it's not like I'll have the chance to buy any Cigar City any time soon). "
A: Pours a slightly hazy orange with two fingers of off-white head that recedes into a thin cap with decent lacing.
A big thanks to caguiar for this beer I’ve been wanting to try. Cheers!
"Nice, somewhat different IPA."
Poured from bottle into pilsner glass. (That's what the restaurant gave me). 
Enjoyed in a pint glass
12oz can poured into a tulip pint.
This was a very nice gift in a trade with my beerbuddy Bierenutz. Thanks Dave.
Thanks to trappistlover for this one. Bottle date says JUN2711.
A-Pours a pretty clear orange color. Marmalade hints in the tan head. Leaves bits of lacing. Head dies off a bit.
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass at low altitude.
Poured from 33cl bottle into wine glass.
A - Reddish orange with a nice thick white head.
No freshness dating but I got it just a day ago in a trade...
"A- Pours with a cloud like 3 finger head into my DFH Signature glass. Deep, hazy pumpkin color with a bunch of black stuff floating around the bottom of the glass. The tinted head sticks in huge chunks all over the glass and doesnt let go."
Big thanks to Andrew for the hookup on these...
Poured into a CC snifter.
Appearance: rich syrupy look. Hazy amber. Off white head with fairly large bubbles on the pour. Recedes to a slight ring.
"Good Everyday IPA. Nice inviting aroma of Hops. Nice balance of hops and bitterness. Crafted very well compared to other craft breweries. Slightly Hazy with a light frothy head, Jai Alai is tasty if your only drinking one....or six of them. Cannot wait to Locate some of their other beers."
"12 oz bottle courtesy of MikeLuke23. Thanks Mike. Pours a cloudy light amber with a small light tan head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is light grapefruit, sugar cookie, and a bit of tangerine. Quite sweet. The taste is sweet sugar cookie, caramel, and some light grapefruit. The finish has a strong bitterness. Medium body. Medium-low carbonation. Overall, not that enjoyable. Too sweet. The flavors are in general quite bland with not enough hop presence."
Thanks to markwise for sending me this delicious morsal
"Pours a clear but slightly hazy orange with a two finger head that sticks around. The aroma is orange and pine. There may be some mango and pineapple coming through as well. The taste is slightly sweet caramel with tons of orange and decent pine. Tropical fruits are also coming through as well. Mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation is perfect for the style. Overall, a deliciously sessionable IPA that has become my go-to brew. This is a typical east coast balanced IPA and one that I keep coming back to time and time again."
"a: This was a chill-hazed, murky looking golden color. It was served to me with a small frothy cap."
"Thanks to Stankonia’s Florida LIF, I’ve got a glass full of Cigar City. Thanks again, man – after that Guava Grove, I’m excited to start exploring this brewery."
Had this on tap at the local Buffalo Wild Wings tonight.
"About a finger’s worth of off-white foam, not especially frothy and the retention is average at best, the lacing comes in solid sheets but little stickiness. Murky orange-amber in color with more of a brown than red cast, solid glow throughout, not too many bubbles visible. Sweetly hoppy nose of pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus, pineapple, nectarine, apple fruit and flowers, does show a piney resinous to cut grass and herbaceous side, peppery too, powerful lift and staying power. Full-bodied and close to thick, coats the palate and heavy on the tongue. The carbonation has more fluff than prickle but not that strong in either sense. Dry on the whole, the orange, lemon, grapefruit citrus dominant yet without sweetness. More biscuit, bread here with a touch of honey. The florality very pretty and spreads through the finish. More bite than juice in the peach, apricot, nectarine fruit, falls short of tropical. Very consistent presentation and very good balance, perhaps not that complex but easy to enjoy and doesn’t unnecessarily seek to push the envelope."
Poured into pint glass (Sept. 2011 bottling). 
"12 oz. bottle poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. Comes out a golden citrus color with extremely good clarity. Only a slightly off white colored head. It clings to the glass for dear life, really good lacing. I'm digging the look."
"Pours a clear, deep orange with a 1 finger head that dissipated quickly."
Crystal bright amber with a light head and lacing. 
Poured from a 12oz bottle to a shaped Dogfish Head pint glass.
"I've been meaning to try Cigar City beer for a long time, but seeing that I primarily live in LA, it wasn't going to happen until the school year started and I was back in NY. Now that the time has come, I finally got my hands on some Jai Alai and I can't be more excited to try this. Hopefully I didn't hype myself up too much."
"Pours deep orange, 2 inch frothy white head.."
A regular favorite of mine I'm just now getting around to review. 
"Filled my growler today, just poured a pint. Not my first or last time having this beer, but have not enjoyed a pint of Jai Alai in a couple months so I thought it was time to refresh my pallet. "
Cigar City Jai Alai is an IPA that emphasises woody hops. I didn't like the faint chlorine-like flavours.
"A - HUGE White foamy head! Foggy dark copper brew comes from the bottle. Interesting label, btw. Brew is very thick for an IPA. nice lacing too."
This beer pours a slightly hazy beautiful orange color with thick ivory head that leaves a large amount of lacing to the glass and retains well. The aroma is strong with caramel malt and some earthy hops. The taste is similar with the caramel malt notes being up front and a slightly piney hop finish... Could be a little more hoppiness to the flavor/aroma. The mouthfeel is very smooth and clean finishing. Overall a great IPA.
Bottled: 13JUL11
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Lagunitas pint jar
Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass.
"A finger of bone-white foam rests atop a murky, copper body with orange trim. Little lacing and a somewhat brief duration detract from what is overall a nice-looking beer. Good citrus aromas combine with ample biscuit malt."
"A- A beautiful copper/caramel color that is perfectly transparent. Off white head with a ton of lacing down the glass that clings on pretty much forever, as far as I can tell."
"A: Slightly hazy light amber color with a finger worth of head that lasts forever. Great retention, great lacing."
I've wanted to try this beer for quite some time. Big thanks to Joe for the trade!
"S: Grapefruit and some orange hoppiness, slight bisquity malt, toasty, slightly dank."
Poured into a snifter glass
Pours a hazy orange with a nice fluffy white head that leaves lacing down the glass.
12oz Bottle - big thanks to pushkinwow for this one
A- pours nice brick red/ very light amber color with 2 fingers worth of off-white head
Pours a coppery yellow color with a nice head. A very rich orange/yellow/amber color. Nice.
"12oz bottle, 16oz shaker pint glass"
pours a lovely caramel. crystal clear and nice to look at. small head. lacing.
Received a Contains 12 FL. OZ. bottle in a trade w/ mdvatab & has a $2.89+TX sticker on the side. Poured from the awesome labeled bottle with a cricket player on the front into my 16oz Founder Pint Glass and has a JUN0311 on the front of the bottle. 
A 12 ounce bottle from inlimbo77; thank you!
"A: light amber, orange hues. single finger off white head."
"Enjoyed at the Great Nebraska BeerFest - Papillion, NE..."
A: Pours looks to be fairly big bodied and hazy. Coppery orange in color with a very healthy off white colored head that lingers nicely. 4
"Poured an attractive dark copper color with a head that hung around for quite a while. Aroma was of caramel, tobacco, and hops. Flavor was dominated by caramel malt and hops were not as dominant as I would have liked. Mouthfeel was good and overall this was an easy-drinking beer. Good, but I would not rush out to get it."
A: Poured into a fluted glass. A hazy orange color with a thick white head. Good lacing down the glass as the beer settled.
Cigar City Jai Alai
"Served the 12oz bottle into an English pub pint glass. Beautiful apperance with a one finger creamy head and an amber colored body that didn't let much through. Some lacing was present. The smell of this beer is amazing, as I was pouring it I already started to feel the aromas rising from the glass: this beer hits you with fruits, hops and most of all a strong oak and wood aroma. Nose follows the taste with an oak flavor that ends with a combination of fruits and bitterness in the palate. The alcohol level provides a big punch in the taste and you can feel it in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with slight carbonation."
A: Golden-orange hue with white head that leaves good lace.
"poured into a pint glass.bottle dated aug 2011,im assuming thats a bottling date"
Pours a light orange color with a nice big off white head that falls to a ring and laces well.
"12 oz. bottle, purchased 7/2011 from a reliable bottle shop and well stored since, there is a 042311 printed on label in white ink. Is this the bottling date? Drink by date?"
"a- poured a hazy, amber/burnt orange color into a pint glass. A rather large, white head dissipated quickly, but left bubbles and nice lacing all the way to the bottom."
"12oz bottled June 13, 2011. Served at around 45F."
"Received in trade from GPHarris, thanks for the opportunity. "
"A- Pours a dark, hazy orange color with a nice off white head. Head is gone pretty quick, becoming a thin layer of bubbles and leaves some very nice layered lacing. "
Thanks to Pecafaced for this REALLY big want in the N00B BIF round 5. Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter.
"An excellent IPA, and one that grows on me the longer I drink it. In fact, I drank through 2 six packs before reviewing one, because for me it was hard to nail down the flavors here, as they were changeable and fleeting, but oh so tasty. A nice pour, orange amber with a head that sticks around and leaves some lacing. Very citrusy with a nice bitterness throughout, but it's hard to place the particular citrus flavors and aromas. A bit of orange, grapefruit, and tangerine, and some carambola comes through for me as well. A veritable fruit salad here. There is a touch of woodiness and a little bit of a sour zing, but it all seems to belong. The malt is very well integrated and merely provides a sweet counterpoint to the fruit notes. Very smooth, and not chewy at all. At the finish there are some additional light notes of coconut that help add a little creaminess to the bitter undercurrent and fruity topnotes. A very nice package indeed- a great IPA/"
"I traded for 5 12oz bottles of this with a friend that lives near the brewery. He doesn't know that much about beer, so the trade I sent him was certainly too generous, but it is what it is. I am reviewing on the last beer he sent me. I have been certainly less than impressed with it thus far."
Poured into a tulip from a bottle. Beer is golden orange with white head that dissipates quickly but leaves decent lace. 
12 oz bottle poured into my trusty mug.
"Pours with a thin head that dissipates after a couple of minutes. Medium carbonation, clear with a color not unlike aged bourbon, kind of a dark gold. Smell is malty and herbal, with a touch of brightness."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a BrewDog cervoise glass. Stamp is quite faded, but might read: 042211. Bottled 22 April 2011?"
I have been wanting to try this beer for sometime and finally got my hands on some while visiting FL.
12oz bottle into a pint glass.
12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks to dimenhetfield for this one.
"Thanks to mntlover for the bottle. Pours a mostly clear, orange amber body with a three finger offwhite head. Excellent retention and lots of sticky and clumpy patch lacing."
Thanks to JayAre46 for this bottle. Review from notes
Poured from 12oz. bottle into imperial pint glass.
A- Big huge rocky seafoam head on a hazy orange brown body. Nice lace rings on the glass.
A - Very clear golden bronze color. Pours great finger head and really good head retention. 
A: Pours a bronze-orange color with notable clarity.  A large white head sits on top and has decent retention and leaves behind a good amount of lacing.
Bottle: Poured a hazy deep orangey color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and some very good lacing. Aroma consists of citrus notes with loads of floral hoppy notes and a sweet malt base. Taste is a very nice mix between aromatic and floral hops with balanced bitterness and some citrus notes. Malt base is maybe a tad too sweet for my taste though very solid with no watery notes. Boyd is full with limited filtration and great carbonation. Very well brewed and something I could drink on a regular basis.
12 oz bottle poured to my Stone IPA glass. 
Thanks to Trevor for this one.
Pours a reddish gold with a big persistent rocky head. Smell is a great combination of hops and sweetness. Honey and lemons with some great floral notes from the hops as well. Taste has just a bit of sweetness up front followed immediately by a hit of intense bitterness. Herbal and floral notes develop through the middle. Finishes with a very pleasant grapefruit bitterness that lingers for a while in the aftertaste. Very unique- would be immediately recognizable. Medium to full bodied and well carbonated. Overall a really great IPA.
"Pours cloudy orange with a huge 2 finger frothy off white head that didn't move for a while and faded very slowly, leaving excellent frothy lacing clinging to the glass. A great looking beer that was textbook IPA. "
"12oz bottled dated May 25, 2011 into a Duvel Tulip. Just under 2 months old."
"I've drunk a lot of this but it's my first review of it. Luminous golden amber in color and produces a thick, high, rocky head that sticks to my snifter as it falls. Getting a lot of yeasty malt and caramel sweetness in the nose. Sweet forward with the hops coming through in the middle. A bit bubble gummy in the middle, with something strangely like a Belgian character just before the hops rush in toward a dry, bitter finish. Good carbonation and a slightly resiny, drinkable mouthfeel. I realize now that I've been drinking much more hop forward beers lately and this is more complex and a bit sweeter than I remember it being. Nice to know this is from my neck of the woods. Good."
"A - a deep orange with a chill haze which already has me thinking, the 1 finger head came and fell to a ring around the edges, while showing delicate lace the way down."
12oz bottle poured into a Cigar City snifter.
"My case was stamped June 29, 2011. Not sure if its a brew on/bottled on/packaged date but its fresh regardless."
"12oz shared with Klym, Poured into Stonic Nonic."
Poured into a Stone nonic. Thanks to Cavery for the share!
poured into snifter glass.
Poured an amber color w/ a nice thick head that becomes thin but lasts. I'm picking up a fruity musty aroma at first whiff. Apricots and sweet grapefruit come to mind along with caramel and malty notes. There is a nice hop bitterness up front with caramel malt taste in the middle that almost reminds me of a marzen (crazy). It ends with some tropical fruit and earthy tones with tobacco and pine at the very end. Tobacco lingers on my palate for a good while after the last sip of this beer. Perfect balance in my opinion and the fact I can't buy this in my state makes it taste even better. This is a great beer to add to any ipa lovers lineup.
Received in a trade. Thanks goes out to Duff27!
A good looking IPA. It pours a hazed orange that let's a ton of lint through but you just can't see the other side. The head is khaki colored and fast to fade. 
"A: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a copper color and a slightly cloudy consistency. There was an inch of foamy, long-lasting head. Good lacing."
Poured into my Founders snifter.
Single purchased at Abe's.
Bottle
"A- Pours a hazy/cloudy deep golden body, almost copper. Great off-white head that's been here for quite a while now. When it does fall, it falls to a pretty thick cap. Lots of sticky lace all the way down."
"12oz single brought back from Pensacola, thanks Jake. Hard to read bottle date of 4/23/11 poured to a Stone IPA glass."
12 oz bottle poured into a snifter
"12oz bottle, trade from seeswo - thanks mang!"
"Dead-on copper color, an inch of frothy cream-colored foam, and a bit of haze gives Jai Alai an almost perfect IPA appearance in my book. Not to mention some of the best lacing you can find. This beer looks beautiful. Simcoe hops are definitely dominant in the nose, with a noticeable aroma of sweet malt. As the glass empties, there's a slight soapiness, but not in an unpleasant way."
Thanks to sendsilk for this bottle.
"Hazy orangish gold, white head. Decent lace."
"A: deep burnt orange/semi-cloudy, 1 finger head, wonderous lacing"
A - Pours an clear amber copper with a 1 finger off-white head. Minimal lacing.
"A - Hazy golden orange copper colored with an average lasting, whitish head. Little lacing."
My first CCB brew made possible by trade w/ Alieniloquium. Thanks Bro!
"This pours very cloudy dark orange and has nice fluffy head with good retention and lacing. The smell is citrusy and slightly malty…you can almost smell the tartness. The taste has a unique fruitiness that I have not quite had before. There seems to be a robust tea-like presence in the flavor, and I can detect some peppery hops as well. There is quite a bit of flavor going on here, and the body is medium-heavy. There is a pleasant crispness that allows this beer to finish pretty smooth, just as you expect it to linger and be overly syrupy. I’m drawn back to this beers unique complexity again and again. One drink begat another, and so on…"
"Jai Alai on tap at Valhalla, Hell's Kitchen, NYC. "
Okay I just have to say that I am glad this beer has made it to Alabama and in bottle form. I know it is in keg form also but I have not tried it out of a keg yet. I grabbed a bottle the other day when I got my delivery at the store and love it. I have been drinking Bells Two Hearted and SN Torpedo alot lately. This brew was awesome. The pour was a light golden haze and right away I could smell the hops and grapefruit. The taste was smooth and hops were upfront the finish was full of citrus and grapefruit and then smooth after taste. I love this brew and will be drinking more very soon. My new go too.
"poured from bottle into standard pint glass. lots of wonderful soft head. about two fingers (i was aggressive). pours a beautiful golden haze. nose is all malt, tid bit of hops. taste is malty caramel up front then a solid hop finish. not much citrus in this one. if i had to pin-point, id match some subtle grapefruit. mouthfeel is great, awesome and refreshing. overall, great beer. i would drink it again, and again and again. i would definitely like to try it fresh!"
a: a murky golden-coppery color with a very thin lacing left to settle on the top
Served from a bottle into a snifter. 
"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. The beer was served in a pint glass, and it poured a light, yellow-copper coloring with a light, fluffy head. Aromas of fresh fir trees, slight citrus, and fresh cut grass. The beer has a great lacing as you drink. Flavors are light, citrus sweet malt and a heavy foundation of fresh, peppery hops. Very well balanced. The aftertaste is crisp hops and grapefruit, with a dry and bitter finish. Tasty and light!"
Appearance - Pours orangey tan with a moderate amount of head. About one finger of head with an aggressive pour into a snifter glass. Carbonation sticks to sides as the beer is swirled around. 
"Poured into my Magic Hat ""I toured the brewery & artifactory and won this pint glass"" pint glass."
"Pours a malty-orangish, golden-light-brown (or maybe the light is low in here). Has a real nice egg-shell head on it. The nose is hops, malt. I get big simcoe and pretty big, sweet malt. The taste is big, sugar malt balancing a nice hop flavor. There is a definite simcoe presence (which I firmly believe makes an ipa taste horrible when old), but this beer is evidently fresh. More sweet than hoppy, this really drinks like a lower ABV DIPA. There is a touch of piney-hop flavor that I think brings this beer around and elevates it from an average IPA. Mouthfeel is sugary and thick (for the style) hanging on the tongue. Overall, I actually really enjoy this beer, but when I break it down it sounds less positive than it is. This is a good one and really nice to try next to the cigar box one (5 nose!) and the white oak one. In fact, this beer comes off like it was designed to be put in barrels. Oh well, I like it."
"Grabbed a sixer at the local Bev Barn. Being the only beer at all from Cigar City in the place, this either sold out really fast, or has been sitting there for a while. My money is on the latter, but I bought it anyway, having always wanted to check out something from this brewery. "
My buddy brought this one back from FL for me. Cheers! 
Poured a deep hazy copper color with quite a bit of beige head on it. 
12oz brown bottle with pry off cap poured in a pint glass. Purchased at Knightly Spirits in Orlando.
"Pours a hazy orange color with a big foamy head that left behind some good lacing. It smells of hops with some sugar and malts. The taste is slightly better, there is kind of a weird wood to this but it isn't a bad thing. Mostly citrus and pine hops on the malts. Mouthfeel is fine for the style. This beer is a pretty easy drinker and not bad, but not great."
Picked up a fresh sixer at Chan's in Destin...
"Pours a beautiful amber with gold hues and a decent head. Solid lacing down the sides, though the head disappeared a little too quick for me. Full, hoppy bouquet with nice fruity notes (I'm thinking peach or apricot, a little grapefruit). Very full, smooth body, which, together with the ABV, really helps simultaneously balance and enhance the hops. Clean, strong bitterness throughout."
Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass from a 12oz bottle.
"On tap from my kegerator, keg filled days ago, picked up from ccb. Poured into my ccb pint glass, orange amber with a sticky two finger head. Lacing is crazy on this one, beautiful beer. Aroma of citrus, floral hops and tropical fruits, this is a very complex ipa. Taste follows the nose, again this is very complex, it borders on a dipa, very intense. Mouthfeel is moderate, smooth with substance. Overall this is the beer that made me fall in love with craft beer. Match Jai Alai up with any of the super-hyped ipa/dipas and I believe it rises above!"
"hello: jai alai is a viciously fast sport played with lethal projectiles. the beer lives up to that legacy. it is viciously hoppy played with lethally good taste. its from tampa, on draught at boomerangs in port orange, fl. "
A - pours a very rich copper color with an impressive foamy 2 finger yellow frothy lace that does a good job of hanging around.
12 oz. bottle with no bottling dates. Reviewed on 4/25/11. 
12oz bottle into a tulip. 
"12 ounce bottle poured into my Lakefront Brewery pint glass. Not distributed here, so received in trade from urwithdave. Thanks Dave!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy golden amber, with one finger frothy off-white head that retains its lacing throughout. Aroma is of pine, pineapple, grapefruit, and spruce hops, with a bit of caramel malts. Taste is sweet resin from the start; caramel malt is more pronounced here, and the pineapple flavor of the citrus hops really stands out. Nice bitter aftertaste from the hops balances things out. Thin, smooth body with medium to high carbonation. Overall, a solid sessionable IPA."
Poured into a tumbler at ChurchKey on tap.
On tap poured Into a cigar city sniffer.
"Cigar City doesn't distribute in my neck of the woods, so I was pleased to have a chance to sample something from this brewery. A very nicely done American IPA - emphasis on fruity/citrus hops, with a well-moderated bittering throughout and a clean, hoppy finish. A touch of sweetness toward the end is pleasant. Big abv is well integrated with little alchohol evident."
12 oz bottle poured into A Duvel tulip at fridge temp. 
L: Pours a nice amber color with a medium sized and medium bodied off-white colored head that laces the glass on the way down.
I picked this one up on a lark on holiday. What a find!
12oz bottle poured into my Bruery tulip. 
Bottle (and 6 pack) provided by my girlfriend from a recent trip down to Florida. Into a pint glass.
"This IPA will knock your socks off! Delicious! One of the best IPAs I've had in awhile. Probably the best since my trip to Minneapolis and Masala Mama several years back. Excellent example of the style. Poured a beatiful coppery/golden hue with great foamy head and retention to the last sip. Aroma gave me chills, as I felt as though I'd been dropped in a pine thicket, or grapefruit grove. Taste is earthy, piney, citrusy, with just a hint of malt sweetness to balance it out. A great beer for hop lovers and hopheads. Definitely one of my go to IPAs for now. Great brew!"
Thanks to Dolfan84 for this one!
"A - Pours a cloudy, dull amber color. A finger of white head sticks around nicely, soapy looking lacing. "
"Pours a murky copper with fluffy white head, nice lacing and the head sticks around for the duration. Smell is hoppy with hints of tropical fruit. Taste is perfectly bitter sweet with hops, guava, papaya, grapefruit, pineapple, and molasses...complex. Medium mouthfeel, balanced carbonation, semi-dry finish that begs for the next sip. "
Jai Alai IPA
A- Pours an orangw copper color. Around a finger and a half of fluffy white head. Very goodhead retention. Once the head falls the beer shows a lot of lacing.
"Pour is a hazy copper tone with a nice white lacing on the glass. Aromas of citrus upfront with a bready, malt component as well."
Poured from a growler into a standard pint glass. 
Poured from 32oz growler. Thanks to Andrew (betsona) for bringing this one over. 
12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.
12 oz. bottled poured into an awkwardly small glass at Grease in WPB.
Appearance-Pours an exceptionally clear (very good) light amber color with a very low head (not so good). It took a very aggressive to get any head. 
"An extra received in a trade with swellbrewer, thanks! Poured vigorously from the bottle into a snifter. "
"Hazy golden color with a nice white head and very good lacing. Very nice aromas of hops, citrus and some malt. Medium bodied with nice bitter citrusy hop flavors balanced by malt, citrus fruit and some sweetness. "
"Jai Alai (said like ""hi lie"") is a game with origins traced back to Basque and was once a big part of florida. This brew pours a deep copper with a medium head of bone color. Lacing is top notch, excellent. Smell is enticing, to say the least, with great attributes being sweet, fruity, spicy HOPPINESS! The taste is clean and fresh with huge floral hoppy notes. Its bitter but the best kind of bitter. I liken it to wasabi(the heat is intense but leaves quick without a trace). Doesn't linger around on the palate like some other well known IPAs. Feel is incredibly smooth, refreshing with a perfect light carbonation. I can't say enough about this beer, easily the best IPA I've had to date. Highly recommended to anyone who likes hops and even those who don't."
"Pours into stemmed glass with a clear, copper-gold color with an excellent white head. Aroma is hoppy and fruity with a gentle notes of apricot and orange. The hops smell fresh, but might need a bit more quantity to really pop."
Ap - The beer pours a hazy copper with a one finger off-white head. There's a fairly substantial amount of lacing left in the glass even though the head dissipated to a thin dusting on top after a few minutes.
Got a six pack from a buddy who came up to visit me from Florida. Poured into a pint glass. 
Big off white foamy head that hangs around for a long long time. leaves huge amounts of gobby lacing. very cloudy as well.
"We pour a somewhat hazy, tawny colored brew. It supports a fluffy beige head of two fingers which, as it slowly recedes, leaves thick lacing around the glass. Head retention is nice, as big bubbles sit amongst the rest of the cushion. There is no sediment noted, and carbonation appears to be standard. In the nose, sweet Simcoe hops, in all of their piney glory, sing off the top. They also give a foresty, woody vibe, but not as strong as something that is barrel aged, by any means. Other hop varieties are noted, with a souring citrus sitting strongly through the belly of the scent. Sweetness is enhanced by pings of tropical fruit, but for the most part earthiness is retained. As we sip, bittering hops hit up front. There is also a syrupy sweetness, and thickness that is palpable immediately. This is lent from a white sugar quality, fruity esters, and honey. Malts come to balance through the middle, but sweetness persists to the peak of the sip. We finish cleanly, with slight bittering from citric hops, and a cooling plastic phenolic character. The phenols breathe through in the aftertaste, along with deep malts, almost caramel, and of course with bold hops. The body is medium and the carbonation is medium. There is a thickness to the feel of each sip, which gives a nice froth and slurp the whole way through. The mouth is left fairly dried, but is otherwise happy. The abv is on the higher end for a “single” IPA, but drinkability remains high."
Big thanks go out to sendsilk for including this one in a trade. Thanks a lot Matt! Been wanting to give this one a go for a while now. Bottled on 4/13/11.
A- Pours a Ridiculous two-inch foamy head atop a clear orange/light-red beer. Awesome drink-by-drink lacing clumps left on the glass and the head retention equals one of the best I've seen on an IPA thusfar. 
"And the earth turns on its axis, another day that we went on and dreamt of all the things we wanted to be, all that we wanted to make... the cargo in the sandboxes, a sliver of meaning to our bleak ineptitude. A beautiful beer set before me, a frothy, orange, lacing beer. and we dream of the days that were or will be or wish will be... this longing, you know? longing inside you, inside me, for something... a longing to go home, a nostalgia for somewhere we've never been, a homesickness for those moments of love and ecstasy, those moments of euphoria when the music hits just the crescendo we had hoped for... but even then the beauty is not in the thing itself. The beauty is in something deeper, somewhere deep under our felt longings, something that tugs at our souls and gives us that notion that we need, and we need deeply, though we know not what.. it's a sadness, a distance, an ache that needs fulfilling... and we breathe in beauty and breathe out carbon dioxide, and we give the trees life, and they give us life, and there's something much deeper, something much more meaningful, you're certain of it, but it's just there on the edge of your brain, like a memory of a word that you're sure you know but you can't seem to just draw it out... "
Got this one from sendsilk.
Big props to my boy Colin (Alienoqium) down in Sunny Florida for keeping these tasty treats coming! Poured from a bottle into snifter. 
"A - Typical light bronze IPA colored, just barely hazy. Nice head that lasts and tons of visible carbonation."
12oz bottle poured into pint glass.
"It was our annual trip to Tampa...the night before THE BUCKEYE CRUISE AGAINST CANCER!!!! The better half and I walked a couple of blocks down from our hotel and found a wonderful spot to taste numerous different brews. The second beer I tried, thank to the suggestion of our server...was Jai alai IPA...WOW. This was quite AWESOME!! The color was a rich cloudy amber. The nose inclued a combination of hops, cirtus, and pine...what else would you expect!. This of course fed into the taste of the beer which was WAIT FOR IT...citrusy....and piny. I could drink this....wait for it....give it to me Lionel...ALL NIGHT LONG!!!!"
Presented in a 12 oz. brown bottle at Doc Ford's Sanibel Rum Bar & Grille and poured into a chilled (groan) pint glass. 
"A- Pours a darker than expected orange. Cream colored head that fades, but never entirely dissappears."
Scored a couple of bottles of this from the NEPA Beer Club's latest split...
Poured from a 12oz bottle. 4/21/11
"Had a 10-oz. draft served in a tulip shaped glass at City Tap House. Poured a hazy-like light orange copper color with nice bright white finger width head. The foam clung to the sides of the glass with each ensuing sip. Smelled nice & hoppy, mostly citrus-like, but not too overwhelming. Tasted great - not too overly bitter, but enough to satisfy just about any hophead. Overall, a pleasant surprise. Had previously never heard of this brewery before, but I'll definitely give this one (and other brews from their lineup) another try."
"This is my first beer from Cigar City Brewing Co. Overall a quality beer. Nothing stands out as exceptional, but it drinks smooth and has a nice finish. Nice color with a surprise slight smokey finish, that may be the oak aged coming through. I would buy this beer again."
"The hazy amber brew, measuring about 26 degrees Lovibond, doesn't develop a very large head, but the one it does is creamy and has pretty decent retention. "
6 pack from Deciccio’s in Brewster. Had on the train to grand central with Jlynn and some college girls… Giggity. 
"A- Pours a Hazy GOlden color with a off white 1 finger head, Nice lacing"
A: Dark golden hue with a steady tan head and very nice lacing that clings to the glass 
Way past 5 o'clock. Hate playing from behind.
"I've had many of these over the course of the last couple weeks. I wish Cigar City distributed to Ohio. With continued success, they just might!"
Wow. What great IPA!
"pours a golden brown with a nice head that retained nicely. Smelled of a good amount of citrus, cedar wood and a light malt backbone. Tastes a bitter hop pine flavor little citrus and slight malt presence. Not as complex as I would like but a solid beer indeed. Medium bodied and decent carbonation, very refreshing and good mouthfeel. Overall, a very good IPA but nothing crazy. I would have liked more tropical fruit and floral presence. But that is just me."
"Amber, almost chestnut beer with a standing two-finger head."
"An extra from CaptianRedBeard thanks man, 12oz into an av snifter"
12oz bottle into tulip.
"12oz bottle from the Foodery, Northern Liberties."
"This beer pours a dark amber, burnt orange in color with a one finger soapy white head. It's mildly cloudy and has constant bubbling from the bottom of the snifter. It smells of dry, sticky, sweet, piny hops, some light citrus and bubblegum. The flavor too is pretty top notch. It features a nice array of piny hops, sweet and sticky malt, and citrus and bubblegum in the aftertaste. It drinks well for the style, is both sweet and bitter but like most IPAs it gives me cotton mouth. This is a really good IPA and very drinkable. I had a few on the beach last week and it was perfect. I'd highly recommend it and I'm glad it's one of their year round releases."
Thanks to gtreid for this 32oz growler poured into a shaker pint glass and split with another BA. 
"12oz bottle purchased from Pinocchio's in Media, PA. Thanks! No bottle date listed, but purchased in early April with understanding it was ""fresh"" (to them at least). Poured into DFH pint glass."
Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This is one gorgeous looking brew. Dark copper color that looks very lively with a great white foamy head.
"First tried this at Dos Caminos in Fort Lauderdale. Amber-orange appearance with a nice white head. Aroma is a very citrusy scent. Taste was fantastic; I occasionally drink a beer that makes me stop and say ""wow"", and this was one of them. Incredibly refreshing citrus/grapefruit hop character with a little bit of pine; perfect bitterness. The hops are perfectly balanced with the malt flavors; it avoids pushing over in the hop bomb type of brew. After drinking this in Florida I was incredibly disappointed that we couldn't get it in CT; didn't take me long to make a NY roadtrip to stock my fridge!"
"Appearance: 12oz bottle poured into Sam Adams ""Perfect Pint"". Colour is a light tannish-brown. 2-finger head, slight visible carbonation."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a hazed burnt orange with just a really well definded whitemgreat defintion here,it faded slowly into a frothy mass leaving two rings of lace behind as it did.Tropical fruits and some herbal notes in the nose,underlying caramel biscuit.Fresh overripe tropical fruit,some resin,and herbal hops are not in your face they just flow nicely together.There is a bigger sweetish malt base that holds firm to the hops till the end.A very well made IPA with the alcohol being well hidden,I could drink alot of this."
Thanks to Lerxst!

"This is just as good as I remembered it being the first time I had it. This beer it a really nice amber color on top of the glass that fades to a golden yellow. The head disappears fast and there really isn't much lacing. The aroma is really hoppy, makes me want to go for a swim in this beer. It's aroma is wonderful. The flavor is aggressively hopped, floral and citrusy. The mouthfeel is medium and begs for you yichang another."
"Picked up a single at my local Gateway grill for 4 bucks. Since I never seen a Cigar City beer I bought it up. Glad it's a grade ""A"" beer!"
Thanks again to Brian44556 for the awesome trade.

"Really pumped for this one. All I hear about is how Cigar City is a great brewing company but difficult to get. Also wanted to try this one b/c I used to live 3 minutes away from a Jai Alai stadium, does this game still exist? Lucky for me I got a 6er. Lets try this out."

"Bought this at total wine in Fort Myers, Fla. Pours a hazy orange. Smell is of lovely hops and grapefruit. Taste is very hoppy, and you can really pick up the fruitiness of the hops, I'm getting some malt coming through too, mouthfeel is definitely thicker than the IPA's I have tried, syrupy but with some carbonation. I love cigar city's brews and I want to drive up there and take a tour, this brew I could probably drink 3 bottles but the ABV packs a punch, Excellent DIPA"
"Pours cloudy copper with a finger of white head. Aromas are in your face citrus hops. Grapefruit and pine. Flavors follow with a citrusy hop explosion but are balanced out by a perfect amount of caramel malt. Good carbonation, and a sticky residual mouthfeel. This is a solid IPA."
"Gotta love it, strolling through TW and Cigar City catches my eye. Pricey but so far proven. Jai Alai? That's usually rigged, but how do you rig a bottle of brew? it is good or it isn't. On that note, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top this brew has a nice citrus hop note with some arid maltiness. On the pour its a slightly cloudy yellow with a big beige head On the taste this brew is big citrus , starting with a tinge of grapefruit, moving quickly into orange then very quickly into banana then finishes big into a high test licorice . The AC stands out big on the finish but it is very smooth. This is almost like a reverse shot with a chaser, or a pain in the ass with a 151 floater. Extremely unique. Mouthfeel is like silk. I'm drinking this brew at about 62 degrees in a 68 degree climate. Incredible! I see what all the rage is."

A-cloudy orange with white head
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. I assume this is an early 2011 vintage. 
"Pours a hazy orange with a tight fluffy head, has some floating sediment in the body. Smells of sweet citrus and pine resins. Something else coming through, can't put my finger on it. Very resiny, oily, citrus component comes through as a sour bitter grapefruit. Has a touch of sweetness at the end. Leaves my mouth puckered and watering. This is a drinkable 7 1/2 %. My first beer from Cigar City, impressive."
Thanks to sburrough. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. 
Pours a deep orange/gold color. Nice fluffy cream colored head than slowly descends to a thick blanket. Nice lacing. Smell is malty with tropical hop aroma. A. Lot of tart tropical fruit hop flavors with a malt backbone. Some Carmel notes due to the malt. Long lingering slight bitter aftertaste.
"No bottle date, batch codes, or best by. "
"Pours amber-orange with a pearl white one-finger head. Not much lacing, decent head retention. Big hoppy aroma. Tropical and pine hops dominate, also a bit of floral hops, bready malt and alcohol present in the nose. Taste is what you'd expect from the nose. Big citrus hops, a little sweetness from the tropical fruits mix well with bittering pine hops. A little bready malt sweetness on the back end. Pine hops linger a bit into the aftertaste."
Poured from a bottle into a duvel tulip. 
"First review. Experienced this beer tonight from a 12 oz bottle, given by my girlfriend in a mixed 6 pack. Having lived in Tampa for a few years for college, I have recently found out about the Cigar City Brewery in Ybor city, and I am really excited as its offerings seem to recieve excellent reviews here on BA. "
Presentation: From a 12 oz. bottle into a nonic. Thanks to beveritt for hauling some of these back from Florida.
"Had a pint at Crescent and Vine. This beer is the gray area between IPA and Imperial IPA, but I like beers in here. They're supremely hoppy but still have a decent malt body without being to sweet or thick. I had my glass also with a cheese plate and this went fantastically with the Irish cheddar and Stilton Blue. "
I was pretty excited when my parents brought me back a sixer of this from their vacation.
Received this one in a trade with GallowsThief (Thanks Rich!) Been wanting to give this IPA a shot. Also my first offering from Cigar City. 
Poured an orange with yellow and a little cloudy. Nice thick white head that fades and brings decent lacing.
I paid $11.49 for a six pack of Jai Alai at Sweetbay. 
Big thanks to Jessee for this bottle in our recent trade.

Poured from a fresh 12 ounce bottle into a nonic.
"This is one of a couple of beers I picked up at Fairway on a recent ""cabin fever"" day trip to NYC. I've heard good things about Cigar City, but this is the first beer I've actually tried from them. I'll be on the lookout for more from them when I'm back in Florida in the summer--not to mention when I'm back in New York!"
"A friends Uncle Bob shipped it from Tampa. Pours a copper orange with a white 3 inch sticky head. Very cloudy in my 13 oz tulip glass,with awesome lacing that sticks around the whole time. Smell is nice, but fairly mellow for a IPA with 7.5ABV. Some citrus and piney hops. The taste is wonderful oranges, pineapple, and pine. Not overwhelming but bitter. Plenty off carbonationand great mouthfeel for a IPA, one of the best I have had. I think this a wonderful IPA. So glad to have a beer from Florida. Wish I had more."
Cheers to David for the opportunity. 
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a nice orangy copper color with ample offwhite head that laced nicely. Smell is of pine with some citrusy grapefruit background. Taste is citrusy with some caramel malt notes. Good smooth, medium bodied feel with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall a great IPA that has quickly become one of my new favorites."
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an excellent malt scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and Carapils malts. The hop character is good. It has a mildly aggressive citrus hop aroma that's spicy, yet compliments the malt bill. The taste is good as well. It has a nice bitter hop punch up front along with a well balanced malt profile. It's an east coast IPA with west coast hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good IPA. It's full flavored featuring both an excellent malt and hop character."
"Appearance: Jai Alai when poured was a little hazy, but still had a nice orange to amber color. It had a good two finger head that lasted a good amount of time."
"12 oz bottle, Glass stein"
Thanks Justin for sending this my way!
Thanks to CaptinRedBeard for sending this bottle.
"Nice mango amber color has a sudsy, white head. Very nice fruit aromas mix with passion fruits. Lots of mango and grapefruit mix with citrusy hops in the nose. Taste is smoothe and bitter, passion fruits mix with tangerine, orange and lime. A tad sweeter than some other IPAs, but this brew stays balanced. Another great brew from CC. Not quite Two-Hearted, but a welcome changeup."
"Smells like a grapefruit wrapped in a hop plant. Fruity, hoppy with some mild piney aromas to it. "
"the one beer (somehow) I picked up at Bierkraft. Hadn't had it, the man at the counter recommended I put it back and get the brown. I shoulda listened."
Pours a bit murky and very orange/gold. A bit of head that dissipates quickly. Some nice lacing. Smells a bit sweet and hoppy. Sme citrus and floral flavours coming through. Taste sweet and full. Sme citrus hops and floral flavors. Thicker than a normal ipa but very drinkable

Cliff's Notes to Cigar City Brewing's Jai Alai
"I had this on tap, out of the bottle, and brought a growler home from the brewery ($4.50 pint, $11 sixer, and $6 quart respectively) - the draft version is significantly better than out of the bottle. This review is of the growler which was split into two imperial pint glasses."
Thanks DmanGTR for the chance to try this brew out!
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Piraat tulip. 
"Pours a dark amber/light orange color. Huge head when poured down the middle of a pint glass. Off white, maybe light tan in color and 2"" tall, retention is great. Still 1"" 5 minutes later. Really nice lace too."
"Jai Alai IPA, 12oz bottle poured in Delirium snifter. Interesting redish amber color with nice solid white foamy head. Head fell quickly but never quite left. Musty hop and carmel malt aroma. Malty, piney hop flavor, slightly bitter carmel finish. Little alcohol presence. Medium bodied and easy drinking. A strong offering."
"A - Golden copper in color with a foamy, dirty tan head. Light lacing left behind on the glass. Beer has a slightly hazed look to it."
Pours a beautiful copper with a nice two finger head that gives a ton of lacing. 
"Reviewed from notes written on 12/14/10. Thank you, zoso1967, for bringing the bottle from PA."
pours hazy bright copper orange with a 1+ finger white head that left spotted lacing
"Received this as part of a mixed case. Never been a big fan of IPA but after trying a few other very enjoyable examples I was looking forward to this one. Very unimpressed. Color was of your average IPA, smell was nothing special. First taste was mostly alcohol and overt bitterness (not a good hoppy bitterness either, just sour). Finished with more of the same but some light fruit and pine coming through. After beginning to enjoy IPAs more this one reminded me of what I don't like in an IPA."
"12 oz bottle received from Tanger in Secret Santa 2010, and poured into a Free State pint glass."
12oz Poured into a Chalice
A: Really nice and clear looking copper color. Two plus fingers of billowy white head. Tons of lacing. This beer is an IPA to the T .
Slightly hazy dark amber with two fingers of dense head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass during consumption.
A - nice deep murky orange but cleared a little after settling in the glass. Thin head poured into a basic thin walled crystal beer mug which I can't really fit into a glass category.
"A rigorous pour into the oversized snifter gets a thin white head that does not stay around long, but some suds do cling to the sides of the glass. Color is a murky deep orange."

12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. 
"Pours a pumpkin golden in my tasting glass with a generous creamy head. Enjoying it with - A Cigar - Hoyo de Monterey Palmas Extra. It holds its own with a cigar, wonderful smell - piney and citrusy - plenty of grapefruit. Lots of mounds in the creamy head, still. Nice hoppy grapefruit tast with some creaminess - not sure if I should call it hop con leche or not, but it is a splendid flavour. Sweet, low on bitterness but the hops keep it toned down. Alcohol seem lower than advertised, but I'll press the I believe button. Mouthfeel is great, I like the creaminess to the texture, I would say medium bodied. Very drinkable but will wait to see what the alcohol does before I pound a few more. I'll try again!"
Special thanks to Pittsky for sending this in a trade. Thanks Jesse!
"Pours a murky, yellowish orange with splotches of red thrown in there. Light beige head that leaves sh*t-tons of webby lacing down the side. It looks great, and it looks like I'm going to smell some citrus in a second!"
I was really excited to try this beer because it is not available in New England. Unfortunately after a lot of hype this beer did not live up to my expectations. The hops were not as in my face as I wanted and the malt notes came through more then I care for in an ipa. Having said all that tho I did enjoy this beer and would drink it again.
"A-dark gold, almost reddish. good amount of cream colored head"
Bottle acquired via trade with jchow79. Poured into standard curved shaker pint glass.
"Jai Alai IPA has a copper-colored body with just a little bit of haze to it. Many strands of carbonation bubbles rise to the top where they create a thick looking, tan head. Good retention and pretty good lacing too."
"A - hazy, translucent blood orange. Pours a two finger head with big, frothy bubbles. Lots of lacing."
"Excited to see more Cigar City offerings on tap at House of 1000 Beers in New Kensington, PA."
"a- very dark (for an ipa) brown/amber, hazy, large head that lasts forever, a nice thin layer of lacing"
"12oz bottle, i stumbled upon while doing some beer shopping this weekend. Cigar City in the 'burgh!"
"very very nice, and a good example of AIPA. kind of straddles the line between east coast and west coast, and definitely has a Florida vibe to it. dark amber with an off-white head that holds forever and leaves tons of lace. nose is soft-caramel, citrus, flower, pine and a touch of tropical fruit. just like an ipa should be. extremely well-balanced, juicy and delicious, with pine and citrus rind coming through in the finish. just the tiniest hint of alchohol (which is remarkable, considering the 7.5abv) and a very cleansing kind of feel to it. great brewery doing things proper in a relative beer wasteland. can't wait to try the mango grove..."
"A= Nice amber color really dark, Nice foamy head and nice amount of lacing."
A: Amber colored hue with gold shining through on the sides. Finger of frothy head with lots of lacing. Nice!
A - Poured a copper color with an off white head that leaves lacing behind
First off - thanks to Bamadog for the hookup with this single from Cigar City. I had the cedar version of this prior and didn't get a chance to review it but thoroughly enjoyed it.
"Purchased in DeLand, FL (home of Abbey) while visiting in-laws for Thanksgiving. Poured into pint glass."
"A really pretty hazy cherry wood amber color with moderate head and some nice lacing. Smell is a bit sweet, malt forward, a little weak. Taste is decent, though this is a far more balanced IPA than I was hoping for. Decent piney hop bill on top of a spicy amber malt (and maybe some rye?) bill. Medium body, nice for an IPA, not over-carbonated like so many out there. Good drinkability, not my favorite IPA, but glad to be able to try it."
"Picked this up at the Whole Foods on Houston St. in New York City. I heard that these guys were up-and-coming and this was the only offering that I was able to get when I last passed through there two weeks ago. Although I like my IPA's nice and hoppy, this one fit the bill as well. Without a doubt, this had to be the smoothest IPA that I've ever had and if anyone wanted to try this style for the first time, this would be the perfect beer for that!"
"I received this in a recent trade with sorelenator, and am quite grateful for it as this is really a great IPA. Review is from notes taken on 11/17/2010 and poured from the bottle to a pint glass."
"Jai alai from Cigar City Brewery. Tampa, Florida"
From a growler I got yesterday at the brewery.
nice bulky tan head with a thick veil of lacing sticking to glass.
a - golden in color. white head with good retention.
"Appearance: light red/amber hue. Vigorous pour yields a very attractive, rocky, frothy head almost an inch tall. It slowly recedes to a respectable 1/6th of an inch or so head after a little bit. Nice lacing left on the glass from the initial head from the pour. "
Amber in color with a decent white heading. Some lighter golden highlight's.
Thanks to dimenhetfield for this one! 12oz brown glass pry-top bottle with no freshness date.
"No bottling date that I could find, so I don't know how fresh it is."
Pours into a snifter with a half inch white head that does not retain. Smells very caramelly with a bit of a hop presence. Tastes very much like caramel with a bit of pine to it. Very smooth with a bit of an afterbite. Very drinkable when it is warmer outside but not as much during winter. I really enjoy this beer and may be underrating it because i enjoy dipas more than regular ipas but this is a great beer.
Golden amber with a white head; full alcohol sweet pineapple nose. Much more alcohol in the nose than one would expect with 7.5%. 
Pours pretty dark for such a hop heavy IPA. I'd call it a copper color but more of a deep copper color.
Reviewed from notes.
Big thanks to SneezyAchew for the extra.
"Wow, really a dark yellow almost light brown, definitely dark for a single ipa. Aroma, a little hoppy, definitely seems to be lacking in any noticeable hop nose. Might not be dry hopped at all. "
Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my perfect pint glass.
Big thanks to Jwiss22 for the great extra. Cheers!
"This IPA pours a honey gold in color with a perfect one inch white head with great sticky lacing. Very aromatic, sweet and hoppy with hints of herbal citrus. The taste is sweet from honey, loaded with hop, and has a good citrus bite. This IPA has a medium body a bit syrupy. This is IPA is great, one of my favorites and a great example of what IPAs should be."

"12oz bottle into a Cigar City Snifter pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice frothy eggshell head that lasts and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight crisp Earthy hops and subtle sweet malts. The taste is loads of fresh citrus hops in front of a nice sweet malt backbone that leaves a nice lingering bitter finish. The beer is on the light side of medium with smooth carbonation and well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable beer, one I would love to have again."

12oz bottle into .3l tulip. An extra from GOGRANDE in an all CCB box! 
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into an SA perfect pint glass. The pour is golden honey and a 2 finger white sticky head. The nose is sweet with mangoes, pineapple and citrus. The beer taste better than it smells, tropical fruit blend with grapefruit that finishes with a slight bitterness. Jai Alai has a sticky medium feel to it and is nicely carbonated. Kinda wish I had picked up a sixer of this instead of the single."
The aroma is malty and hoppy with hops dominating. The hops are citrus and grass. The malt is caramel and a bit of corn. The appearance is beautiful gold amber with a foamy head. The taste is like the aroma with an astringent finish. The palate is smooth and thick for the style. Overall this is a good IPA.
"Received as an extra in a recent trade. I was in the mood for something hoppy so I pulled it out. Poured a hazy amber color, with a medium off-white head. Pretty good hops on the nose, peaches, citrus, pine. On the palate, a little caramel, and plenty of hops keep this one nicely balanced. I enjoyed the cedar aged version, and was quite pleased here as well."
Thanks to korguyu123 for this bottle
A- A nice dark orange color.
12oz. bottle poured into a nonic. Thanks to beerwolf77 for yet another beer!
Thanks to funkybuddha for this treat.
"Pours a hazy, deep copper color with 1 finger off white head that dissipated rather quickly. Moderate lacing. Aroma of sweet malts, bready yeast and grassy, earthy hops with hints of pineapple. This was brewed about a month ago and the hops have taken a back seat a bit but that just leads to a nice balance overall. This is a pretty ""heavy"" IPA or rather the bitterness has a death grip on my palate. The carbonation is spot on though. Don't think I could have more than one of these in a sitting."

This long awaited beer pours a nice clear golden amber with a foamy white head of suds that leave loads of nice looking laciing.
"12oz bottle into a DFH snifter, no indication of freshness but this was a new arrival at the bottleshop when I visited. Jai Alai appears a hazed orange amber color with about a finger of offwhite, yellowish stained head that forms when the brew is poured slowly down the middle of the glass. It doesn't take long for the creamy foam to dissolve leaving quite a bit of lace all about the glass. Swirling the glass produces just shy of a finger's worth of foam every time which quickly receeds to a thin layering atop this brew."
Presentation: 12 oz. bottle poured into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass.

Big thanks to the cheesemoose for this one!
"Copper/orange pour. The color looks similar to raw honey. After a vigorous pour, I still only get maybe a quarter inch of bubbles."
"Glad this finally made its way up to PA. Bottled 9/1/2010, so this one is pretty darn fresh."
Awesome extra received from Kiefdog in a recent trade! Thanks!
A - Less than a fingers worth slightly fizzy slightly off-white head... Miniml retention gives way to splotchy lace with a thicker portion in the center of the glass and a collar around the edge of the glass... A medium bronze color loaded with lively swirling carbonation throughout... A little bit of lacing clings to the glass... 
"Served from bottle into a COAST imperial pint. Poured a hazy red-yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to minimal quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of malt, sweet hops, citrus, and subtle caramel. The flavor was of intense malt upfront that subsided to allow a subtle hop character to come through that intensified as it sat on the palate, and was ended off with a sweet citrus note upon swallowing. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a very nice and smooth IPA. As stated by Jeff (PDXHops) there was no date on the bottle that I could find to confirm freshness. The hop character of this brew was definitely present, but it was not the star of the show. This was a very nicely balanced IPA however that was quite enjoy to drink with dinner. Definitely worth trying if you get the opportunity. Can't wait to try the Humidor version of this one so I can compare."

Acquired this from TheManiacalOne so a big THANK YOU goes out to him!
"Lots of reviews, here's my 2 cents. Try it several times. I was able to get three bottles in a trade and the first sort of turned me off with the spice flavor folks mentioned. But, the third day, I was pretty happy with the unique flavor of the beer. I can't get it locally, but if I could, I'd put it into the rotation. Only fault is Perhaps excessive carbonation, but I'm getting more sensitive to that so maybe it's My problem. I have always liked cask ales. "
12oz into my snifter.
"12 oz bottle, thanks Adam!"
"This was an interesting IPA. It mores much cloudier and darker than other IPA's. The color was a golden mahogany with a small off-white head. The remnants of this head stayed throughout the entirety of the glass. Smells really sweet with nuttiness and rich bread. The hops are definitely there, but in a somewhat subdued citrus note. Really fruity with the hops once it hits your mouth. Tastes range from grapefruit to lemon in this department. Then the sweetness hits. You really get a full dose of bready caramel malts on the back-end of this. This is probably the thickest IPA I've had. It really drinks much bigger than a typical IPA...more so than even some DIPA's I've encountered. I really like this beer. It's certainly big for the style, but quite good nonetheless."
This is a very BIG beer - it is so hoppy and intense that it simply burns any other flavor away.

"A: This beer pours a hazy copper color body with red tints. A rocky-like head that is white in color, diminishes rather quickly, but leaves a lot of sticky lace on the glass."
"from the tap, a 10 oz pour. appears a hazy orange straw color, with minimal head. the smell is a bit spicy, with citrus hops as the main note. the taste is much more balanced, with a nice malt base to play with the hop profile. as with the smell, some citrus in the taste, orange? lemon? "

Poured from a 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.
"Found this at Willards in Largo, Florida. It shows a pleasant, hazy amber color with a solid off-white head and great lacing. The aroma is sweet orange and grapefruit with pine undercurrents. Very solid. The flavor offers strong grapefruit sweetness and grain malt goodness. Considering the ABV, this is very drinkable. It's got a rye touch that bleeds into wheat and citrus. It's medium bodied with a moderately crisp carbonation feel. It's almost syrupy but not quite, with plenty of citrus sweetness with slightly syrupy breadiness. Plenty drinkable for the ABV. Quite a memorable IPA with very good drinkability! Nice."
"Snagged this little gem at an unassuming little liquor store in one of the innumerable unassuming strip plazas here in Florida. I was down here for a family trip and never got the chance to got to the brewery, frustrating as it is only about 20 minutes away, but at least I got a hold of a 6pk. of Jai Alai. Enough curious back story, here is what the beer tastes like to me."
Coppery tangerine with several slow bubble streams leading up to a quality crown of pale khaki colored foam. Head descent is slow and lace deposition is extensive; even more so as more of the glass becomes available. Solid all around.

Happy to pick up a 6er at my local beer stop...Florida Wine and Spirits. Reviewing the last of my 6...here we go:
"On tap @ Rattle n Hum. First off, I am extremely surpised and not in a good way on this beer. It is a nice beer but I believe it was hyped way too high and got my expectations up. Tasted like a standard west coast IPA; undistinguishable if you ask me. Average mouthfeel, amber color, carbonation, bitterness, underwhelming aroma, and not enough sweetness to balance it. Aroma was nothing special and the mouthfeel was average. There's not much I can say about this beer. Good but not worth seeking out and would order many others before this in the future."
"Thanks to RomaniIteDomum for sending these to me in the Hometown BIF. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Perfect Pint glass. A single finger of eggshell white foam formed on top of the murky, golden/mahogany body. The head retained nicely...receding down to a thin, but solid layer; excellent lace."
Appearance: Pours a ruby color with a soapy white head the left little lacing.
Served in a nonic pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 
"Served up a slightly hazy orange amber with a very whipped looking slightly off-white head that leaves decent lace. The aroma is much less hop-centric than many of the IPAs I have had recently. The hop character in the nose is quite nice, with notes of candied orange, mango and peach. There is also a very strong caramel malt presence and plenty of sweetness in the aroma. One sip and I can tell this is not a west coast style IPA. It is hard to say this is balanced, because even when compared to Midwest and East Coast versions, it would appear quite malty. Flavors include orange, grapefruit, apricot, spice, brown sugar toast, and toffee. It also carries a decent amount of alcoholic kick that would seem more in place if it were a double. As I sip this it is like the malt and hops battle for supremacy, each trying to shine. This not necessarily a bad thing. The mouthfeel however, is free from all criticism in that it is smooth with just the right amount of carbonation and an amazing finish that is neither drying nor cloying. The aftertaste is also a great aspect of this beer, in that it really brings out some of the hop flavors that the malty body obscures. As far as drinkability, this is not the best IPA I have had in that department, but it does go down fairly well, especially for being closer to a double in power. This is a very good beer, but it is not necessarily the type of IPA I would most want to spend an evening with."
"Reddish orange with a light haze. Big foamy head that left a white cap and wet sticky lacings. Big hoppy aroma, predominanty grapefruit with a hint of orange. Very smooth feel with soft but lively carbonation. Hoppy, grapefruit and citrus flavors at first that transition nicely into a brief malty character and smooth clean finish. Dangerously drinkable. An excellent IPA!"
"they serve this at the bar down the street from my house. it's AMAZING. the first time i had it it was right after i finished a stone IPA and my friend was trying to tell me to try it but i was hesitant because i was really digging the fact that they had stone IPA on tap. ANYHOW...i was convinced to try it because the brewery is around here in tampa. so first of all the appearance was amazing. nice foamy, sticky, clingy lace. nice amber color. the smell captivated me for like 3 minutes before i even took a sip. smells is like picking a fresh hop, cracking it and smelling it, and also very deep toasty malt. smells soo beautiful. it's really hard to explain. maybe oak chips in there somewhere. taste is a very perfectly balanced romance between beautiful toasty sweet malt and very abrasive (but still beautiful) hops. mouth feel is perfect...but maybe a tad more full bodied than your average american IPA. drinkability is great. the only thing that sucks is that i want to have like 6 of these but i have to drive home....7.5%"

Nice hoppy finish with no distractions along the way. Refreshing."

"On draft at The Lark, East Northport, NY. "
"Appearance: Pours a fizzy, clear, and golden amber with a full two fingers of head that is just barely off-white. The carbonation comes mostly from the center (straight from the bottom) of the brew and is fairly strong. The head goes down pretty quickly to about half a finger, but that is pretty persistent. Stick and uneven webs of lacing correspond pretty well with the foamy bubbles across the top of the glass. "
"Bottle into Sam Adams sensory glass, courtesy Jeff (AleWatcher) from his bottomless stash of awesome beer. Thanks, Jeff!"
"A - Brilliantly clear, dark copper with off-white head and lacing."
"Picked up a 6 while driving through Tampa... Color is a rich copper with a lovely hopp aroma paired with citrus notes. On taste: perfect hop balance for the style, some grapefruit and Carmel. Mouthfeel is exceptional and creamy. This is what makes this beer so spectacular IMO. It's smooth and the Finnish is dry and clean. "
"I had this on tap at the Cigar City taproom. The beer was light copper color, with some chill haze and a thin spitty head, lots of lacing. There were some strongly acidic citrus aromas, primarily grapefruit. Strong caramel malt balance, more balance than I'd prefer, but still the grapefruit from the hops is well appreciated in the flavor. Well carbonated, standard IPA body. Good but not great, again I'd prefer less caramel malt."

"And the new wave of IPA begins- fruit forward with both hops and esters; fused together with a seamless web of maltiness, citrus, tropical and orchard fruit but without compromising dryness, crispness or drinkability. I like where this is going!"
Thanks to madtrixter787 for the trade!
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tall snifter. Pours a hazy golden color, with a creaminess to it. Small frothy white head forms, but dissipates pretty quickly. Appearance is really hazy...surprising for an IPA. No lacing...maybe a sud spot here and there."
"Had this beer a couple of times around town in Tampa (and in the tasting room), but this is my first experience with the bottled version that wasn't brewed a week ago. "
This is pretty tasty. 
"Tasted from 12oz bottle. Pours clear amber with a frothy and long-lasting beige head. Nose of caramel malt, some vanilla, and peach and banana fruitiness. On the front, the flavor is caramel malt. In the middle, the peach and banana begin to come through, and on the back the hops start to kick in with some nice citrus and bitterness and a bit of soapiness as well. The body is fairly light with average carbonation. The finish is long with banana and bitterness. This is an awesome IPA. It is very balanced, and it is the first beer that reminds me of banana that I actually like."
A- Nice amber with 2 fingers of a white head with little/no lacing

Pint glass at Willard's Taphouse.
"Pours a dark golden orange with a fair head with decent retention. Aroma has a sharp citric twang with a cabbage-like musty dankness. Flavor has a mild malt sweetness next to a full bitterness that is slightly floral, leafy, and a bit vegetal. Finish ihas bitter flowers and cookie. Full in body, somewhat warming with a mild-moderate level of bubbles. Plenty of hops and bitterness but not too much flora or fruit to speak of, and an odd nose. Decent drinking but twelve ounces is enough."
"Had a pint of it at the Rattle 'n' Hum bar in NYC, the other night..."
"Pours sunset amber with a fluffy, white head."
I had this on tap at T Brendan O'reilly's in Hbg - served cool in a shaker
This beer pours a deep red with orange and less than a fingers worth of head and low to moderate carbonation. The smell is big sweet and bitter hops with herbal and lemon like hops taking the forefront. The sweet fruity hops seem to be sitting under the bitterness next to the malt which is balanced smelling but restrained on the whole. 
"I've had this on tap quite a few times and I guess I never got around to reviewing it. Thankfully I had a newly released 12 oz bottle handy to rectify this problem. Poured into an ""old-style"" CCB pint with the yellow logo."

More then espectable hop pesence, malt in the rear. Enjoyable and agressive IPA."

Cigar City Jai Alai IPA on Cask!
"A: Light copper hue, decent head, spotty lacing"
"On tap at Cigar City takes NYC event at Rattle 'N' Hum. The regular Jai Alai is a very good IPA. Above average mouthfeel, bitterness. Very cloudy with white head. Grapefruit flavours. Of course more complex on cedar. Good palate cleanser, and good drinker, as many of their beers are sippers."
Thanks to FooFaa for picking me up a mini-growler of this. 
Had this at Blind Tiger in The Village. Great place. 
"Pours a nice clear amber color with a tight cream colored head that left a sheet of lacing around the whole glass as it dissipated. The aroma is of grapefruit hops, with a touch of pine. Has a juicy fresh aroma. The flavor has more of a pine hop with an asprin like bitterness. The asprin character is not too harsh. There is also a fresh grassy flavor as well. The hop profile is supported by a fairly sweet malt, perhaps with some brown sugar notes. The body is light to moderate with tingly carbonation, not that strong, has some nice balance but does finish with a hoppy bitterness. Another very good cigar city brew. This AIPA has good balance and is quite easy to drink. The hop profile doesn't blow me away but it is good."
"Once I finally learned to pronounce this, we picked up a growler to consume back at our cozy beachfront condo. The four ounces that came with the sampler were tantalizing in their hoppiness. "
growler recieved from markwise in the review this bif!
"Reviewed on 10/10/09. Growler from Big Z Beverage. Pours a deep orange/brown with a small white head. Aroma of citrus, caramel malt, and grassy hops. Flavor is malt-forward with grassy hops and crystal malt character. Not very hoppy which was a disappointment to me. I am rather underwhelmed, especially since I enjoyed the cedar aged version so much."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Always drinking this beer from a fresh keg, I'm sure because Cigar City can't keep up with the demand for this beer. Citrussy, grapefruity, almost west coast style of IPA with a twist, tasting like a double IPA. This beer has to be one of the best IPA's on earth. It would be impossible to say that one is better, it can only be said that one might be as good, in a different way. This beer will destroy your palate and keep you coming back for more carnage."
"A: Orange amber body. Slight, off-white head. Not much retention or lacing. Not sure to chalk it up to the growler."
Boom!!! world class IPA
Thanks to RoyMunson for sharing this brew.
"Pours a nice reddish amber in color. Nice quarter inch of frothy head forms on the pour. Leaves very nice, spotty lacing on the entire inside of the glass."
"Wow. Am i surprised by all the positive feedback on this beer. I found it to be worse than unmemorable. The flavor was too strong for a standard ipa, very alcohol tasting and not enough sweetness or bitterness to balance it. Aroma was nothing special and the mouthfeel was average. Color is a typical amber. There's not much I can say about this beer."

Growler from Cigar City shared at a BA tasting thanks to mfielden.
"Man, oh, man. After all the times I have had this beer, I finally decided to sit down and review it. 32oz growler poured into my Cigar City pint glass."
Reviewed with my pops on 9/6/09 served out of a wine glass.
"Got this one in trade from Jw347. Thanks, Jonathan."
"Had this one a couple of times thanks to mfielden; thanks Mark. Dark amber color with a thick white head that retains well. Toasted grain and caramel aroma. Moderately hoppy nose, but leaning toward the malty side; the hops have a resiny, citrusy character with a touch of tropical fruit. The taste is decidedly East Coast, very balanced between caramel malts and citrusy hops, with malts taking precedence slightly. Mango and grapefruit hop flavors appear mid-palate, but never truly shine due to the heavy malt backbone. Bittersweet in the finish. Solid stuff, but not my favorite take on the style."
"On tap at New World Brewery,Ybor City, Tampa, 6/20/09, in a Cigar City Pint Glass."
"Growler obtained at CCB on 6/19, consumed same day. Poured into a tulip."
What is it with these guys from Tampa! My second 32ounce growler of the night and again I am floored. Served cold and poured into a pint glass.
"Another beer I had on tap a few times in Tampa, even had notes, but am having to finish this growler off before its no good. Previous tastes made me feel very strongly about this IPA. Pours a burnt orange color with a solid 1 1/2 finger head. Nice sticky lacing left on the glass after a few sips. A real pleasant floral hop aroma, some nice pine and a little less bitter grapefruit citrus hints too. A solid bitterness in the taste, much more pine based than the hop aroma would lead one to believe. Well balanced though. I am normally more of a fan of the stronger citrus hop taste, but this pine works very well. Fair carbonization helps lighten up this rather strong & dense IPA. A very smooth drinker, easily a sessionable IPA for me. Obviously freshness of hops is key to IPAs, and this growler was poured at the brewery a few days ago, but wow, I wish we had this locally, I'd buy it all the time."
"Poured a cloudy golden orange with a two-finger head that dies quickly but leaves some lace. A heavier than usual smell of citric and floral hops; hints of grape and heavier fruits. Medium-bodied and smooth, but great hop presence w/ both the citric fruit flavors as well as a great dry backbite. Decent malts tucked in as well, but what surprised me was the higher-than-usual ABV. They really hide it here and it creeps in a little on the end, but I give Kudos. Glad I saw it on bottle or else I'd think this was a session IPA and get a little crushed."
"Many thanks to Gillard for sending me some stuff from this brewery, which I have been looking forward to trying for quite some time. This came in a large swing top bottle. Color is a dark orange, close to copper, with a sizable white head. Hints of pine and grapefruit in the smell; which never become too heavy. Resiny hops that taste like a combination grapefruit and tree sap are balanced out by a larger than expected malt presence. Despite the somewhat high alcohol level, this has been a session beer for me; at least for tonight. Jai Alai is a really respectable IPA from Cigar City. It reminds me somewhat of Victory's HopDevil IPA, which is also a really great, balanced version of the style. I look forward to seeing what else this brewery has under their belt in the future. Cheers"
"Had this on tap at Oldsmar Tap House. Pours hazy orange with a nice creamy head, definite carbonation (bordering on more than I would like). Upfront hops, slight citrus and a nice pine scent. Decent hop bite with a good malt backing, very balanced. Drinkability is high. Perfect for a summer afternoon, and I will definitely be on the look out for more of it. Looking forward to an increase in distribution as the popularity of Cigar City increases in the Bay Area."
"This wonderful brew was consumed at the Lost Kangaroo Pub in Bradenton, Florida."
"Thanks to the waiter at Mr Dunderbak's in Tampa for recommending this wonderful beer. In a pint glass the beer was a slightly hazy cherry amber color. It had a medium-sized white head and some specks of lacing. Very nice floral and citrus aroma. Hops came through well in the taste, mostly grapefruit, but also a bit of pine. Very well-balanced with malt. This is a well-brewed beer. Wish I could get it here in Maine."
A big thanks goes out to Screach for bringing this gem to the May Austin BA tasting event! 
Thanks to markwise for the 32oz growler. My first taste from the CCB and I must say I'm hooked! Dark hazy amber pour with a thick off white head and spotty lace. Color is a little too dark for an IPA. Caramel and citrus on the nose. Nice resinous body & great balance. Earthy resinous hops with a twist caramel malts. Long bitter finish.
"On tap at Vine and Barley in Port St. Lucie. Pours a nice orange tan color with a bit of head, leaves a ton of lac eon the glass. Smell is of citrus and outdoor freshness. Taste is where this is at, leaves pine, orange, tangerine the flavor is all there with a nice overall bitter aftertaste. This is an amazing IPA and it grealy exceeded what I was thinking it was going to taste like. Finally we get an amazing Florida IPA."
poured in to a tulip glass at the Lost Kangaroo in Bradenton. 
"On-tap at Underground Bluz in Orlando. Pours a clear dark amber color with an off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing and retention. The aroma is loaded with lots of pine and citric hops and some malt as well. The taste picks up right where the aroma left off with a big dose of hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a fantastic IPA that is highly recommended! Well done Cigar City!"
32oz mini-growler courtesy of tpd975 poured into a tulip.
"Had this on tap at OLDSMAR TAP HOUSE, undoubtedly tampa bay's best pub....overall awesome IPA! Strong hop flavor...close to the Sierra Nevada Torpedo...I was shocked it came from Tampa! Excellent with cheese and crackers...gonna have to check out Cigar City Brewery and see what else they have! Wanting it to come out in bottles locally!"
Cheers to tpd975 for this brew in a trade! Pours with a think head. Settles to a nice lacing. Dark amber in color. Smells mostly of pine hops. Taste is a mix of pine and some malts for balance. Mouthfeel is smooth. A very drinkable IPA. Worth seking out if you are a hophead.
16 oz Pint poured at Redlight Redlight here in Orlando.
On draft at my house (Hell Yeah!)
"awesome stuff, there is a reason everyone in minnesota is talking about this beer as one of the best wet hops in the game, i have to agree, maybe my favorite beer from these guys so far. its clear and rich brassy golden and frothy white headed from the tap, with a stunning aroma, even shocking, of mosaic, cleaner and fresher than i have really ever known it to be. they must use a ton of hops here, its oily and west coasty and kind of rich to me, loaded with lupulin and myrcene and all the other goodies in here, concentrated and intense for a wet hop, with just a pale malt base it seems, thats all that needs to be there. i get none of the now tired mosaic fruitiness, its elevated way beyond that pineapple citrus thing, and none of the cat pee character i sometimes get when its over dry hopped, its perfect here, a wonderful version of itself, an example to others i hope, so darn good. some bitterness to which is nice, but this drinks like a california pale ale to me, and i mean that as a high compliment. worthy of the hype, this is next level hoppy beer. others from outside the state have no idea what they are missing here, this should be in the national conversation. it really took my by surprise. ill look forward to this each fall when i am up north! as good as mosaic gets."
Appearance - pours clear golden color with big fluffy white head that settles to a fairly thick cap. lots of spotty lacing.
"Pours light Amber. Tall foamy, Whitehead the Fades fast with light lacing."
"Pours on the yellow side of a clear amber with a white head. Good retention and lacing. Floral and slightly spicy hop presence on the nose with a touch of citrus. The taste is grapefruit and grassy notes in abundance, with a sweet malt presence to back it up. Drinks more like an APA than an IPA. Smooth, lightly carbonated, and medium-bodied. Great beer as always from Castle Danger."
"I have no idea how people could rate this beer poorly. If this is you, you need your taste buds revoked."
"Mosaic IPA pours a copper color, with a big long lasting and lacing head. Big fresh hoppy aroma, that can fill the room. Taste is big, hints of earth, lots of tropical fruit, grapefruit and big hop flavors that finishes sweet. Good body and feel. Overall fantastic IPA, big flavors, complex, does finish sweet."
Golden orange color. Clear. White head. On tap.
"Poured from a pint can 2 weeks fresh. Aroma is of melon and floral notes. Taste is Intense and pure mosaic at its best. One finger spongy head dissipates soon but laces nicely. Amber and slightly opaque. This may beat Sosus for the best mosaic I've had. Flavor matches the nose but is more intense. Creamy mouth feel with appropriate carbonation bordering Niro feel. Now having a second the next day and this is legit. The flavor is insane--one that the nose hints toward, but the nose isn't huge."
"This beer pours a slightly murky orange with a large, uniform head. The aroma is bold and vibrant, with huge guava, passionfruit, honeydew, pineapple, mango, candied pineapple, and overripe apricot and peach. The flavor is still vibrant, but not overly assertive, with soft guava, papaya, candied pineapple, mango, and overripe peach. The mouthfeel is soft with creamy carbonation. Overall this is a pretty wow beer - the aroma is huge, but the flavor much more demure, all leading to a very drinkable, sensuous beer."
First purchase (10/17/17) of the 2017 offering (stamped canning date is 10/10/17).
"This isn't a great fresh hop ale, but it is good. An enjoyable fruity hop aroma with a juicy quality. Fruity and flowery with a background of the herbal/grassy quality, which never shows strongly. Cloudy amber and fully airy white cap."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter. Canned 10/10/16.
"Pours a slightly cloudy light honey color with a huge off white head that hangs around leaving great lacing. Aroma is fresh citrus. Flavor is more malt forward than I would have expected. Nice citrus hops and low bitterness. Feel is kind of watery, carbonation level is low. Overall only an okay thirst quencher. Wouldn't pay for this again."
"Giving this a solid 4.0 but it is a tale of 2 different years, I never did review it last year. 2015 was bomber and 2016 is a pounder can. Both were good 2015 was superb the difference is the hop the mosaic hop used each year and/or amount.2015 was so fruity fresh and danky in the bomber the can not so much it is smooth and hoppy but showcases way to much malt. 2015 was delicate and so tasty with the hop(mosaic). The difference to me is that i wanted another bottle after finishing 2015 and went out and bought more, the 2016 one 4PK will be it for me not interested in another."
"Blueberry, tropical and citrus taste that screams Mosaic hops, but is a little more subtle than I expected from a Wet Hop IPA. The mouthfeel is insanely creamy and smooth with a dry finish that is also surprisingly clean for a Mosaic driven beer. Very tasty and easy drinking, even if a titch too mild."
"Timing is everything. I recently read an article about the rise in ""wet hopped"" beers -- those made with fresh, as opposed to dried, hops -- when I spotted this beer at the liquor store. I was already a Castle Danger fan; and figured they'd get it right. I was pleased beyond expectation."
"Very hazy and a dark amber color. Lots of sudsy head that sticks around for a while. Smell is mild but hoppy. Hints of bitter citrus and green apple, with a slight detergenty scent too, and a bit of wet, slightly mildewed blanket. Taste is equally mild. Pine resin comes out a bit but overall, not a ton going on here. Only slightest bitter aftertaste, but I would almost prefer a stronger one if it meant a stronger flavor. It's a perfectly enjoyable beer and has some nice grassy undertones, but I must say I'm glad it was just an extra in a trade box, and not something I spent real money on."
Not sure if my bottle was old as there is no date but this was border line horrible. This having the similar rating as Pompeii from TG is a travisty. No hop flavor and this weird sweet smell. Hopefully it was just an old bottle
"Been hearing good things about this beer & finally could resist the siren song no longer today. Bought, fridged, popped. Split with my wife. "
from a bomber (sitting in my fridge for two weeks longer than it should have due to a cold that wouldn't stop) into a tulip
"Clear golden color with two fingers of head that slowly settled to a thin film. Heavy lacing is left down the glass. In the aroma I get a massive dose of floral notes. Never associated that with Mosaic hops before. Also pick up some melon, citrus, and mango notes. Taste is more familiar to what I am accustomed to in Mosaic hops. Dankness upfront with tropical fruit with citrus and pine. Not as oily as other fresh hop beers I have had this season. Moderate bitterness with a bit of sweetness from the malt but otherwise this beer is all about the featured hop. Good carbonation and light mouthfeel."
A-Deep gold...little head but nice lacing on glass.
"Dark straw colored, if it's not in the light almost bordering to ruby.One of the best smelling IPAs I've encountered. Bursts with fruity flavors when opened. Taste follows the smell. Straight up juicy fruit gum. Magnificent, lacking in carbonation but that could be because my growler was a week old. Easy top 5 IPA"
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a chalice.
"Very tasty fresh hop beer. Poured golden with excellent head and lacing, smells of sweet hoppy goodness. Taste is same and very smooth, very impressed."
Drinking this beer is like giving your taste buds a high five for everything they do for you. I regret not getting the 64 oz growler.
"Hazy dark gold with a one finger white head, with very nice retention and generous lacing. Very nice aroma with pineapple, mango, berries, citrus, melon and pine. Very nice."
One fabulous beer. This fresh hop beer blow Surly Wet out of the water. Great beer
"Wow, what a surprise, While I do enjoy Ode (Their regular IPA) , I was surprised in such a quality beer from Castle Danger. So far the best Fresh/Wet hop Ive had this season. From aroma to taste to finish, such a fantastic beer"
"Dank nose with floral and fruity awesomeness. Mouthfeel is great for a fresh hop - not overly carbonated, but not the acerbic roughness that comes with any fresh wet hop. Taste mirrors the nose, fruity, all mosaic all the time. I was delightfully impressed with this, and am bummed I only bought two. Awesome, awesome beer."
Very much disagree with the first reviewer of this beer...
L - pours a deep hazy orange color with a small amount of straw yellow. Poured into my surly teku glass and forms about a 2 inch head.
"Canned 03/28/18, ‘BLEED BLUE’."
"Really good single IPA. Hazy, good smell to it, but it's not a double IPA which people forget when they think it's got a lesser flavor and smell than their DIPAs. For an IPA, it's extremely good and smooth. Velvety."
16 oz. can dated 09/12/17
"Really hazy golden color with white head. Aroma has some caramel malt and slightly dank hops. Taste starts juicy, just slightly sweet, continues with ""green"" hop notes and finishes with some white grapes and light bitterness. Medium to full bodied, really smooth but also well carbonated. Overall it's another great juicy IPA from Monkish."
Got this from a buddy in trade - 
"Can dated ""10/14/16 DOYERS."""
Another Amazing IPA from monkish. Very cloudy and thick for an IPA but really great Hop aroma and taste. Super balanced. Darker in color then the over recent ipas. Another winner. Go Giants
"From a can poured in a tulip glass. Friend brought back from NC. This is a really well made, traditional American IPA. Pour is a beautiful copper gold color. Small head with lacing that lingers. Smell is nice, intense resiny peach and slight piney grass, with a hint of bready malt scent in the backend. Taste is well balanced bitter and malt. I taste the tangerine, pine, grass, light caramel, lemon zest and sweet malt flavors. Maybe a touch of biscuit. Definitely not a session IPA; substantial body and thickness to the beer. Body is well-balanced. This isn’t as juicy and tropical as more recent IPAs, definitely reminding me of really good IPAs from ~5 years ago. This isn’t my favorite hop combination, but it is purposeful and just so well-executed that I had to rate it highly."
Hopping dropping and rolling
Very good. Had pint can at airport bar in Charlotte. Opened with blast of juicy fruit and finished a little heavier on the pine. Smooth decent body for a can suggests good malt backbone. So does rich bready taste that fills out /helps but stays in background to hop attack.
Good solid IPA!
"Poured from a 16 oz can dated 7/12/18, into a Willi Becher pint glass."
Love the fruity finish on this beer. The hops are great
"Plastic glass at CLE airport. Wanted an iPA so not sure what I was getting. Nice surprise. Nice color no real head (bartender was careful not to have one). But nice lacing in the glass. Nice citrus hop aroma which matches the taste. The citrus does not overpower the nice malts which leaves to nice overall flavor. Was surprised with the apv, tastes like a good summer drinking beer but a bit high for a hot afternoon. No faults. If you like a citrus ipa you will like it!"
"This is a great IPA. Pours a very slightly hazy light copper color from a 16 oz can into a pint glass. Big foamy, bubbly head with excellent retention and thick foamy bands of lacing on the glass. A good looking brew!!! Aromatic and slightly citrusy aroma, overall very pleasant. Tastes very good. Nice and bitter but with a smoothness that comes from a good malt/hops balance. Aromatic and mild citrus hops are featured here. Mouthfeel is the best part. Even though it is bitter, there is a pillowy softness about the beer that reminds me of Blind Pig. It goes down real easy and would be an ideal session beer if not for the high octane. Alcohol is not noticeable at all here. Surprised and impressed, I could drink this stuff all day."
"WOW! If the alcohol content wasn’t so high it would be a terrific session beer. Perhaps it is just the results of a nearly empty stomach at CLT airport. Recommended by Jeff Northrup this beer stands up to the hype. Super clear with a oatmeal head that laces nicely down the glass. Slight fruit, balanced acidity and bitterness along with lower carbonation make this truly a winner. Top 5. Thanks Jeff."
"12/28/17...on tap in downtown Charlotte. Light bronze, heavy foam, active bubbles. Resin oils and pine nose. Hearty bitter open, and quite juicy. Firm and pronounced flavors. Rolls through and the bitter lingers. Real tasty."
BO 8-21-17
"For me, this is the IPA all others are measured against and the one that opened my eyes to the style."
Bottled on 9/11/17 (one month old)
"Poured from a 16 OZ can into a pint glass. The appearance is a murky,, bright copper color with a medium sized off-white colored head. The aroma is full of hops and has a nice dose of orange and pineapple mixed in. The taste follows the nose with a nice pine hop finish."
"Absolutely awesome! NoDa Brewers you nailed this IPA. I drank this IPA a number of years ago, before I ever heard about rating a beer. Nothing's changed. It's awesome all around."
"Tall can of Noda Hop Drop 'n Roll, about 55 F, poured into a glass in September, 2017. The temperature of the beer was perfect for the hoppy character. Beery aroma and a nice head, leaving lacing on the glass as the beer was drunk."
Wonderful explosion of hoppy deliciousness. Perfect level of carbonation. This is the equal to the revered Vermont IPAs.
16 oz can dated 6/26/17
Appearance - Pours nice deep golden color with a thick dense white head.
"Tall can, 6/15/17 on the bottom....gotta love fresh high quality IPA in a can!"
"This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking copper color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving light streams of lacing. The smell had a glossy sweet citrus to light bitter citrus imparting a light spice to balance. The taste was sweet to bitter and added the light spice to enliven and help to accentuate a nice bitterness rolling into the aftertaste and adding a decent dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation rolls over my tongue nicely with a good IPA harshness. The bitterness level is at a medium level. Overall, I say this was a nice AIPA that I would have again."
"Pours gold. Foamy, medium, off white head that lasts a while with good lacing."
"Not sure how to phrase with all the wine review like adjectives but real good hops, strong but pleasant and still juicy and malty. Drink it often on frequent nc visits."
Gold with vibrant carbonation and a half inch of dishwater white. Moderate lacing. The aroma is of citrus & piney hops with some light malt. The taste is a scortchingly intense citrus hops burn with some piney hops in the fade. The mouth is moderately sticky and chewy.
Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip
"As a Charlotte native, I'm obligated to love anything by NoDA brewing. This one I enjoy not begrudgingly, but enthusiastically. Perfect blend of hoppy and sweet. Nice color."
Sparkling clear amber with a large fluffy white head and garter lace.
"L: Honey colored, slight head, lots of bubbles"
L: Light golden color with a big white head that really lasts.
Hop explosion. So delicious. Golden and creamy with great lacing.
Strong and consistent
"Pour was a yellowish Amber color with a one finger head. Smell is grapefruit rind, orange ring with a little pine. The taste follows the smell. Pretty much a medium feel on the mouth. Overall a good IPA that I personally think was a great IPA a couple of years ago."
"This beer varies in appearance for me. I'm only back in NC once or twice every twelve months. Most recent at Charlotte airport, it appeared a golden copper color. As always, the hops are strong at the front. Though I can smell the citrus, I can't taste it much over the hops. Not as much malt, but as a fan of floral IPAs, I'm okay with that. The beer lacks the citrus punch I really enjoy in my IPA, but this one keeps me coming back. I always seek it out everytime I'm in NC. It's a must try if you're passing through. For those of you passing through the Charlotte airport, it's always on tap at 1897 Market just outside of the B terminal."
A: The beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high fluffy white head that died down but consistently left a head covering the surface. 
"On Tap. Pours a hazy golden orange color. Smells of strong hops and citrus: grapefruit, orange, peach, mango and others. Thin lacing leaves the sides of the glass as it goes down. Enjoyed at a pub nearby the brewery so I know it had to be fresh. Tastes very hoppy up front with a crisp grapefruit backing with orange undertones. Strong ABV that doesn't hit hard at all. Can enjoy a few without hurting afterword. Good, smooth, mouthfeel with a nice finish. Overall a great example of the style and a good beer."
Poured on tap into a plastic airport cup. Hazy golden orange with thin Lacing & head. Sharp hop taste right off the bat with a ton of citrus. Not enuf malt to make it perfectly balanced and a slightly astringent chemical flavor somewhere in the mix. Long bitter finish.
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 7/18/2016. Pours slightly hazy orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel/nuttiness, toasted biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel/nuttiness, toasted biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, lemon/orange rind, toasted biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and fairly creamy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Minimal warming alcohol for 7.2%. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink, despite the aggressive bitterness. A very enjoyable offering."
A great IPA. Lacking only in hops and complexity.
"Canned on 7/18/2016. Poured into IPA glass. It pours a hazy, honey-amber color with two fingers of foamy, milk-white head and thick lacing with excellent retention. The smell is quite malty and grassy with whiffs of orange, melon, grapefruit, and subtle but fragrant herbs. It also features pine needles and resinous hops. The initial taste is sweet malt but then there is a jolt of dank, bitter pine and hops. There's also a touch of sweet fruit at the finish. It's a great balance of malt and bitter hops. This ale is medium-bodied with a touch of creaminess, moderately carbonated, and the 7.2% ABV gives it a nice punch without being overly boozy. Overall, this is a well-crafted IPA that deftly balances West Coast hoppy, and Southern malty, styles. It's a winner!"
"Riding high with the acclaim of 2014 Gold Winning status, this hop bomb of a beer employs some of the sexiest hops on the planet and with a dry, bready backbone acting cleverly in support."
Draft. Smells only slightly of hops. Poured a cloudy yellow orange with a thin layer of white head. Didn't linger long. Slight hoppiness upfront. Little bitter on the back end. Tastes like dry hops. Not insanely impressed. Good. Not great.
"2016, can, dark orange hazy color with an off white head. There is a little bit of a soapy lacing. The odor for me is pine, grapefruit, honey, orange, rock candy, pineapple, herbal, onion, malty. The taste for me pine, tropical fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, honey, orange, bread, malty. Some bitterness throughout."
One of the best I've tasted
Pint-sized can:
"Nice nose, citrus and pine and very effervescent with a nice creamy head. An assertive bitterness suppresses the fruit slightly. Still, a very pleasant IPA."
This beer is on my 25 to try before I die list my wife found in the Internet last year and at first pour it did not disappoint! The color is a deep amber with a thick off white head. Immediately the hops aroma fill the air surrounding my glass and I again understand how this beer made the list. The hop characteristics continue through the whole glass. Great beer for hop heads like me!
"Pours a hazy golden copper color with 1-2 fingers of creamy white head with decent retention and lace. The nose is sweet caramel malt with a blast of sweet citrus and some orange zest. The taste has a really nice hop profile with some sweet citrus fruit, some orange and grapefruit zest and nice pine note all balanced on a nice caramel malt backbone. Medium high body with nice carbonation that is highly drinkable. Mathis is a tasty IPA with a huge hop presence without being a palate wrecker."
Had a pint at CLT for 9.25. Beer was served orange with a nice white head that is leaving lacing. 
"Pours a clear copper color. The head is a finger high and eggshell in shade. Retention is quite good, even if the texture isn't perfectly creamy. Thick rings of lacing stick to the glass nicely, though."
On draft in CLT. Rich and malty but balanced with huge hop flavors. Pine and grapefruit pith plus some orange and onion. The bitter hop oils linger for a long time. Medium/full mouthfeel. Did I say malty? Reminds me of Stone Enjoy By. It lacks the finesse of the finest but a very good beer nonetheless.
Pours a dark gold almost orange. 2+ finger light cream colored head is quite frothy. Good retention and lots of lacing.
"Cold draft might be a bit below optimal temperature, but I'm getting a different nose and taste others have descibed. This is very hop - forward with more pine resin than citrus. Front to back tongue read is mild on the malt sugar, and the middle roast is overwhelmed by the hop bitterness off the back. The higher ABV only slightly covers what must be a very high IBU. This one is for dedicated hop-heads."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass.
This is a North Carolina rock star! So damn good! Always a favorite. This is in my top 5 for sure.
9 day old can but dealt with some high temps in travel to North Texas.
A slightly hazy orange-copper. The soapy off-white head has good retention. 
"Pours a clear, pale amber producing almost 3 fingers of frothy, moderately lasting, beige head that leaves a nice, webby coating of clumpy lace. Aroma is hoppy citrus (grapefruit, orange) & tropical fruit forward with a hint of pine swimming in a sweet caramel background. Taste is a fruity mix of grapefruit, orange, tangerine, pineapple,& some pine resin sitting on top of sweet bready dough & caramel. Sweet up front but transitioning to bittersweet around mid-sip with the bitterness intensifying in the drying finish where it becomes a very bitter, lasting citrus rind & pine aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-high carbonation, slick & wet in the mouth but drying after the swallow becoming astringent on the tongue."
"Served on draft at Picassos in North Charlotte. Damn good beer. Plenty of bitterness with the malt hanging out in the background, just the way I like my IPAs. Aroma is grapefruity and loaded with pine. Flavor is straight fine with huge grapefruit as well. I am not sure I have had a beer that has such a distinct mimicking of grapefruit. Bitter to the end with a dry, clean finish. If you are looking for balance, look elsewhere. Hop forward to the max. Alcohol stays well hidden, but damn that bitterness is still kicking my ass. Top notch IPA, and a local on draft to boot!"
"HDR pours to a giant, slightly pebbly ivory-colored head on a clear, very effervescent deep gold body; head retention is moderate and lacing is good, consisting of sticky slabs and caverns. The aroma is medium-big: grapefruit, pine and spicy/sweet florals backed by a nice grassy character. At the front of the palate, the flavor is a quite bitter grassy pine; mid-palate the bitterness moderates a bit, the grapefruit from the nose emerges and eclipses the pine, and a slight bittersweet nutty character makes itself known. The bready malt foundation is quite apparent. The finish is dry and fairly clean, showing just a bit of nuttiness, and is followed by the onset of a nice, pronounced clinging resinous grassy/pine bitterness that lingers for quite awhile. Retrogustative olfaction is modestly grassy. The mouthfeel is biggish for the light-medium body and is quite astringent; the texture is slightly creamy and slightly peppery from the restrained carbonation. (growler)"
Good balance between bitter and flavor hops. Light citrus notes and earthiness.
Can poured into chalice
L: Crystal clear amber-orange with a small white head with good lacing.
"Pours a nice honey/amber with a thick bright white head that dissipates slowly. Nose is fairly strong with some tropical notes-you can tell its very hoppy. The taste features a balance between tropical fruits and bitter citrus hops. To me the bitter hops slightly balance out the tropical notes. Its a very flavorful and bitter beer. It has a nice mouthfeel-not too carbonated or too thick. Overall, this is a very good IPA, but I prefer one a little more on the tropical side."
L - pours a filtered dark ambery orange. Fluffy white head. Course bubbles. 
"Clear gold with thin bubbly white head leaves lacing. Smell a little weak, but malty and piney. Same in taste. Lots of malt, a different hop profile than I am used to, something sweet in the mix. Not keen on extremely bitter finish."
Feels like an east coast IPA lots of heavy malt - also lots of great hops fruitiness...
"Poured from a 16oz can at Charlotte airport - dark golden hue with off white foam. Nice smell of tropical fruit, orange citrus and malt. Taste is a beautiful blend of mango, orange along with malt. Finished with bright citrus notes. Reminds me of Dirt Wolf - though I'm still partial to the Victory."
"Good IPA , great brewery"
similar to Ithaca Flower Power
Straw color - pronounced hops taste. Piney. No disappointments here. A fine IPA.
"This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking copper color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving light streams of lacing. The smell had a glossy sweet citrus to light bitter citrus imparting a light spice to balance. The taste was sweet to bitter and added the light spice to enliven and help to accentuate a nice bitterness rolling into the aftertaste and adding a decent dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation rolls over my tongue nicely with a good IPA harshness. The bitterness level is at a medium level. Overall, I say this was a nice AIPA that I would have again. Thanks Dwayne!"
"Canned 2 days ago. There is a big fruit aroma when you pop the can. The beer pours a dark orange to amber color. The taste is balanced with citrus, tropical fruits, pine, and a sweet bready malt. You can taste a small amount of alcohol which brings it down a little."
Nice and piney
I got a lot of bitterness and not in a good way. So much that it tasted like a home-brew with residual hops in the bottom. The malt didn't seem to match up well with the brew either. Not sure if it was just the can I got or how the beer actually tastes. Can't say I recommend this one.
Hop Drop N Roll
"Slightly bitter hops, finishes somewhat strong on back of tongue"
"Got this as a bonus in a trade. Very nice surprise. I had never heard of it but I was quite impressed. Drank right out of the 16oz can. Nose is piney... But not overwhelming. Tasted as such. Very nicely balanced floral hops... and more hops. Feel was medium bodied, almost syrup like. Whoa, not sure where that came from but sticking with it. Overall a very nice hop head must try. Glad I have one more."
"This beer smells great and the hops really shine through in the flavor as well. Not as well balanced as the big guys, but still a solid offering."
"This came highly recommended via a four pack imported from NC to OH by a friend's sister. I must say, they are on to something. And to package something so good in such large containers is nice bonus."
My favorite NoDa brew to date. Very nice hoppy character but still very smooth and easy drinking. Could easily mistake for a session. Great beer overall!
"Fresh can, less than a week old. "
"Oddly, had this interestingly-named beer on recommendation of my better half, poured from pint can into hotel water glass. Big but balanced, must-have IPA."
"Got this as an extra in a trade so I didn't expect much, but DAMN I was blown away. This is a fantastic IPA with such great balance and hop character."
"Way too piney for my taste, and I'm not a fan of IPAs with a strong malt backbone like this one. If you are a fan of Sculpin, Tropicalia, Jai Alai, etc - this will not be to your liking. Other than having a citrusy smell this drinks like an East Coast IPA. Really disappointed."
"maybe i had an off can, i hated this and poured it out.."
"Great beer. Hoppy, sticky, delicious. I wish I could get this locally. Id always have some on hand."
"Golden bronze in color with a bib fluffy head. Grapefruit bomb. Very juicy. A lot of floral hops. Hop resiny stickiness with some dankness. A bit piney. Has a fairly big malt backbone, but it isn't too noticeable or distracting because of the hops. Fairly bitter."
I thought it was ok. Definitely didn't live up to the hype for me...too much malt.
"Poured out of 16oz can at a BBQ joint in Charlotte. Pours an amber color with a big white fluff. Huge danky, piney smell as well as taste. Good amount of bitter as well. Medium-bodied with right amount of carbonation. I can see why this is rated as high as it is. Great brew! Hopheads rejoice."
"Disclaimer, I am real partial to HDR now living in the Charlotte area and wanting to support the local breweries. Big hophead too. I have had this 50+ times. It's what I always grab upon arrival at the National Whitewater Center on a hot Southern day. Big bold hoppy taste, real nice piney smell. Smooth in the mouth with a reasonable bitter bite. Very well made as are most NoDa beer. I will often do 2/3 HDR and 1/3 NoDa Coco Loco for an excellent dark IPA. All NoDa beers have remained consistent over the years."
A: slight haze; a shade lighter than bronze in color; 2 finger light khaki head that receded slowly to a thin cap; nice lacing;
"Gorgeous light copper body, crystal clear, with tons or carbonation and a nic off-white head of medium-sized bubbles that creates an abundance of sticky lacing."
A huge thanks to Carp19 for sending me a few of these.
"Beautiful brew, with a strong snow-white head with excellent retention and nice lacing. Transparent golden body, very lively and active."
"16oz can, date smudged, poured into a Lagunitas mason jar."
If I could swim in beer it would be time to drown myself in this epic IPA. Like all most all of NODA products.
Shazaaam! One of my favorites. I love living in Charlotte around these great breweries!
Hazy deep orange with a medium nice looking frothy head. 
"Seriously one of my favorite beers, and the fact it's made just down the road from me makes it even better! It's nothing extreme, but amazingly well balanced and as drinkable as an IPA can get! If you even claim to like IPA's, you'll like this beer."
"This was canned three days ago. Amazing IPA, not my preferred hop profile but the one that it has is HUGE."
"Poured from a 4-day old can; this is the maltiest IPA I have ever encountered, and that's not a criticism. It's a really nice beer, a wild and wonderful deviation from what seems to be the current standard for the style."
If you like extremely strong hops this is for you
"Canned 3/30/15. Extremely malty, not sure if this one falls off super quickly."
A damn good ipa that's a borderline dipa. This beer is great. All hopheads will for surely enjoy this one.
"A 16oz tall boy can picked up at the Brewery in late April, 2015. "
I'm a new englander and used to the hop bombs. This one is very nicely balanced. Great hop forward smell and taste with just the right amount of malt backbone. Thanks to Jwag1185 for hooking me up. Overall a great ipa that I would definitely like to drink again. Well done!
Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned April 21st 2015.
Can dated 3/31:
Hops for Days! That's all.
Pouts a bright copper with a thin white head that leaves volumes of small sticky lacing. Aroma is citrus and pine hops balanced against a little malt sweetness. The taste is much the same with a big hops blast up front. Nice weight and a smooth finish.
West coast style of IPA on the east coast. Definitely on the better side of IPAS I have had recently.
"Hop, Drop 'n Roll pours a copper color with a small but lacing head. There is a bold hoppy aroma. The taste has a smooth but hoppy flavor, with a hint of bitterness and dryness at the end. Very easy to drink, good body. Overall, its a full bodied yet easy drinking slightly bitter and dry IPA."
As fine of a beer as I've ever had. No wonder Hop Drop won the World Beer Cup Gold Award this stuff is indeed liquid gold. Huge hop and grapefruit flavor but it could not be smoother going down. Can drink this every day! Cheers and thanks to NoDa Brewery!
Not a fan of this beer. Very inconsistent.
"American IPA brewed with Citra, Amarillo, Centennial, Warrior, and Chinook hops. Poured from a 16oz can into a Goose Island tulip. The pour is slightly hazy, apricot in color, and sports a creamy eggshell white head that retains quite well. Lots of bitter, oily, sappy hop aromas on the nose. Pinetrees, flowers, grass, and grapefruit."
Incredible and unique. Crazy flavor profile. I almost get cashews or something at the end. Not everyone will love this but man alive I do...
Almost a wee hint of butterscotch in this one. Grab one if u see it!
"Acquried during a trade from @wmjones3, thanks! Great to have tried this. On my want list for some time now. Great nose. Citrus notes. Major hops up front. Drinks like a DIPA. Great balance with a nice kick. Alcohol present but not much, still juicy. Well done"
At craft beer tasting Event. Caramel
"Good looking: amber and cloudy with plenty of head and sticky lace. Caramel and tropical fruit aroma.A bit boozy for a single IPA. Very West Coast, pine, tropical fruit a big hop punch at the finish. Leans toward the sweet side. Heavy-ish body for the style"
Wow so much balance has to be a top 10 ipa
"All I can say is that I think this beer deserves serious consideration in the top 10-15 IPA's in the country. Talk about balance, I think this beer is on the precipice of genius"
"Unpleasant taste, bitter and lacked that fresh hop taste I had expected. Color was cloudy and dreary."
"Oh my. Where to start. Looks like septic system runoff. That aftertaste. Behck. So yeasty, chalky, worty, gross. Does not live upto its hype. Drinkable but wouldnt buy any."
Delicious. Not like any other IPA I have had.....
So delicious. Best IPA I've had in a while. So refreshing and citrusy.
"Pours opaque amber with a fingers width of off white head. Good lacing and legs that linger for a little while. Very aromatic, tons of tropical fruit and citrus, followed by slight resin notes and malt sweetness. The taste is of grapefruit, mango, and citrusy fruits. Light biscuity notes & malt sweetness that balance the bold forward hops. Very sweet and hoppy. Mouthfeel is very silky with medium carbonation. The hops linger on the tongue and coats the mouth well, the alcohol not overly present but is still there in the background."
Received via trade from @humuloner22 and poured into my SN IPA glass.
"Tasty IPA, if a bit malty, and with a sort of generic hop flavor. Just not a lot of pop to the hops, neither on the palate nor in the nose. I could see this being a bit of a workhorse IPA, something to count on, but it didn't wow me either."
Delicious beer with just the right amount of hops but also has a slight citrus/fruity taste.
Not a hop head and this was a damn fine brew. Very balanced with hops and malt. No discernable alcohol taste. Could crush these any time of the year!
Canned on Monday (1/19/15).
This is a really nice IPA...aroma is nice and stays strong throughout. Flavor starts out kinda fruity...grapefruit and mango are present....the malt provides a nice balance and sweetness during the sip. And then come the hops to finish and stick around til the next sip...they hang on the tongue for dear life! 
I got this one via trade with @CHSASVbeer. Poured from a pounder can into a standard pint glass.
"Bitter, hoppy and delicious ipa"
Silky smooth IPA. Alcohol hardly noticeable. Lots of flavors going on. Delicious! Much deserving of its accolades!
Poured into DFH IPA glass
I don't like hoppy beer so this wasn't a beer for me. It smells like a Christmas tree and taste like hops.
This is one of my favorite beers now! Has a great balance between hops & malts.
"Huge melon from start to finish in this one. I just wish there was a bit more complexity in it, but I guess that's what makes this one so unique. Super drinkable, mouthfeel is perfect. Just the right amount of chew, a bit resinous. Nothing overpowering. Great stuff."
"Some nice complex hop notes, but nothing exceptional, and very heavy, goopy, syrupy."
This beer use to be worthy of the gold medal it won but not so much anymore. It's like chewing on a flower and not the tasty kind. They ruined this beer.
Very good brew. Well balanced. Pine in the nose. Head about a finger that lingers for a while. Recommended
Not an IPA guy at all but enjoyed this one the mix of additions makes this a winner would drink this again
Pours a burnt orange with a 1 finger white head that lingers for a while. Light carbonation runs up the glass and the body is fairly clean and clear. The smell is pine up front. Fairly muted. A little bready malt in there with a touch of sweetness coming though as well. First sip is bitter pine with some orange mixed in there. The finish is tongue-punchingly bitter. Medium body and coats the tongue completely. Bitterness lingers for a while. 
"Appearance - Very nice, orange to amber color. Good inch head"
"Pretty good tasting IPA, no overpowering notes, very balanced."
"A nice IPA reminiscent of West Coast IPAs with an abundance of fresh hops and grapefruit overtones. A bit on the cloudy side. Bitterness in the mouthfeel, but not overly so and with a nice amount of smoothness on the tongue."
2014-12-15
A--No clue had it out of the can
"A: poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass, orange with a white foamy head, clear"
Pounder can into a tulip
Beautiful pour with thick creamy head and nice lacing. Huge vanilla and strawberry nose. Both present in the taste but fighting for space against grapefruit and sticky pine as well. Just a fantastic beer.
Never made it out of the can. I almost cut my nose because I kept cramming it into the can trying to smell more and more of this bad boy. Sweet and sticky smell. I would like an air freshener for my car that smells like this. Fruity and hoppy taste. This one comes after you. The bitterness is strong but it works really well. I wish this beer could get thrown into a regular rotation of the IPAs that I drink. Great beer.
"NODA did not invent IPA, they just perfected it."
"Bought a can at Hops Burger Bar in Greensboro, NC for $5.50. Poured into a shaker pint. Expectations are very high. "
Thanks to renagawam for this beer. Poured into an IPA glass from a 16 oz can. Date on can is 10/27/14.
"16oz can, bottled 10/07/2014, poured into a tulip"
"Poured from the can, Brewery fresh!"
"Blows Sculpin away, definitely belongs among the top IPAs and DIPAs."
16oz Can
poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass less than a month old.
"Looks just as pretty as can be sitting in the glass with a deep amber toned body. The head stands at about two fingers and was easily achieved with a strong pour. Off white rocky foam bubbles fade in a few minutes. Waves of scattered lace is left behind. Nose is absolutely lushes with vibrant tones of creamy pine and citrus marmalade along with orange lollipop to boot. As I sip on this one I get layer after layer of intense and distinct hop flavors. At first you get a sweetness up front, then that yields to piney prickly dryness on the back side. This carries a very attractive bitter feel to the mouthfeel that stays with this brew as you drink. This beer is exceptionally dynamic in character. This brew is well worth the accolades it has received."
"The nose of this is great, VERY pungent grapefruit. This is a good beer, no mistaking that, but the issue I have is the drinkability, it's just not very high for me with this beer. The word I'm looking for is sharp, it's too sharp on the palatte for me. "
"Deep orange color with small white head that fades fast but leaves great lacing. Big tropical and citrus fruit and resinous hop aroma. Touch of caramel sweetness from the malt up front fades to citrus notes of mostly grapefruit, touch of mango and a bitter resinous finish. Creamy feel with lower carbonation and a medium body. Strong IPA with big citrus flavor. Glad I had the chance to try this."
Updated with 8 day old can.
From 10/28/14 notes. 16 oz. can poured into a tulip.
Obtained in trade from BA Mike from Colorado. Can dated 9/9/14 poured into a Harpoon snifter.
"Okay, I stirred up a mess in the message boards. I drank one batch too cold. I purchased another batch drank it warmer. That is what needs to be done for me anyway. This IS a good beer but I still don't think its the best beer I have ever had. I love the fact its from NC and its readily available now anyway. I still maintain that the first batch I tried was a bit off. The newer batch dated from October is a lot better. "
Bright and citrusy hops up front with a big malt backbone
"16oz. can, poured a bit into a glass for appearance by drank the rest from the can, Heady Topper style."
"Bitter, resin, pine, orange peel"
Canned three days before popping the top.
"We got a pretty good one here, my peeps."
"16oz can. Dated 9/9/2014, poured into a teku glass 10/10/2014."
16oz can into a pint glass.
Thanks to dogdoc for sending this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from 16 oz. can into an Upland pint glass.
"16 oz can into glass. Canned 2/14, drank 2/16. 4-pack purchased for $11.99."
"Got this as an extra, sure glad I did!"
"This is a fantastic, yet very intense interpretation of a West Coast IPA. Hop Drop is very comparable to Stone's Enjoy By IPA, so you know it is good. The nose will give any IPA fan a massive erection as soon as that can is popped, blood should rush to the main vain rather quickly."
Brewed in my home town! Damn fine IPA. Makes me proud!
"I first visited NoDa about a year ago and tried a Hop Drop. I was blown away. For me, it is just about the perfect American IPA. Great on the nose and has a terrific look to it also. It has strong citrus fruit notes, is sweet and clean but with the right amount of hop bitterness to cut through resulting in a clean dry finish."
Big thanks to Bilco for a surprise can of this gem
"Appearance: pours a deep burnt orange, almost a red. a finger of a white head with an extremely strong retention and leaves a pretty strong lacing behind. hazy and nearly opaque but a little bit of brightness to it. 4.25/5"
"Really nice IPA. Orange gold hue, rich creamy mouthfeel, honey and sweet malt background. Living in California, this one reminds me of some of the sweet-style NorCal IPAs we have around here, like Drake's Denogginizer and the great Knee Deep beers. This one fits right in with them. Delicious. Highly recommended."
"Thanks, Bill."
Solid beer overall. Found it to be a tad on the sweet side.
Hoppy yet very smooth
"Fresh can shared by RussianDragon. Thanks Dave! The beer is nearly clear with a copper / orange body and an inch or more of white head. Huge aroma of fresh hops, pine, grass. Gigantic waves of resinous hops blast the palate. Pine and grass. Hurts so good. An unexpected surprise. Terrific beer."
"This beer is phenomenal. Amazing, thick aroma with grapefruit, orange, grass, and a biscuity dankness. Taste is ridiculous. Just a juicy, dank, hoppy, resinous IPA with great balance and flavor. The hops are in your face, but the right amount of maltiness softens the blow. Feels a bit sticky, which I love in an IPA. One it warms a bit it really opens up and almost drinks like a DIPA. Props to NoDa for this beer. Its easily one of the best IPAs I've ever had."
"A-Clear amber, not much carbonation, one finger head that tries to leave some lacing."
1808th review on BA
"Pours out a nice bright orange color. Pretty true to the style. Big white head. Smells good. Pine, some juicy notes and hops. Taste follows through. Nice clean mouthfeel. Probably the best IPA NC has to offer."
Had this fresh in North Carolina. Really solid IPA.
Poured from the 16 ounce can into a snifter.
Had this on 2014-08-17 at the brewery; and again at the brewery on 2015-07-26. 
"fresh, canned less than two weeks ago"
"As good as any American IPA on the market today. Balanced on the pallet, great nose, good color, nice head, and crisp finish."
"Deep amber color, 1 finger of fluffy off white head, solid lacing"
16 oz can poured into a Guinesses pint glass.
"Currently my favorite IPA by a long shot, and unfortunately as difficult to find, due to its popularity. Repeated trips to the brewery as well as local haunts come up short. News of a shop getting in a supply means lines and rapidly sold out inventories. I love this beer, but I hope the hype around it settles down somewhat soon . . ."
poured from month old can to pint glass.
"Saw some guys drinking a tall boy I didn't recognize from across the sushi bar at the Charlotte airport. Asked what it was and the bartender sang its high praises. I'd never heard of the brewery. Gave it a try and wow, what a beer. Amazing hop flavor straight out of the can. Easily a all-time top 10 IPA for me."
Excellent beer!
"Canned a few days ago, generously shared by my first trade partner, portable. Ripped one open warm the day Doug gave them to me for maximum freshness, now for a closer look. Enjoyed from a beer hunter taster glass"
"Looks a light Amber, clear and semi approachable but, meh."
"A: Copper filtered with lots of fine whirl winds of bubbles rising in the glass, 2 fingers of yellowish head."
"As the gold medal shows, this beer is fantastic. Great citrus notes don't overly dry out the beer. It's sure to please any hop-head. I just hope all of the Brewhaha over the gold medal doesn't create any quality/quantity issues. Congrats to all of you guys down at NoDa"
Enjoyed a can of the Hop Drop n Roll in Charlotte at the US National Whitewater Center. The IPA was great after a long day of rafting and being outdoors. This excellent American IPA is easily enjoyed straight from the can and is not too heavy for a hot summer day in the South. Wish I could have visited the brewery while in Charlotte. Hopefully NoDa Brewery will increase distribution to the Hampton Roads area.
"Got luck and found some in Greensboro, NC. It lived up to the hype I had heard and am now looking to try the rest of their beers. Hope their ramp up in product happen quickly for better distribution and the quality I tasted with Hop, Drop & Roll continues!"
"A hazy, glowing light copper color with an orange hue. An aggressive pour produces a good head stand of rock to creamy off-white bubbles. The foam has a lasting head retention and leaves a light lacing on the glass."
canned less than 3 weeks ago. 
"A - Golden copper, slight hazing, with a significant head that reduces to a film over the top and lacing."
I was really surprised with this one. The hops are so present and well balanced. I got more of the piney hop flavor than citrus or grapefruit which is my preferred style. This one shouldn't be missed and is a must if you are in the Charlotte area. I need to load up on these next time I'm up there.
"This smells, and tastes like Juicy fruit bubble-gum w/ nice piney notes and smooth bitterness. A real unique treat."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. This IPA appears a deep golden/orange. The slightly off white, one inch head, with fine froth, appears puffy and soft. The lacing is sticky and the head is persistent. Nice design and artwork on can."
"Local, so I'll try to be unbiased,"
"A bit sweet with some citrus hints. Entirely delicious. I could drink this refreshing IPA all day long. NoDa has the best beers in Charlotte by far, so if you are in Charlotte, be sure to swing by NoDa brew! Hop drop also comes in pint cans, so you can bring some home to enjoy, which I did, of course!"
This was the second time I've had this beer. My buddy brought it up from NC. It poured a slightly hazy orangish with white head that left a lace all the way down the glass. The scent carried some pine and bitter hop. The taste leaned bitter but was drinkable. There was a grapefruit bitterness to it. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it's a solid offering.
Poured into a DFH tulip from a pint can that was canned 5-5-14
"Reviewing Hop, Drop 'N Roll from NoDa Brewing Company out of Charlotte, North Carolina."
Pours a fairly clear deep copper with a frothy cream head that slowly dissipates leaving moderate lacing.
Received as gift from Mark Rodda. In a can. Bottled on 4/28/14. Poured into a nonic pint glass.
"Thanks to LGB362 for a couple of these cans: one went down during our last poker session, this one is for the review. 16 oz. lime green can. "
Poured froma 16 oz can into a tulip glass
"Modest off-white head, somewhere around a finger’s worth, dissolves away fairly swiftly, the lacing too is spotty with slightly under average stickiness. The liquid is gauzy if not close to cloudy, arguably as close to a reddish amber as true orange hue, there’s a few lazy bubbles visible, tend to be on the fat side. Robust nose filled with pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus, ripe apricot, peach, pineapple fruit, honey, chocolate powder, the pine sap is sticky and glues the freshly mown grass to your nostrils, hot tar, black pepper, metal shavings, its pungency is not all sweetness. Full-bodied and a touch heavy, the carbonation makes a decent stab at getting things swirling but it has its work cut out for it. Very piney and herbaceous, that tarry earthiness adds to its bite. The grapefruit and orange citrus here tends more towards bitterness. Still, no lack of cocoa malts, honey and caramel flavors. Tropical nature to the fruit, pineapple, guava, papaya in addition to the peach, apricot base. Serious amount of dry residue left during the finish, tends to dampen the exuberance of the sweeter elements. Overall, it smells and tastes wonderful, perhaps would benefit from adding greater cleansing freshness to the mouth feel."
Poured from a one day old 16oz can into a pint glass.
Color: tawny gold
"Canned 1/7, enjoyed 1/23. Updated bits and pieces from a canned on 5/25, enjoyed 6/12."
A: It pours a ruby orange with an off white head and visible carbonation.
Friends down in North CANolina sent me this CAN to further The CANQuest (TM) and I am deeply thankful!
Thanks to jmgrub for sharing this one at Retsinis' tasting.
16 FL. OZ. can
16oz can from bcrossan (thank you). Canned 4/1/14. Served in a goblet. 
"Poured from a can into my Duvel tulip glass. The nose on this beer is amazing. Grassy, pungent hops all over the place. Deep orange appearance. Hazy. Taste is phenomenal. Citrusy hops throughout. One of the grassiest IPAs I have ever had. Very unique. A lot of bitterness but very balanced. One of the drier finishes around. Would be very difficult to make a night with several of these but a fantastic IPA. One if my ""go to's"". Well done."
"First off, as I have been on here for several months, I have noticed that some of the rankings are an absolute joke. For example, to preface, I'm not a Stone hater. Their latest Enjoy By IPA is probably the best beer I have ever had, but when it comes to the Stone IPA, the Go To, and some other offerings, I don't get it. Some of the Stone beers are rated WAY too high. To segue, this beer specifically is absolutely a top 50 beer, and an incredible IPA. It blows Stone's base model IPA completely out of the water, yet look at the rankings. It just doesn't make sense. Also, does Beer Advocate not even recognize the World Beer Cup? I ask because this beer won the Gold Medal there earlier this year... This is a top 50 beer. Anyway, enough of my rant."
"A- Translucent light golden honey, medium lacing with terrific legs!"
ugly malty beer that tastes like cardboard from a 2 week old locally bought can.
"A- Hazy, murky deep gold. Almost copper really. White head of 1 finger. Decent lacing."
"For a single ipa I don't know how you get more juicy hop aroma and flavor. And it is extremely drinkable! The malt presence might through people for a loop, but I really like it with the hop collection, gives the juicy a nice pathway on the palate."
Thanks Kegatron for sharing this pounder can with me. Pours a pale copper color with slight haze. Decent off-white cap with typical retaining powers.
"16oz can poured into an Idle Hands tulip. No date on the can but I am told that this can is less than 2 weeks old, so should be very fresh."
16 oz. can poured into a snifter.
"Got a can of this from my beer guy following one of his other number one customer's trip ti the east coast. Can't get this in Michigan so I was quite excited to try it. This ipa pours a very handsome, hazy orange hue with a two finger white head that gives way to a nice film and silky lacing. The nose is very fruity; lots of tropical notes of mango, papaya, grapefruit, and even apricots. There is also a pine and resin dankness present in the aroma. There is a little malt but it is subtle at best. The mouthfeel is smooth and a little sticky. Very nice coating hop resin and easily sippable. The flavor is more citrus and pine than the nose. The tropical notes are lost but taken over by bitter grapefruit pith and pine resin bitterness. This is actually a good thing in my opinion as I was concerned about an overly fruity taste based upon the nose. The finish still reveals some of these tropical flavors and ends with a dry bitter bite on the tongue. Overall, this is a very good and unexpected ipa. I look forward to sampling more NoDa offerings the next time I'm in their distribution area."
"Received this can from some stranger randomly at hunahpu's day. Thanks, you!"
No canning date that I can find.
"Thanks to my buddy Garret for this one. Somehow this beer has evaded me....until now. Hop Drop pours a really nice translucent orange. This thing is sticky and there is just the faintest amount of floaties in the glass (not quite on Heady's level). Nose is tropical fruit, sweet caramel malt, pine, and some orange/citrus. This is a big IPA! Tastes more like something I would consider to be a DIPA, personally. Massive amounts of juicy, fruity hops, as well as a nice malt backbone, and a great mouthfeel and finish (again, quite sticky). wrap things up nicely. Overall, this is damn good IPA. Yet another winner from NC."
A- Hazy orange in appearance with about an inch of cream colored head with generous lacing. There are a ton of pieces of hops floating around in this beer that really hurt its overall appearance.
Thanks to pgh_penguins for the can.
"What the hell happened to what was once the greatest IPA in all the land? Whatever it was, it isn't good. Something has changed and NODA needs to undo it. What a disappointment."
"Had a large can of this at the Charlotte airport (layover--Charlotte can't handle a little snow). Basically, this is a solid IPA--nice hop profile (more pine than citrus, moderately bitter) with also some malt to balance things. It's smooth, very drinkable, and quite sessionable. I'm surprised this isn't well known nationally. It's solid, but it doesn't necessarily have flavors that aren't seen elsewhere."
"Fantastic brew from NODA in Charlotte NC. Citrus, piney, floral, great hoppy character. Straightforward style with tamed malts and boosted hops, floral head and softer mouth feel. Starting to find in cans and tap all across the state of NC. And at 7.2% this makes for a solid can on the river! Definitely recommend hop drop & roll and most of what NOdA puts out."
"Yay tall boy cans, thanks to Beerness for this one."
Thanks to JLindros for sharing.
Tall boy can into pint at the Charlotte airport. Nice golden slight brown copper color. Not much head but sticky lacing. Huge hop aromas. ..pine and citrus bomb. Taste is nearly flawless. ..smooth wonderful base malt hint of nuttiness with a massive hop burst. So smooth its scary. This is one he'll of an IPA! One of the best I've ever had.
"Let's just say that when my fridge doesn't have any Hop Drop and Roll in it I get very uncomfortable, from the time that you crack a can until the last sip this beer is fantastic and just spot on. I absolutely love this beverage, well done NoDa Brewing Company."
I had it for the first time was at the Charlotte airport on draft. Since then I have had HD&R in can it was just as good. I just love this beer it is exactly what an IPA should be. I just wish I could get it here in Dayton Ohio. When I am traveling I always ask. I highly recommend this beer.
I live in Ohio and we have some great beers here and nearby Michigan.
16oz can poured into a tulip glass.
Tulip glass.
Had on-tap at Appalachian Vintner Asheville. Served in a Sierra Nevada pint.
Canned 08/18/2014. Thanks to @bsyoung!
A: Dark orange color. Hazy with really noticeable sediment
Thanks to n2185 for the can. Tasted 10 January 2014.
"I don't usually go all-fives on a beer, but this one nails it at every level. It deserves it's status in the top 50 IPA's in America and I'm glad I can get this beer anytime I want it here in Charlotte. This should be a whale to those in other parts of the country where this beer isn't distributed."
"Pours a medium amber with a more than ample head and lacing. Big nose of citrus hops, mostly grapefruit, against a slight sweet malt background with a touch of pine hops. Medium bodied with a nice slick mouthfeel. Normal carbonation level. The taste is an exceptional balance of citrus hop flavor over malt sweetness. Bitterness is mild, which accentuates the remarkable flavor of this ale. Smooth finish of grapefruit and malt sweetness with slight tartness and bitterness that lingers. To call this one outstanding, is an understatement. By far the best IPA I have ever had. In a side by side with Founder's Harvest Ale, NoDa wins by 0.11. It is more flavor intensive and has a slightly thinner body. Both are predominately grapefruit oriented flavor profiles, but Hop Drop is a tad drier and that helps the hop flavor overcome the slight malt sweetness in Founders. Both are exceptional and display the brewer's art at it's best."
"A - pours an incredibly hazy golden amber color, nearly zero light gets through this thing. Half a finger of tan head, OK retention, very very thin outer ring remains 5 minutes later. Looks very similar to a heady, and that's a good thing to me!"
"Orange gold color, hazy, with 1-finger of cream colored head. Laces in light bunches. "
shared on christmas day. poured from can into two half pint standards. taste and smell are amazing. pours a cloudy haze with some residuals visible in the beer. excellent carbonation. piney taste that lasts into the back end. would definitely buy again and highly recommend to any hop head. super awesome!
"Woody amber color with some stagnant suspended specs floating about. Aroma at first is very soft. Then expands to a juicy-fragrant-floral-citrus-lightly piney extravaganza. Sweet peaches, apple, smooth orange, tea, passionfruit, white bread and caramel malt. This beer does taste pretty fantastic. Very pleasant fruit and flowers. Simple yet deep flavors. Body is medium-full with a nice slick slightly syrupy texture. Excellent stuff."
poured 16oz can into snifter.
"A - Polluted, murky dark orange with a little red. Huge head, long retention, lots of hearty cling."
"16oz, no date"
"Strong on the citrus. My buddy said ""Wow, that's a grapefruit sandwich!"" Feels like a DIPA. Great floral aroma. Lots of hops, but well-balanced. Nice cloudy amber color. Good lacy head. Aftertaste is good and hoppy and lingers a good long while. Everything I'm looking for. Very enjoyable. One of the very best IPA's I've had. Would drink this any day."
Thanks to CincyTrigger for sending this my way. 16oz can served in a snifter. It pours a nice orange body with a light haze. There's a sizable head and lots of sticky lacing left behind. Lets dive in.
This beer is awesome on all accounts. The main one is it's always fresh and available. You can just go and buy it without wrestling someone at the brewery or on Ebay.
16 ounce can -&gt; New Belgium globe glass
"16 oz can poured into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass. A beautiful opaque orange color with a few fingers of head. The smell is piney along with citrus - lemon, grapefruit, and orange come through. Really outstanding nose. The taste is really bitter with a strong pine presence. This is a true hop bomb that has a distinct resinous feel. Overall, this is a really drinkable west coast IPA and one of the best beers coming out of Charlotte."
"Poured on-tap at the brewery and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, opaque, copper coloring with a thin, filmy, sparse, off-white head. Nose of tart citrus (tangerine and grapefruit), with a rich caramel backbone. Flavors are tangy sweet caramel forward, with a vanilla overlay, all blending with a tart and bitter hops character that is heavy citrus and pine. Smooth and light, with a bittersweet and peppery aftertaste. Clean, dry finish. Very solid beer!"
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (HF stemware); no canning date but this stuff just got onto the market here in North Carolina. So, fresh. "
Amazing IPA. Heavy IPA drinker and this is one of the best I have ever had.
"Bottled shared with Duffman929-- thanks! Apparence is a slightly hazy gold with white head. The aroma is amarilla forward with heavy pine and grapefruit, citra notes are there but are present in the background. Nice malt backbone present which pairs nicely with the hop profile and makes for a touch of earthiness. Taste has moderate to high level of bitterness with huge amarillo presence. Pine and grapefruit dominate with mellow tropical notes in the background. The malt backbone comes through strong and presents a touch of caramel. The finish is pleasantly bitter and well balanced. Mouthfeel is on par for style. Overall, a nice little IPA with plenty of hops and a touch more on the earth tones than I would expect from the advertised hop schedule."
Thanks to Wil for this one!
"Ap - Dank! I mean a mess, dark orange filled with cloudy goodness."
Reviewed again from 2013 now 2016 just feels so different--scores are 2016
A: Pours a hazy burnt orange in color with some very light amounts of active visible carbonation along the sides of the glass and some apricot + amber highlights. The beer has a finger tall creamy foamy beige head that slowly reduces to a thin film covering the majority of the surface of the beer with a couple of small slightly thicker patches and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.
If you look at my rating history you can see I only rate beers I like. I like this beer. It's hoppy with a nice citrus balance. Color... I love murky IPAs and this one murky. I rated this a little lower on mouth feel because it seems just the littlest too thick. I'll definitely have another. BTW...it's a $3.00 pint night special at the Columbia SC Flying Saucer. I'll be drinking this as long as I can stand.
On tap from my backyard kegerator into a Founders brewing pint glass
"Good to see I can get bottles of this beer now in GSO.Poured into an imperial nonic a deep burnt orange with a great looking lacey white head,it looks creamy and left a nice sheet of lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Tropical fruits abound in the nose along with some sugary sweetness and more mild herbal hop notes,great hop complexity.Tropical fruits on the palate as well along with big herbal/grassy flavors,there is a sugary base along with some biscuit but it doesn't interfere with the big hops.For me this is easiest the best beer I have had from NoDa,the hop profile is just great,probably one of the two or three best ""big"" IPA's brewed around here."
Appearance: Arrives with a hazy amber color; the head is respectable and leaves a bit a lacing here and there
"A: poured into a snifter, this beer pours a clear golden caramel color. The brew leaves a little lacing, not as impressive as the high end west coast IPAs that I've had."
A: Pours a pale amber color with one+ finger off-white head and thick lacing. 
bomber bottled 7/15 and consumed the same day..into a shaker.
16oz can from Salud into a Duvel glass...
"this beer really impressed me. on tap at the charlotte airport for some nine bucks, I was unsure at first for obvious reasons. it pours a hazy goldenrod flower color, dense looking but with very good carbonation amounting in an inch or so of white fizz. the nose is unbelievable, really yummy. tons of citra hops and other high alpha varieties, way more fruity than bitter, with notes of grapefruit and lemon candy, fresh peach, and dried grass. the malt is rather unremarkable, which is okay because the hops complexion is just so big and interesting. I love the way the hop flavors come though without making this supremely bitter. it is a bigger beer, and drinks like one, with a fuller body and a slight boozy warmth on the finish. a couple of these is enough, but the use of citra hops here is something to behold. best airport beer ive ever had, no contest."
"Can from HeadyHops81, thanks for the opportunity."
A-Pours hazy orange. Hard to tell the head from the sample cup.
"Stopped by Duckworth's in Charlotte last week and having never tried anything from these guys, I started out the evening with this. "
Thanks to kubrick215 for picking up and sharing this growler. My first beer from NoDa. 
A: nice copper color with a finger or so head
"I love this IPA. It is my favorite style and this one of my absolute favorites of the style. The malt/hop balance is excellent, while still showing a very hop forward ""west coast"" profile. There are a lot of highly hyped IPA's in the market (most are deserving of their reputation) -- this one compares favorably to all of them and in my opinion exceeds most."
"Had this one at the source! Served from tap into a NoDa sampler shaker. Poured a bright yellow-orange with a minimal white head. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, pine, and pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, pine hop, spice, spicy hop, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I really enjoyed the flavor profile that was going on here as it was very appealing to the palate and crisp. This fact also made me order another pint after I was done with my sampler. The rest of the beer was pretty decent for the style, but just didn’t stand out from some others I have had in my ticking career. While this is not a bad thing, I just wish it would have swept me off my feet in some way. Definitely worth your time to try this one."
Had on tap at the brewery on 10/24/2012.
Visited the brewpub yesterday: pour into shaker pint glass.
"Had on tap at the tasting room. Pretty much a perfect IPA, huge citrus aroma and taste. Nice white head with the expected mouthfeel for a nice hoppy IPA. Definitely one of the best IPAs I have ever had. I will absolutely be seeking this out in the future."
"on-tap, duckworths ballantyne"
"Pours a pale amber color with one finger off-white head and thick, consistent lacing."
"The appearance was a hazy golden bronzed orange color with a thin white layer of foaminess. No lacing. The smell had started off with some sweet citrus and bitter grapefruit rind. Light sweet onion dankiness strolling in underneath. The flavor copies the smell pretty much the same. Light sweet danky onion and citrus aftertaste. Semi-smooth sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent ssessionably low carbonated smooth feel. Overall, great AIPA, definitely would have again!"
L - lightly evervescent crystal gold. I can see right through this bad boy. Buoyant fluffy head with surprising sticking power. 
"Bottle dated June 17, 2016. Poured into Kane tulip glass."
"Poured into a pint glass on draft at The Local. Pours a vibrant straw yellow, with a one inch fluffy white head that leaves a beautiful ring of lace. "
"Appearance: pours a golden yellow color with a nice head, and some moderate lace developed during the session."
"On tap at the Beer Belly in Albany, NY."
On tap at Pies & Pints: Pours a clear pale yellow straw with a finger of head that settles to a cap with ample lacing. Big citrus nose...mostly orange. Taste follows nose. Really enjoyable.
Hippiness and zestiness if nothing else! Good beer 5/16 JAYS
Appearance is hazy dark yellow with a sticky bright white head that leaves sheets of lacing. 
"Had on-tap 03/23/16 at Maine Beer Company in Freeport, Maine"
"My first one of this and it surely won't be my last. Another outstanding beer from MBC. Pale hue with a slight hazy look, nice head and lacing, citrusy smell with a group ""hug"" of ingredients that left a slight bitterness that was very nice. Good job MBC"
"From a 3-week-old bottle, pours a slightly hazy, pale gold with a couple fingers of dense, bright-white foam. Good lacing. "
Bottle dated 3/16/2016:
Fresh pick up from Maine brewery. Poured into a snifter.
From 1pt 0.9 oz bottle marked 031616
500 ml bottle was poured into a Spiegelau glass. 
Poured a pale golden yellow color in a Spiegelau glass with a 4F head.
"Outstanding - soft body, smooth mouthfeel with a crisp dry finish. Autumn gold pour with a resilient head. Fragrant aroma of pine, citrus, hay and grapes. Those Nelson hops are unmistakable - pineapple, mango, orange rind, green grapes with a light cracker malt. Drinks real easy with a clean bitter finish."
"bottle dated 3.16.16. pours a slightly hazy yellow/gold, few fingers of head that sticks around for a while due to all the tiny bubbles rising. stickyness all over the glass, wow looks great! "
"About 2 weeks old. Smells amazing. Dank, piney, grassy, grapefruit rind and orange zest. Light and crisp mouthfeel. Highly attenuated. Dry, bitter finish. Little sweetness. Pretty tasty and solid ipa that drinks like a pale."
500 mL bottle poured into an Allagash sample glass. 
what an awesome Nelson sauvin highlighted IPA. delicate yet full flavored. simply awesome to sit back and sip on a hot day or a cold one for that matter. classic MBC mouthfeel.
"Not sure what it is but I LOVE the feel of this beer. WOW - so silky. The looks is a cloudy light yellow with carbonation floating slowly to the top in a tube in the middle of the beer. The head was two fingers when poured from a bottle into a large 20 oz tulip glass. The head is fluffy and the lacing is pronounced. The smell is lack luster. Not a lot here, but grapefruit notes. Not a lot on the nose but it is nice. Nothing to complain about - would just appreciate a stronger smell. The taste is subtle an very refreshing. The 6.5 abv was hidden well, would put this in the category of a 4.5 session IPA. The best attribute is the feel. Id you could imagine melting down a silt scarf in order to drink it - yeah - it is that smooth. I love this beer."
"Poured into a becker golden and clear. With a healthy head that looks something like one of those perfect fake mustaches. The head remains for some time. Very pungent fruity hops smell. Sweet, flavorful aroma, not bitter at all. Almost no malt in the beer but the hops are sweet and pungent and fruity. Feels fresh in the mouth. Excellent beer."
"Pours golden and clear, with a two finger head. Smells of mosaic and hops, sweet. Taste is bitter and refreshing. Clean, but tingly mouth-feel - plenty of hop flavor with a nice dry finish. Nice IPA from Maine Beer Company. I'll take a Lunch or Another One over this most of the time, but still a nice change of pace."
"Crisp, clean, citrus forward straw colored wonderful ipa."
"A solid, not too strong IPA. Great color, best in a nice big pint glass."
"Beer is a slightly hazy straw color with a thing ivory head. Aroma is a powerful hop blast: pine and citrus. Taste follows the nose. Citrus and pine give way to a dry finish that is a pleasant mix of bitter and tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is excellent. It is well carbonated. Assertive but not at all heavy. Overall, this is an excellent beer. An unusual mix of hops has produced an extremely tasty and drinkable beer."
very very good.. for the first run at it I expect great things going forward..
"Such a delicious brew. Balanced, as always. Cant wait for Beer II"
16oz bottle poured into a globe.
"Wow, Nelson and Mosaic work together so well here. Mmmm"
"This a solid first offering from Maine's new Hop Program; light, dry, tropical, so clean. Wish I had the opportunity to get my hands on this beer again and again!"
"First Impression was ""Is this really HF What is Enlightenment?"" Opened my eyes and saw Beer 1. Top notch representation on the style. Abv of 6.5 was a surprise."
"My 50th Beer rating for beer advocate, so I decided to splurge and get something a bit nice from the store. Amazing look smell and taste, One of my new favorites!"
Loved this beer. Hops were outrageous.
Bottle from Bier Cellar Portland enjoyed in the hotel room in Augusta. 
"Incredibly light, pissy (in a good way) session ipa"
1 pint .09 oz. bottle poured into a bulbed pint glass. Liquid comes out a pale yellow/orange almost straw color. Very hazy and it glows a little more in the light. Really hazy and it has a nice white head with some really great lacing to it. 
Dated 02-25-15; tasted 03-19-15 (bottle into snifter glass). 
A bright gold color. Fast fading white head. A bit of lace.
this is kind of Hop Ranch while Another One is kind of Dirt Wolf...
"Fine beer, nothing special about it. Very little flavor."
"L - light hazy yellow, big head fades over time, lacing the glass"
A - A great looking IPA. Bright light wheat body with 2 fingers of pure white head with great retention and lace.
"Bottle. Pours a barely hazy, bright yellow color. Head is white and frothy in its consistency. Lots of lacing curtains draped along the glass. Aroma really pops. Zestily hopped! A very cool combo of hops are showcased here, including my absolute favorite, Nelson Sauvin. Grassy yet very tropical. Unripe pineapple, passion fruit, and some noticeable guava. I also pick up Maine Beer's delectable malt profile of sweet but somehow dry pastry goodness. Flavor is full of exclamatory lemon zest, guava, lime, grass, and passion fruit. Oh yeah, and pineapple. Maine Beer malt perfection: pastry, white bread and perfect backing for those hops. Light, bubbly, and spritzy feel. Noticeable bitterness but not an IBU bomb. Wow, they nailed it again. Stupendous. Love the use of my favorite hops (Nelson). I think the Mosaic hops also contribute a nice, earthy and tropical and spicy hop element. Very complex and unique."
One of the best beers I've had.. I'll put this second behind Dinner.. What a beer this is.. Hopefully it won't be hard to find more of this stuff..

Bottled 022515
Very cloudy with a dirty gold color. Moderate head but it leaves a good blanket of lace. 
"Almost completely opaque orange-yellow with a moderate, bright white dense fuzz settling to a persistent thick collar."
"This beer pours a very cloudy dark golden yellow color with a three finger, frothy off white head. Retention is excellent and there are many hanging chunks of lacing left on the glass."
"Can from the Fort Point brewery in Boston, MA, whislt in town for EBF. Can was two thirds full :( Pours moderately hazy with minimal head and nice lacing, smells and tastes like spicy dank citrus candy, medium to thin bodied. Quite nice, great hop nip."
A: vibrant pale orange color with some darker amber notes towards the middle. Bright white head
"Another instant win from Trillium... Features Enigma and CTZ hops, canned 1/26/18... Hazy medium-gold, cloudy orange juice-looking brew with a fat white head that left lace down the glass... Aromas mildly citric and vaguely tropical, but with greener notes popping throughout... Tastes follow in kind, with additional suggestions of unripe mango and bitter melon... Sweetness is mild, complemented with a moderate bitterness and a smooth delivery... Muted tanginess, ample carbonation, and a clean finish... Beers like this are the reason I consider Trillium a top 10 brewery..."
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
Poured from a 16 oz can into a harmony glass.
"Had on tap. Pours hazy orange yellow in color with minimal head. Taste is big peach, herbal hops, and light chardonnay. Heavy bodied, slightly bitter, moderate carbonation. Reminds me of a milkshake ipa. Super thick, good juiciness, better than the original."
"folks are really loving this one it seems like, and its delicious, and obviously highly preferable to just about any of the blood orange ipa types that have flooded the market in recent years, but they have a winner with this ipa, it really doesnt need any tweaks. it always seems weird to me when a brewery takes an amazing flagship-esque beer like this one and makes changes, its famous for a reason. that said, the mango added tastes fresh to me, its not too sweet, and most importantly of all, its dosed lightly enough to accent the base beer without taking it over, i would have been real disappointed if this covered up the goodness that is the original. the hops and the mango go great together, and this being on the maltier side anyway, there is a lot of support in body so the mango doesnt change the feel too much. its a nice fresh sunny mango flavor, juicy and natural, and it works. i think it brings out the sweetness of the malt a bit much for my personal taste, but the beer remains very balanced. i definitely still prefer the original, its a staple, but this is a nice little variant, nice fresh mango and not too much of it."
"Mango keeps getting me on some of my favorite IPAs, and this is no exception. I keep thinking more fruit might throw off the balance, but maybe I just like them that way."
Mango mama pours a darker cooper color with a small head. Hoppy ipa aroma with sweet mango notes. Taste is mainly iPad with subtle sweet mango flavors. Good body and flavor. Overall nice ipa with subtle mango.
"On tap at the Tap, into a tulip, pours a clear deep orange-Amber with minimal off white head that dissipates quickly. Some bread and a lot of overripe dark mango on the nose. No hoppy bite on the tongue, no bright tropical flavors...a lot of mango pulp, though...some depth of flavor, but not much complexity. Disappointed. Give me the regular any day...I've heard such good things about this one that I really want this to be a flawed batch, even though I don't think there are technical flaws here."

Big thanks to the guy who gave me this. Thanks
I have wanted this for so long! 
On tap at the brewpub. Poured into a 10 oz. goblet glass.
"Big thanks goes out to MBrausen for sending this one down for myself and caSSino to tick (well me to tick...). First beer I've had since my accident on 11/11/11! Reviewed live. Served from growler into a NoDa Brewing snifter. Pours hazy bright orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt, mango, pine, caramel, fruit hop, and pine hop. The flavor is of sweet malt, mango, pine, caramel, fruit, fruit hop, and pine hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This was a great way to start back drinking. The mango is definitely present and makes a nice balanced flavor with the hops. An easy drinker that I suggest all beer lovers try to get on their palate."
"Thanks for sharing, Rich. "
Tried this at Sweetwater with Urbancaver and Cashew70
You had this beer. 
"On tap at Town Hall Tap. This beer arrives a hazy orange-red color. The head is half an inch in height, and lingers a while. The aroma is of mango, grapefruit, and oranges. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with some pine resin coming through. The mango characteristic in both the flavor and aroma is subdued enough to not lend a lot to the beer, but strong enough to take away a lot of the great qualities of Masala Mama. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, I can quite disappointed with this beer, and will most likely pass on it next time."

"Stopped by the brewpub to pick up a growler, and it turned out this was on tap. Couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it, and I wasn't disappointed."
10 oz pour in a snifter glass. Super pumped to see this on tap when I was in town for the weekend. 
10oz pour served in a snifter.
"What a beer. This one really blew me away. A very pretty orange color but little head developed on this one. Nose is amazing--fresh hoppy citrus intermingles with real sweet mango notes. It's like smelling a fruit basket. Flavor really delivers with a truly unique IPA experience. Exceptional fresh mango flavors overlay a citrus and leafy hop profile that fades into a moderate and balanced malt backbone. Medium to full mouthfeel, this one really delivers. I think the other Town Hall beers I had were good, but not out of this world. This beer is out of this world, however. My only complaint really is that the mango mutes some of the bitterness, but I got my bitter fix on regular Masala Mama anyway."
"This beer has eluded me for yours, now I finally get to try it. After an evening at Triple Rock celebrating Surly's 5th anniversary party we headed to TH for brews and fod. "
On tap at the Town Hall Brewery
Got lucky on this one. We happened to stop in two days after they tapped it.
"Another superb IPA from Minneapolis Town Hall. Poured from a cask into a pint glass. Pours an amberish brown with a lacy beige head. Nose is the perfect blend of mango and hops. More subtle mango in the taste, but still present. Clean, refreshing body. Nice finish."
On tap. Served in a goblet.
Had this served in a pint glass at the pub.
"This is one murky looking brew. Looks like homebrew, and that's a good thing. With a hard pour, I erect a nice frothy ivory white head. It doesn't stick around for long. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is fresh and citrusy. Mango juice and citric hop overtones blend to perfection. Awesome aroma. Flavor is mango dominated and it's the perfect complement to the otherwise outstaning fruity and citrusy Masala Mama. Hops blend in some other fruit notes as well, like apricot,tangerine and nectarine. Base malt is caramel and toffee, but it's in the distance. This is one boldly flavored IPA. Well done."
Growler shared by JP - much obliged!
Huge thanks to whoever cracked open this growler at the Brick Store.
"Mango Mama pours a murky, milky, muddled deep orange. No lacing, no retention. It's really unattractive... but it DOES look like what's to come. It looks like mango puree was poured in and swirled around."
Many many many many thanks to dontcostnuthin for sharing this with me. I owe you one John!

Thanks craytonic for this one. We know it was filled within days of us opening it.

Growler received in trade from darklordlager. Big thanks for filling this long time want of mine. Poured into a Sierra Nevada 30th Anny snifter.
One hit is on appearance - as those kind of standards go. Very murky and muddy looking. First pour no head and second pour had a loose head that disappeared quickly. So get the hard hit part out of the way first.
Poured from a 64oz growler into a tasting glass.
Cheers to Sean for hooking us up with this on a random Wednesday night.
"64oz growler straight from the brewery, graciously shared by Davolebomb"
"64oz growler provided by Sean...Tough to open and as it does a huge hiss, a slight gusher. Pours with tons of head, a light tope head with a hint of orange to it, watery and falls quickly. The beer is a dark dirty orange, tons of bits of fruit float throughout the glass....The aroma is really nice, great notes of mango not at all overwhelming or too sweet, light pine resin on the back balances out...The taste is a huge let down, most the sweetness is gone, light mango but a lot of medicinal/metallic/pine flavors are not great. "
64 oz growler into an oversized tulip. Big thanks to joshuaseresse for this in a recent trade. 
Figured I'd get the double tick on this one. Growler brought back from the brewery three days ago. This will give me the opportunity to see the head anyway. Poured into a pint glass.

"On draught at the brewery, Mango Mama is turbid, dull orange with small, big bubbled skim that quickly dissipates, leaving a flat, thick looking beer that is most unappealing. "
Appearance: Extremely cloudy mango to burnt umber appearance with an attractive 2 finger khaki crown that displays little retention and lace. 
Big thanks to SourNote for the chance to try this one!
"Finally get to try this one. Poured from a growler into my Southern tier tulip glass. It looked pretty much like apple cider in my glass, brown and murky. At least if any of the trick or treaters ask tonight it will pass for cider. It poured with very little head and what was there completely disappeared in a minute or so. It's hard to rate this one's appearance, as a traditional American IPA it would score pretty bad on looks. It's not very traditional though and having regular Masala Mama I'm sure the mangos have a lot to do with the look. I'm going to cut it some slack in this category and say it's average for fruit addition beers, which is probably still generous."
"At last, growlers!"
Had this on tap 10/25 and 10/26 at Town Hall.
"On tap. Poured into a Town Hall pint glass. Pours a slightly hazed and murky amber orange color with a 1 finger off white head which settles rather quickly. Fruity aroma, duh right?, with citrus type hops aroma. Sweet mango flavor upfront follows by a nice citrus hops type bitterness. Loads of citrus rind bitterness. Medium mouthfeel. Surprised at the lackluster head and poor lacing as I don't recall previous batches being as such, perhaps making a full batch vs. 1 keg at a time has something to do with it or the fact they had to use pasteurized mango puree vs. mango chunks . Really drinkable though. As I have had this several times I feel the quality wavers a little bit between batches. This time the carbonation was less than before probably due to my aformentioned reasons. Still, this is an awesome brew that drinks really easily and tastes great."
Mango Mama on-tap at the Town Hall 10-25-2010. Poured into a pint glass:
64 oz growler with a best by date of 11/09/10 poured into a Bell's tulip on 10/25/10 (the day of its release!)
"Well, much to my surprise I was in MLPS for a release of Mango Mama and their anniversary celebration. I was quite excited to try this treat having loved Mama Masala in the past. Well, sadly, I have to place this near the top of my over-hyped beer list. In my mind it wasn't nearly as good as Mama Masala and had some flaws.."
A: Peach colored with a small but consistent film for head; decent lacing
"A: Pours a nice, bright orange with some moderate haze and a nice off-white head. Served in what is probably best described as a medium-sized goblet."
"Got three 10 ounce pours at Town Hall over the weekend. Is 30 ounces enough to tick this one off? Tasted side by side with Masala Mama, this one was slightly better IMO, both very good though."
A: Hazy orange in color. Served in a snifter with a minimal white head. There is little retention and not much in the way of lacing. 
"One of the most surprising gifts to behold, along with a note demanding immediate consumption. Thank you my good sir!"
"11/17/10 again at Town Hall. Way more mango this batch. Went from mango infused IPA to IPA infused mango juice. Still good, but not 5.0 good like the first time I had it. Batch variation for sure. I'll just have to keep going back. "
"Thrilled to finally have been able to sample this one, I think this is easily one of my top five most sought after. Lovely pint, served cold and proudly enjoyed."
"Pours a semi clear light copper color. It smells sweet and tart. The server told me it was the Masala Mama IPA infused with mangos. I think it made the Masala Mama taste a lot better. The taste is much sweeter and more tart than the regular IPA, you can really taste the fruit addition, but it has a nice was of mellowing out the bitterness. It smells and tastes grapfruity a bit like a hopslam."
"Hadn't heard of this beer, before I showed up Minneapolis Town Hall this winter. I knew I wanted to try Masala Mama and their winter seasonal, but after my sister ordered one and i tried it, I was instantly hooked."
I've had this several times over the years. I finally sat down and wrote some notes this time.
"On tap at Town Hall, came to me with a small fading head. Much darker than the O.G. mama."
Surprised to find this on-tap at the brewpub yesterday.
On-tap at the brewery. From notes:
Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a tiny white head.
Served on-tap at Town Hall. Poured into tulip glass x2.
Served in 10 oz. wine glass
Serving type-on tap poured into tulip glass.
sampled on tap at the brewpub july 30/09.
Decided to grab a few beers one night while the little lady worked late. Had this beer after their Smoked Porter so this tastes extra fruity after that. Drank from a small generic snifter.
After missing this day less than a day at the pub earlier this summer I was glad to see MTH brought a keg of this along to GToM 2009.
Oh mama...
On tap @ GTOM
"On tap at the brewpub, served in a 10 oz snifter."
Hazy orange pour with a thin white head. Plenty of citrus and hoppy fruit aroma. Flavor is up front orange and mango that really went back and forth from the hops and the fruit. Nice caramel backdrop in this one. Nice a bitter fruit bitterness in the finish. This was definitely a standout at the Great Taste Of The Midwest in 08.
had on tap in 10 oz goblet at MTHB it pours a peach orange slightly hazy color with 1/3 inch head...the smell is the mango its tropical smelling and sweet i also smell some grapefruit and hop/spice..the taste is super the mango hits you first the it gives way to their delicious marsala ipa which means tasty hops /grapfruit ans sweet/mild malt( MTH flagship imo) this one is so good it is so well balanced highly flavorful and with the infused mango it is just WOW..this is a must try ipa.. the only thing negative is that the 10 oz glass goes down fast and they do not sell in growlers.... this one is highly recommended
Served in a 10 oz mini-goblet.
I had this one on tap at the Town Hall brewpub on 5/11/2009 (part of an epic beer trip with BA roadhouse).
Had on tap 5/11 at the brewpub into a goblet
"First, let me say that I avoided this beer for quite a while since I DON'T LIKE MANGOS. I couldn't fathom why Town Hall would ruin a simply superb beer like Masala Mama by polluting it with something like that. "
Consumed on 3/2/09
A= the beautiful thick head stands out the most to me. Followed ty the deep amber orange color.
"On tap at the brewery. Consumed with the Seven Corner's Burger. I was quite happy to see this on tap on a Wednesday considering it's only supposed to be available on Mondays. Pours a light amber/orange color with a small orange/white head that stuck around the entire time, leaving some average lacing. Very nice aroma of citrusy hops mixed with orangy Mango. Not much in the way of sweet malts as the sweetness in the nose comes mostly from the fruit. Flavor is fantastic! The way the sweet fruit balances with the bitter hops is phenomenal. It's sweet but not too sweet, mango flavor is present but not overpowering to the rest of the brew. Bitter, citrus hops balance out perfectly with the sweetness. This is a great beer, and I almost think I prefer this one to the regular Masala Mama. Yes. I like it that much."
On-cask at the brewpub. Ordered a 12 oz. glass before dinner and it was a tasty little appetizer.
"Enjoyed at the brewpub with the FMonk, Al McArthy. Not much in aroma, mango neutralized the hop. Looks fruitier, adding some bulk and colour to regular IPA. Gives it some fruity to the bitterness. Overall its a wash and a change of pace. You have to chase down this one, even though advertised as always on Mondays."
"happened to drink this beauty at the bar today for lunch. came in a slightly smaller than a pint (prolly 11 oz idk) big bowled white wine glass. had slightly understanted mango character compared to what i was expecting, however it was delicious. the bitterness was smooth and really flavorful. it wasnt a huge hop blast anymore but it was a great beer."
Appearance: Arrives at the bar with a hazy amber color; the modestly sized head leaves dots and shards of lace
A- Golden brown with a thine white head no activity to be seen.
"They've had this off and on for the past few months, but seemingly more off than on. Last week, though, it was in and I had to revisit it for reviewing purposes."
"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy...Mango Mama is back at TH."
"Into a tulip glass, looks just like the Masala Mama, but without any head or lacing, and I couldn't twirl much into existence. The aroma was a bit tame, but a lovely fruity blend of hops and the infused mango. With a name like Mango Mama, I'd have expected this to go a little over the top with the fruit, and thankfully it didn't. It still is basically the same Masala everyone knows and loves, with a gentle touch of the mango fruit to sweeten it up a bit. A great idea, the perfect fruit for this. lovely."
"This beer is out of this world. Up front you get the same fantastic citrus bitterness as in Masala Mama but then a bright mango sweetness sweeps all lingering hop flavor off the tongue for a perfect, even finish. Its too bad this isnt one of their permanent offerings."
"Dark orange in color, no head, just a ring around the top. The body is a lighter, more honey-colored hue toward the bottom of the glass. The nose is filled with hops and pine, along with a sort of citrus/orange peel and grapefruit gloriousness, very sweet, but not as mango-y as expected..."
"I'm sure this is just an oversight, but I can't find the ""stone growler"" option here...I'm sure they'll put one in soon."
More flower than fruity. Overall good beer
"Aug 2018...pours brownish dirty gold, thick and murky with patchy ringed white foam. Strong citrus fruity nose - tropical fruits abound. Sharp citrus tart open, lemon, strong rind flavor. Malty thick taste. Juicy. Really tasty citrus loaded IPA>."
16 oz can the bottom reads : (Billy Mays Haze IPAS 4 Dayz YAY! ) 7/20/18 opened on 8/8/18 update on 10/26/18.
This was poured into a becher pint glass.
On tap at the brewery
Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; difficult to read but canned imprint looks like 04/22/2018.
Canned ~8 weeks ago.
"Look: Very hazylight orangish yellow, but not turbid big white head"
Pint on draft at Parker's in Portland. Watching Pats lose to the Panthers.
"I'm not a professional beer drinker, but I really like this."
Draught
A; cloudy; pale gold in color; a 2 finger ivory head that receded to a thin cap; very nice lacing;
"had it out of the can that i bought at the brewery, so pretty fresh (fill date was 2 days ago). In speaking with the brewer, it appears this is their flagship beer, but I didn't really feel this one. a little dull on the nose and it had a bit of a bitter aftertaste. look was light golden, but cloudy (and I wouldn't call it hazy). definitely better IPAs in the area."
"12oz. can served in a tulip nonic. No freshness dating. Pours a dull orange with a fluffy, tight, quarter inch, bright white head and a murky clarity. Nose is somewhat subdued but suggests tangerines, a hint of pith and some biscuit malts. Taste consistent with nose; however, more pith forward than citrus. That said, it comes off a bit dull. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive carbonation that leaves a residual prickle at the back of the throat between quaffs. All and all, not sure this beer warrants the hype and the price tag based on this offering. Perhaps an old can?"
Appearance: Pours out honey colored and hazy with a modest head; a few strands linger 
"Visited Stoneface while on vacation and picked up a 6 pack of their IPA. Very easy drinking with a relatively low IBU of 50. Poured into a tulip glass, head dissipated quickly to leave a golden hazy appearance. Taste citrus with a mild hop bite. If your in or around New Hampshire pick up a pack you won't be disappointed!"
"got a 4pk of these white visiting NH. nice citrus and pine notes, bready malts providing some balance. mouthfeel is on point. will definitely get more of this next time i visit. nice stuff!"
"This is my favorite beer on the easy coast, unless you talk of their Blip, or other special releases. It is the closest to a West Coast IPA I have found here."
"Pours a half clear light orange. Fine, soft foam."
"On tap at Row 34 in Boston, MA."
Nice cloudy double IPA look.
My favorite... Def some pinney scents and taste but not over baring
Can not Waite for these to be canned
"One of my top three beers. Great stuff. Ambrosia. Very balanced, nice floral aroma. Like Jimmy Breslin said...""A Good drinkin' beer""."
"On tap at the Irish Rover in a Standard pint glass. One finger firm head.Nice citrus/floral aroma. Piney and citrus flavors mix well for a crisp feel on the tongue. Poured from a pint bottle into a tulip glass. Taller head, two fingers. Same fine taste and aromas. Reminds me of the finer west coast IPA's."
Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. 
Poured from 16oz bottle to pint glass. Has a cloudy light amber look with very frothy thick head. The citrus smell is strong and very pleasant. Taste is of the more citrus IPA than the sharper pine ipas. Feel is amazing stays on your toungue like velvet. Still one of my very favorite ipas. A+ Stone Face
Draft at Loon Mtn...
"This is an excellent West Coast-style IPA, and I wish we could get it in Delaware. I would buy it often."
Pours light head nice aroma. Tones of citrus light pine and hops. Very well made. Nice refreshing. Very solid ipa. Very drinkable. Will definitely have again.
I liked the balance of the beer from start to finish.
Thanks to smanson56 for this one from hid LIF box. 16oz bottle poured into 10oz goblet. Poured a lightly hazy gold-yellow color with over 1/2 inch of white head that had great retention and lacing. 
"Pours gold with a, creamy head that smells amazing. Peaches, mango, and orange all hit very quickly on the nose. The piney, earthy tones come in to finish similar to the taste. Citrus, sweet tones but not over powering, almost subtle but apparent. Very nice IPA that doesn't over do-it, flavors are on point."
Great local NH IPA. Very consistent batches. One of my go to IPA's.
"Enjoyed at the brewery. Great beer and great brewery. Overall an excellent experience. Very tasty, smooth and easy to drink. Flavor throughout with great depth . Will def visit again when in the area."
16.9 oz. bottle dated 04/18/16
"This is an update...wayyy better than my first experience bc that bottle was old. This is superb. A typically delicious hoppy NEIPA but not as hazy as most. Crazy drinkable and refreshing. Big fan. Pricey, though."
"Had on tap at the Barking Dog Ale House in Haverhill. The beer has a nice slightly amber, orange appearance with thick retention and great lacing on the sides. Aromas included hops with a fruity citrus smell mixed with some earthy tones. Taste follows the nose as a good and bittersweet IPA with balanced hops. Great mouthfeel in general, helping to make the drink refreshing and crisp. Overall, I enjoyed this IPA with my dinner, especially because of its refreshing quality and it's great appearance."
"As soon as it poored I knew it was good. Great aroma, color on point. Juicy and well balanced..."
"Bottle, no apparent date:"
"Draught @ Brewery: This one pours a cloudy, dark golden color. There was almost no head on it, but it did have some lacing. Decent nose. Some pine, citrus and tangerine. The taste is also good. Nice hop bite to it. Mainly pine flavors, as wll as some tangerine."
This beer clocks in at about 5 weeks old. Not sure what happened in this batch but there's no hop presence in the nose. The flavor has plenty of bitterness but lots of off flavor that you'd get from lightstruck beer or older beer. Lots of macro-lager scent and some macerated corn notes. Disappointed. Not sure if it is just a bad batch.
"Poured from a bottle dated 1/22/16. Huge creamy head and a cloudy orange look, not a very pronounced smell, kind of citrus. Sweet malt taste up front and then a hoppy bite, if you are looking for a bitter bite this one doesn't have it. Pretty smooth almost creamy mouth feel that finished almost a bit peppery. Easy to drink and I'd get it again. Good suggestion from the Craft Beer Cellar staff here in the Ham"
"I was pleasantly surprised when I first sampled this beer over a year ago at a local beer festival and the bottled variety certainly did not let me down at all. Review is from a 16.9 poured into Stone Brewing ""Specialty IPA"" glass. Upon opening the bottle I was greeted with a lovely aroma of fresh hops which perfectly accentuated the thick, frothy head that filled my glass well above the brim. The beer itself poured a very nice, slightly hazy, golden honey color while the head was thick, pillowy, and long lasting. The scent was floral with some subtle earthy tones and a touch of grapefruit. Taste to me is the most impressive part of this beer. Very well balanced, malt flavor up front with strong and flavorful hops on the back without overpowering the palette with bitterness. This beer is very drinkable at 7.2%, and went down very smooth. I thoroughly enjoyed the seamless blending of malt, citrus, hops, and the slightest hint of spice in this brew. The mouth feel of this beer is great! Medium feel which gives it some substance without feeling like a watered down IPA or too heavy to drink more than one. The thick frothy head accentuates the feel of this beer initially (lacing was exceptional as well). Overall, I have to say this is an exceptional IPA. I truly believe Stoneface has distinguished themselves among NH brewers with this beer. I am thoroughly looking forward to sampling some of their other offerings. As an occasional drinker of IPAs, I might add that this may become one of my more frequent sources to satisfy my need for Hops."
This beer pours a hazy honey color with a huge frothy white head. Retention is excellent and there is tons of webbed lacing. Smell is a bit muddled. Earthy and floral notes with some spiciness and citrus. Taste is the same. Feel is medium and smooth. Just a bit of stickiness on the back. Overall a very good beer although I think the aroma could use some tweaking.
"Purchased at the CBC somewhere in NH. Poured into a hotel room glass. The initial pour was a clear golden yellow, but I noticed a ton of sediment at the bottom. After adding that, it's very hazy and aromatic. Thick white head that leaves some lace. Aromas are a combination of tropical fruits and spice. Taste is great - sweet and tropical up front, spicey hops, followed by a soft and balanced bitterness. Mouth is just right - medium-body, smooth, nice carbonation. Overall, an impressive IPA."
Bottling date 01/15/16
"Unfortunately, I have know clue when this was bottled."
"Pours clear golden Amber with a thin foamy white head. Piney and citrus hop with toasted malt. Piney hip flavor up front with some juicy citrus notes, medium body with low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and finish. Solid IPA"
"Nice fruity nose, floral hop notes, and hints of cotton candy. The citrus hop notes dominate the palette with a solid butter caramel malt backbone and a bitter citrus rind finish. Medium bodied, smooth and surprisingly wet. A solid IPA well worth seeking out and a fantastic first brew in New Hampshire."
"L - Pours a very, very sexy deep orange. Not hazy but deep and full in color. A lot of thick head, lots of lace. "
Many thanks to SawDog505 for this bottle. 
"16.9oz bottle with 011516 on the side. The beer pours a somewhat cloudy coppery orange with over an inch of fluffy, thick head. Tons of lacing. The aroma is lots of lemon and lime with light piney and floral hops. The taste is much like the aroma. Lemon and lime up front but with a bit of stone fruits this time around, followed up by the floral hops. Pine comes out towards the end along with more lemon and lime. Lightly toasted malts in the background. Herbal, almost peppery aftertaste. Heavy mouthfeel and very drinkable. Overall, great New England IPA that I need more of."
16.9 into tulip. 12/7/15
"Poured in a Luminarc 16oz IPA glass. Very nice golden orange and caramel color. Very nice thick head, a vanilla like color. Very smooth IPA, subtle hop tones. Easy drinking IPA. Has nice sweetness to it , hints of citrus with stronger caramel Flavor. I really like this beer, very very good beer. So soft and yet full of flavor."
Good well balanced IPA.
A- 500ml bottle split a few ways with a medium golden body and a very large frothy white head with great retention and deep thickness. Thick pillows of lace blanket most of my mug.
"A: Clear, golden orange, thick, fluffy white head that dissipates very slowly. Carbonated air bubbles can be seen rising fairly quickly from the bottom of the snifter."
Bottle poured into a snifter
"Clear apricot colored with streams of bubbles rising up to a white frothy head of dimpled foam that lingers long. Bright aroma of citrusy and floral hops. Flavors of honey malt initially, followed quickly by hoppy citrus and florals. Lots of tangerine, moderate bitterness. Even mouthfeel, moderately carbed. Good beer, but perhaps a bit overrated."
Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass. 
"Juicy. Grapefruit pith, orange rind, tangerine, cherry and pine bitterness. Highly attenuated. Super clean tasting. Medium, dry finish. Really awesome balance. Very solid."
Poured with a glorious presentation-
"Cloudy straw/orange. Small white head with a good bit of lacing. Really pretty, and what I come to expect of the region."
"Great IPA. Poured out of a 16.9oz bottle. Thick head on top of a golden orange body with plenty of carbonation. Aroma of orange, lemon, pine and mango. Taste follows suit with some nice tangerine balanced by a slightly sweet, earthy malt and a solid bitter finish. The carbonation lingers a bit but the finish is wonderfully dry. I'm excited to get my hands on a few more."
Always excited to try new breweries. This is my first from Stoneface. Stoneface IPA pours a hazy gold. Things are topped off by a couple of fingers worth of bone white head. Head slowly settles to a ring. Plenty of lace left in its wake.
Poured from a fresh pint bottle purchased at the brewery into a tulip glass:
Stoneface should be very proud of this beer. In my world this is just an outstanding IPA. Deserves world class
Yum.
"Beautiful crystal clear golden beer with a towering white head and fantastic lace. Nice, super fresh raw herbal hop flavor, but a tad light on mouthfeel."
"Solid beer, really liked it. Nice hop bite."
poured from a 500ml bottle.
16.9 ounce bottle. Supposedly fresh. 
"Tasty IPA. One of the best new beers I've had in a while. Reminds me of a cross between Maine Beer Co. MO and Another One. And that's a very good thing. And at $1 to $2 cheaper, that's even better."
"L-fairly hazy deep gold. Somewhere between filtered Cali and vt type shit. Persistent creamy head. Nice lacing. S- citrus, white breast malt, generic hop notes. T- lime, melon, honey, pine, grapefruit. Some sweetness before a lingering but pleasant bitterness. F- nice and creamy, not too far from the big boys. O- good beer but nothin crazy IMO. Always happy to find this on tap and at 5 bucks a bottle it's never a bad choice"
Hands down top 3 beers I've ever had.
"Nice lacing in the glass (from a bomber at home). Sweet and hoppy nose. Citrusy and slightly floral. The body is slick in a good way. Moves across the palette well. Juicy initial rush followed by a pleasant, almost piney secondary. Really, really good."
"Bottle of unknown age, really want more nose out of this brew."
"Cloudy yellow amber, medium white head of slight retention. Nose wafts lemon. Taste somewhat similar. Good but a bit unidimensionally hopped. Medium light body, low moderate carbonation."
Poured into a tulip glass
"No bottling date that I could find, however this just hit the shelves last week so I'm guessing it's fresh."
"Drinkable, enjoyable IPA. citrus nose. Clean, crisp IPA. Nothing spectacular, but typical dry-hopped IPA. Solid. Very balanced....nice beer for IPA lovers that like a citrus dry-hopped punch."
"I was pleased with this Stoneface offering. Fortunate that I was able to have someone send me a couple bottles. Overall, it's very solid. It reminded me of a poor man's version of Maine Lunch. That's not a knock by any stretch, either. Give it a try."
"Pours dark and slightly cloudy. Smells strong of citra, fruit, and hops. Strong hop flavor, citrus notes, bitter dry finish. Spicy mouth feel. Really good IPA, and a good example of a lot of things done right."
Nice IPA offering. I reach for this beer when I am out of Heady topper. 
Great local IPA....and I don't have to wait in line for it!!
Served in a snifter. Caramel gold color and cloudy. Tiny head but some streaks and spots for lace. 
"Putting NH on the map can't wait to hit this brewery up for there double and or specialty brews. There distributed beer IPA and APA are are fine offerings and have had one of there Doubles on draft at the Garder in Nash. Nice Hops to malt ratio, not super citrusy,or over powering. Good beer"
64 oz growler was poured into a pint glass. 
"Pretty straightforward here. Not as fruity and tropical as many of the newer IPAs out there. More of that classic grapefruit punch and a heavy palate bruising bitterness. Reminds me a lot of another beloved NH seacoast IPA, Finestkind, but not quite as drinkable."
"A very, very good beer. Outstanding hoppy smell on the nose. A bit too piny on the finish, but other than that excellent. Pours a beautiful yellow with two finger head."
"Drank from a 1 pint, 0.9 fluid ounces bottle purchased at Stoneface Brewing Co., Newington, NH"
"Not great, not terrible. A middle of the road ipa."
Hazy orange nice lacing.
"Easy pour into a room temperature tear drop, opaque, honey-colored. Lush malty head that persists, then heavy lacing on the glass as it drinks down. Sharp clean smell of hops. Tastes of sweet malt up front, grapefruit and lemon, moderately hoppy on the back end. Smooth and nicely balanced between sweets and bitters. Surely as fine an American IPA as I've ever met. I wish I had more but, um, I bought the last two pints at my local shop."
This IPA is crisp and refreshing nice balance with piney notes.
"An easy to drink IPA that is full of flavor. If I lived in New Hampshire this would be my go to IPA. Great HOPs, great flavor and a great finish. How all IPAs should be. Nothing crazy here, just a really good IPA."
"Poured from bottle bought at brewery on 3-17. Highly drinkable, well crafted, full bodied ipa. Drank so nicely that it didn't warm up a whole lot, but I'm sure there's even more nose and taste coming. Pale is nice too. Rye isn't my style but it was far more bitter and stronger than the IPA. Porter was flavorful."
"What a pleasant surprise, The guy at the beer store in Meredith recommended it to me. Really solid IPA, Nice pine notes with a smooth finish. Me likey! Hop notes are good, but not over-the-top. Superclean taste, Nice warm boozy feel. Good job Stoneface!"
A super solid IPA. A must have if you are roaming around New England and want to try the best IPAs (non- imperials) out there. My favorite coming out of NH... and looking for another NH brewery to wow me with a new #1. Hoping with the improvement and growth at Stoneface... we can get this in pint can 4-packs in 2015!
"Hazy golden orange pour with barely any head. Color is beautiful. Strong aroma of pine and resin, right up my alley. Taste starts with heavy bitter up front, but surprisingly smooth finish with a hint of malt sweetness. Keeps me sipping. Good stuff!"
"I really didn't get the hype with this beer. Maybe the bottle was old, but it was purchased in Portsmouth at CBC. Dark amber color, sweet and malt forward with underwhelming hops. Had a homebrew quality, just lacked depth overall."
Thanks to GRG1313 for sharing this one at Oneinchaway's tasting.
"Absolutely phenomenal beer. Easily pared with meals, especially red meat. In my opinion, it is delicious at any temperature and equally drinkable in the bottle or a glass. Well worth the typical $6.00 in the seacoast New England area for the perfect sized 16.9 oz bottle. I recommend any Stoneface product already on the market to any, especially for IPA/pale ale fan"
Found a few bottles while visiting my mother... Snuck 'em into my car while she wasn't looking. Hops are evident on the nose and in the mouth. Great India Pale Ale!
"My notes below are truncated; I'm having this beer as part of a bottle share. Reviewed live at low in Austin, TX."
"A nice foamy and attractive head on this one, and later light lacing. Fresh scent of citrus, grapefruit, and light hops. The taste is a fruit basket, notably pineapple, grapefruit, mango and orange, with a bit of pine and a little breadiness. Some upfront bitterness leaves a mild bitterness on the finish. A great creamy mouthfeel. A nice, balanced, and well crafted beer. The best beer I have tasted from my home state of NH. Looking forward to trying more brews from Stoneface."
It's an ok IPA. Worth a try. But there are so many other IPA's out there that I'd rather have.
Appearance: a pretty hue of cloudy light orange. Crisp concentrated head forms on the pour and is present throughout. Active carbonation happily rises.
Nice nose. Smooth all the way through. Make it a point to look for nonfiltered and light in color IPA'S. This will always be a go to. Waiting to try the double. Finally a great one I can easily get.
Very clear and has a very bitter first taste. No after taste
Another good IPA out of New England
"A - Cloudy yellow, huge rocky head. Fades slowly. Leaves heavy heavy lacing. "
L - Impressive creamy head sits atop a beautiful light orange body. Light lacing as the head drifts down the pint glass.
Served on tap in a pint glass.
"Slight cloudiness, very nice head that stayed. Medium nose, piney with some floral undertones. Decent enough taste - piney bitterness, clean, but nothing unusual. Good mouthfeel."
My second bottle of this; had tried it about a month ago... Now putting thoughts into reality... Got this 0.5l bottle locally tonight for $5.50....
Consumed 11/9/14
A - Pours a light hazy amber with nice foamy white head. Extremely good retention and lacing.
The beer comes in a hazy rich orange.
Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a large fluffy white head. Nice retention and lots of lacing. 
"Finally picked up a bottle after always passing it over since I didn't know much about the brewer and, wow, am I wishing I had done so earlier! Real nice citrus notes going on here and a bite to it as well. Decent head with some lacing as too. I must say I am very impressed with this IPA and Stoneface has more than passed my expectations. Well done, and enjoy!"
"I'm not a big IPA guy, but this is a great beer!"
Bought from Craft Beer Cellar in Nashua and poured into my trusty pint glass.
500ml bottle.
A - Pours a hazy cloudy burnt orange with a pillowy frothy white head. 
"Pint from Portsmouth Gas Light Co. First sip was very bitter without much else going on, but as expected as it warmed up it developed a great citrus juicy character and lovely billowy hop burst on swishing. Still very strong on the bitter end, in my opinion overly so. Without a doubt an excellent IPA as it warms."
"Pure awesomeness. Enjoyed this IPA immensely. This new brewery really knows what they're doing. Delicious to drink, and leaves you wanting more. Well done!"
"Extra in a trade from keith. Wow this stuff is fantastic, totally under my radar. great hop profile with incredible balance. Goes down incredibly easy, fantastic! Highly recommend, super excited ive got a second in the fridge!"
Poured from Growler filled 48 hours prior. Huge candied citrus flavor with just enjoy bitterness on the back end to balance the sweet citrus juiciness. Citra/Amarillo is evidently an outstanding combination. Absolutely world-class IPA for lovers of juicy citrus rather than bracing bitterness.
Poured into a 13 oz Weyerbacher tulip glass canned on 1/25/17. Pours a very attractive clear orange with a solid two finger sticky white head that leaves behind plenty of rings of lace.
"From the stubby 650 ml. bottle. sampled on September 6, 2014."
Date: 09/05/14
"Poured from a bottle (bottles sold 1-4pm weekdays, otherwise growler fills) in a tulip, three day old bottling. I had it on draft with a fresh keg the day before and I am not tasting too large a difference. Just a fantastic IPA. Beautiful nose, citrus, grapefruit, 2 finger lacey head that dissipates. Nice color, goes down well for 7.2% ABV, no bitter after taste. I am pretty pumped to be so close to the brewery. I'll be back to purchase a log."
"Excellent IPA. Quickly becoming one of Portsmouth's go-to-IPAs. Some nice citrus notes. Nice hoppiness. Very smooth drinking. No bitter aftertaste. Great job by a new-to-the-scene, but up-and-coming brewery!!! Have tasted at the brewery, from a growler, and in the bars and restaurants where it is served. Very consistent and high quality. Bravo!"
"A world-class IPA from right up the road, I picked up a bottle from the brewery."
"Ideal for a IPA fan who likes a low malt backbone. Piney, burnt orange nectar of the beer gods. My new favorite. Sadly up from New Orleans for vacation in Portsmouth and only a short while to enjoy. Get some if you can. Served in a short tulip glass at a perfect mid fifties temp. To-dye-for aroma. Made for high-IBU snobs (like me)."
"Wow, picked this over Maine Lunch in a blind tasting a few weeks ago and now am enjoying my first growler. Love the smell, not too dank not too crisp - perfect in my book. The taste is right there as well. I think this is now my second favorite brew behind Heady, it is that good! This stuff is the real deal."
"Freshly filled growler, at the brewery 4 hours ago. Nice gold pour, two finger head. Some nice sticky lacing. Smell is pretty juicy with a subtle but apparent maltiness. A little bit of bitterness In the aroma as well. Right off the bat, this mouthfeel is awesome. The only word I can think of is ""pillowy."" It's so soft and creamy, a little sticky. Just way too easy to drink. There's great flavors here. Resinous pine, some citrus rind, absolutely nothing unpleasant about this at all. There's only a small amount of bitterness at the end. Nice aftertaste for this, as well. I really love this ipa. Their pale ale is decent, but I feel this in on another level. It's so easy to drink and a ton of flavor."
On tap at cask and vine
Big thanks to BigStein88 for this wonderful surprise growler!
Served from a 500ml growler into a LA teku. 4 days old.
"Perfectly balanced IPA - exactly what I want from this style beer. Beautiful color, great mouthfeel, and the nose is full of that citrusy herbal dank Citra goodness. Taste has it all too, grapefruit, lemongrass, pineapple with a mild to medium bitterness. Sweetness is minimal but enough backbone to balance out all the glorious hoppiness going on here. This is a must have....often!"
Had at the brewery today. 
"Really great soft east coast IPA. Pours a hazy soft yellow, smell is citrus. Taste follows the nose, very drinkable. Orange, mango, pineapple with a malty back end. Excellent brew."
"Very proud to have this coming out of ATX (Austin, TX ) one of the go tos around town."
Had this from draft to go with some duck sausage served with onion and dates. Excellent combo!
My favorite IPA in Austin. I have tried IPAs from about 30 different microbreweries as well as many others from other cities and this is still my favorite.
"On tap at Torchy’s Tacos in Austin, TX."
"If you Texans have never had Other Half, this is close enough to have no need to trade for it."
"A 32oz growler fill ran me $12 at the Growler Room (Burnet) in Austin, TX."
Pours a cloudy orange yellow color with a thin foamy head. Retention is mild as is lacing. Big juicy citrus aroma. Pineapple and grapefruit very evident. Slight piney resin. Taste follows the same way. Medium bodied with low to moderate carbonation.
On tap. White head. Golden sunset orange. Lots of haze.
Delicious and fresh.
"Pours hazy orangish yellow. Short, foamy, Whitehead that Fades slowly with light lacing."
"Electric Jellyfish was the best beer I found in Austin (and in Texas as well). It is more like the New England IPAs that I like, and would give most of the more notable breweries in the tri-state area a run for their money. Reminds me of early Vermont IPAs."
"I'm spoiled with IPAs, being from New England, but this is a very good example of that style. "
"Crowler. Slight malt sweetness met by big dank hop punch, but not overly bitter. Great balance and so drinkable. Nice soft feel. Thx to Buddha for the hook upon this one!"
"Bought a couple of crowlers on an Austin road trip, had to see what the hype was about. Pour is a nice murky, medium orange hue. Super sticky lacing. Aroma is amazing, huge citrus pith, fresh oranges, grapefruit and hints of lemon. Mango, pinneapple, papaya. Spot on. Taste follows well, grapefruit stands out above the rest. Not much hop profile, straight juice. Hints of pine in the back end. Stays true to the juice. Mouthfeel is soft, but doesn't have the pillowy coating a Trillium and Tree House would have. Wow, definitely one of the best IPA's to come out of TX. Stays in its own lane, not quite 'NE style', but very close. As for TX IPA's, in the same realm as Yellow Rose."
"This is arguably one of the best IPAs in Texas. A definite rival of Yellow Rose. The last time I had an IPA this good from this corner of the US, was Ghost In The Machine. "
One of the best IPA's coming out of TX right now. Pinthouse is killing it.
L: Hazy dull orange yellow color. Looks almost like grapefruit juice. A small creamy white head and some nice large fingers of lacing.
"Hazy yellow, almost opaque. Lots of lacing."
Picked up a crowler from the South Austin location on Monday for $9.00.
"A very New England IPA, A bit pale in appearance."
"Juicy with excellent aroma. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but silky smooth finish. Very very drinkable...can't tell it's a 6.5 abv. Extremely well made beer. Rivals jai alai and yellow rose, which is good company to be in. People will be begging for this one allover the u.s. Once the cat is out of the bag."
"Juice bomb with slight haze. Reminds me of Heady Topper, but with a more bitter finish. Would drink this every day. Had on tap but this is a beer that should be canned. UPDATE: Still one of my favorite American IPAs produced in Texas, but their WTF is Juice is equally yummy."
Served in a nonic from at the Pinthouse brew pub.
"South version of Man O war from what I can tell. From that I mean it's their mainstay that they always like to have on. More sessionable, easy drinker. Nice hop aroma, light orange in color. Taste is citrus and pine, but not heavy and not too bitter."
10/1/18 can
gimme moh booze kehd. Double i guess i need.
12 oz. can. Hazy bright orange. Smells of papaya and some orange zest. Malt behind it is substantial as well. Almost smells of oats. Tastes of tangerine and some sweet melon hops. Still has almost an oaty malt flavor. A little sweet and a little toasty. Medium body. Faint bitterness. Excellent.
"This one pours a very hazy orange color, with a small foamy head and lots of lacing."
12 oz. can (!!) dated 7/23/18. Purchased at brewery 7/28/18 and poured into Carton Dubvariant glass.
"Pours with an aggressive very white head. Took a bit to wait for it to settle down. Pale yellow body and quite cloudy to pulpy OJ looking. Very nice citrus, tropical fruit hop aroma. Even a little sweet. No particular resin quality. "
Love a cloudy mysterious dense delectable IPA LIKE THIS ONEO
"Straight up pineapple flavors. Way more tropical than any ""tropical"" beer I have ever had. Personally I want a bit of orange in this to help balance the pineapple, but still very good."
"Very hazy on the pour. Decent carbonation. Mosaic hops, citrus and some hay on the nose. The taste has some really nice flavors with the hops, citrus and dry earthy tones on he finish. Feel is dry and thin on the end which was nice with the flavor combo but could use some beefing up."
"Tangerine, orange creamsicle, lemon, grapefruit juice, melon and hints of pine. Zesty. Cracker malt. Dank and delicious. Finishes fairly dry. Nice level of sweetness. Really good."
Appearance – Two finger persistent head on a very hazy deep yellow body.
Pours a hazy golden hue with brilliant white pillowy head. Bold hop forward aromas and flavors. Citrus and pineapple dominate the taste. Small floral sweetness and pleasant bitterness.
"This pours a creamy and vivid looking hazy orange, with a tight white head, and lots of lacing."
"Drank from a 22 fl oz (1 pint 6 fl oz) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA"
This brewery has recently started being distributed to MA. I am a Tree House junkie and this brewery is on that level for me.
"A - Super opaque, light orange with a shadow cast, white head, full and fat, with a light orange cast and while it fades some, it persists with a thick rocky cap, and lacing which is both thick and ropy."
Pours pale hazy orange with a beautiful white head with fair retention and lacing
22 oz. bomber that theoretically has a late December date on it that I can’t see. But I’m old. I can barely see my big print computer screen. Split with my wife. At least I hope that’s my wife. 
Thanks to Jeff for this one. 22oz. capped bomber into a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303. 
Thought this was a great variant of an all ready good beer. It is hard to go wrong with mosaic hops and the addition seemed to add some excellent flavor to the beer. Has the same ipa feel of the regular golden nugget with that good earthy kind of floral mosaic hopiness. Would buy again for sure if it came back out.
Beer has usual Golden Nugget label - date stamp indicates that it is dry hopped with mosaic. Look for date stamp to determine if beer is dry hopped o not.
"On tap at Dexter's in Madison, Wisconsin. 12oz served in a snifter glass. Pours a light hazy yellow body, orange hue, one finger white head, short retention, bits of lacing. Smells of all the mosaic goodness that SueMo had; a bit more of a citrus and pine in comparison, but it doesn't smell all that different. Flavour is more of a generic citrus and pine hop aroma, light-moderate bitterness, cereal grain, caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, fairly creamy with a light non-descript bitterness on the backend. A solid dryhopped beer, nose is improved on the base but that's about it."
"Bottled 7/22/16. Pours a hazy amber color with a big ivory head and plenty of lacing on the glass. Smell is big on this beer, I could smell it from four feet away. I get pineapple, citrus and pine on the nose. Taste is more subdued than the smell, but is a nice balance between sweet, citrusy flavors and the more bitter elements of the hops. Mouthfeel is silky smooth like nearly all TG IPAs I've had and is becoming the standard by which I judge other IPAs. Overall this is a nice take on an already good beer."
"Pours a hazy, pale yellow with a thin, white head."
"Hazy Orange, vibrant, solid white head. Piney, earthy, and floral. Tastes than it smells, same but really shine on the taste. Grassy, lighter body. Pretty good"
Serving: Bomber into snifter
"Everything that is great about golden nugget, now with mosaic...nuff said!"
"This beer pours a medium orange with a perfectly proportioned head. The aroma offers up guava, dried mango, grapefruit, pine, raspberry, and a grassy, oniony hiny. The flavor starts very tropical, with pineapple and mango, then grapefruit, guava, as well as the grassy, oniony notes I expect with mosaic/ The bitterness is present enough to combat he fruity sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is a solid beer, lots of complex and fun hop notes."
"Smell is citrus, tropical fruit - passionfruit, pineapple, sweet malt, and a hint of melon. Taste is pine, orange citrus, pineapple, and a hint of guava. A well put-together IPA but I thought I would like it more given the Mosaic hopping."
"Super Fresh it poured a clear light orange color with a nice head and lacing, smell was garden dank hops with crushed white fruit and light citrus , taste follows nose its danky with a fair amount of citrus and apple and pear , medium carbonation with just slight bitterness, an enjoyable IPA."
Golden orange color. White head. 
"Clear, light golden color, with a fluffy white head. Big pine resin nose, with a hint of tropical fruit. Taste is mostly pine and resin, with a long, lingering bitterness. Fairly dry, with very little to no malt flavor. Fairly thin body. Refreshing. Very good."
"L- Opaque amber, just enough head, decent lacing."
Can dated 10/25/18. Poured into tulip.
Had this on 2018-07-07 at their Fermataria brewery and again on 2018-08-04 from a 16oz canned on 2018-06-28.
"Really nice light IPA, crisp and refreshing, honey comes through nicely."
"Like a Focal Banger clone, except way less lighter. My favorite sweaty hops note."
"It pours hazy and with a thick three to about four fingers head. The aroma is pi ey, floral but also full of ripe fruit and sugar candy notes. Easy to drink due to the mellow yet relatively long lasting bitterness. Full mouthfeel."
"One of my favorite Tired Hands beers. Passion fruit, papaya, honey, and pine. I would buy a case of this. Great for an easy-drinking single IPA."
Poured from a can into my Tired Hands teku glass.
Look is hazy
canned 8/9/27. 
"Got this in a random trade in the Tree House parking lot; my first ever Tired Hands beer and I was mighty impressed; canned on 8/9/17, drank on 8/26/17"
Thanks goes out to larryi86 for this brew.
Can stamped 8/09/17
the honey undertones are a little too much and hard to balance out
"Pours a turbid hazy straw yellow to orange with a full frothy white head. Nose is of citrus pith and grass. Taste of honeydew melon and cantaloupe with a bit of grapefruit and orange pith/skin added in. A bit of that light grass to taste as well as faint pale malt. Then comes the raw honey. I'm not the biggest fan of honey in beer, I think it puts off a odd flavor for whatever reason and I am picking it up on this one as well but I still like the beer. Mouthfeel is fat, super creamy and thick from all those oats. Love the can art of course also."
"Most of the beers that I've had from Tired Hands have been outstanding but this one had something missing to it. I couldn't feel the oats and the odd combination of honey and grass didn't quite cut it for me. This was a smooth, slick, and sweet beer that went down *too* easily without leaving a strong impression on me and given who brewed this, I expected just a bit more!"
Very nice refreshing brew!
Can Date: 2/24/17
"Pours a foggy, murky deep peachy orange with two fingers of buttery-yellow head forming on top. Easily more head to be had if the pour was any more aggressive (started aggressive, but quickly tapered off). Lacing is great. A tasty citrus crew of orange, tangerine, and grapefruit form right at the onset of the aroma, and linger well throughout the aroma. Additional notes of raw grain and biscuit malts round out the smell. Flavor profile is peaches, orange, tangerine, with a little bit of a tart, grapefruit finish. Biscuit malts keep the hops from running amok, although the hops do remain well balanced despite their flamboyant and boisterous display of flavors. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a little bit of a watery, thin edge to it. The fullest peak of this beer has a little bit of a grainy edge, with a pleasant fullness. Overall, a flavorful IPA that drinks smooth and steady with plenty of big notes in the flavor. Hop bitterness is no where to be found. "
"Look: Pineal pours a light golden, almost straw color. A half finger of head appears up top, but quickly dissipated into the glass. The beer is certainly hazy, but not to the level of some east coast IPA. "
"Pours a nice golden yellow with a nice white foamy head that lasted a few minutes leaving a lacing as the head dissipated. Aroma is mostly citrus maybe grass and some honey too, especially as I neared to bottom of the glass. Taste is citrus and hop bitterness with a nice full medium body. Didn't pick up much taste wise from the honey. Really clean finish with not much of an aftertaste at all just some lingering bitterness. Good well balanced IPA."
Every time this beer is caned I can never get enough this it is an oat based IPA that is only topped in my opinion by tired hands oblivex an amazing doubleI IPA. I highly recommend this beer.
"Pleasant hop nose, not a huge IPA nose. Get the initial taste of oats, followed by the hop bitterness with a malty and oat finish. Surprised by the BA rating"
"Orange Juice appearance. Thin, dense head of white bubbles. Lots of honey and hops on the nose. A weird combo. No trace of oats on the nose, but the density makes it relatively evident. Big honey, biscuit malt, and hop character on the taste, albeit a bit flat. Not bad but not great."
"Looks like peach juice with a slight head. Smells of peach and orange. Taste is same with some slight bitterness. At the end, brief aftertaste of prickly citrus hops acidity. Mouthfeel is juicy but not sticky or syrupy at all. Another damn good beer from Tired Hands. Would love to do a side-by-side comparison with Alien Church."
Canned 6/28/18 (11 days ago)
"Another lovely lupulin bomb from Tired Hands. This is as delicate as you will find within the style. Luscious, soft, dry. What else can you really say about an IPA this well made? Looks like mango juice. Wildflower honey addition really puts this over the edge on the nose and in the sip. World class without question."
Poured from a 16 oz can in a Veil stemmed teku hybrid
"Hazy peach color with slightly off-white head. Aroma is milky sweet with floral hops. Taste is really hoppy but not bitter. It's fruity, floral, juicy, really nice. Medium body, quite smooth and also well carbonated. Overall it's a really good example of a New England IPA."
"Very good IPA, bitter from the simcoe."
This beer rocks. The best beer tased in 6 months. It is best had at their fermentaria
"Dark apricot/gold, smells fruity, slightly alcoholic. Taste is sweet, and soft - can definitely sense the mosaic hops, mellow sweetness, tropical, honey and biscuit on the back end. Low carbonation and light/medium body. Sticky from the oats... Very smooth, complex, good..."
Can dated 10/26/16.
B- / WORTHY
"Poured 16oz can into snifter. Whoa look out, it is lively. Cloudy dull yellow with a hue 3 finger soapy white head that will keep expanding even on a gentle pour. Soap bubble globs of lacing all over my glass. The aroma is filled with bright hops that bring grapefruit and lime peel. The flavor is packed with juicy notes of orange, grapefruit, with a tropical blend and spritz of lime. Feel is medium, very carbonated with a dry bitter finish. I really enjoy this hop combination and it is a stellar IPA."
"Hazy orange with a khaki, foamy 2-3 finger head."
L: Relatively hazy golden orange. Minimal head after aggressive pour. 
16 oz. can poured into an IPA glass. Comes in a 4-pack. Bought at a can release this summer. 
L - nice glowing darkly orange haze. A bit of radioactivity going on here! 
On tap in DC at Churchkey
"Can dated CANNED 8/24/16 into a tumbler. Pours a murky copper yellow with a finger of white variable density head that left ringed lacing. Nose has mucho pine and citrus with tropical undertones. Taste follows the nose for the most part, with perhaps more equitable amounts of tropical contributions. Finish is light, clean, nothing lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is clean, light body, easy drinking and medium carbonation. Great beer, that I'd say rivals their Alien Church as my favorite of their offerings that I've been fortunate to taste. Almost a mix of traditional West Coast flavor attribute with the NE-style of hop aromatics and mouthfeel. Loved it!"
Poured into a teku.
"L: hazy light orange, lacing white head "
Poured from a growler into a pint glass.
"evolution of the IPA in progress!!! juicy, yummy, sweet and bitter... awesome flavors, great aromas.... even the 'local' stuff in california is getting in on the action now. finally."
"A- Looks like orange juice in the glass, thick, opaque, and a hazy, bright orange. The head is thick with great retention and lacing, while being about a half inch in size. Really a pretty pour in the glass."
Wow. This is incredibly smooth. The mouthfeel is ideal and it has a nice bright hop profile. Looks great. Not much nose. The perfect amount of biscuity malt. It's hard to believe there's actually alcohol in here. Nice job on this one.
"Beautiful hazy orange with a medium head that retains a nice cap and laces the glass really well. Notes of grapefruit rind, fresh cut grass, light flowers, honey dipped grapefruit pulps and pith, and a soft husky graininess. Crisp, clean, light, super crushable and a touch dry. This IPA is a bit more bitter and in your face than I'm used to from them. I don't get tons of fruit other than a strong note of grapefruit. The honey and the oat bill manage to balance this hop onslaught ever so slightly. It's a middle of the road IPA for them but that's still fantastic."
Poured from a growler into my Tired Hands teku.
Pours a hazy golden straw color with a 2-finger fluffy white head. Leaves a good amount of sticky lacing.
On tap at Fermentaria and poured from a 16oz can with a hazy golden yellow color with a white head
"From a 16oz can purchased on release yesterday. Opaque tan/amber...cloudy as are many TH beers. Delicious citrus flavor on the nose and palate with a nice bitter IPA finish. Another excellent, hazy beer from TH."
"One of the best beers I've ever had. It's amazing how hoppy this brew is, yet it's not bitter. If you like IPAs, you must try this beer."
"Similar to Punge, although.....I found it to be slightly more juicy with notes of freshly sliced peaches, nectarine, and melon. I've had 2 different cans, and one was pretty hazy, and the other was fairly clear. Both were excellent though!"
"Wonderful IPA. Hazy and dank, there are tons of juicy citrus in this one. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and a little bit of honey. Just a little twinge of piney bitterness on the end to separate it from their pales."
"Hazy bright orange body, big tropical fruit notes on the nose and in the flavor. Very drinkable, slightly fuller bodied than some of the other TH ipas. Solid brew."
"On tap at Tired Hands Brewing Fermentaria in Ardmore, PA."
Just picked up today at brewery release. Fresh as a mofo. This reminds me of Hillfarm's double citra. This is a cloudy creamy smooth hop bomb. Can't put my finger on the back end taste I'm getting. Maybe dried fruit of some sort. No idea. Overall: I'll be trading very little of this case.
Poured from a swing top growler in to tulip glass. 
L: cloudy sunshine yellow
"This beer poured a hazy yellow. A nice 3/4 inch head that left great lacing on the glass. The aroma was very intense and had strong notes of pineapple, grapefruit and tangerine. Mouth feels was extremely rounded , which i guess comes from the use of wheat in the mash. The initial flavor is of honey bell orange and pink grapefruit. The finish is long and has notes of pineapple and fresh cut grass. The bitter piney notes are pronounced but smooth. Maybe the best IPA I have had from a PA brewery!"
"Poured out as a hazy golden brew with a creamy white head on top. The smell of the beer is fruity and hoppy. The taste of the beer is much like the nose, fruits and hops with a subtle bitterness. The feel is creamy and smooth. Overall it's another good brew from Tired Hands."
"Fruit-centered and dry-bodied, the late additions of hops give Pineal a fruit cocktail-type of medley with all its vibrant, ripe and juicy glory but without much of its ""Hawaiian Punch"" type of sweetness."
"Thanks Slatetank for sharing this growler with me. Poured into a matching Tired Hands wine glass, the brew alpears a clouded golden orange with a creamy off-white topping. The cap fades leaving patches and stringy lace."
"Thanks to tenderbranson for sharing this 2l growler with me, enjoyed chilled in a Tired Hands oversized wine glass. "

Growler is one day old. Tulip glass. 
On-tap at Tired Hands for their 1st Anniversary party.
64 oz. growler poured into a wine glass.
First had: on tap at TH
On tap at Tired Hands.
Growler poured into a tulip
Poured into a tulip. Unfiltered hazy tangerine color. Nice thick white heading with some good lacing throughout.
64 oz. growler 
4oz taster pour
Can poured into a sampling glass
L- Pours a surprisingly light colored beer that's golden with a slight carbonation visible. Three fingered head is present.
Light copper colored with a heavy amount of moderate to large sized sediment suspended within. There's a quarter inch to an inch of brown frothy foam resting on top. The aroma is of oranges and citrus hops. I'm tasting plenty of citrus hops and then some strong undercurrents of blood orange and the corresponding acidity. The mouth is dense and moderately acidic.
"Had this on tap in a nice Frosty Glass. While I don't have quite the pallet that most of you all do... I thought immediately, ""this is definitely one of my favorites coming out of Georgia."" This brew is an enjoyable experience!"
Only 2 months old but tasted stale and out of class. Not sure why rating is so high here.
"Poured into a Spiegelau tulip from a can dated sometime in April (no date on the can itself, but I know the date on the 6-pack I bought was sometime in April). Liquid is bright cloudy orange, and the pour kicks up a solid head that fades pretty quickly to a ring and a film."
Poured from a 12 OZ can into a pint glass. The appearance is a hazy golden yellow with a large white head. The aroma is fresh citrus. The taste is a mice mix of hops and oranges.
Poured from 12 oz can into Duvel tulip. No freshness date.
"12oz can, undated, assumed to be fresh, poured into a 14oz snifter glass."
I know i've been on BHB tear. Had this this last summer i cannot wait for it to come back on the shelves. great looking can. what an amazing beer. yes!
"Poured from a bomber dated 2/25, I had been wanting to try this one for awhile so didn't pay attention to the date when I grabbed it. The smell after opening the bottle was great, very citrusy. Poured a beautiful burnt orange color but was loaded with sediment, not sure if that's normal or not. Let it settle some and drank gently. Taste was grapefruit with good carbonation. I'll try a fresh one if I find one but seriously thinking about drain pouring this one due to the sediment."
"Wicked hazy rusty orange color with a stupid large head of loose bubbles and spotty lacing. This beer was a pain to pour, head built out of control. Strong aromas of hops and citrus peel. Notes of grapefruit flesh, blood orange skin, and pith. Oddly carbonated, heavy bite up front fades by the swallow but fills the mouth with citrus bursts. Interesting beer, I like the flavor but the citrus does run over the hops and the IPA character."
Burnt orange coloring to it with a hazy appearance. 
"Pours an opaque, rose/pink tinted deep gold, looking very similar to a glass of pink grapefruit juice. The pour produces 4 fingers of frothy, white, moderately lasting head that leaves an island cap & collar ring of chunky froth & a nice webby coating of clumpy lace. Aroma is hop heavy orange & grapefruit with more restrained notes of pineapple, spice & maybe a little pine which combine to beat into submission a faint (biscuit) malt hint. Taste is a hop bomb version of the nose dominated by orange & grapefruit. The tropical fruit, spice & pine are detectable behind these but are joined by a herbal hint. A sweet maltiness is certainly more detectable throughout the sip than in the nose. There is also an alcohol note in the finish that I did not detect in the nose. Sweet, fruity & juicy up front through the finish it becomes dry, bitter & lightly astringent in the aftertaste. As with other blood orange brews I definitely pick up the orange (very prominent in this case) but lack the experience to differentiate between orange and blood orange. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, starts wet & juicy with a peppery prickle in the finish, becoming dry & drawing in the aftertaste. A mouth coating hoppiness leaves a lasting dryness on the tongue. If you're looking for a mouthwatering, tasty IPA give this one a try, you will not be disappointed!"
"A: Murky burnt orange, thin off white head, good lacing"
Beer mimosa.
Appearance - The beer was dark murky orange in color.
"The beer looked much like orange juice, coming out of the can. The body was hazy in appearance, amber colored, and had a small head, barely one finger thick. The aroma was laden with orange pulp smell, with the citrus dominating the somewhat spicy hops. The taste was citric up front, with a tasty orange flavor that eventually faded to a bitter hop taste, and finished with a spicy aftertaste. The body was quite dense, and the ABV not readily apparent. A good fruit flavored beer, that is not too sweet."
Solid danky citrusy IPA with orange zest and pith flavors. Perfect balance of hops and orange. Interesting and crushable. So glad this is in cans for pool adventures.
Damn good. Delicious aroma with a taste that does not disappoint! An unexpected almost creamy mouthfeel for an IPA. Well done Burnt Hickory!
"I've had this before out of the 22oz bottle. It was maybe a month old and good, but not too memorable. This 2 day old can is amazing! Excellent use of the blood orange!"
"From a bomber bottled on 3/3. Pours cloudy with good head retention. Nice floral aroma of c-hops and hint of orange. Flavor is almost ""juicy"". The orange comes through in the finish. Bitterness is subdued, very easy drinking and refreshing. Overall impression...this beer is balanced and damn delicious. Well done BHB!"
Great beer. Definitely will have to find more of this!!
Pours orangish yellow with nice 1 inch head. Smells of slight tropical notes and orange. Taste is lightly bitter with nice tartness from the orange peel. Moderate mouth feel.
"Pours orange from a 22oz. bomber, aromas of citrus (orange, grapefruit) and a taste that blends sweet/tangy well with just a hint of hop bitterness. Very smooth, crisp, with a light/medium body. I was really surprised in a good way about this beer. And if you're unfamiliar with the band, you should drink this along to ""Hey Judester"" or ""Hornet Piñata"". Rock 'n' Roll!"
"Pours from the 22 oz bottle orangey amber, initially clear but hazing up as the yeast arrives in the glass, with a moderate head. Citrus in the nose. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
Poured from a twenty two ounce bomber bottle into an IPA glass. Piercing orange color with an explosion of citrus and orange in the nose. Intense orange flavor from the blood orange peel and a screaming hop profile to round out the citrus flavor with nice maltiness to complete this crisp India pale ale. An incredible IPA from some great people.
Excellent subtle orange flavor - nice departure from overly fruited fruit IPAs.
Smells a little citrus and hoppy great flavor orange knocks down the hops a bit really nice beer.
Excellent. Can really smell/taste the orange in this beer. A must drink.
Great IPA from GA! Reminds me of Grapefruit Sculpin ...delicious.
Really enjoyed this IPA. For the citrus IPA lovers it's a must have!
"included as an extra in a trade, no visible date on 22oz bottle, a wonderful surprise! You can tell it is orange peel due to the slight tangy bitterness. Would happily drink this beer more often on a hot summer day!"
"Burnt Hickory nailed this one with the perfect balance of hop, malt and blood orange juice. The beer reminded me of Grapefruit Sculpin substituting blood oranges for grapefruits. Super drinkable, great body, incredible aroma and outstanding flavor. Bonus for easy to read bottled on date to ensure freshness!"
My first beer by these guys; very good. The blood orange comes through as just a subtle tartness.
"Love it. Good looking, nice smelling, delicious IPA. Dig the orange on both the smell and the taste. I would put this up there with some of the best IPA going."
"Bomber into a snifter. Pours a semi-cloudy, vibrant orange with 1 finger of dense, white foam. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Big aroma - blood oranges, citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, and a hint of pine. Medium weight, and nice and creamy. Maybe just a hair lighter than I'd like on the mouthfeel, but still very nice. Sweet oranges, citrus, and a decent hop bite up front. The bitterness intensifies about middleways, and still lingers on the aftertaste. Finishes smooth and crisp, leaving behind a sweet stickiness that's played out well with the residual hop bitterness. I'm tasting a slightly stronger malt presence as it warms up."
Fantastic IPA. All around one if the best I've ever had.
"There was a lot of hype about digits. Nice lacing on the tulip, earthy at the end like Hop ranch. Thought i would like it but that orange was danky coming thru like the bottom of the barrel .ABV present at the end after swallowing it. Didnt care for it, but my friend at the growler shop really enjoyed it. I think i lean towards the grapefruit or passsion fruit side of IPAS. Might have been the malt that threw me off."
Pours a slightly clowdy orange and you can smell the orange zest from across the room almost. The smell is amazing. The hop flavor is more pronounced in the flavor with a slight orange finish. This is the best beer I've had in a very long time. I will be seeking this out again.
"Great beer for the style. Lacking slightly in the blood orange, but overall a seriously tasty ipa."
I am not a huge IPA guy but I LOVE this beer!!!!!
This was a really really solid flavored IPA
look: light orange with a foamy off white head that mostly dissipates. Slightly hazy.
"Overall, a solid and balanced IPA. I only got a hint of the citrus, but I would have liked it if that flavor was more present. ."
Burnt Hickory has done it again.
"Very good. I think a proper word to describe this is ""balanced"". The flavors mesh well. Though I was hoping for more of the blood orange flavor, it's there. :)"
"No label information. Didjits is brewed in the style of an American India Pale Ale with Blood Orange peel added. Available as a spring seasonal on draft, premiering in a packaged format for Spring 2015 in 22 oz. bottles."
"There are two batches of this beer out, the first batch had more orange than the 2nd and is more murky. Both are very good with the first batch having more orange flavor but the second one showing much more of the IPA character of the beer. My preference is for the second batch and that is what my review is on."
On tap.
"22oz bottle from Sprayberry Bottle Shop (Marietta, GA). 9.99. Bottled 3/4/15. Served in a Burnt Hickory snifter. "
"Holy cow. This beer lives up to the hype. An intense combination of hops, tart orange, and dry malt combine to make an incredible beer! Blood orange seems to be a hot adjunct in ipas right now, but this one leads the pack as far as I'm concerned."
"This was Georgia's first Blood Orange IPA! The aroma of the oranges was intense, and the taste followed perfectly. I hear it's only a seasonal release, and if that's true, I can't wait until next Spring!"
"From growler. Again another highly hyped Burnt Hickory Brewing beer. Was told by shop man that I was ""lucky"" to get this beer because it's going so fast. I can see why. Oranges and beer? It works. kinda murky but is really a fabulous combination of flavors. i can't narrow the hop down but i think the oranges play off it really well."
"Pours hazy orange color perfect, The smell is faintly of orange, citrus no real hop bitterness. The taste is amazing bright citrus, followed by a sour bite on the tongue. Sticks with you and then you get the bitterness on the back end. Mouthfeel is smooth could easily drink the whole growler in 1 sitting... I probably shouldn't but I could."
A fantastic based IPA with a ton of real blood orange added to make this thing balance well with the hops. Easily one of the top 5 IPA's in the world.
"Appearance: Delicately hazed, orange-gold body with a foamy, whitish head."
A: Light honey color and clarity with a decent white head at first that calms to a thin cap on top
