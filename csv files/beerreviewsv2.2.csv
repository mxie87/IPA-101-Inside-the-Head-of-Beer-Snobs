I was lucky enough to sample this at a festival in Boston. This is the standard by which I compare all other beers.
"Definitely a solid IPA. Extremely well balanced. Hue is orange, and taste carries hints of citrus and pineapple. Very drinkable beer at 10.5 ABV. My tasting notes are based on a keg event in Philadelphia."
The hand of god has came down to a certain individual and said make this and you will win. Nothing more to say than this is godsend. 4.75 on the nose cause nothing is perfect.
"Tasted from draft. Checking off a whale. Pours a partially cloudy gold. Aroma is piney, medicinal, floral. Moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of pine, resin, citrus, herbal and earthy. Complex and goes down super smooth. Awesome imperial ipa."
"Amazing beer, elder is better. Smooth all the way. Notes of pine and flowers (sorry not sure what kind). Taste is great along the way, needs to be served cold because the hops tend to get a little dull with warmth"
"Tried it on tap at Haven Gastropub in Orange, CA. Crystal clear gold with a slight head. Good carbonation. Taste was very hop forward with notes of citrus and pine, followed with a light malty sweetness, and ending in a boozey bite. The alcohol content definitely shines through. Overall a very good triple IPA, but I feel that the alcohol holds it back. What makes Pliny the Elder so good is the balance of flavors, which is lost in the Younger. Worth a try for sure, but if you can get either the Elder or Blind Pig regularly, you are not missing much if you don't."
Was at this years event (2018) .

"On tap at City Tap House- Logan Square in Philadelphia, PA."
A-Pours a nice clear golden color with a nice head and lacing
On tap at SD Taproom during their 11th anniversary celebration on 02/24/18.
"The color was a golden yellow, smell was citrusy with a bit of piney-ness and taste was smooth. It lacks the typical bitterness that comes as a smack to the face with triple IPAs. All-in-all, it was delicious. I liked smelling it as much as I liked tasting it."
"Stood in line, being alone jumped me up a bit. Small, bright golden pour, small, scant head. Piney, hoppy aroma, flavor blossoms with resinous hoppy bitterness, ABV comes in late with a wallop. First sip was meh, but it gets better with each one. Scratch this off the bucket list."
"A President’s day Miracle! On draft at LadyFace Alehouse, Agoura Hills, CA."
"Finally tracked it down at Tonys Darts Away in Burbank, CA. It is definitely the best IPA I've ever had, and IPA is my favorite style, so I suppose it's the best beer I've ever had."
"Finally found it. Orange gold with a fair bit of haze which surprised me. Elder certainly has no haze. Big aroma of fruit, fantastic. Fruit flavor doesn't come over in the taste as much as I was expecting more floral and Piney. Huge hoppy finish. Ridiculously smooth for a triple ipa. Most triple ipas i have had seem to throw hops in to throw hops in. This seems to have been carefully crafted for sure. All in all a huge fantastic beer and worth the hype in my opinion."
"So smooth and so intense - lupulin galore. First sip was so intense and smooth at the same time, makes your throat tingle from the obvious density of flavor and amount of ingredients going into this brew."
"So you fly in from Australia, you wait for 3 hours in a line and you wonder ... is it just hype? No!!! It exceeds all expectations- the only question that needs to be asked ... when can I get back!! Truly privileged to have experienced the younger and the elder! My first 5 on BA to the younger!!"
"2018 version at the brewery. Very smooth for the abv. Drinks like a lower abv beer but packs a lot of flavor. Piney, grapefruit, floral. Very tasty. Wish this was year round!"
"Well made and delicious. A lot of alcohol, so really packs a punch. Totally worth waiting in line, but probably not worth traveling across the country for."
"Waited in line at the brew pub for this and the experience was definitely worth it. While I would take younger over any other triple I have had to date, I wouldn’t say that I preferred it to Blind Pig or Elder for that matter."
"This is a huge triple, and there's no hiding it either. It has a big hop bite, nice bitterness, piney, a decent amount of ethanol; creamy, boozy finish that lasts and lasts."
not worth standing outside for 6 hours but delicious
Retro rating
"Was fortunate to have this At Sonoma Renaissance. As good as the best local wines maybe better , pretty potent too"
"It's been a long while since I had this beer, but the memory is fond. First and foremost, the release is fun. Russian River does a great job of creating an air of mystery and exclusivity, making this tasting a special experience."
Waited in line for a few hours for this one at a local bar. Worth the wait!
"Strong, intense, hoppy. Lives up to the hype"
"Not a fan, just never was a right combination of hops for me. Rather have a IPA from Laginitas, RIIP, or Trillium"
"Just happened to be in San Fran during the brewery release week so I made the drive up and waited in line. Was in line about 2 hours and got a seat at the bar. Its hard for a beer to live up to this much hype, but I was in no way disappointed. Its extremely hoppy yet sneaky smooth for being such a high ABV. Its like PtE but cranked up hop flavor and bitterness. I would definitely recommend. Really had a great time at the brewery and was really happy to try this bucket list beer."
First year trying younger and to me it was just a little more dry then elder. Get Ipa none the less but its way to hyped due to its limits. Had this on tap at churchills pub and grill at there bottle release party.
Lived up to the hype for sure. I am a strong advocate for this beer. Everything about it. I recommend it for sure. He whole experience is so perfect.
DUH-FREAKING-LICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Russian River Brewing Co. ""Pliny The Younger"""
Light golden color with little to know head on draught. It has a nice floral hoppy smell. Tastes crisp with a nice hoppy bitter finish with such a great balance making this beer so smooth and easy to drink that I drank two in less than an hour. Great west coast IPA and easy to see why this beer is in the top ten.
"On tap at Bru Craft & Wurst in Philadelphia and we can cross this off the old bucket list. 6 oz. pour. Should be noted they had problems getting the keg going and they had to pour into a pitcher, let the head/foam die back a bit, and then pour into snifters."
Finally able to track down this thorn in my side beer! Tons of hop aroma on the nose and on the palate but a little too west coast malty for my taste....you can almost taste the ABV....chase OVER!
Got Lucky and was on business the last day of the 2017 Younger release. 
"I'm not usually one to buy into the hype, but my local bar got a keg of this and I couldn't resist. (Thanks Hop Grenade!) Pours an orange color with a lacing of bubbles. Creamy citrus smell. Resin-y feel with a touch of carbonation. Taste is pretty much all hops, smooth citrus and pine flavors with no harshness. The impressive thing about this is that the smell and taste are all hops, but it's so smooth and less bitter even than many single IPAs. You would never know this is a 10.25% ABV either, it hides the alcohol well. Overall, it's a great beer. I'm glad I got to try it, but I don't know that I'd stand in line for hours to have it again. For my money, I think Westvleteren 8 is better."
"Thought at the time of drinking and now upon reflection of many killed IPAd that Elder was the the best, and Younger definitely stood above Elder. A step above. Since I can't give Youger more than a 5 I would give to Elder, I'll knock Elder down a bit."
On Tap at the RRBC 2/14/17
"If you live in CA, come get this beer. The hype is worth it, this is a ridiculously smooth beer and it wont disappoint your expectations."
"Had on tap at RRBC on 2/9/2017, "
"Far too drinkable at 10.25%. If you were walking through a fruit orchard that had all the best fruit trees in it, and a warm breeze blew all the scents into your nose at once, that's the smell. The taste that follows is similar, but add in notes of pine and nutmeg to go with apricot, mango, tangerine, peach, and who knows what. Smooth across the palate, and wonderful to drink"
"Superb, excellent, stupendous, OMG, any great adjectives this beer deserves. I love this and am glad I came out 1000 miles for a taste. 2 & 1/2 hours wait was all worth it. Everything good you've read....IT IS BETTER"
Wow. Simply wow
"This is an outstanding beer. Although on the East Coast, I have been lucky enough to be in the Bay Area during its limited release. I have not missed an opportunity to have one, or two or four!"
Tried this guy almost two years ago and I still remember how it tastes. That's how perfect it is.
Well what can I say that hasn't already been said. A giant among beers. Waited for three hours in rain for this damn beer and it did not dissapoint. Exceptional.
Had this in February at Blue Palms Brewhouse in Hollywood. Sad it only comes once a year. Delicious. Worth the line. Great Drinkability.
"Had 2/29/16 at The Pour House. I was the first person there for the release. I had a car full of friends drive down just for this beer. I was the first person to receive their pour, and the only person in an extremely crowded bar to receive three pours."
"Drank 3/7/16 at Monk's Cafe. Incredibly smooth. Sweet aroma. Light first taste, dry finish. I didn't expect this to live up to the hype, but it did. Truly special."
"Ooo baby. Watch this guy strut. Pliny the Younger's man-parts walk into a room and commands the attention of all the occupants a good five minutes before the man himself arrives. It snaps and yells and gets everyone to stand up in salute, looking astute and respectful as the man himself is about to enter. And the man? He himself is just a bunch of man-parts stitched together with the precision of the best cosmetic surgeon ramped up on the stress and the pressure of knowing his (or her) creation is set to be on every adult website one day. Looked at in high-definition 4k, 8k, retina display, 180-degree SBS VR technology. Gawked, ogled, eyes-gaped by thousands in the privacy of their home doing to themselves things in ways only they know they enjoy. The work has got to be perfect and indeed it is. Pliny the Younger takes no prisioners, makes no promises, and yet is promoted again and again to high legendary status. Some scoff at the hype, deeming themselves too cool for truth, banishing themselves to lesser beers deluded into thinking they still have their pride. Pliny the Younger strips these hip-types to the nude and laughs at their single excuse for a man-part. You can't even please men with those parts, he says. Your women must thirst for more every night, he goes on, waking you up at all hours in disbelief that it's over. They want more says Pliny the Younger. And when they get their heads on straight your women, he says, come to drink from one of my many abundant man-parts all stitched to me like a Picasso meets Rembrandt. And he laughs and laughs, bellowed out from deep inside, hearty and foul putting Santa on the naughty list and driving Satan to the hills of heaven. That's Pliny the Younger. And it's number 1."
"A big, hoppy, slightly boozy wallop of TIPA! It definitely stands on the shoulders of Pliny the Elder, but not by quite as much as I thought it would."
Peerless. Had a have to try this in downtown Philly at Monk's Cafe. May be my only chance. Don't pass this up if you can get it!
"After waiting 8 hours in cold, windy weather, this beer was a great end to the day. Smooth as its elder but higher in abv. Great taste and profile."
"Had in Philly back in March. We had an 8oz pour that I nursed for about 45 minutes. This was the 3rd time I had it. The taste does not live up to the hype. After sitting and warming up it became more complex and really developed into a much better beer. If I was sitting down and had to choose between the Elder, Younger, or Blind Pig - Yes I would take the younger but only because it comes out once a year. With that being said I prefer the Blind Pig"
"On tap at Monk's in Philadelphia. Had this before the hype escalated to the point of long lines or lottery tickets. Just a beer I'd seen was rated highly (but not then top 5). So, obviously, this rating comes years after the drinking, which is probably not legit, but it also mean my response was not prompted by any circusy hoopla or the allure of scarcity. I didn't even know at the time that the Younger was hard to find. I just happened to be at Monk's. So I write, belatedly to say: this beer was a revelation, an epiphany. And I think that's where much of the hype comes from, which is to say I think it's at least partially justified. The way Pliny combined maximal hops intensity without any harshness to the bitterness, the complex shifts among pine, citrus, grass, the way 10% alcohol could be so hard to detect--it's not only that I'd never had anything quite like that, but that I had never had a beer that tasted so amazing. Unlike many fine beers I have sought and had in the decade since, I remember the first sip with complete clarity and detail. So, yeah, look, nose, mouthfeel were all excellent, but the taste--from that first sip through the bottom of the second glass--was extraordinary. While there are very good IPAs of DIPAs whose ratings seem to me to be much inflated by the difficulty of snagging the beer (Heady Topper, e.g.), I don't think this is one of them."
While I believe this is better than elder I do think there is a lot of hype behind it. Not as big and juicy of a nose as one would expect and there was such an alcohol burn
"On tap at blue dog event. Had right after HF Susan and Legitimacy. I must say, I am very impressed. Yes, it’s overrated. Yes, it’s west coast. But yes, it’s awesome and worth the hype in some respects. This is the OG hop bomb. Pours a clear golden orange with a white head. Aromas of grapefruit, candies, orange, dank hops, alcohol. Taste is not crazy bitter, there is some hop flavors in there followed by some strange piney smokiness then there’s a tad of alcohol heat. I can see why this came to the top of our beloved RB list and has remained there simply out of respect. On to the next one..."
"Comes in looking a yellow with 1/4"" white head. Aroma is just massive waves of amarillo dry hopping it seems. Just massive and delicious. "
"had last years batch at obriens in san diego. about 30 people for one keg. everyone got as much as they wanted, real chill atmosphere with people enjoying the nice san diego weather."
"Good triple, Not overwhelmingly bitter or boozy. Obviously there is much hype surrounding this beer but overall it's a solid TIPA."
"I was fortunate enough to be visiting friends in the Bay area so drove myself up to RR for the first morning of release. 3 Hour Line around the block but very worth it. Easily the best IPA I have had so far. So well balanced, the fresh hop oils are my favorite part, and just an excellent mouthfeel. Very resiny but the high abv is hardly noticeable. I very much enjoyed every drop of all 3 pours."
"By far the best triple IPA I've ever had. Got two large pours at the Stone Brewery last month and this baby packs a punch but goes down like a single IPA. Definitely not boozy at all like most triple IPA's I have had. Looked great, Smelled light, Tasted Smooth and went down smooth. Great beer, not sure if I would wait in line for hours for this, but worth standing in a line for 30 minutes for sure every time."
"I went into this thinking it would be good but probably really wouldn't live up to the hype. I was wrong. While the Elder has many peers nowadays, the Younger is still elite. Pretty much what you'd expect from an IPA rated so high. Excellent taste, smell, flavor and mouth feel."
Great freaking beer! A long wait is a small price to pay for a one of a kind experience to try this beer at the brewery.
"I found myself in Philly with the family for the weekend. Serendipitously this trip coincided with some Younger tappings. Had a pleasant wait at the front of the line outside of Monk's Cafe, which was good enough to get one of the five or so seats at the front bar. 6oz pour served in a wine glass."
"This one was a 5 for me. It might be mainly because of the hype and rarity, but I absolutely loved every drop of this beer. It was clean and crisp like most west coast IPAs, but had the juiciness of a NE hopped IPA."
2016 edition.Beautiful gold with a decent head. Tropical fruit aromas with a touch of pine. Flavor is similar with a rich yet deceptively smooth feel. Perfection of balance. Cheers!
Had at Burgers n Brew in Davis. Waited 3 hours to get this - missing church ...now been 26 years since I was in church....I blame beer. Pours a typical Amber with modest head and lacing. So tropical and fruity....but so overwhelmingly smooth - hard to believe this is 10%. Such a great triple IPA. What also makes this beer better is that Mike and Chris haven't had it...which makes them inferior beer drinkers
"Pours light amber and small head. Good carbonation. Aroma isn't as pronounced as i'd like, but floral and citrus are present. Taste is incredible, citrus, floral, earthy, but so smooth for abv its hard to believe this is a Triple IPA. Smoother even than Elder IMO, malt and hops nearly perfect balance. Maybe my favorite hoppy beer."
"Vibrant golden color with thick white head. Intense aroma of mango, orange and a little peach. These continue to the taste, with little alcohol kick at end, a slight spiciness and lingering hop bitterness. Medium bodied. Amazing beer that's definitely worth trying at least once."
"All time want. Had at Saraveza, 10/10 for their handling of this, walked right in and had this peer on their patio on a beautiful Portland Spring evening..."
"So today, I got to try super-rare Pliny the Younger at Slater's 50/50 in Anaheim Hills. I'll put this into perspective: I'm a fan of Russian River's beers. Elder, Consecration and Blind Pig are among my all-time favorite beers. Do I think the Younger is worth a three-hour wait? If just for the beer itself? No. However, It was a great opportunity to socialize with other beer-lovers."
"This was my first time having the Pliny the Younger. We've all heard about how great this beer was, but many of us haven't had the chance to have one.. Some would say its not worth the lines you'd have to wait for a glass or its price. Maybe some would hate on its hype. This beer is worth all its hype! its such a light triple IPA. Nothing like any other 10% beer I've had before. Looks and smells amazing. its darker then I thought it would be. The hype is so real."
best ipa ive had smooth not bitter
"Draft at the brewpub. Pours clear orange-gold with a slender, frothy white head. The nose has a lot of piney hops, pale bread, tangerine, light grass. Medium sweet flavor with some juicy melon, tangerine, light piney bitterness, peach, alcohol. Full bodied, lightly chewy, with fine to average carbonation. Warming finish, lightly resinous, with lots of juicy citrus fruits, tangerine, some grapefruit, nips of boosty alcohol, orange, mango, mellow bitter grass and citrus rind. Well, it’s very good, and very drinkable, but there are more expressive ’imperial’ IPAs out there nowadays. Still, I can appreciate that this is juicy and drinkable stuff."
"Tried it on tap at a local event. First impression was that the aroma was lacking. Maybe it was an older keg (2-3 weeks). The taste was overly sweet, which was unheard of from Russian River's beers that tend to be balanced nicely."
really good beer just like pliny the elder just more bitter and hoppy and stronger but all that said its super smooth still. if you get a chance its a must try.
"Got some today at the taproom San Diego. Best thing I've ever seen, smelled, or tasted. Words just can't do it justice so I won't even try. Ill just say that world class is quite an understatement."
"Drank this right after the Elder. First impression was pretty good. Then I went back to the Elder and it tasted watery. Blown away by that. Ate some bread to cleanse the palate and went back to the Younger. Obviously as the score indicates it was incredible. Pine, Dank, Grapefruit, Resin all X 2. Seek it out and wait in line for an hour for this beer. You won’t be disappointed."
"Finally got to try this after all these years last weekend at Toronado. It's absolutely a great beer, but I was sure there was no way it was going to live up to the hype and I was right. It smells incredible, but I honestly thought the flavor was a little on the boozy side, and after two 7 oz glasses, I felt like I'd had enough. So glad to have tried it though, life goal fulfilled!"
2016 version.
"On tap at The Salted Pig in Riverside, CA. "
"Had the Younger on two separate occasions at the same establishment with consistent results limited to two 5oz tulip tasting glasses. Clear, light amber color with little head. Sweet vanilla, orange and papaya nose with just the slightest, slightest hint of barnyard animal aromas, but in a good way. Creamy, rounded and well balanced flavors of vanilla, citrus and tropical fruit with just the right amount of hops. Had a pint of the Elder next to the Younger for comparison purposes and I can say the Younger is no comparison. Big, big triple IPA with smooth and delicate features. Delicious!"
2016 version on tap at O'Briens San Diego.
Had the 2016 this last week at the brewery and it was the best batch yet! It made Elder taste like water to me side by side. Fabulous full bodied and incredibly balanced. If I didn't know that it was 11.25% ABV I wouldn't have had a clue......until later.
"On tap at Harry's Hofbrau in San Jose, Ca."
Lucky enough to catch the 2nd keg before it tapped out at Toronado. No wait in line made this even better than last year. It's that time of year when I stalk my social media accounts waiting to see where it may or may not get tapped. I hope to try a couple more times before this season is over. 
On tap at Toronado San Diego
On tap poured into a snifter at Falling Rock Tap House Denver.
Look-glassy Amber feel with a delicate head and a light body
"On tap at tornado, San Fransisco. For an Aussie, this feels like I've hit the holy grail."
"Waited over 4hrs to sample this almost mythical brew, I was not disappointed. Contrary to my thoughts about triple the hops, this is a very smooth beer. It had a very creamy mouth feel and a smooth follow. Worth the wait"
"Hands down best beer, waited two hours an eighteen minutes for. :)"
"Lots of tropical fruits and melon on both the aroma and palate. This beer is dangerously drinkable with low bitterness and little alcohol burn. A damn good DIPA, overall."
Super hoppy profile. Very plesent on the pallet. At 10% not overpowering. A good middle between dinner and heady topper
Had on tap at the brewery last year during the two week release. It was an exceptional beer. I'm not sure if I've ever had such a balanced beer before. Each component of the flavor profile was spot on. Well worth the nearly-six-hour wait!
I've had Younger on RRBC in 2014 and 2015. Both years have been great. The malt profile of RRBC is unique in comparison to other IPA's. Younger only builds on what Pliny is. Drinkability is great. Very hard to tell that you're drinking 10-11% abv beer. I've had the best IPA's in the world and this is still my favorite with Heady being a close second. Look forward to the 2016 batch.
Good beer it was a little boozy when I drank it opening day last year of the release however I think the elder is a better beer.
"This is unbelievable. Perfectly crafted double IPA. Just as you think they can't make Pliny better, the Younger proves to be more refined than the Elder. Imagine all positive of the Elder and none of its negative."
"Had in 2010 when I just happened to be in Santa Rosa for work. Great beer and I don't even normally like IPAs. Makes you feel funny, in a good way."
Truly one of the best beers out there
"Hate to say anything is worth the hype, let alone a 3 hour wait, but alas, it's bomb. It is."
"I feel like such an irresponsible goober for not having ever reviewed this phenomenal big ass hoppy elixir. I have had the privilege to drink both 2014 and 2015 versions and I will review it in general, based on both but realistically mainly based on the 2014 edition for it was vastly and clearly superior in every way possible way.( Even though both were 5's) maybe this years was 4.99 but whatever."
"Terrific triple IPA. Waited in line for as few hours and was able to get three glasses along with Pliny the Elder and Blind Pig. Overall was well worth the wait. The beer looked, smelled and had a very smooth chock full of flavor taste and feel. Too bad the availability is so limited."
"Stood in line back in February at Samuel Hornes in Folsom, Ca. The 2 hour wait was well worth it. Amazing IPA. Great nose, feel, and taste is incredible especially considering the 11%"
"Went to the tapping at the South Philly Taproom in Philadelphia. Full blown blizzard, everyone was out of work for the day. The line wasn't too bad, only about 30 people at 930ish for a 10am tapping (the line grew a ton in the last 10 minutes however). Pours were $10, first come first serve, keg was kicked in 19 minutes. Color was a beautiful orange-y gold, head was thin. Served (unfortunately) in a skinny taster glass so I couldn't get much in the way of the nose (or maybe it was because I waited outside forever in the freezing cold). Taste was a little dank, but with some citrus. Sticky but had a fresh bouquet of hops on the back end that balanced everything out. Was tasty and I can see what the hype is about, but I don't think I'd be willing to stand in line for more than an hr to get a pour. Definitely a bucket list/BA Top 250 experience though for anyone who hasn't tried it yet."
"A dark golden color that finishes nice. It doesn't hang on the tongue too long. Surprisingly drinkable, but still not as good as the hype."
"Pliny the Younger on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, fifteen dollars for 6.5oz, cash only for Alex's Lemonade charity. for charity, 10.5% ABV"
If not for the lines around this beer I would like it even more. There are some amazing IPAs out there without a 3 hour hype train. Maybe I wish I could just get more though.
"Had a much more unique depth of flavor than Elder did. Much fresher too, cuz obviously, it is consumed within days of release. Aroma was particularly alluring. I wouldn't wait 8 hours like some people do for it, but there's really nothing that compares in terms if IPA. I recommend you get to whatever venue it's hosting earlier than two hours before tapping, or wait in line with the other hundreds."
"Apparently, I am in the minority in preferring Pliny the Elder. Still, this is one of the best IPA's made in the U.S."
"Had this on opening day Feb 6, 2015 after waiting in line for 4.5 hrs in the pouring rain. It is a spectacular beer to have straight from the source. Although a very high abv it does not taste alcohol forward and is truly balanced with a good amount of hops on your tongue, a bit of grapefruit follow through and a floral scent. Had a great time drying off and warming up and 3 10oz pours along with some Elder and Blind Pig hit the spot. It is a special beer worth the effort."
"Had this on opening day Feb 6, 2015. Waited from 5:00 AM around 70th in line. Had 3 10oz pours. This beer definitely lived up to the hype. I've had plenty of triple IPAs and this was hands down the best. And much better than similar ABV double IPAs. The balance of malty backbone with bitter hops was perfection. 0 alcohol whatsoever. Each sip made you desperate for more. Definitely going back."
Had this in 2013. Waited in line for almost four hours and it was well worth the wait. The taste was as good or better than any beer I'd had up to then. Since then I've had beers I like more but it is certainly world class.
Hands down the greatest IPA I've ever had (twice).
Big hop aromatics are the star of the show for sure. Just a touch too sweet and syrupy for my taste. Especailly considering what it takes to get a scant 4oz pour of this beast I'll take the Elder any day of the week.
"This beer manages to do the ""look"" well - pale straw, makes you anticipate a pils if you just saw the glass but had nose plugs in. Take those nose plugs out though - big floral and citrus aromas, some pine. Once you take a swig, the taste transforms into a berry/pine marijuana flavor on the tongue. Mouth is smooth, and dry. Overall, this hop combination has likely been perfected, and better beers only occur because they approach with different combos."
An absolute amazing IPA. Lucky enough to have had this at least once. Is it better than Sculpin though?
Didn't think a beer could taste this good.
"Very good, very strong. Don't drink before your wait in line, otherwize you will be the silly person. If you are that person, it's ok. My friend James thought he was drugged, there is a limit for a reason. Also, Younger is a masterpiece of the modern style. Check out the current champ on a weeknight and you'll only have to wait a half hour or so."
Had this beer from the source at Russian River. Waited about three hours but it was well worth it. Younger is just like Elder but on steroids. This is the epitome of a west coast IPA with lots of pine but incredibly smooth! Highly enjoyed.
Great IPA. Not sure why it's in the top 10 on BA. But great
A great beer. Great floral and citrus scents. Dry finish with overall low boosiness. Great marketting makes this beer highly sought after. I have tried it three times 2015 being the best.
"The 2015 batch was significantly better than the 2014, in my opinion. In 2014 my friends and I enjoyed younger but wouldn't have put it as a top beer, however, in 2015 the experience was completely different. The floral smell at the start told us this was a different brew. It was smooth with an overall amazing taste. Hard to believe it was over 10%. By far, the best beer I've had."
1st keg at falling rock in 2015
8oz pour @ Pizza Port Carlsbad during the Younger tapping
Late review - tasted at Toronado in 2013. Blown away by mellowness of this high abv double (triple?) IPA. Hops are big but not overwhelming. Lives up to the hype.
2016 vintage
Perfection. Flavor a mile deep.
On tap 2015 in Monks in Philly. It was allright.
"Review for 2015, 2016 vintages"
"For not being an IPA fan, this Triple IPA is something that I wish you could purchase in a bottle. Tap availability only makes it taste that much better, sucks for those who do not get Russian River."
"Ok, had to find out what the hype was all about. Waited 90 minutes and was told I was a genius for going on a Tuesday. The nice thing is, Russian River only allows in as many as can be seated (none of the usual madhouse, quite civilized) and they charge the normal pricing for it (and are proud of it! Truly a labor of love!). Background: I'm not a hoppy guy. Doppelbocks, stouts, porters, ciders are where I live. This beer changed all that. Smooth, amazingly smooth with a hoppy finish at the back / center of the tongue. Not overpowering at all in taste but packs a punch at 10%. Very much worth the wait. Best beer I've ever had? Yes. Easily the best IPA. Got to enjoy seven (10 oz) glasses this year and I'll be back for more next year."
"Simply the greatest beer known to man. If you can get a chance to enjoy Younger, you need to jump on that chance right away!"
First sip at Mediterraneo Hermosa Beach annual Pliny the Younger celebration March 2015 with JT.
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft (San Francisco Beer Week)"
"FINALLY tracked this one down! 7oz pour into a tulip glass. Floral and light citrus nose. Resinous and a bit piney with some heat from the booze, but amazingly well balanced for a big 11% triple IPA. I understand the hype... this beer was very solid!"
A beer I thought I'd never get to try. 64 oz. growler poured into a snifter.
"Wait was 2 1/2 hours, weather was perfect (as usual) and we got seated right away on the patio. I got an Elder to taste side by side, and was surprised to find Elder to be a better beer in every way. And Elder isn't even the best IPA on tap every day! Still, I had a great time and probably will too. Just don't expect to have your mind blown, Younger is good but this is an over-hyped release that owes its weeks of long lines to those who suffer from FOMO."
Pony and a surprisingly assertive bitterness with herbal aroma and a persistent head. Definitely drinkable but overhyped.
"Wine glass on tap, pre purchased to avoid crowds. "
I Prefer elder... A little less intense
My number one IPA. Its a must every year now
"3/2015 on tap at the Pour House. Fantastic DIPA, but now that I've had it, I wouldn't fight crowds and drive hours to try it again..... But, I certainly wish it was easier to obtain...."
Believe the hype. This beer is great.
"Happy to finally try this whale. It was damn good, but not one I need to seek out. Perfect balance of super hoppy and nice malt backbone. Great aroma."
2014 release on tap at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach.
"Worth the wait, had it three times in one day at 3 different spots."
"Worthy of the hype...the alcohol is apparent but seems part of the overall package that is not overly anything...bitter, but not too much so....well balanced...good hop kick with fruit notes from many angles...tropical comes to mind..."
"Had this on tap at a local spot in Palo Alto during the 2 weeks younger was available. Pliny the Elder on steroids. Yes it has more alcohol, but it is beautifully balanced. very easy to drink. This has an amazing aroma and great citrus to it. Would love this to made more often."
"This and the elder side by side made the elder seem like it had no hops it in. Amazing beer. Super light body, not painfully malty like you could expect at 11% and honestly not crazy hoppy either."
Three 10oz pours at the RR Brewery in Feb/2015
A prefect 10. No 5. 10! Waiting in line for 5 hrs to try it only made it that much sweeter. Dog fish head was coors-like afterwards
Just yea
Got a chance to try this legend at the Euclid Hall's release on 02/22/15.
Finally got it. Worth it.
"It's gold, Jerry... it's gold!"
"Bigger, badder, Elder. Great beer. Worth the wait"
Easily the best triple IPA ever. Very smooth and not overpowering holiness. Can smell Pliny the younger from 5ft away. Get your hands on it. Lives up to its reputation.
oh what a beer! had 6 on tap out in the source on Saturday night! Had my 3 and my fiancee's 3 and they were so great
Sampled on tap at Small Bar - thanks to cuz for cluing me into this under the radar tapping. Pours a beautiful bright hazy mandarin color - much richer in color than Elder. The nose is huge citrus fruit and pine. Taste is citrus and juniper but drier than expected. Really interesting and complex. Crisp finish.
The hoppiness was out of this world
"The hype just got real. It was released from a few local bars and pubs that make this beer worth the effort to find . This makes it worth living in SoCal for the amount of good beer, but overall its pretty damn triple ipa. I personally don't crave ipas as my go to but having this opportunity to drink it, is a dream come true. Overall it's worth the hype. It's indescribably good, to what you imagine it would be. Balanced, tropical notes, controlled bitterness, easy to drink and so much complexity."
"Had serious doubts that this beer would live up to the hype, but it did. First few sips started off a little slow for me, but after the first ounce or so this beer was close to perfection and only got better sip after sip. Ambrosia in a glass."
Very piney..smooth and drinkable
2017 UPDATE
Best beer ever. Had the 2015 edition. Drove 9 hours to the Russian River Brew Pub and got lucky with only a 2 hour wait time on a Saturday to get in. Totally worth all the hype. So amazingly drinkable its scary. It almost hurts to say but I prefer it over Pliny The Elder.
Onot tap at Russian River 
"Finally got the chance to try PtY after being shut out in Philadelphia last year. Relocated to denver this year and fortunately there are about 10 kegs shipped here yearly! Showed up at a bar around 3:45 PM, 60 guaranteed tickets were passed out at 4pm. I was one of the lucky recipients. Sipped on victory dirtwolf and Pliny the elder while we waited.."
"Watch out it'll creep up on you! amazing beer, must try!"
"I used to live on the east coast and I've had plenty of cases of Heady Topper. Pliny the Younger is a different beer, but one that I prefer more than Heady. This beer is certainly worth the hype and four hour wait."
"Exceedingly clean, well balanced. Transparent with a light head. Definitely a bit more of a kick than PtE, though not in the nose. Its a classic and deservedly so. But dont expect quite the same overwhelming hop bomb you may find in other imperial IPAs."
"Appearance: Copper/orange in color, kind of a glowing hue to it, appearance is very similar to PtE, no head when the beer was brought to me but from what was there it looked as if it would have a really light, airy, fluffy, bubbly head to it, lacing left on the glass looks awesome, seems as if it is running down the glass instead of sticking, this beer is insanely clear, and there's just something about this beer when you look at it that a lot of time and detail went into this beer and that it will be amazing!"
"Absolute blast at Russian River this year, younger is nothing short of amazing"
Draft tap pour at Toronado SD into tulip glass
The only beer I can honestly say is worth the hype.
"Simply the best beer I've ever had, amazingly smooth just right the amount of bitterness. It feels easier to drink than the elder which surprised me, considering it has a higher alcohol content. I was worried by all the hype but it was completely justified to me due to how great it was."
"Not a huge difference from Elder. Certainly overhyped, but still great stuff."
Finally hit our city of San Diego. Had the pleasure of drinking 3 of these bad boys. Was also comparing it side by side with Pliny the Elder. Pretty amazing how RR can make the Younger taste like Elder and pack in 5% more ABV. Excellent beer!
this was by far the greatest beer I have ever tasted in my life the smell was of nothing but tropical fruits papaya pineapple passion fruit mangos some grapefruit the flavor was of the same nothing but tropical fruits and so so so smooth what an amazing beer Russian River the wait was worth it
"Had it on draft at Hamiltons....amazing, simply amazing...so smooth for a TIPA...."
Amazing beer. cool I got some only wait a little over 3 hrs with good company. Like having my mouth ran trew a forest and calling me back for more best beer ive ever had.
Great batch in 2015. You would never know it was over 10 percent as it is silky smooth.
"Two glasses at the Bistro's 15th Annual Double IPA Festival. An excellent beer, and extremely well-balanced. Great mouthfeel, like silk. That said, I think the rarity is partly responsible for such high ratings."
"Tough to say what a perfect beer is, but this is the best of its style in my experience so a 5 it is."
"A really really well made and balanced TIPA. The hype kind of ruined it for me. It was good, but there are many ""triple"" IPAs that you can get that are just as good or better. Simtra, Hoparillo, and RuinTen come to mind immediately. Younger might have been the first of its kind, but these days there's not much to separate it from the rest of the crowd. Like Elder, it showcases a similar piney/grapefruity character and honestly if I didn't know it was 10.25% I wouldn't have known. The sweet malts hint at the higher ABV but there is no booziness to it at all. I think I waited about 30 minutes to try it, and I'm glad I got to try it, but probably not worth it again."
Drinking it now at Stone Escondido for the second straight year. The hype is over the top but it really almost lives up to the hype. It's perfectly balanced and not sweet or malty despite the high ABV. And the hops aren't overpowering. Just really well done.
By far one of the best beers I have ever enjoyed. I kinda like elder better because you can drink more of it tho...
"Truly a phenomenal beer. More sticky hop flavor than the Elder, but just as drinkable. Younger had more pine/earth/spice flavors than Elder, and a bit less Simcoe tropical fruit flavor. The kicker with this beer is really the smooth low body palate cleansing drinkability combined with over the top delicious hop flavors and ABV. The only thing that keys you in to the ABV with this beer is a slight warming sensation about 5 seconds after each sip."
This beer is well worth the wait! It will not disappoint you.
on tap at pizza port solana beach 2012ish
"May not be worth standing in the rain for 12 hours, but it is a perfect example of a strong IPA. Think of Pliny the elder, but more rounded with even brighter hop profile. Beautiful nose, and extremely smooth considering the ABV. The legend may be exaggerated, but not by much."
"Lives up to the hype in every aspect, unfortunately the hype and wait makes it hard to taste for nearly everyone. The only TIPA I can consume with ease."
Do I really need to explain why this is a 5?
Best IPA I've ever tasted. I've had a lot of IPA's over the years and nothing comes close to Younger (imo) it could be my Cali bias but you can not beat the fresh hop taste of this one.
Notes from my time at the bar with Younger:
"smell: like a brighter version of elder. hops up front, giving way to more hops...residual sweetness. "
"For all the hype, this has a lot to live up to. It does! From the first hoppy quaff to the last, Younger is a great beer."
I've had this the last four years running and i think its getting a little bit duller each year
"A phenomenal beer. A little sweet, but that sweetness carefully balances the beer and the high ABV. This beer is very hyped up and very deserving of it. I'd love to sit and drink multiple in a calm setting rather than a hectic Philly bar."
Worth it.
"This is a perfect beer for IPA lovers. The Younger is to the Elder as the Elder is to Sierra Nevada. (I'm not saying Sierra Nevada is bad; RR is just in a different league.) The beer is perfectly carbonated with such a deep and complex flavor that it should by all rights be undrinkable, yet the mouth feel is so smooth and luxurious you'd think you were drinking a stout or something."
Had in a bottle at my house.. Hardee har har.. I stood in line for 6 hours on Monday Feb 17th.. Had to save my notes for this to be the 100th beer.
"After nearly four months of planning finally had the chance to do a reasonably timed "" side by side"" review vs heady. While a secretly hoped the my results would lean PiY I cam safely say heady is the superior brew. While PIY is amazing, it seems to be more of a hop bomb than heady. When compared side by side, heady to me seems to be a better planned beer. The only other drawback with PIY is the buttery feel others have reported here which I definitely experienced and found distraction. Either way two great experiences with heady taking a distinctive edge."
"I was very excited to try this beer. I may have been too excited and ended up building it up too much in my head. While this is a great beer, it is not worth the effort off waiting in long lines to try it. I actually prefer the elder more than the younger. I'm glad I tried it and obviously I recommend anyone who hasn't tried it to do so. But next year I'll stick with the elder."
"Drank at the bar at Russian River on superbowl Monday! The wait on Sunday was eight hours, Monday night I walked right in and sat at the bar."
this has been surpassed by a lot of other breweries.
Had it on tap at Tustin Brewing During the Pliny the Younger Week!
"This is the perfect imperial IPA in my opinion. It deserves a 5 for so many reasons. Perfectly balanced, great mouth feel, with that perfect TIPA kick at the end. Hop forward but nice and smooth. Perfect"
"Pliny the Younger. Oh how I've longed to try you over the years since entering the craft beer world. Finally had the opportunity to try this beer on tap at Lucky Baldwins in Old Town Pasadena earlier in February this year, side by side with PtE might I add. This beer definitely deserves its place on the BA top 250. Piney, floral, boozy, yet still retaining its balance."
This review is based on my experience about two months ago. Pliny the younger is an amped up version of the elder. It's a little bit sweeter than the elder but I think it masks the 10.25% really well. Such a great beer but I've come to expect that from Russian river.
Updates:
"this was the best beer i ever had. belive the hype. full bodied, very smooth with a high abv. creamy head on top. very hard to get. waited an hour and a half and luckily was still on tap. would definitely do it again. i have tried almost all the top beers and this definitely my favorite of them all."
"Had 2 10oz pours about a month ago at Falling Rock Tap house in Denver, CO. First time trying it, extremely smooth with the perfect balance of bitterness and floral/citrus, extremely drinkable and crisp. Beautiful rich amber color, and the smell contained everything from fresh wild flowers, to tropical fruit, to earthy. Lucky I got to have a second!"
"Been living in Santa Rosa for a while now and had heard all the hype but never gone down to Russian River to try it. Wish I had gone sooner. The Elder is great, but this is better. The first thing you notice is the color. Like liquid gold. Very thin head. Smells strongly like citrus along with pine and some tropical notes. Taste is exceptional. Not as hoppy as the elder. Great balance of hops and malt. Real thickness in flavor. Perfect amount of carbonation. Felt smooth. Overall this beer lives up to the hype."
"When I heard about Pliny The Younger, I was at my infancy stage of beer enjoyment. I had read many reviews and often thought, ""how the hell can any beer be as good as people rate this to be??!!"" So, I decided to break Vinnie's rule and enjoy this beer at a local watering hole weeks after ""it should have been enjoyed."" Well, Vinnie, I can't imagine how this wonderful contribution to the beer world could get any better, even after sitting through a coast to coast joyride, over many wonderful brew towns in this great place of freedom to brew whatever the heck you want to! All I can say is thank you. One day I will enjoy this citrine jewel in the location of its birth, until then..."
"6 ounce pour into short tulip glass, enjoyed during PtY tapping event at Side Bar in West Chester (shout out to my man, Brendan, the ever friendly bartender at this awesome establishment). PtY was not hazy, as I had anticipated, but rather clear. Slim collar and decent lacing, although both head and retention were likely compromised by nature of event (servings were pre-poured before I got to the bar rail). In any event, the nose was incredibly flamboyant/expressive, with sweet piney hops evident. In the palate, the experience was at first extremely hoppy, followed by a mango/papaya floral fruit note, and finally, a sticky piney/citrus burn."
On tap at Monk's Café in Philadelphia on 3/11/14:
"On tap at Monk's Cafe Mad Monday, 6 oz pour into a small wine glass"
"Second time having younger, this time at monks, 6 ounce pour in a goblet. Pale yellow, no head, poured ahead of time for at least 100 people. The aroma was light pine. Taste was pine, citrus and alcohol, slightly bitter. The carbonation was good, full bodied. I was very disappointed younger, all 5 of us agreed elder was a far superior brew. Younger is good, but not as good as the hype."
Poured at Monk's Mad Monday event.
This is as good as it gets! A very balanced triple IPA that is very very smooth. This is the most drinkable and delicious TIPA there is for sure. I have gone up to Russian River the past two years to get this and will continue to do so!
Had it on tap at the Escondido ale house. Waiting only about an hour with my wife and some really great craft beer strangers. Beer was truly nectar of the gods. Lived up to the hype and the experience overall made it that much better! Can not wait until next year to get my hands on another pint.
"This is my favorite beer now, just a bit better than the heady topper. This is the smoothest sweetest tasting IPA I have ever had. It doesn't even taste like alcohol. The aftertaste is second to none. I tried it twice and still cannot believe how good it is."
A: Straw yellow color. Clean filtered. 
"A: not as cloudy as Heady Topper, but a beautiful burnt amber orange with 60% opacity. Thin, fluffy head with a sea-foam look and 1-2cm rise."
"Had this beer for the first time today on tap at the Memphis Tavern in Philadelphia. I now understand what the hoopla is all about. Although my mainstay is Belgian style beers as I'm not generally a fan of hop forward beers, this creation was excellent. Look forward to more of the same from Russian River."
6 oz pours in wine glasses. Not much but at least a try.
"Appears a clear gold with thick white head that leaves tons of lacing. Nose is full of tropical aroma, citrus, grapefruit, and pine come through the strongest. Taste is expertly balanced with plenty of piney hops. To a of apricot and grapefruit throughout with bitter undertones. Mouthfeel is surprisngly light and had a slightly creamy feel. This is truly well balanced and the alcohol is nearly undetectable. Very good!"
"On tap at pour house sacto, ca..looks a clear 24k, vibrant tiny bubbles from the bottom of the tulip glass, lots of micro bubble action..smell is pine, apricot, and white grape, some sweet fruit juice as well. Taste is exactly as the smell suggest, pine, bitter-floral hop profile, very smooth and tasty..nice punch of hops without the lingering resinous sticky feeling of beers in this same style...mouthfeel is perfect, light creamy carbonation, with slight micro bubble action on the front of the tongue which smooths out quickly on the palate.. overall a well executed and dialed in iiipa. Food paring is: savory and mild- spicy foods, suxh as indian food, lamb lollipops with basil or mint sauce, or some heavily salted/seasoned nuts."
"Had on tap @ Final Gravity in Roseville, CA"
"well, I finally got to try it. bought the raffle tickets at Beachwood BBQ so didn't have to wait in the line. $40 in raffle tickets produced one pint=a deal better than waiting in that long line and with the weather lately, that works."
Scored 8oz pour on tap at Crow Bar 2014 release.
Got to try the beer at a local restaurant that got a couple kegs of it. 10 oz pour.
"The younger... What can I say this beer lives up the the hype. I've never had a triple IPA that was this clean. I had it on 2/24/2014 so it's my first dive in. I had to wait in a long line and take the afternoon off work to try this beer. Let me just say it was worth it. If you can get your hands on it, do. If not you can always stumble upon the elder also a great beer and is close to the taste of the younger."
Served on tap into a goblet.
"Perfectly clear, small to hardly any head by the time it gets to the table."
From notes on 3 pours yesterday at Falling Rock side-by-side with Elder on tap
On tap at Falling Rock on 2/22 (and again at Backcountry on 2/23)
"Had this beer at a keg tap at toronado in san Diego. Three glasses down and I was feeling a really good buzz. Waited an hour and a half to get it with two extra glasses on top. Totally worth it. The mouthfeel is so intense, it goes down like a creamy citrus sparkly firework. The taste is very similar to pliny the elder with a lot more mouthfeel and even smoother which is odd but I'll take it! Had a great time waiting in line and drinking with the people I met in line. Totally worth it. It's the experience coupled with great beer that just makes it all come together for a hell of a time. Any true beer fan should aspire to taste this beer. Til next year, cheers!"
"The holy grail of beer right? Well, no, not really. Sure it's a more hopped up version of Pliny the Younger, but it honestly does away with the biggest strength that Pliny The Elder has and that is balance. I found Pliny The Younger to be too much. I much prefer Pliny the Elder to Pliny the Younger and find no need to search this out again, though the party was fun :)"
"I really enjoyed this beer. Worth waiting 8 hours? Probably not. But what beer is worth 8 hours? Overhyped? Not by a long shot. Russian River really put a ton of work into this beer and it shows. The smell was incredible; intense grapefruit which I love. This beer is 10% but is not boozy what-so-ever. In fact, almost no alcohol taste and very easy to drink. I think everyone owes it themselves to at least experience this beer once."
"On tap at Falling Rock, February 22. 10.25% ABV"
"On tap at Toronado (SF). This beer is awesome. I could dock random 1/4 points, but for the style, it doesn't get any better. This pours a medium orange color that is surprisingly see through. The smell is juicy citrus fruit with a light sweetness. The taste is lots of strong citrus fruit. It's bitter, but at the same time balanced by the sweetness from all the malt. There is virtually no alcohol presence, which is quite a feat for an 11% beer. This beer is incredibly drinkable and perfectly balanced. Far and away my favorite TIPA."
"I've been about the hype for two years now...learning about the Younger releases last year and missing my opportunities. After striking out twice already this year, my opportunity came this morning (2/22/14). After the hours of driving, parking, waiting, holding in a coffee dump, waiting, making small talk, waiting, finding a quick spot for said coffee dump, waiting, taking pictures, waiting, and more waiting....my snifter was poured and the deliciousness was before me. "

Had this on tap in SF at Toronado. $6 for what looked to be an 8oz pour. 
"Being from Sonoma County, I figured it was time to brave the lines for this reported ""World Class"" beer. I am not a fan of IPAs by any means, but felt I had to try PtY at least once in my life. I really was hoping the 2.5 hour wait would be worth it."
2/14/14
"I'm a IPA guy, but my taste buds are over-loaded from the alcohol on the triple IPA's. "
"This treat was being served on Valentines day at a local bar in Danville, CA. 2 full kegs tapped out in 43 Mins. Once again, this beer did not disappoint. A full-bodied brew with a powerful hop aroma and lingering taste. It is the perfect example of a triple IPA. Incredibly smooth. Incredibly strong. Memorable flavor."
"On tap at Bobby G's Pizzeria in Berkeley, CA."
On tap at Toronado
1st BA review. Go big or go home I suppose.
"Served from a tap in San Francisco during the launch week. Pours just like any other IPA of it's style; Crisp, golden and clear. A sniff brings about a lot of similar notes as Pliny the Elder, but I get a lot less pine and more of that malty sweetness on the head, especially as the beer warms. Citrus, a subtle grapefruit and some bitters all present. The taste, like the Elder, stay true to it's smell, and the abundant hop character comes right out at the front, with a consistent, malty undertone that slowly takes the focus as it goes down, leaving a very palatable taste in your mouth. This beer hides its alcohol just as good as any I've had. It really gets lost in the sweetness from the malt, and I wouldn't have pegged it as a &gt;10% beer if I wasn't already aware that it was. The style of hops that are used really compliment the malt well, so there isn't a flavor that dominates the taste of this beer. It's smooth and the tiniest bit more creamy than a usual IPA. This beer really has the same taste as the Elder, but with a sweeter backing to balance well with the additional hops. Not as malty as a 120-minute, but not an overloaded hop-bomb either. You can tell it has been meticulously balanced."
"Been. Long time since I logged in, wanted to hate it but its worth reviewing. Had it at Marriott SF drank 6 10oz pours trying it for my first time. Absolute pure clarity on that yellow gold with a finger of foam. Smashing citrus and pine in your face almost a bit of resin, literally I cracked a smile. Drying but not cloying at all. With rich citrus and forest maybe apricots and a deep bitterness that was clean no sweetness. One dimensional but pure perfection not a pliny fan but fing amazing for what it is at that abv."
"Came to Santa Rosa for the PtY release, waited in line for six hours in the rain, and this was worth it."
A: Hazy orange with a white head.
Had this last year at Haven Gastropub in Orange. Was alittle skeptical at first when I had to wait 2 hours but it was well worth it!
"Long live the ""Younger"". This double IPA is as smooth as good as it gets. The hops give this beer a refreshing taste. I didnt think the Elder could be duplicated, but this beer is a refined elder. The bitterness is perfect in this beer. Unfortunately unless you live by the brewery its pretty hard to get more than a pint or two in February. This beer should be tasted by all."
I have enjoyed this beer at RR and the Bistro in Hayward. It is big bold and awesome.
"Had this beer in Folsom CA, and it did not disappoint. They don't sell this in my neck of the woods, so it was great that it lived up to the hype when I actually got to try it. "
A: Filtered deep golden beer with frothy head.
"Better than Pliny the Elder, but very hard to get. "
"On tap at Uber, 2012. "
"Stood in line for 3 hours, got my ticket, and had this at my home brewery...Tustin Brewing Company."
"This beer is one of the few that is worth the hype. Had it on a sample flight that included Row-two, Blind Pig, The Elder, and The Younger: all exceptional beers, but the Younger sort of blew them away compared side to side."
"The release of the Younger the last two years was fun; waiting in line with good friends, bars having special food and ""IPA tap takeover."" That was the highlights though, the Younger is good but I wouldnt wait for it alone especially at 6$ for 4oz's. "
"I had this beer about a dozen times in February and twice in March. I write this review now from notes I had written on my notepad app in my phone. I think this review deserves the complete journey I took from La Habra to Santa Rosa on a chilly evening in February. I drove seven and a half hours to get to Russian River and arrived a bit past 10:30pm. My girlfriend and I ordered a couple glasses of Pliny the Younger. What I saw was a small glass with a clear, obviously filtered, golden beer and a nice head. The aroma was enticing to me, not so much my girlfriend. ""It smells like pine cones!"" She was not a beer enthusiast like me but I agreed with her- ""It also smells like citrus and in very good balance. Not one more than the other."" So we drank. Poof! Like a memory it was there and it was gone- it vanished, it evaporated. It was so easy to drink I had to keep the second gulp in my mouth, swish it around and chew it a bit to get the complete experience. I was dumbfounded. ""Isn't this supposed to be nearly 12%?"" I asked my girlfriend. By this time she was done and ordered another. This was a woman that barely got the hang of Leinenkugel not two months before. As I watched her drink it, swish it around and chew a few times (like I told her to) she would close her eyes and ""Mmmm! This is SO good."" This was probably the fifth or sixth kind of beer she has ever tried. The aggressive amounts of ABV with the intense aroma and smooth flavor and the subtlety by which the flavors develop in your mouth which is such a rich dynamic from a hop punch in front to a sweet tang of citrus to the back which completely masks the amount of alcohol in addition to being filtered- this beer is quite frankly dangerously delicious and I can't wait for my next journey in February!"
"I had some at the brewery and liked it so much that I tracked it down at a couple places in San Diego (Hamilton's Tavern, SD TapRoom)."
This beer definitely lives up to the legend. 
"Great brew, I wish it was bottled and year round. It taste like a concentrated glass of grapefruit and pine. I've had heady topper, and I know this would rank higher if it were more readily available outside of California. I also think that this blows heady topper out if the water."
Sampled at the pub several times in 2011 & 2012
World Class Beer. I wish there wasn't so much hype around this beer because I really hate waiting in line to drink. I'm lucky enough to live really close to some of the best craft beer bars in the San Francisco Bay Area and there's always some place that has a keg once released. 
"This is a beer which, like so many of us beer nerds, I've wanted to try for a long, long time. I am a huge hophead, so this was a nice treat for me. Had this yesterday on tap at Varga bar in Philly for the black tie event. I managed to grab two 6 oz pours so I got a pretty good idea of this beer."
"First and foremost I just want to say that I did not intend to get drunk off younger but the opportunity to have as many glasses as I wished drove me to have my fill of it. And for the first time trying it, it was no less then amazing. "
I was lucky enough to get two glasses this year.
Can I say anything more about this beer than has already been published? Sat next to Vinnie during the day we were there. He mentioned he thought it was the best batch so far. I agree. My fourth year attending and it was definitely the best. A good friend is a photographer for the Santa Rosa Press Democratn who has done dozens of stories about Vinnie and his beer. Even HE said it was the best batch ever.
Stood in line at Sidecar in Philly for a couple hours to get a pour of this. Was very much worth it.
I don't know if this is the 'world's best beer'. But it is the best I have ever tasted. Hands-down.
"After such a long quest for some PtY, I was finally able to imbibe on some of this goodness at the Bishop's Collar in Philadelphia a couple weeks ago. Poured into a 4oz sampler glass (had two thanks to my wife who doesn't drink beer) - Poured beautiful clear golden with an one-finger super white head with beautiful lacing that lasted very well throughout. The intense aroma was full of citrus and floral hops along with pine. PtY had the perfect blend of hops in the nose that work very well with each other. The taste sweeter and maltier than I expected, possibly to better balance out the loads of hops this beer has. This was by far better than Pliny the Elder - by a mile. Full of grapefruit and sweet like honey. The finish has a nice citrus and resiny note on the end as well. Mouthfeel had a perfect balance with lively carbonation lasting throughout the (obviously very short) drinking session. It really brought out the smoothness and balance between the malts and hops on the tongue without the bringing out the bitterness like I thought it would have due to the Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder, so this was a pleasant surprise! This beer was perfectly balanced all-around. It is truly such a shame that this beer is ""very expensive and difficult to make under tight space limits"" according to Russian River because this would have been the go-to IPA in many beer circles. Would love to try this again in the near future!"
"Was abosolutely thrilled to get this beer on draft at the Bishops collar in Philly. Unfortunately they only ended up giving out % oz samples. Still great to try. Nose is Elder on steroids more pine, more tropical. As perfect a mouthfeel as I've had from an IPA. Taste is sublime. Amazingly balanced between bitter hops and biscuit y malt. hope to get a full glass soon."
"Poured on tap at Monk's Cafe into a wine glass for the charity event Alex's Lemonade stand. 2 1/2 hours of waiting in line, good chats, and good crowded insane times! "
"This was released this morning at my local bottle shop. It was released at eleven am, I was the eleventh person in line, the beer is eleven percent abv, and it was gone in eleven minutes.... crazy."
8oz pour at the Hulmeville Inn.
At the bar on my phone so won't make this too long
"This Beer IS AWESOME. I wont go into all my tasting notes because there are tons already. The only reason I give it a sub perfect score is because the hype does not meet the beer in my opinion. Its a bigger version of Elder. But many beers are equally enjoyable to me. Great beer, must try, should be WAY more available."
On tap @ Wildwood last night. 8 oz pour.
Served in a tulip glass.
"I had this beer on tap in a 12 oz glass at Bailey's Taproom in Portland. I must say, it lives up to the hype. I believe this keg was 10.5% ABV but it was not too hoppy to enjoy even with the high alcohol content. It has a beautiful translucent golden color and goes down extremely smoothly."
Had during SF beer week at Bobby G's in Berkeley CA. Had with a PtE side by side. 
On tap at TJ's in Paoli. Poured into a 10oz snifter glass. 
Served in a tulip glass.
First pour into my glass at Boulder Strong Ale Festival at Avery Brewing
"Decided to fight the crowds & try me some Younger on tap at Local 44. $8 for a tulip glass. Nice white head delivered upon the pour. Crystal clear gold color. Amazing considering how much hops go into it. Smells of dank hop resin. Attractive lemon rind & notes of melon, mango, orange zest, and some vanilla. Tastes amazing. All the hop characters in the nose in the flavor. Nice firm bitterness. Not pungent or astringent. Dangerously drinkable. Alcohol doesn't seem noticeable except I can tell it's there since I haven't eaten lunch yet. (This is my lunch.). Dry tasting. I love this beer. So glad I decided to come out for it. Only reason I didn't score this a perfect score is due to the extremely limited availability. "
"A: Beautiful, deep golden IPA appearance with a tiny strip of white head. Had it in a 5-ounce sampler at Capone's in Norristown, Pa."
A: viscous looking IPA with some small white head on top
8oz pour at Wildwood
On tap at the Cheeky Monk into a tulip-style glass.
Fortunate to be in Denver at the Cheeky Monk for a tapping. 
"I'm a fan of Russian River, and Pliny the Elder is amazing, but I've always had even more love for their sours,. But I HAD to try the Younger, so we decided on a whim to drive from Sacramento to Santa Rosa on day 2 of the Younger's release. We got in line at 4:45, and were finally drinking the Younger around 9:45. They were out by 10:30. Apparently, some had waited seven or eight hours before us. Three weeks later, I managed to try it again in Sacramento at the Pour House. We got there forty minutes early and it sold out in twenty minutes."
Appearance – Nice golden color. Minimal head on my pour. 
Amazing beer. This year is better than 2012. Also incredible to taste this side by side with Pliny the Elder and seeing how much better it tastes given that Elder is a great beer as well.
Serving Type: On-tap at Breakwater Brewery poured into a half pint glass.
"First of all I just wanted to say I am not one of these guys who went to beer college and pretends to know anything about beer. I know what I like and I know that Russian River has a huge hype behind them...But its the real deal. Pliny the Younger has been on my radar for a long time and finally got a chance to get a taste this past weekend at Harrys Hofbrau. It did NOT disappoint. From the second I got the beer in my hand(4oz pour) I swirled it around in my glass for what seemed like 10 minutes smelling the hell out of it. I wanted to stick it up my nose and breathe it in forever...It was refreshing. Its definitely got a huge scent and taste of grape fruit. Super smooth, much more than the Elder but amazing. Well worth the wait in line and wish it wasnt so hard to get...But I see why it is. If this beer isnt on your bucket list revise that list today! Cheers"
"Smells strong but with a light citrus note, overall smells fantastic. Pours very light but golden with a very small hint of orange, relatively small head. Initial taste is dominated by bitterness but rounds out with a small amount of citrus, finishes pretty dry. Doesn't scorch your tongue with bitterness. Virtually no alcohol character which is impressive considering the %age. Overall it's the epitome of a triple IPA, a dominate hop bitterness flavor that is balanced nicely and allows you to drink more without any problem."
"Tasted on February 16, 2013 (a 45oz. pour at Harry's Hofbrau in Redwood City):"
An in depth review is not necessary. Attending a sometimes hectic tapping of this brew is worth it. Also: I see alot of people having the Elder immediately preceding the Younger. I suggest enjoying something light and easy drinking while waiting for your pour of the Younger. The pallate is able to taste the beer more intensely.
"I could not drink Pliny the Younger without having the Elder right next to it. The major difference is the bite at the end and the mouthfeel. When you drink Pliny the Elder you get alot of hopps and pine from the front to the back of your mouth and when you drink the Younger you get a crisp strong pine with a hoppy flavor in the back of your mouth. With that being said, I don't think you would notice the difference if you were pounding and had them on separate occasions. "
"On tap at Russian River 1 week after release (Feb 8, 2013). This was a real treat to sit down and take my first sip after traveling from NH for this and SF beer week, etc. The weather, setting (love RR brewpub), and atmosphere were perfect. Having tried all of the top IPAs/DIPAS except this one, I had to confront the Younger."
"Sometimes you just luck out. With a business trip to SFO for Feb 18th it looked like I was out of luck. Saturday night I was trying to make dinner reservations for Sunday night, but the restaurant was fully booked. So I went online to look up Rosmunde's and on the front page it said they were tapping their keg at 5pm on Sunday. Had to standby for an earlier flight on Sunday but arrived at 4:30pm with about 25 people in line. And the best part is that 30 minutes later there was no line for the 2nd."
"Well, had to travel to Cali for it once and for all. First day tapping at RR on February 1st, 2013. "
I might be one of the few who at least from the 2013 batch of PTE think that it wasn't as good as other beers that I have had. The beer reminded me of a apple or cider after taste. It wasn't as hoppy as I personally would like and it's very smooth. Reminds me of a cross of Apple Cider and Chardonnay and an IPA. 
Had at hollingsheads deli in orange. Big shot out to everyone at hollingsheads for putting on such a world class event.
"A--Pours a beautiful golden orange with a healthy head and impressive lacing. I drank it third in a flight of Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder, and Pliny the Younger, and it retained the head admirably while awaiting its turn (not very long, admittedly)."
"ranked one of the best beers in the world for a reason. this is one ive been dying to try for a long time and finally got the chance. followed the falling rock taphouse on twitter anxiously waiting the announcement and finally it came. tapping at 1pm, doors opening at 11am, I was in line by 9:30. had to play it safe. turned out to be a beautiful day of chatting and sharing beers with some great new friends. the beer itself was a joy, worth all the wait and anticipation. it came out in a tulip looking as radiant as a bar of gold, maybe with a slight orangey tint to it, and a couple fingers of pure white lacey head that leaves sticky tracks on the side of the glass as it sips. the nose is fabulous, rich in high alpha hop varietals mostly of the citrus persuasion. grapefruit rind, tangerine, and sweet lemon are apparent, and a bright ale yeast contributes some depth. it smells extraordinarily fresh and decadent, sure to be a treat. the taste is shocking. that first sip was just divine. I let it sit in my mouth for about a minute, just letting it soak in. huge floral and citrus hop notes. some bready body from the yeast, but holy cow the texture of this is what surprised me the most. its not sweet and viscous like so many American big IPAs. its light on the tongue and very clean in the finish. its bitter, but it isn't a blinder in that regard. its sweet, but it isn't sappy or sugary or thick. I think the mouthfeel allows for the flavors of this beer to develop perfectly, without making it unnecessarily weighty or sticky. that element was just so pleasing. when the waitress came around offering up seconds, I shot my hand into the air faster than ive done basically anything in the last ten years. the first sip of that one surprised me too, because it was cold again. I hadn't realized how much this beer opens up with temperature. the great blossoming. theres just so much hop going on here, very west coast, very very fresh. I am not sure from a brewing standpoint what makes this so special, and why other brewers cant offer stuff like this up on a year round bases. it has a similar hop profile to the stone enjoy by series, but trumps it by miles. the pliny the elder could easily be my every day drink, but so could this. it really doesn't seem as alcoholic as it is, totally masked. wow. I really appreciate the opportunity to enjoy this, and would like to thank the people of falling rock and the crew at my table for this event. what a beer, what a good time! cant wait for next year! worth they hype and then some!"
"What to say? This is the best beer I've ever tasted - and boy, have I tasted a few good ones."
Had to get to Toronado at 11:30 AM to try this beast.
Had on draft at RRBC last Friday. Served on-draft and into a 10oz Nonic tumbler.
"Excellent flavor. On tap at First Street Alehouse in Livermore. One 10oz glass. Reminds of Elder but more citrus (orange vs Elder's grapefruit.) Sweeter than Elder, with more fruit flavor. A very likable brew, the favors are intense. A bit much on the carbonation."
Very hoppy and bitter brew! My first thoughts were Sierra Nevada Hoptimum meets Pliny the Elder. It's great to do the side by side comparison of the Elder and the Younger if you can. 
"Yeah buddy! Raul did it! Out of tha tap straight from ma's teet! - Russian River, itself."
EDIT 2/10/13: Just as good as before.
Pliny the Younger is an incredible beer. I waited in line for 4 hours to taste the Younger. The place was a madhouse. 
"On tap at Russian River Pliny opening day (5 1/2 hr wait, yes FIVE Hrs and 30 min wait) reviewed from notes on February 1st 2013"
Served in a 10 ounce glasses at the brewery. From notes. Reviewed 5 February 2013. Released 1 February 2013.
"Went to Russian River Brewery yesterday to get me some Younger. We parked out back and didn't see much of a line. After walking up to the bouncer, I found out the back door entrance is for folks purchasing growlers only, who could come in and get anything they want to go, for the exception of a pour of Younger. Once we walked around the front, we saw the liny for the pliny which took us 3 hours to get through. As we waited, we decided we've came too far to turn back now, but this will be a one-time thing waiting in line this long for some beer. Once we got in though, holy smokes. Pliny the Younger did NOT disappoint. Less hoppy and much smoother than Elder, it was absolutely the best 10% beer I've ever tasted. Like everyone said, lots of grapefruit...simply amazing."
"Waited in line a little over an hour at the brewery to enter the all-you-can-drink Pliny the Younger outing today! Hell yeah! Poured into a 10oz pint glass on tap. Served with delicious pizza made by the fellows at Russian River, who use their own beer batter for the dough. Does Pliny the Younger hold up? Oh, yes. Yes it does."
"No beer is perfect...except perhaps this one. I sat down to my first glass yesterday at the brewery in Santa Rosa and was prepared to be underwhelmed. I mean the hype alone, it just couldn’t be that good. Well, it’s that good. I am a sour/wild ale kinda guy but the grace and structure of this highly crafted brew seduced me to the hop side. After the first glass and a slice of pizza I was really enjoying life...I mean at a whopping 10% ABV, whoa! 2 glass limit for me. Is it my new favorite? No. But I will never forget it and will make it a point to stand in line again next year to get a couple glasses of perfection in a glass."
"After missing my chance at this brew last year and the year before, I finally committed to making a trip to the source. I waited in line exactly seven hours to get in."
"First day on tap. Got in line at 8.30 and finally got in a little before noon. The place was absolutely mobbed with people so these notes from my phone are a bit squabbled. Needless to say, expectations are through the roof"
After 3000 miles traveled. After 4 hours waiting in line. I finally try The Younger.
You had this beer. 
"On tap at brewery, February 2012"
A - liquid gold
"Really late on posting this. Notes are from February. Had it on tap at Surly Goat, Father's Office, Tony's Darts and Churchill's Pub within a few weeks of each other. "
"One of my bf's favorites, i heard so much about this beer and heard also that it was not sold much and that it would not be in stock much longer, so of course i had to have some. I'm not usually into this heavy of a beer, but boy was i shocked to taste it and want more. Yummm! Boys sure do have a set of extra taste buds just for beer! I'm glad my bf is such an advocate otherwise i'd be missing out on a lot!"
"Appearance is clear, light amber in color, with a thin white head that leaves minimal lacing around the glass. Aroma is bursting with grapefruit and hops, with notes of sweet honey, caramel & fruit. Taste is sweet caramel malt upfront, mildly piney in the mid-palate, with a slightly bitter hop finish. Not too hoppy though. Very rich & well balanced. Mouthfeel is light in body, smooth, & again slightly bitter in the finish. Overall, is it the best Imperial IPA in the world? That’s subjective; I see how people could think so. I think it’s pretty damn good, but I tried it in a blind tasting among other DIPA’s, and it certainly wasn’t my favorite. The hype plays a lot into this. Still, extremely glad I got to try this!"
"From notes: Sampled at EBF 2010. Pours a murky pale golden color with a stingy off white head that dissipates quickly. Wonderfully complex hop aroma, lots of citrus grapefruit and orange being in the forefront. The flavor is big with lots of caramel offset with plenty of hop flavor mostly of the peach/grapefruit/orange vein. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Very nice big IPA that I waited much to long in line to taste. I’m glad I got to try this its a great beer, but I think I prefer the elder."
"Luckily the wait wasn't to bad (about 30 mins) from there you walk in, hand them your money, and collect your long stemmed half pour. Crystal clear Golden orange color was very nice.. Head had faded by the time we collected ours. Aroma was very sweet, piney, and full of juicy citrus. Taste is amazingly balanced.. citrus, pine, slightly bready, sweet, and smooth. Really great IPA but i wouldn't say its the best i've had by any means."
"I waited four hours in a line outside Russian River Brewery to get in to taste this beer, and I have to say, it really is that good. "
Enjoyed at Capone's with IrishColonial on March 3rd. Reviewed from notes.
The benchmark of all beers as far as I'm concerned. 
On tap at Capone's and Monk's Cafe. Served in a mini snifter and a wine glass respectively.
"This beer tasted amazing. It had a very orange/golden tinge to the appearance and was very much hop driven. If you enjoy strong hop beers and like the taste of citrus fruits, I would highly recommend this to you. I have tasted a similar beer from Russian River - Pliny the Elder. The Elder is much more drinkable than this beer. The Younger is very alcoholic and not a beer for every day casual drinking. If you are looking for high quality Imperial IPA - try locating this beer...if you can."
Had it out of a growler at Bierstube in Philly. 
"I was in Santa Rosa a week after Pliny the Younger was tapped. I knew I wasn't going to get PTY at Russian River or anywhere else for that matter, or so I thought. After spending the day in San Francisco we made a stop at Beer Revolution in Oakland. As we ordered our beers we were told that PTY was on tap. I couldn't believe I was actually drinking this beer. WOW! Knowing the chance of never having it again I savored every drop. The aroma and taste of the hops were unbelievable. One of my top three beers."
"on tap after a 5 hour wait. Pour is a clear golden orange with a tight white head. The nose is light for the size, heaviest on citrus with notes of pine and hop resign."
"Aroma is simply amazing. Totally my type of hops. Lots of grapefruit, citrus, orange and tropical fruits. What an amazing aroma. Flavor is awesome. A wonderful beer experience. Grapefruit, citrus, mango and a hint of pine hops. Smooth and sweet. As much hops that are here it is not overpowering. Very well balanced. Delicious."
Finally got to try after waiting for 3 years! On-tap at Capone's 3/3.
"Reviewed from notes, enjoyed in early March in Philadelphia."
Finally had my first pour of this delicious beer at the Vine Street Pub in Denver back on March 1. It took all of 11 minutes to blow through the 1/6 barrel and the staff there handled it very well - they were awesome.
I was lucky enough to stumble across this while in the Philadelphia area to spend time with my wife’s family. I had it at the Blue Dog Tavern in Chalfont at an awesome event that was not too crowded even.
"I am privileged to live within driving distance to RR brewery. Luckily my dad doesn't like hoppy beers, so he drove. Went last year on a weekday and had a great experience. This year I went on a Sunday so we got there a little early because we expected a line. By the time it opened there were probably over 300 people in line. I had 4 glasses and had a great time once again. I also had it a few weeks later at Tazzina Bistro in Woodland, CA. Each of my beers were 10oz pours."
Reviewing from notes (not that I need them) from two 10oz drafts enjoyed at the RR Brewery itself. 
Had 2 at Craft Ale House. 
On tap at the Hulmeville Inn 3/20/2012
"On tap at the Jose Pistolas in Philly, poured into a pint glass. "
"Thanks to Monk's for giving me a chance to give this a try. 4-5oz pour, out of a wine glass."
Special thanks to Paul for getting a ticket and sharing his pour.
"Well... It took a few years to get it but I finally did and I'm honestly glad that I did. Not only was I able to have the Younger but I had the Elder to pair with which was perfect. This beer poured out as a really nice looking golden copper color with a thin white head on top. The lacing isn't too sticky on this which I was surprised. The smell of the beer is loaded up with tropical fruits, pine and other forms of hop aromas. There isn't much in the way of malt coming off this bad boy on the nose. The taste of this beer is big. It's much easier to taste the massive different between the Younger & Elder when having them side by side. Younger lingers on the tongue for a very extended amount of time which keeps the beer in the glass for a longer period of time (which I personally enjoy). The flavors of pine and tingling hop flavors just cut into your taste buds leaving you with cotton mouth almost immediately after the first sip. The mouthfeel of this beer is a bit heavier than the Elder. It's little bit more oily too. Overall this beer is something that I'm proud to say that I got to try finally. I'm even more glad that I compare the two with each other. I can see now why people like the Elder better than the Younger simply based on the drinkablity. The younger is something that needs to be enjoyed over a good amount of time where the Elder is more session-able even though it's not. I wouldn't decline either Pliny on any day, I enjoy both beer a lot and I look forward to the next time I get to have this beer again."
"I was in San Diego for a conference and I dragged my wife to Toronado's for valentine's day. (she doesn't really like beer). The place was packed and I noticed everyone was drinking the same thing. I saw the Pliny the Younger tap and laughed a little to my wife about it. The bartender said it was no joke, they had it unadvertised. Talk about serendipity!!!! We drank it from wine glasses. (yes, even my non beer drinking spouse liked this one!). It did not have a head. The beer is a beautifully distinctive strawberry blond color. The aroma is citrusy hops. The taste is the same. This beer is the essence of west coast hops but it is not bitter. (this is why the girls like it and other enthusiasts like the elder better). How do they get all that hop flavor without the bitterness? This is the genius if this brew. I favor stout beers so this won't be the best in the world for me, but it is damn good, and probably is the best in it's class. Drink it if you can get it!!!"
First beer(of course) at the Blue Dog event.
So Pliny The Younger... is it worth the hype? Maybe. Do I like Pliny The Elder better? Absolutely.
200th Review
On tap at Day 1 of the Younger 
On tap at Bishop's Collar.
"Had twice on tap in Philly. Really glad I got to try it twice. Went into it not buying the hype, and while it exceeded my expectations, it's nowhere close to the best beer in the world. Review is based mainly on the 8 oz. tulip of Younger I scored at Resurrection Ale House. Kudos to Brendan and Leigh for doing it right!"
"Had on-tap at Monk's in Philadelphia, PA. Poured a clear golden orange color with a whispy/fluffy thin white head that receded fairly fast, leaving streaky lacing on the glass. The aroma was pretty heavenly. Tropical fruits, citrus, pine...very enticing. Taste starts off sweet with a strong taste of grapefruit/mango/citrus, and finishes a bit dry with a resinous taste. It is bitter/dry, but not overly so and the hop profile is VERY well-balanced and IMO damn near perfect. Drinks pretty well considering the ABV. Medium in body...honestly, worth the hype."
"Finally got a chance to try this at Resurrection Ale House in Philadelphia this morning, and it certainly lived up to the hype."
Finally got to try after waiting for 3 years! On-tap at Churchill's 3/3.
On tap at Churchill's On Churchill's Renaissance day
Had this one on-tap at the pub a few times over the course of SF Beer Week '14 and I am adjusting my scores up a bit. Really an incredible DIPA when it is this fresh.
Review #200
"On tap for Churchill's Renaissance at Churchill's Pub & Grille in San Marcos, CA."
On draft at Monk's Cafe - finally get to try this elusive beer!
"Lucked into trying Pliny the Younger on tap at Vine St Pub in Denver for a 4:20 special tasting this past Friday 4/2/12. A friend was visiting from our hometown of Atlanta, GA, and this was a great start to his trip."
"So much hype for this brew! I'm glad I finally got a taste. Not sure why everyone is up in arms about this one. Tastes very similar to PtE but with a higher ABV. I actually prefer PtE. Is PtY worth all the hype? In my opinion, no. If you haven't tried it, I do recommend giving it a try if you have the opportunity."
On tap at Capones 3/3/12.
Pliny. The. Younger. I finally had a chance to drink this illusive brew a few times over the pats week. Thanks to Teresa's Next Door and TJ's for the way they handled this. 
This was the first year I really had to make significant effort to score a glass.
Had this at Monk's cafe in Philly during a charity event featuring The Younger.
"Poured on draft into a 5.5 oz glass at Capone's. Pours a gorgeous golden hue with thin lacing. Brilliant citrus and hop nose that is perfectly balanced. Taste follows the nose closely. Perfect balance of hops, citrus and pine. Mouth is smooth with a sublime. Bitterness. Overall, stellar."
Enjoyed on-tap after waiting in line for an hr and 1/2 at the bottleroom in Whittier. review from notes. 
PTY on Tap at BoneYard Bistro Sherman Oaks 
Pliny the Younger. 
This is my first official BA review. PtY on tap at the Bier Stein in Eugene OR.
"After calling Russian River, the distributor, and driving over an hour in Philly, I finally experienced the Younger. The hype, travel, and effort were well worth it."
After a much anticipated wait I was pleased with the delectable drink presented to me. This was not just some modest swill to guaff down. Comparible to the Elder with mildly enhanced citrusy flavor and a softer feel. Would have liked to savour a second pint but had to drive.
I was one of the lucky ones to get a glass of this at TJs. The sixtel lasted all of 55 minutes before it kicked. 2012 version of the beer.
"beautiful beer. very happy for the opportunity to try this, and big thumbs up for tj's in paoli pa, for keeping this low key, no pub, no event, no mass hysteria. got lucky, read a blog from last year said they had it, called yesterday to find out it was being tapped at 4. showed up 320, no crowd, got a seat at the bar, no fuss, no muss, absolutely the way it should be. my computer distributor is 5 minutes away, and for that alone i will return to this fine establishment. and paid only $6.75 one tulip."
Sixtel On-Tap into Tumbler Glass
"A - Brilliant tangerine color, thin white head that has little retention, and decent lacing. "
"Kind of a weak appearance. Pale golden, nearly zero head and no lacing. Bizarre since it's got so much hops in it."
"Pours an almost crystal clear straw yellow, good head and some lacing."
"Had this on tap at the Grey Lodge, 2.28.12, it is amazing to have such a world class beer blocks from my house. Appearance is a wonderful honey gold, with a decent amount of lacing. Smell is wonderful with a prelude to the wonderful balance that this beer displays, lots of hops and malt here. Taste, well...I talked about the balance here and it is ever present here. When you think about the copious amounts of hops added this beer, you are amazed at way the sweetness just balances it all out. I felt like I was on the brink of this beer being too sweet or too bitter, but it all worked out in the end. Mouthfeel is sticky, but a wonderful feeling...not to slick and definitely easily drinkable. Overall, I can see why this is one of the most highly regarded beers out there, definitely lives up to the billing."
A- Light golden color with a minimal white head.

"Dear Pliny,"
2015 update:
"I am sure many of you have already tried the Elder and may be curious about how the Younger compares to it. My review will focuse on addressing this particular topic. Overall, the Elder and the Younger are both excellent (as you would have guessed!). I wouldn't wait in line for hours just to try the Younger, but it was definitely worth my 30+ minutes at a local joint. "
"Pours a clear, orange-burnt orange with a small white head that laces."
"on-tap, last drop bottle shop in seattle"
Had on tap at falling rock.
"enjoyed at the mecca, RRB. reviewed from notes taken on 2.9.12. poured into a half-pint glass. thanks to all the bar staff for a great experience!"
A - Served a clear golden color with a thin finger of frothy white head. Faded fairly quickly leaving some good lace clinging to the sides of the glass.
"On tap at Russian River on February 5, 2011. Pours a golden amber with a small white head leaving a ridiculous amount of lacing on the glass for the alcohol content. Aroma is ridiculous with resinous pine hops, loads of floral hops, and hints of pineapple and grapefruit. Barely any malt coming through in the aroma. Initial taste is huge pine hops going into some more floral hops with just enough malt to balance it. A bit of grapefruit comes through as well. Great bitterness on the finish, but not too much. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Amazingly not overly sweet or syrupy for a beer of its size like many DIPAs. Amazingly drinkable as well. Barely a trace of the 11%. This could very easily put you on the floor very quickly. Just an amazingly good beer. Worthy of all the hype it gets. 5/5/4.5/4.5/5"
Thanks to the salted pig for this pour!
Poured into snifter at bottleworks 2/22/12
"On tap @ Bottleworks into a snifter - for the second year in a row, I just happen to walk into the shop just as they're pouring this sought-after rarity. Lightning does indeed strike twice in the same place."
Enjoyed 3 tulips of the 2012 Younger at Monks Kettle in San Francisco (and a couple at Russian River in Santa Rosa).
"Poured from a draft into what appeared to be about a 10-oz. skinny glass at San Diego Brewing Co. in San Diego, Calif., on Feb. 14. Not sure the name of it. Color was honey caramel with a nice gray lacing that stayed for about five minutes. Just a tad bit of film on the sides, which was a bit surprising. "
Served in a tulip from the falling rock taphouse
Appearance:
"Tasted up at Oskar Blues Home Made Liquid and Solids in Longmont, CO. A: Medium to dark copper colored, lacy spotting on the surface of the beer and sides of the glass, very clear - 4.50, S: Wonderfully fragrant, intense aromas of peach and pineapple, a thick and syrupy sweetness overwhelms the nose, possibly one of the finest smelling beers I've ever encountered - 5.00, T: Strong grapefruit and bitter pine assault the palate, a medium sweetness as well as some mild tropical fruits in the background, slight alcohol burn - 4.50, M: Medium mouthfeel, slight effervescence perceivable on the tongue - 4.00, D: Very drinkable for a 10.75% beer, sharper bitterness on the palate than the nose lets on, all around an excellent beer - 4.00"
The reason it took a bit of a wait to get into the brew pub on a Monday night. Not a big fan of the style but had to see what all the fuss is about. 
"It seems that Pliny the Younger comes and goes quicker with each passing year. The beer has been much sought over since being named the Best Beer in America a few years ago. A line formed at 8am at Oskar Blues Homemade Liquid & Solids yesterday for the tapping at 1pm, and easily sold out to the lucky 50 folks that grabbed a ticket. We were among the lucky few, and always are in appreciation of the GREAT hospitality, service, and friendliness of the GREAT folks at Liquid & Solids!"
"On-tap at Last Drop Bottle Shop. Seattle, WA. February 18th, 2012."
Served on tap at Russian River taproom at 2012 release. Served in a 10 oz glass. Had very high expectations given the hype. 
"Live tasting, on tap @ Barley and Hops Olde Worlde Family Tavern... 10oz. Pour into a mini pint glass.."
"Poured on-tap at Russian River Brewpub - Santa Rosa, CA..."
Imbibed on tap at The Bistro Double IPA Fest 2/11/12.
Finally got to try the big one at The Rose & Crown on 2/15. SF Beer Week has been ridiculously epic thus far.
"Enjoyed on tap at the Parkway Tavern on 2/16/12. An awesome night for beer lovers with the Elder and the Younger on tap, and the Younger was free!"
"On-tap 2/16/12 at the Parkway Tavern in Tacoma, WA. Customer appreciation night. On the house! I think the Parkway made a few friends."
"Served on-draught into a 10 oz glass at Russian River's taproom during the 2012 release. Reviewed from notes. Expectations were through the roof given the brewery, site ratings, and how good Pliny the Elder was. "
"On tap at the daily pint, served in a tulip glass."
Free schooner (customer appreciation night) at the Parkway in Tacoma -- how awesome is that?
On tap at Apex in Portland. Poured into 6 oz glass.
"Poured at Pete's Brass Rail in Danville, CA, on Valentine's Day. I'm in love."
A: A perfect golden yellow but it did not have a significant head to go with it.
Reviewed from notes.
2/9/12 at Stone Brewing
On tap at falling rock taphouse.
"Color was a golden light orange.  Citrus bouquet. No head at all, but nicely carbonated. Nice mouthfeel.  An immediate blast of pine that yields to alternating grapefruit and floral flavors. Finishes with distinct grapefruit. No discernible alcohol warmth despite having an ABV of 10.7%.  Great beer, but not my own personal number one--certainly not the best on the planet. "
on Tap at Toronado San Diego
A Pours a beautiful orange with little head. 
"Had this on tap at APEX pdx. 11% of greatness. I've had tried over 900 beers and this 1 takes the top spot by far. Incredible taste, not as hoppy as i would have guest, but thats what makes this beer unique. "
Had this on tap at Apex in Portland. Was surprised to find it a very average imperial IPA.
"Waited 3 hours in line for this gem. Had I come 30 minutes earlier, I could've been in with an hour wait. Le sigh."
Stood in line for 1.5 hours before getting in to the brewery an immediately finding a seat at the bar. 
"Well I finally was able to try this one! I am surely not gonna say anything that hasn't been said already so I will not go into gory detail. All I will say is what a wonderful beer with all the elements. Perfect color, nose, mouthfeel and taste. More on the taste...silky, citrus, and oh yeah the hop profile is perfection. Was able to do side by side with elder. In compassion, elder has more wood and less hops. Younger pours a more golden yellow than elder. A huge highlight getting to sample this! Perfection!!!"
"On-tap at the Russian River brewpub. Pours a dark/clearish orange with a small amount of head. The smell is fantastic, lots of floral and grapefruit notes, along with a touch of pine and citrus. The taste mirrors the aroma, a wonderfully balanced brew with nice floral and citrus fruit notes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation, and a dry and clean finish."
"Pours a piss yellow. Like when you're super dehydrated. Not much head but looks very solid. Smells phenomenal. Lots of floral aromas. The hop profile is far less piney than elder. Very enjoyable taste as well. Citrus, floral, touch of booziness. Smooth... Great flavours overall very solid. Jealous of those who can get it more easily"
Little 9oz swing top flask. Thanks Jason
Served out of a fine wine glass 2x
On tap at the Brewery.
"On tap at Higgin's Restaurant in Portland, OR. Served 8oz. in white wine glass while the theme song for ""Rocky"" is pumped through the speakers. "
"On tap at Toronado SD. 10oz pour into goblet. Pours a hazy, golden color with think silky head. Moderate lacing. Nose is fresh pine, but not the pungent bitter pine expected. Sticky resinous character in the nose, primarily alongside the sweet caramel smell. Citrus notes, grapefruit and lemon, some melon. Taste is much the same, instantly bitter upfront but unarguably fleeting in character. Bitterness subsides to resinous pine, almost like young pine bud. Caramel sweetness coats the mouth while the alcohol warmness becomes apparent. What a fantastic balance of strong piney hop flavors with the sweet alcohol layer. Carbonation is moderate, the amount is juuuust right. Slightly astringent. But ever so slight it is. Mouthfeel is sticky and a tad dry. Overall, lives up to the hype as a very, very good triple ipa. Excellent proportions of piney hop abundance and sweet malty layers."
From Russian River brewery at 11.30 am on Monday morning. This is the earliest I've had a drink in years.
"Review from notes on phone, feb 2011 at Freshcraft in Denver"
"Tasted this on Superbowl Sunday (Feb 4th) at 11:00 am, only waited in line for 1.5 hours so I feel lucky. "
DANG!
A: Beautiful golden amber color. Clarity is spot on. Nice action from the carbonation in a thin stream. Can't comment on the head unfortunately because of the near full pour (thanks!) but there's ton of sticky lacing.
"First year that I have been back local in the past 3. Made sure I set aside a day to spend at RR enjoying this amazing beer. Had it in 2010 in CO, and in 2008 at RR."
"Enjoyed on Feb 4, 2012 at RR in Santa Rosa."
"Enjoyed on a sunny Monday afternoon at the 2012 Younger Days at Russian River brewpub, Santa Rosa, CA. "
I've saved my first review to review the younger. I was there on feb 4 2011 waited five hours and will say well worth the wait!!!
A-This beer is incredibly clear. Not a cloudy as the Elder. Has a nice shiny golden look. Maybe some slight orange. Didnt have any head but didnt need any. 
On-tap at Russian River brewery. Poured into a 10 oz. nonic mini-pint glass.
Enjoyed on tap the release day at 10:30 am.
"Had this in a pint at the Brewery, loved it so much got a growler also served into pint glasses (6)"
"Had this on tap at a special release RR taste at falling rock. What do i need to say, THis is possibly the best us beer around. take reg pliny and give it a boost of awesome and that is PTY. I had to knock a half point just cuz i cant give a perfect rating. nobodys perfect but this dam close. also leaded at 11% it will get you tanked fast before you know it. BEWARE!"
"A - Pours a hazy gold with a billowy, creamy head that clings till the end."
"From notes. On tap at the Falling Rock earlier this year. Had enough to go around for me to try 2 snifters ($8 each). Pours a nice golden hue with low fluffy white head and minimal lacing. Sweet, citrus aroma with less pine than I remember from last year’s release, but still - what a nice nose. Could breath this one all day. Starts with a mild pine resin and citrus flavor, with pineapple and orange flavors coming on strong on the finish. Nice hop balance and tell-tale floral pine on the tongue. Beautiful stuff and incredibly balanced with minimal bitterness. Thanks to Chris for procuring this great brew again."
"Made the pilgrimage to Russian River pub in Santa Rosa this past February specifically for this beer. When we first arrived (on the day of release), there was a 4 hour wait to get in. We aborted and went up the road to Bear Republic for lunch instead. When we returned to Russian River that night at about 8pm, the line was only 45 minutes long. Once inside, the atmosphere was awesome because everyone was there to try the same beer, and they had all put a lot of effort into being there. It was a great party."
"Waited in line this year at the brewery. Two hours later we were in the door with the Younger in our hands. The journey, pursuit, and anticipation made this beer all the better. I was expecting a boozy malt bomb but was pleasantly surprised to find neither to be the case. Worth the hype and wait. Get it while it lasts."
One must plan ahead to enjoy this highly craved nectar of the gods. Fresh on tap in the proper stemmed glass is the only way
"Deserves it's reputation. Was lucky enough to have a lot of it this past year including the unannounced tap at Hamiltons in SD. Truly an awesome beer. Beautiful pour, color, burn, bitterness, balance, finish. Ahhhh, wish I had some right now. I know some people like to compare it to exponential hoppiness, but to me there is no comparison. Younger is the far more polished triple IPA."
Enjoyed at Russian River during Younger Day 2011.
"Had from a growler at RBWG 2010. Easily the best DIPA I’ve ever had. Amazing fresh hop flavor there with earthiness, citrus, floral, and more. The flavor is right up there as well, plenty of hop and bitterness but enough malt so it’s not a crazy unbalanced mess. Love it!"
Growler sent by joeneugs (the last year they sold growlers-rating from notes)
"On tap at Toronado!!! Check my facebook pics for an idea of what the world’s best triple IPA served at the world’s best Beer Bar looks like!! The hop flavors are similar to the Elder, but with a massive malt backbone and pronounced caramel notes. Well worth the 6 hour flight!!!!"
"Poured into a 6 oz mini snifter glass at Capones in Norristown (just outside of Philly). After waiting in line for 1.5 hours, let's see if this was worth the wait..."
Poured into an eight ounce glass. It appears medium bodied gold with only a thin layer of white foam.
"First had: on tap at Monk's, Philly, PA"
On tap at Belmont Station on 3.19.11 with hopburster.
"Thanks to Sparky27 for the tip on this. Tried at Hollingshead Deli along side it’s older brother. Let’s just say that it’s good to be young!!! This rating would be insignificant but it is my 50th rating in the top 100!!! What a beer to mark being half-way there!!! Bright orange peel, lemon zest, and floral aroma with hints on evergreen. Huge 2-inch tight white foam with an amazing blaze orange body. Lacing clinging mightily to the inside of the glass, a fond memory of the sip that just transpired. Flavor is incredible...definitely more aggressive and profound than it’s older sibling. Orchard fresh nectarine, Ponderosa pine, and a bit of grapefruit rind tartness in the finish. Coating yet not cloying mouthfeel. AN INCREDIBLE SPECIMEN!!!"
I had the opportunity to sample this several times at EBF including a nice little side by side with PtE.
"Review of Pliny the Younger from tasting notes taken on March 3, 2011."
"Served on tap at Russian River Brewing the day after the Super Bowl. I'll be honest, it was just too big for me and I LIKE big beers but there was just too much going on. It is still a fantastic beer but I found myself getting through my ordering other RR offerings after finishing my 10oz. pour. I'm glad I tried it but didn't think that it was worth elbowing my way through the crowds."
Had this beer a couple of times at tappings throughout the Philadelphia area.
"12 oz. pour at Apex PDX first anniversary party 5.7.11, $8.50."
"Had an 8oz pour just like the previous reviewer and from the Eastside in Olympia. I thought the beer was pretty good. Good frontal, and finishing hoppy taste with a light malty taste. The Pliny was several months old so I am sure this affected the taste quite a bit since Russian River does say it has to be fresh, so probably not as hoppy and nice as a fresh Pliny the Elder. Regardless of the freshness I still thought the beer was better than almost any IPAs, double IPAs I have tried. And the Sanctification was really good btw."
"I have to say I was very skeptical about this one. I've been to the RRBC several times, and overall arn't a big fan of too many of their beers, including the elder (OK, imo). Maybe it was the waiting in line on a warm california day that makes you appreciated a cold beer more, but I have to say that for the most part the hype is true. I agree with the prev reviewer, it's 11%, and you can't taste the alcohol AT ALL. This a truely DANGEROUS BEER. The best description that I could come up with at the time was that you take the Elder and add the subtle, yet complex taste of a Belgian and this is what you get. I'm not a big IPA fan, but this one is definitely the exception (and I've tried a lot of IPA's looking for one I like, but so far this one is IT)."
"Yep, it's good... I had a YOUNGER and Elder side-by-sde. Younger was in a Tulip and Elder was in a snifter "
"Had this one in early March on tap at Stone Brewery in Escondido. I had no idea that I was in for such a pleasant surprise on my first visit to Stone. I had one glass on my way down to San Diego when it wasn't on the menu yet. I decided to stop by on my way back the next day to see if they still had any. It was on the menu now so I quaffed three servings of the stuff. Needless to say, I liked it."
On tap at Capone's served in a 6oz snifter. Big shout out to Matt Capone and employees for putting on an amazingly smooth release!
Poured into an 8oz tulip.
"For my first BA review, I humble myself in the presence of PtY. I realize giving a perfect score is a dangerous move, but it truly represents my experience and what the beer deserves as an example of the style. "
Had a 5.5oz serving in a small snifter at Capone's in PA. 
"Had at Capone's at yesterday's Russian River Fest.Frankly, had come just to check off PTY from my wish list after many years of wondering. Fortunate to get four 5.5oz servings, and transfered 3 to a decent size tulip glass. My wife insisted on having 1 for herself. This might have been ""sharing the love"" a bit too far."
A - Striking honey colored amber. Wasn't expecting the look of this beer to be as beautiful it was.
"I had this on-tap at Capone's, poured into a goblet."
"Poured into a 6 oz mini snifter glass at Capones in Norristown. After waiting in line for 1.5 hours, let's see if this was worth the wait..."
"I will change the score when I find a better beer. I enjoyed this beer because it was sooo similar to pliny the elder, yet bigger in every way possible. the malts were not prominent and the hops smashed the pallet but in a very gentle way. The bar went crazy when they ran out. I am grateful for the people who were there early and appreciate the beer. I will be around next year."
Poured into a 10oz goblet. 
Tap at PtY 2011 release. 
"On draught at Oskar Blue's Liquids and Solids in Longmont, Co. Poured into an 8oz snifter."
"The beer pours with a small but solid head with a good effervescence. The beer couldn't smell more like pine, just wonderful like walking in a pinewood forest. I love aromatic beers and I could smell this one five feet away when the growler was opened. This is one of the driest hoppy beers I have ever tried, and now I fear I am going to crave it constantly. The beer is bracingly bitter and piney with some great complimentary mango and very mild citrus flavors that lend a hand in the complexity, this is not to say that the fruit notes sweeten the beer at all. There is just not a trace of the huge alcohol , just one remarkably well put together beer."
2/15/11 on-tab at San Diego Brewing Co
16 oz pour on tap at hollingshead deli in orange county. Waited in line for 2 hours at 8 am in the morning on a monday was well worth it. Drank side by side with a PtE
Served at Blue Dog Tavern on 3/13. Thanks to the great people there who had such an efficient ticket system in place for the beer! 
"I made a 2 hour road trip to Russian River a few days before the 2 week pouring ""window"" ended, in hopes of tasing the legend. I landed in the brewery by early afternoon and easily found a barstool. Score!"
"Got an amazing tip, shared with a few with Brendan (afksports) and had a bunch of it...finally a beer that lives up to the hype."
Notes for later review when I'm on a computer: 
"After trying the Elder and blind pig and being massively underwhelmed, I was not expecting much from this beer. What an incredible surprise. "
"On Tap at the Blue Dog in Chalfont PA on 3/13/11- thanks to a thoughtful ticket system that also benefited a couple worthy charities. Kudos, Blue Dog!! Served in a Tulip Glass."
Had this on 2011-03-12 at The Drafting Room. It wasn't a mad rush at the bar as the owner had thoughtfully arranged a way for folks to get tickets ahead of the event. Well done sir. 
"This is an amazing beer, there's not much to say that hasn't been said. I though in all honesty don't feel it's the greatest thing EVER. As you would assume it to be from all the hype. But the Russian River crew has again produced another gem to treat us eager beer drinkers with. OK OK the beer..."
"I am lucky enough to work at a place called Hopmonk Tavern in Sonoma, CA. The owner Dean Biersch bought the last keg of Pliny the Younger for the year about 2 weeks ago. Two days ago, Tuesday March 8th we tapped the last keg of the Younger in the county. Guess who had to work all night? By the time I got off 7 hours later, there was so little left in the keg that it weighed as much as the empties. Nonetheless, I got a full 12 oz glass with Kary, our head chef."
On Tap @ Father's Office Santa Monica 2/11(From memory)
Poured into an eight ounce glass. It appears medium bodied gold with only a thin layer of white foam.
"Thanks to Scoats and his Grey Lodge Pub for the special offering. I enjoyed my own pour and shared half of my sister's (thank goodness for diets) with another friend, Marty."
"The chase is over and let the hype finally have some perspective. My finish line was a newer joint in NW Denver called Hops and Pie. A little place that does two things great: pizza and craft brews! No fiasco, no attitude, and no worries. Hops and Pie poured off their 5.5 gallon of Younger within 45 mins with no stress."
Served in a Brussels glass. 
"After countless attempts to get a glass of this in 2011, my diligence was finally rewarded with a couple glasses of the Younger."
"Wow! I had my first Pliny The Younger yesterday at Abbey Pub in Bend, Oregon. I enjoyed it a great deal. There were about 50 people there when Geoff tapped the keg at Noon. At 12:23pm, the keg was empty. :-) "
Had this on tap at Falling Rock.
Thanks to St. Stephens Green in Phili for my first taste of Younger
On tap at O'Brien's.
On tap at Oskar Blues Longmont
"Had this on tap at Oskar Blues in Longmont. Phenomenal. Great balance, good mouthfeel, nice hop and pine notes. Had it side by side with an Elder, and definitely taste the difference. That being said, both are delicious. Couldn't even tell it was 11%."
Pours a light orangey amber color with minimal head
"Enjoyed on-tap at the Monk's Russian River tasting event on 2/28/11 in Philadelphia, PA. Pre-poured into a wine glass."
Not sure of the glass size but I had this at Monk's on 2/28. When I got to Monk's the line was pretty long. Looked to be about 100 people so I was shocked to get a glass at all. 
"Finally found this guy this year, i missed out last year. Poured into a 10oz tulip."
"thank you, hulmeville inn, for the great RR tappings on 1 march 2011"
2/28/11 - 8oz pour in to a tulip glass
2011 on tap at Khyber Pass Pub
on tap at khyber in philly. served in tulip glass. 
"8oz pour in to a tulip glass. Clear, caramel colored body with a thin head. "
2/26/2011
A: A beautiful clear golden color with a nice foamy head that quickly drops to a few off white bubbles on top of the beer. 
Finally caught up with pliny the elder's nephew
At first I was concerned this beer would not live up to the hype. It did.
Tasted the beer at the bar. I had to wait in line for about one hour and a half. I then just proceeded to drink two 10 oz younger glasses in almost no time at all. It is really exceptional how easy drinking the beer is for its size.
269th review on BA
On tap at Falling Rock.
"I was luck enough to have this 2 days in a row, 2 10z pours at RR and 2 more the next day at a tapping at Bobby G's in Berkeley. All 4 were equally amazing, though nothing will ever match the first couple sips I had at RR. Rarely does a beer live up to the hype, but this one surpassed it for me."
"Had this on-tap at Bobby G's Pizzeria before the rush started, major props to the crew there for managing the craziness with calm and a genial attitude."
"Happened to wander into the Father's Office in Santa Monica, and this was on tap. Score! Had three pours at the bar."
"There is no doubt in my mind. For all the talk and trendy tales about this beer, now I understand this to be one of the greatest IIPA ever crafted."
"On tap tonight at Father's Office in Santa Monica. Enjoyed a relaxing 3 10oz pours with no lines, hassles, or assholes."
I enjoyed this fine brew on tap at the Blind Lady Ale House in Normal Heights at the 5 o'clock release. Taped out in an hour and I was lucky enough to have 2. One in a 10 oz (.25 L) flute and the other in a 10 oz snifter. The first was paired with .4L of Elder. 
On tap at Blind Lady Ale House during their Younger vs. Elder event. Poured into a brandy snifter style glass.
on tap at Toronado SD
Not sure how I've forgotten to review this in the past... but no time like the present! 
2011 Release on release day at RR. This is a transcript of my notes.
I finally/actually made it up to the brewery to try out this wonderful offering from the people at Russian River. Served in a 10-oz glass. Moderately carbonated.
On tap at the Toronado SF.
"The annual arrival of what many hopheads consider to be the pinnacle of IPA perfection has become more than a mere release, it's an event. Running dry within the first day of tapping the kegs last year taught the good folks at Russian River a few things. This year they switched things up, releasing a limited amount of kegs per day, and not filling growlers for anyone. As they announced on their website: The only way to get it to go is in your tummy! Works for me."
"First brew rated, figured it should be 'the One'."
"Body is a clear gold poured from draft to about a half-inch head. White foam dissipates pretty quickly to a cap and ring. Leaves trace lacing on the glass, which is motile and does not stick. "
"2011 Pliny the Younger: Pale yellow, medium body and carbonation. Smells like pine and grapefruit. Your taste buds are totally shot after tasting this. Intense earthy hop flavors: marijuana-like and resinous. Probably lots of Columbus hops. Not as citrusy as 2010, but the same de-emphasis of hop bitterness and emphasis on hop flavor. Less bitter than Pliny the Elder. And again, the alcohol is masked by the intense hop flavors. Pretty tasty beer -- hard to explain the hype (especially when you think about all the other delicious double IPAs out there), but one of the best."
On tap at RRBC on Tuesday the 8th and again on Friday the 11th.
On tap at Uber last year in Seattle...the keg blew in 12 minutes!
Had on tap at Toronados
"Poured at Toronado, San Diego on 2/10/11. $7."
From tap to wine glass
On tap at Stone 1/10/11
"This is truly excellent and overall essentially a stronger, slightly more intense and richer version of Pliny the Elder, with the same excellent balance of hop and malt, bitter and sweet, full body and easy drinkability. "
The things I will do to taste world class beers!!
On Tap
I manged to get my hands on this one at 11 am at a packed Toronados in San Diego. 
"10 oz draft pour at Russian River Brewery. Almost no head by the time it got to the table, poured a hazy amber or burnt orange. Aroma was very prevalent in the beginning and I got pine, grapefruit, tropical fruit as well as some floral notes. As many others have stated this beer is like a bigger version of Pliny the Elder but somehow it achieves more balance between the malt and the hops. All of that along with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel make this a very drinkable 11% alcohol beer."
I was one of the first 20 people in the joint SuperBowl Sunday and thought I might as well order a Younger while I'm here. I mean...everyone else was doing it.
"A friend received a growler in a trade last year and shared it with me. I reviewed the beer when we consumed it, but misplaced my notes. I recently discovered them when cleaning out my beergeon."
"Hit the RR brewpub for lunch today. No lines, just a pleasantly packed pub. I loved how the sever immediately said ""What can I get you to drink? Younger?"". I'm sure they knew they would be right 99% of the time."
"Drove up seven hours to Sacramento to stay at Abel's (abecall98) in Sacramento this past Friday, then drove another two hours Saturday morning to go to Santa Rosa...all so I could try this beer again on tap at the SOURCE."
The most coveted beer on earth - finally after all these years!!!!
A long line forms along 4th Street in Santa Rosa every year about this time. The reason? The annual extremely limited release of Pliny the Younger!
"I was there at the 2011 debut. Simply an outstanding, world-class beer. Floral, pungent hops without the bitterness that so many have unfortunately associated with ""good"" IPA. Well-balanced and obviously carefully crafted, this is a distinctly American beer. And one to be proud of. Well done Russian River. Oh, and watch out because that 10%+ ABV will sneak up on you..."
Consumed on tap at the brewery on release day 2/4/2011.
I could smell this baby before I even had a chance to step into the brewpub. Aroma of pine and citrus waft out from the door. The aroma is enticing and I had to smell it for 2 hours while I waited to get in!
Went to Russian River's brew pub on the second day of release in 2011. 
"Pliny the Younger is the beer to get on tap. As an IPA drinker I am always skeptical of an IPA that gets a lot of lip and press; however, this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. As a fan of Dreadnaught from Three Floyds, to Sculpin from Ballast Point, the Younger is a truly notable beer. Color is lacking only in the sense that I appreciate a more copper-colored IPA. You cannot beat the smell. It is a scent of heaven, both floral and fruity, and with the taste you get a hint of pine. The hops are indescribably fresh, crisp, and dry. In the event you have the luxury of making it to the Russian River Brewery for this annual beer unveiling, get there early and enjoy the ten ounce pours."
Growler shared by Grabbin2nd (thanks RJ) on 2/9/10
Apearance - Hazy golden copper with a 2 finger white head with medium retention and awesome lacing.
Somehow this review from notes slipped through the cracks. Had on draft at the Spring House Drafting Room HopFest in April of 2009. Poured into two different 5 oz. tasting glasses (guess they couldn't just do one glass)...
A- Pours a light hazed golden orange in color with a soft silky white head. The head retention was okay and it had minimal lacing.
"Enjoyed this op tap at Flanigan's Boathouse in Summer 2006, just rating it now for some reason. Maybe I'm just sobering up from that strange mid-afternoon event, held on Monday of all days. Fresh bursts of pine cones and grapefruits on the nose, with a lingering sweetness. Orange body, slightly darker than its elder kindred. Just such a wonderful flavor, an explosion of the aforementioned, more candi sugar than the Elder, swirling lighter fruits mingle into an extraordinarily balanced, large, and impressive IIPA. Not the grapefruit peel wonders of Dreadnaught, but an exceptionally balanced utter assault here."
From (brief) notes:
"How have I not reviewed this beer? I had it three times this past year on tap, and after recently having Hop Suey on tap, I looked back to my review to see how the scores matched up. Huh. Back to the notes for my review!"
"Thanks, Prufrock, for sharing this rare and delicious treat. Served cool in a taster."
"I have had this several times on tap and once from a growler. This rating is from 2009's growler (notes from the time). Pours with a small white head that fades over a golden body. Even after over a week this still leaves pretty decent lacing. Aroma is sticky gooey pine and citrus hops with earthy and spicy notes as well. Caramel and alcohol also back it up. Hops are straight up Simcoe and Centennial. Very clean, hop first taste with citrus and floral that blends to a sweet caramel and only slightly alcoholic finish. A touch of bitter orange liquor as well. Some pineapple too. This is a great example of hop goodness at its best. Smooth mouthfeel, light bubbles. "
"On-tap at the Bistro double IPA festival (finally, finally putting my notes down into a review)."
I got this on tap at Pi Bar here in San Francisco.
"Had this at TJ's a few months back. Reviewing from mental notes, pictures, and some very limited notes I typed onto my phone."
"From notes... Went to PtY release on Feb. 5th...Waited in line for 3 hours and was lucky enough to get a couple glasses for my girlfriend and I along with 3 growlers before they sold out an hour after we got there. Appearance was a bit darker and more amber color than Elder. Not a big head with incredible lacing. The smell is mind-blowing...I walked around my house with a an empty growler of it up to my nose during the Super Bowl (that's how amazing it smelled.) It's like the Elder on steroids. The taste is like no other beer in this world. So much pine, floral, sweet caramel, citrus, and hop notes....you can't get more complexity in an IIPA. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy... with SO much drinkability. I can't believe how fast I consumed high quantities of this beer. Can't wait for 2011 release!"
"I was sadden when i heard that Russian River sold out of this beer in the first 8 hours. Frantically I called up every local beer bar in with in an hours drive of Santa Rosa, and found out that Toronado would be tapping a keg in a week at a special Russian River 'tion night. The first sip was very magical and I knew that it was worth the trip. The gobs of hops are not over whelming like you would first expect. I think the bitterness is so intense that your taste receptors just shut down. The 11% alcohol sneaks up on you like drinking a glass or two of really good wine. You get a nice buzz going on, and you do not feel full or bloated from drinking a few pints, since they serve this to you in 8 oz. pours. That was probably one of the greatest nights in my life, until a week later I found out that RRB had a top secret keg of this stuff still available. I noticed a difference in the taste just by the Younger aging only a week, it wasn't as crisp and intense as I had remembered. Although it was still a great beer to drink. That night I had 3 glasses of Younger and a basket of beer bites. I would pay $100 any time to be able to have that night again. It was one of the best meals i have ever had."
"It doesn't take a beer geek to recognize excellence. I had this beer once on tap one upon a springtime in Seattle, on my first visit to the Stumbling Monk. I'd never heard of Pliny at the time but since it was the strongest IPA on tap I requested it. The bartender didn't really play it up, so I was amazed when I got the beer in front of me. The luminous golden cup in front of me bore a heady, floral aroma of citrus and conifer. I remember really tasting the grapefruit in it, and being impressed by both its richness and balance. After a beer this strong I wouldn't usually feel like another one, but this was an exception. I knew at the time that it was easily the best beer I'd ever had, and I haven't found a better one since. The Holy Grail of IPAs."
"On tap at Capones (9oz). Enjoyed with Leafs93 and Damico. Pours an amber orange color, clear, with a thin head. Has an aroma of pine and grapefruit. This was definitely worth the anticipation. Has a great taste, creamy smooth balance of bitter and sweet. Notes of citrus. I think what separates this imperial from other imperials is the creaminess. I love the harsh hop bitters in imperials but the complex flavors here are balanced so well to reduce that harshness. Which is likely what makes it so appetizing to so many beer fans. I will not say it is the best beer I have ever had. But it is near the top of my list."
"2010 version. 8 oz glasses at O'Brien's, 1st keg of the season only a couple weeks after it was released. Waiting in line for about 30 mins, keg was kicked in 10 once they started pouring. "
On tap @ Monk's Cafe during there Russian River event. There was a line outside about 30min before the bar even opened at 11am. By the time the bar opened it was over 60 people long.
"It smelled VERY strongly of hops. My nose is not fancy enough to decipher the different scents - to me, it was just super hoppy. It was light amber/gold, with no real head to speak of. It was sweet and watery when sipped, but had a syrupy feel on my lips afterward. It was nice, sweet, and subtle. Overall, the first half of the glass was really nice. However, after that...it just stopped being all that great. Maybe the hops killed my palate, I don't know. But it's not a beer I would drink a lot of."
2009 vintage. 
"I got to try this for the first time in my life amidst a mass of beer geeks clambering over the taps at Blue Palms in Hollywood like brokers at the New York Stock Exchange. Luckily I was able to try it again 2 days later at Father's Office in Culver City where it was CONSIDERABLY lower-key, and where I easily got to order 2 glasses (the Blue Plams keg kicked in 7 minutes) and found a seat where I could sit and sip in peace."
"On tap at Toronado, San Francisco"
Review from notes taken on 3/20/10 during TJ's: Younger and Elite friends event.
Source/Serving: Growler fresh from the brewery. It was insanity!
On tap at O'Briens. 
Had this at the local 44.I felt very fortunate to have the opportunity to try this and even more so to have it in a nice peaceful local with not that many people. I've read some of the reports of PtY madness at other tappings.
On tap at Union Jack's Easter Hopfest on 04.03.2010.
"A - served in a tulip glass, clear just the right head, like fabulous"
Growler shared by alexsdad06. Poured clear bright copper color with a large frothy off-white head that was lasted with excellent lacing. Heavy complex sour citrus hop and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with dry slick texture and soft carbonation. Heavy smooth bitter citrus flavor with a heavy bitter finish of long duration with a small alcohol burn as it warms. This is a standout beer. Thanks Brad.
Had this on tap at a few places during SF Beer week but this review is based on the pint at had at Pi Bar during Russian River night.
"On tap at TJs in PA for the pouring event. After PtE, Supplication and Consecration (hour or so rest for my palate), how could my day get any better? Served in a snifter at 4PM, I was #14 on the list and showed up 15 minutes before they opened, awesome. The beer is golden-copper with a nice ring and very sticky suds. Light lacing is left and a really cool looking cloud stays in the middle of the beer for the entire experience. Smell is right up there with the best hop aromas for me. I homebrew but still don't understand how to extract hop notes like this. The hops lend citrus, tons of floral and earthy, fruity and pine to a balance of greatness. There is some malt in the background (11% ABV!) and it balances the aroma to perfection. I have rarely had a 10%+ beer with no alcohol in the aroma, impressive. The taste is also one of the best. First off, while sipping on this for probably over an hour, no alcohol ever came into play, ridiculous. The hop profile is once again very earthy and floral and also citrus and fruity. Even some herbal notes come through. A nice malt backbone helps the beer become whole. The malts are like a very good homebrew wort to me and go in nicely with the hops. Mouthfeel was moderate-heavy with great low-medium carbonation that I prefer in huge beers. A really nice warmth hits the tongue along with the perfect amount of bitterness. The creaminess in the feel was very nice. At $6.25 per glass and 11% ABV, this is probably the most dangerous beer I have come across. The drinkability is frightening. I could session this and think it was 5-6% at most, vastly impressive brew."
"On-tap, served in a snifter"
Big thanks to JZED for sharing and bringing this precious resource back to Ontario from California.
"First beer review, I'd say I'm starting it off right. A thousand thank you's to Hayes for sharing his growler, it was overnighted to him so still very fresh!"
"From a keg almost seven weeks following the release, poured into a snifter glass."
Pours a slightly hazy straw yellow color. Not too much in the way of head but what was there was a bit soapy and almost pure white in color. It really clung to the sides of the glass.
Thanks to the Hulmeville inn for this one.Limited to one per person but my wife who is pregant did not want any so WOOHOO!!! Two for me.
"Appearance: light orange in color with a short 1/4"" head that broke down quickly. No lace devlops."
"Blessed with this on tap Saturday at Tria Washington West in Philly. Waited in the rain for a bit, thank god they had a 1-10oz serving/person rule. Keg was kicked about 10-people after we were served."
"Had on tap at a ""secret"" tapping, Gray Lodge in NE Philadelphia. Poured into a stemmed pint glass, whatever that may be called! Was fortunate to get the first glass! Pours a bright copper/yellow color. Very small white head that dissapates to a thin ring, pretty quickly too. No real lacing to speak of, but could be due to the ""bar-glass"" washing methods."
"Just got back home from the PtY event at Tria this afternoon, was one of the lucky ones who got in before the keg kicked. Review based on my notes."
"Pours clear with a slight head. Aroma is powerful , fragrant, with strong grapefruit and lily and jasmine. Flavor is huge: hops, grapefuit and lily, with a sugary malt backbone. The mouthfeel is prickly and sharp. The bitterness is slow and sweetish, like a bitter tea. Alcohol is totally hidden, making this a quiet killer."
"Drank this on 2/15, two 17 oz. mugs at Hollingshead's in Orange, CA. From the notes I took at the time:"
after a year...finally we meet again.
"A: Beautiful in the glass, nice and golden orange with a slight white foam head. The lacing was perfect in my glass as well."
Ah yes - one of the beer holy grail items. I might as well be a geek and review it.
Rewriting my review from the ground up. 
"The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is outstanding. It's your typical West Coast DIPA, but done to perfection. It has your standard pale malt base which seems to provide adequate balance. The hop aroma is sublime. It's citrusy with hints of pine. It's very bitter, yet not as much as I thought it would be. The taste is great; so smooth and drinkable. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. What there is , is a damn tasty beer that's relatively light and loaded with hops. This is a thing of beauty. The mouthfeel is great as well. It's a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is off the charts. There's not heat whatsoever, just heavenly golden nectar."
Okay... had FOUR glasses while they had it on tap at Henry's. Here goes:
"Thanks to klevelandrocks, marshalzhukov, and craytonic for all sharing growlers with me this year!"
Received this from sugit.
Thanks to my buddy sugit for this sweet growler!!!
Tried this rarity for the first time during a special 20-person morning session at Resurrection Ale House. Beer was served with a smile in a medium-sized tulip.
"Had a full snifter of this at a tasting at Capones in Norristown, PA. "
"Someone from the East Coast with an opportunity to try and review this highly sought after beer, what an opportunity. I was beginning to compare this beer to the legend of Bigfoot (Sasquatch, not the Barleywine from Sierra), some people have seen it but it's so rare that it's more of a myth than an actual beer. (tongue in cheek, of course)"
A- nice golden yellow orange. Small skin of head not a bit of lacing. 
"10oz pour at Monk's Cafe, tapped for their Russian River Mad Monday. I got the first retail pour (not to brag), so I'm kind of a big deal. "
"Had 8oz pour on-tap at Falling Rock Taphouse on 2/26/10 as part of their special tapping the night before the Boulder SourFest. Place was packed so glad that ummagum and I got there 1.5 hrs early and got a table. It was a slightly hazy golden orange color. Had slight carb streams. Couldn't tell how soon after pouring that we got it since it was a mass delivery but it still had a 1/8"" foam cap that stayed there for the duration (especially as I kept swirling it to kick up the awesome aromas). My glass had good lacing and not much sticking but my friend's had great lacing and lots of sticking so I used his as the lacing reference and chalked mine up to washing issues. "
On Tap @ Monk's Cafe
"Thanks treyrab for the growler hookup connection... living in Alaska, this is a dream come true for me, the anticipation was...well, you know what it was. to the beer:"
Poured into a 10oz tulip. Very slight creamy head with light sense of cabonation. Color a clear golden with slight amber hue (though to be fair the lighting was pretty bad). 
"Pours an almost crystal clear golden orange color. Huge frothy white head that lingers, leaves great lacing and holds the delicious smell. The scent is a beautiful whiff of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple with vauge hints of pale malt and pine resin. I found myself smelling this beer more than i was sipping. Taste begins with the semi-acidic grapefruit, mellowing into a semi-sweet pineapple and tangerine. Bitterness comes through in the end through tastes of pine resin. In between, definite tastes of pale malt are present and provide just enough to smooth the edges between flavors. Body is medium, slightly oily and slick, but does not linger on the palate and cloud future sips. Overall, and excellent dIPA... more akin to a hoppier version of Blind Pig due to all the fruit notes. To me it appeared much less bitter than the PtE due to these tropical fruits."
On tap at Monk's amidst the chaos. Here we go!
"10 oz. pour on-tap at The Horse Brass. Just fantastic blending of malty backbone with an up-front hoppy citrusy bitterness. Not nearly as unbalanced as I expected, but just as good. Really a superbly-balanced beer considering how strong it is. A much more pleasant and drinkable beer than I expected, and not the up-front flavor overload I was bracing myself for. I could drink a lot of these back-to-back."
Poured from a growler into a tulip.
"At long last. Enjoyed a half pint on tap at Falling Rock. It was worth the wait. Pours a beautiful golden color with a nice, frothy head. It almost smelled better than it tasted, extremely fragrant floral, piney aroma."
"Growler shared by AJ. Thanks AJ! Pours clear orange color with thick off white head. Aroma is citrus, simcoe hops with grapefruit rind, and some resinous stinky citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is an explosion of flavor. It follows the nose nicely and I can detect layers of resinous hop goodness. Upfront its citrus, then comes simcoe citrus, followed by pine sol flavor, and coats my mouth with hop resins and finishes with a touch of heat. Overall the alcohol is hidden well and I do detect a touch of alcohol in the finish. With more hops. Wonderful beer. Thanks AJ!"
Sampling this live right now at Capone's.
holy crap i never thought i would ever get to try this but after a six hour drive and a 2 hour wait at the bar and here i am 
"First, second, third, etc. many solar system-sized thanks to cloudskipper for going through the trouble of securing this growler & shipping it to the cold northern steppes. Was going to get one last year but turned out I was going on vacation after the release, so I've been waiting an entire year for this opportunity. Break out the glasses & pour that Younger!"
"2010 growler. Yet another huge thanks to DuffManSW for hooking this up! Big, loose white head with great lacing and a nice golden color. Big juicy melon and citrus notes in the aroma with hints of honey, honeydew melon, and a distinct skunky homegrown (yeah that kind) quality. The flavor is a juicy blend of wet hops, melon, grapefruit, tropical fruit, and a mellow bitterness on the finish that just lingers forever. The body is creamy and medium-full with soft carbonation."
I'm proud to say that this beer will be my first review. 
"In my opinion, the Younger is a stronger, hoppier (both are ridiculous) Elder. Nose is slightly more tropical and grapefruity than Elder. There is also a little more candi-cookie sweetness than the Elder. With a slightly lighter feeling body, deceptively, yet equally smooth and dry and refreshing. So fresh and delicious, a true ode to the hops."
"Growler shared by jerz at Woodshop 5.0. Pours a clear gold with an orange tinge and a creamy dense white head. Aroma is hugely pineappley/grapefruity with vanilla and a piney herbal character. Flavor is very herbal and bitter, lots of resins for sure. Sweetness comes through only in an orange/lychee hoppiness. Malt? What malt? We don't need no stinkin malt. Even if there was a pound of peated malt in this I wouldn't be able to taste it through the absurd hop whirlwind. I think I used the word ""whirlwind"" in my PTE review too now that I think about it. Whatever, this beer pulverizes. I'll rerate next year off a proper pint."
On tap at Abbey Pub in Bend...Personal thanks to Geoff for bring this on!
"Sampled at a local tasting in St. Louis, big thanks to hooliganlife for bring 2 growlers."
A secret tapping at Teresas Next Door on 2/23/10.Thanks Matt and Andy for the heads up.
"Well, here it is, I finally get to try more than a tiny serving of this much-coveted beer. Poured into a tulip. I'm actually a little nervous because I know the reviews for this beer are scrutinized. While it does pour an attractive semi-clouded gold, the foam recedes rather quickly, leaving a few large bubbles on the surface. "
Received a growler of this from the super generous abecall98. I've missed this damn beer the past three years and I decided the 2010 version needed to be in my belly. Drank from some sort of Belgium snifter thingy with Mr. Scoobydank.
02.05.10 at Toronado
"Enjoyed a tulip of this on draft at Teresas's this afternoon. It was a quiet tapping, nothing advertised or broadcasted about it. Which I personally enjoyed much more so than the mayhem of other releases. Anyways, this was my first time having it."
"So friends of mine asked me what good beer I had around and I popped open a growler of younger. After half a glass, the double digit ABV frightened them off, and I was left with half a growler. I can't complain because this is a beautiful beer. It Poured a nice amber color, almost like mead, With a good solid head and an all hop aroma. The taste was exquisite with a heavy hop forward bitter blast, balanced out by a honey/nectar malt flavor. I had 3 glasses and I could drink this alll night if it were not for the alcohol hitting me after glass 3. It's an amazing beer!"
I got in line more than an hour early for EBF session one to ensure I got a taste of this behemoth. That turned out to be unnecessary when it lasted more than two hours into the session. I even ended up getting a second sample.
"2010 on tap at the Horse Brass Pub and Saraveza in Portland, OR"
Thanks to my Cali connection Nick for going through a lot of trouble to pick up and send a growler of this fine nectar my way.
"I am not the biggest fan of big, strong IPA's. They are by no means my favorite style. I do however respect them, enjoy them, and admire their sometimes complex layers of flavor. "
"Cheers to Mikeoxlong for trading this growler, I have been wanting to try this beer for about 2 years now! Als shared among friends as it will be ahrd to finish a whole growler!"
On tap at the EBF 2010.
"Gave this one the once over at Barley and Hops in Temecula, CA. I feel priveleged to review the number one beer in the world right now."
Finally got a chance to try the newest number one on Beeradvocate.com.
"Had a few glasses with my homey Joe. Poured from a super cool flip-top growler, it has a bright, yellow gold color with good clarity. The head is white with good retention and lacing. Carbonation held up good in the growler shipped across the country."
I had several ounces of Pliny the Younger poured by Vinnie himself at the Extreme Beerfest.
Thanks to a very generous BA for dealing with the madness at the release and shipping through one of the worst storms DC has ever seen to get this to me. It's been a long weekend of driving up and back to Buffalo and I've been looking forward to opening this growler.
Walked into one of favorite bars and there it was. I was very happy. 
Infinitely huge thanks to generous Evan (beddachedda) for sending me a growler and being almost too fair in the trade when everyone else was getting shut out! You rock! Poured from the standard 2L Russian River sweet looking swingtop at Dave's place with a bunch of Chicago beer crew.
Big thanks to errantnight for hooking me up with this long time want.
"Was lucky enough to be at Pizza Port San Clemente on Valentines night and got talking to the bartender. Great beer there as always. Well, the bartender told me they had two five gallon kegs waiting to go on tap. He didn't tell me it would be on at opening, but he also didn't think they would put it on later in the day."
HUGE thanks to dukedevil0 for sharing this with the Chicago BA crew. Just an amazing display of awesomeness by Dave!
Hand bottle from LongBeachHopHead. I decided if I tasted any sort of trouble with the bottle I wouldn't review it. It landed on my doorstep today and I'm cracking it with friends to share the love.
"Had it on Tap three times now, tasting notes are from 2/9/10. Just had a glass about an hour ago and feel the notes I took are still accurate so here we go!"
"On tap at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver on Tuesday and was very lucky to have gotten the two glasses of it that I did as the first keg was gone after about 10 minutes, and the second very shortly thereafter. "
A huge thanks to Matt (drabmuh) for sharing his growler with me!
A huge thanks to treyrab for sharing some of his growler with me! Couldn't wait to dig into this one after all I had heard about it and was eager to see what this beer was all about. Poured into my tulip glass...
On tap at Malt and Vine in Redmond.
"This beer is definitely the pinnacle of IPA's. The IPA has a beautiful caramel color, similar to an old German Riesling and a wonderful hop aroma that makes you feel as if you're running through a field of hop vines. The taste embodies the classic characteristics of a West Coast IPA with strong presence of bittering hops resembling Chinook. The mouthfeel is amazing, very smooth and fully bodied with less carbonation than a typical West Coast which improves its drinkability. You can easily suck back several pints of the Younger without worrying that your taste buds will be recked. Overall, an amazing IPA worth the status of number one Beer on the Planet"
Thanks to jrallen34 who let me share his growler with him.
REVIEW 500!
"Huge thanks to Dave for sharing this, never thought i'd try it. "
"Growler shared by Dave (dukedevil0), thank you sir! Poured into a tasting glass a couple of times."
growler into balloon glass.
I drank this from RR growler into my Rochefort chalice.
"A- A gloriously bright, clear golden beer. Sexy fluffy yet creamy head, lacing to die for. Really is beautiful in the tulip glass here at Pi Bar."
"Growler shared by mreusch. Thanks! Served in a Boulevard Tank 7 glass. Poured a deep gold with a thin white head. Massive piney hop aroma. Flavor is dominated by hop bitterness as you would expect, but there is a solid malt base without being sweet. Very drinkable for the abv, alcohol was not very evident. Lots of hops without being too green in the flavor. Nice mouthfeel, medium to full bodied. Believe the hype."
"A very generous growler gift from my pal, Arbitrator! Thanks a million, my friend..."
Lucky enough to have this on tap on a visit to Russian River. 
Growler from my sister who has relocated to Napa who happened upon the event per my begging. 
On tap at Father's Office. I had three of these nice little guys before the bar was even half full. I greatly appreciate the bar abstaining from doing a hyped-up Pliny the Younger night. Much nicer in my opinion to bust this thing out quietly. 
"Tasted this tonight at a local tasting. My buddy Keith got this through a trade and he is awesome enough to share with us. Pours a really clear yellow to light orange with some Hop residue in my glass, yep hops I say. I am not a great smeller, but I do smell a ton of hops. So, for a normal person, you would smell a mega ton, I bet. The taste is very floral and not over bittering, which is great in my book. I am not a bitter freak, I like hop flavors. Wish we could get this in Florida year round."
On tap at Pizza Port San Clemente
Review #200.
"I've waited about 4 years to get a chance to try this beer, and am very glad to be able to do so just a few days after it took the top spot."
Thanks to concourse for the share on this one. Very interested to see if it lives up to the hype.
On-tap at Tustin Brewery (8oz pour)
"Making a 125 mile trip worthwhile. Feb 13, 2010 was the start of a brew tour beginning at Port Brewing to grab some Red Poppy Ale and Angels Share Grand Cru."
Draft serving in a 0.5 L mug at Hollingshead.
"I want to do a standard review, but this deserves so much more. I'll start with appearance. This beer poured a burnt orange color that was lightly effervescent, but had great lacing and head retention. Smell was slightly piney, but more florally and citrusy. This is bitter. And not a harsh and spicey bitter, but a citrusy and floraly bitter. The younger gives it smell every cent it's worth. Hints of diacetyl on the malt. This is very well balanced. More on the hoppy side, but the malt gives the perfect smootheness to it that makes it so drinkable. Hops sit on the palate and fills the nose with that perfumy floral hops. I had a 17 oz pour and I've become a philosopher. Amazing beer. Never had better."
"Thanks to LongBeachHopHead for hand bottling this beauty so that I could taste the hype, and this is a case where I can believe the hype. "
A huge thanks to tzanio for this one!
REVIEW # 400 (FOR ME)
Thanks a million to alcstradamus for his generosity.
"Quite clear with a smallish head that dissipates quickly leaving a little bit of foam around the edge of the glass. This beer smells fabulous. To quote a friend ""if hops had a vagina this is what it would smell like"" The fresh, grassy, grapefruity, cleanliness of this aroma is what I want to reek of when I get out of the shower. (even though I would probably find myself only able to attract middle-aged fat and/or balding men with beards). The flavor follows the smell, though it is not as complex or nearly so orgasmic. Super-dry and bracingly bitter, I would even say that the bitterness is a bit over the top, but only a bit. The mouthfeel is unremarkable, acceptable levels of carbonation... not tannic or anything."
"Much thanks to Sugit for providing this growler. This was definitely an experience, and we drank it on the very day (2/13/10) it takes the BA #1 spot. There isn't much that hasn't already been said, but here are my thoughts."
"Many, many thanks to Wespatrick for sharing this gem. Had at a tasting last night, Feb 13th. Reviewed from notes."
"After tap, now on to the growler courtesy of Grabbin2nd."
"TaNgerine hued copper, slight haze--yeast or dry hopping?"
"Many Thanks to a very generous trader for hooking me up with this one. I can't thank you enough (!), especially with all the craziness surrounding the release. I split this side by side with Elder (bottled 1/14) with my homie Jeff the other night. "
"HUGE thanks to Chad, a fellow Hoosier that's been transplanted to California. 64oz swing-top growler from the brewery. Served in an oversized tulip and shared with fellow BA infestaxion."
Growler from augustgarage. Many thanks!
Growler received from jfh. Thanks a ton for this one! Poured into a Bruery tulip.
APPEARANCE 
I was totally stoked to get a growler of this in the mail yesterday. Many many many thanks again go out to mjl21...Mike you made my year with this beer!
"I can honestly say this is a beer that I never thought I'd have the opportunity to drink, but I'm extremely grateful to chris for hooking me up with a growler from the most recent release. I am especially thankful because it sounds like it sold out in about 5 hours this year."
Nice clear golden pour with two fingers of sticky head. The smell is an absolutely blistering assault on the senses. Sinus cleansing levels of hops. Huge floral and pine notes with an underlying orange peel citrus aroma. This takes the bar set by other west coast IPAs and throws it like a javelin through the heart of restraint.
Has it really been a year since I sipped this delicious nectar? Yes. Yes it has. 
"A huge thanks goes out to my buddy Ryan for hooking me up with this. After two years gone by of PtY trades falling through, Ryan stepped up big, not to mention the best packaging job I've ever seen on a growler."
"Poured from a growler into my Duvel tulip thanks to Evan, thanks again brah! I owe you big time!"
"Received my growler today from moosington-thanks man, this sure was a great trade. It is being shared with two BA's. I start the evening of excitement with the unveiling of the growler."
MAMMOTH thanks to JMoore for this.
"Pours a deep amber gold with a thin bubbly off white head. Retention is average, nothing special."
"As a huge fan of The Elder, I waited patiently to find the Younger and was frustrated by near misses and the grim prospect of never actually tasting this beer. Sheer serendipity brought it to my lips; the tapping was unannounced and no sign was displayed. ""We're just trying to keep it mellow, so don't make a big deal about it,"" the bartender advised."
"HUGE Thanks to Jerz for hooking me and my crew up! We don't get a lot of good beer up in Fargo, so this is a treat!"
"Paid $6.25 for a 12oz pour into a pint glass at the Englander in San Leandro, CA."
"On tap at Toronado SD, into a tulip:"
"Received a growler as part of a trade with Ricand. He sent it overnight from California to Indiana so that I could have it as fresh as possible. Gathered with four friends they day it arrived. I've been waiting to try this beer for a LONG time, and was very excited to finally give it a shot. Thanks again, Rick!"
I've been lucky enough to have a good share of this beer over the last week at both the release day and at the DIPA fest and enjoyed it immensely but the social nature of said events didn't permit me to take notes. I'm reviewing tonight from my only growler. From notes 02/10/10.
on tap
"Big ups to eliottJW and juhl31 for scoring me a growler, even when I couldn't make it up to the brewpub. A true friend indeed. Shared with many other friends and poured into a New Belgium tulip."
Got this in a trade with barleywinefiend. You da man Josh!
"A huge thanks to Jerz and VacaX for making the trek from Long Beach to Russian River, and fighting through the mob to bring this back to So Cal. They're champs for their efforts, and I don't know how I'll begin to repay them."
By the time we got to the bar to ask for growlers. They told us it was gonna be a while but here's a couple glasses to enjoy while you wait.
My 300th review
"I acquired a growler of the infamous Younger from vacax (thanks mate)! Served it in a Bruery tulip glass. I poured 3 glasses of RR brews and compared them. Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger."
"Multiple draught and growler samples over the past weekend. First sip last friday at the release day which was supposed to be the start of a release week, though things didn't exactly work out that way. Walking into the Russian River brewpub, the aroma hits you at once. Yes, you heard correctly; I just rated the aroma by entering the room. Elder is probably my favorite DIPA, so a side-by-side was necessary to really get a feel for its larger nephew. The color is a deep gold, going a touch darker than Elder. The head is small, with some sticky white foam lingering in a slick. Oddly enough, at first, Elder has a much more expressive aroma, leaning on more pine and pungent dankness. I do a double take on Younger: there is a touch of alcohol and orange showing but it seems pretty closed. Temperature is definitely key with this beer. Many larger DIPAs (or TIPAs in this case) seem to benefit from a cooler serving temperature that lets the hops keep the upper hand over the malt sweetness. Younger breaks that mold because it is about as dry as you can get and still maintain balance in a beer this big. I have heard that it has been sweeter in past years, but can't say firsthand how this years release compares. All that I can say is that the sweetness never becomes at all bothersome. Sure, it is evident when compared right next to Elder, which elegantly shows how dry the style can be, but it works perfectly with the massive hop load. Let the temperature come up a few degrees, and the hops become incredibly juicy and expressive, showing all kinds of orange, mango, and grapefruit. There is a similar resiny dank touch as you get in elder, but it is overall rounder, fruitier, and juicier, probably helped in part be the additional perception of sweetness. The flavor is just crazy hoppy without being at all abrasive. This is one amazingly smooth beer, with just a hint of alcohol in the finish to remind you that it is nearly eleven percent full of it. Bitterness is almost mild to start, only building to full strength toward the back of the tongue. Mildly malty and sweet, but it's pretty damn had to pick out much definable malt character over all the hops. Medium-full body with smooth carbonation. Just about the perfect consistency for a beer like this, with the hop oils contributing as much mouthfeel as anything else. Younger has a surprising amount of subtlety and balance for a beer this big and hoppy. It definitely has more nuance than most big DIPAs, and may even be a touch understated. In the end, it works perfectly just like Elder works perfectly, just from a different approach."
Amazing.
"A-Beautiful color, golden light amber, clear"
"I'm scoring this from when I had it on tap at the 2010 friday release at Russian River. I am going to pick out the aroma/flavors from a growler pour at home during this review, but I wanted to give it the on-tap score because the mouthfeel is better on-tap."
"Long time BA, but a first time reviewer. I think I've chosen a fairly worthy beer for my first review."
Sharing my buddies growler during the big game.
Believe the hype... that's all that really needs to be said about this beer. perfection. 
"Had it on tap at the brewpub on release day...in a word unbelievable. One sip and my perspective of IPA's was changed forever. Completely destroyed my taste buds. Sticky and chewy in the mouth. Today (2 days after release) I just opened a growler and it is just as awesome. It is IPA perfection. Floral hop scent, good head, a little cloudy. The hops resonate in my mouth and the bitterness removes all saliva. If you are a hophead this is the pinnacle of beer."
"On-tap at the brewpub on release day, less than 20 minutes after opening. Poured into a generic 10oz nonic. Consumed on a sunny day out on the patio."
I truly believe that not enough good things can be said about this beer. I had it on-tap at the release day. I also split a growler of it with friends the day after the release. Very fortunate to write this review. 
"Had this on-tap yesterday and am having it from a growler now. If this beer were available year-round, I'd drink nothing but. "
"After standing in line for that long, just about anything would taste good. So I had several glasses to make sure my judgement was clear."
Kinda bummed only got one growler. Waited in line from 1-3. They ran out of growlers while I was in the bar. Our waiter was kind enough to search out one growler for us. There was even some jerk who bought over 20 growlers.
I got 4 growlers of this today at Russian River Brewery.
Sitting in the taproom sipping a younger.
"I've had this elixir twice --- once during its regular Feb. '09 release at the Eastside Tavern in Olympia and once, surprisingly, at HopFest at Brouwer's this past summer."
"Review transcribed from a RB review from Feb. '09. I have actually only had this beer once, and I was fairly drunk at the time. Mark my words, I will practically live at Russian River Brewing when this is released in '10. So did it live up to the hype? In a word, yes. This is a sweet hoppy nectar of the gods. It really just doesn't get much better than this. Had it on tap at Toronado in SF."
"Okay,so this is one of those great hype beers, the father of all IIPAs, etc., etc."
"othing. Seriously, this was a nice treat. Pours gold with a thin white head. Juicy hop and citrus aroma. Flavor was very fresh with the with sticky pine and floral hops dominating and citrus fruits coming up in a close second. Slightly sweeter than expected, but it still has a nice dry bitter finish. This was very nice."
"Had this at lucky baldwins in pasadena, ca. They had an IPA fest going alll week with rumors of a PTY keg that they would crack sometime during the week, so i went a couple times out of the week then last minute i went again and BEHOLD! it was finally on tap! i grabbed two glasses of it and enjoyed the SHIT out of them."
Had this at the Local 44 in West Philly during Philly Beer Week. Awesome lineup of RR brews on tap! Review from notes (3/15/09).
I had to fly all the way across the country to try this beer and just stumbled into a bar that happened to have it on tap. Lucky me.
"Oh YEA!! This was all it was purported to be. Had it on tap at Russian River last week. Poured (in a 10 oz. glass) to a bright orange-red color with good head and lacing. Strong nose of hoppy citrusy grapefruit hit me as the waitress approached. As I nursed it along, the 11% abv also became much more noticeable. Mouthfeel was very full and slightly tingly, and the taste was a very dominant bitter grapefruit blended perfectly with alcohol and a touch of malt to round things out. I sipped toward the finish, which was long, very smooth and warming."
A: Poured into a snifter at the Bottleworks Grand Re-Opening. They had a great selection but my mind was already set before I walked in. Golden orange with burnt lemon and butterscotch hues. Infusion of well balanced hazy copper rich tones. While lighter in complexion than my expectations it is a fantastic looking beer. Perfect pearl white head that fluffed up like thousands of minuscule marshmallows. Retention was strong. Sticky crystallized lacing all down the glass. 
2012 batch...
Viggo was nice enough to share this one. huge thanks eric!
"HUGE thanks to nerd for hooking me up with this growler IP at DLD, I owe you man, been waiting a long time for this one. "
"Thanks very much to Grant for sharing this growler at the Brick Store Pub. I've somehow missed this every year in California even though I'm usually there every time it comes out- sadly I'm usually working too hard then to seek it out or go up to Santa Rosa. I love the Elder, and this beer is every bit as good as I'd hoped. Pours golden with okay head and some excellent lacing. Very nice for a growler. A beautiful blast of pine on the nose with some lovely sweet caramel malt providing a nicely layered backbone underneath. For me, the taste is perfect. Sweet malt and a heavy dose of extremely fresh tasting piney hops that have just oozed their oils into this brew. Some nice citrus on the finish as well that combines with the sweet malt for a nice slightly candied finish to the herbal explosion that came beforehand. Deep flavors that roll on and on. Exquisite. The mouthfeel is at first prickly with hops and then smooth with creamy malt. Looong finish. Utterly delicious. I could drink this all day and pay for it later. Not as dry as the Elder of course, but even more deeply flavored. A masterpiece from my favorite brewery."
"I was finally able to try the mighty Pliny the Younger on tap during the Drafting Room's Hop Fest V. I originally thought they were going to tap Pliny the Elder, but they tapped Pliny the Younger instead. What a pleasant surprise!"
"Served on-tap at TJs a few weeks back, from my notes. "
Had on tap at Naja's in Redondo Beach.
"A: Color is rich, pale hued but with an orange and honey goodness. Not a lot of head or lacing, but the carbonation appears bubbles up in champagne-reminscent strands."
"On tap at Union Jack's in Boyertown, Pa as part of Easter Hopfest '09. Served in a tulip; 10.5 oz. serving."
"On tap @ Union Jack's (Boyertown, PA) on 4/11/09. Part of the '09 Easter Hopfest. "
Two 10oz tulip glasses on tap Saturday 4/11/09 @ Union Jack's - from cell phone notes:
"Had this on tap at Falling Rock and damn was it good. It had a tremendous aroma of grapefruit and hops. On the palate, it was big and malty, then a wave of intense hop flavor the likes of which I have never experienced before. The pure essence of hop flavor. Bitterness came slowly, but eventually saturated the back of my mouth and did not leave. A looonnnnggg finish."
"Served in a snifter at Capone's on Sunday morning March 29th, 2009. What a fantastic event. Kudos, as usual to Matt and his peeps. Double IPAs and strong sour beers at 10am on a Sunday, BooYa Grandma!"
"On tap at Tria Washington Square - I drove 30 miles to partake. Tria was exceeding fire code capacity when we arrived at 6:45, so I had to take the wife to Banana Republic to spend some cash and kill some time. Luckily the kegs were still dispensing when we returned at 7:30."
"finally i had the holy grail! On tap at Tria for their thurs barrel tasting series. Poured into a crystal wine glass, great glass lacing and clarity, wonderful color. And the smeill, as I would expect from a RR beer and having had the elder, great piney floral hops hops and more hops..."
A - pours a clear slightly orangish yellow with a nice fluffy white foam that left plenty of sticky lacing
On tap at Devil's Den in Philadelphia. My first visit there and certainly not my last.
A - Classic IPA coloration of amberish golden
"I am not into overhyped beers, but PtY really is as strong as the reviews indicate. Straight 5's fromm me. "
"Got to try this on tap at Capone's. Pours orange with a thick white head. Aroma of nice hop oils and crackery malt. Flavor is quite malty with a sweet finish. A bit heavy and harsh at times and not as citrusy as the growler version I had. Certainly not as citrusy as Elder. Second time around I was less impressed by this one. It is a heavy IIPA and at times overbearing. Fun to try, but I think I'm done seeking out this one. Elder is better!"
Russian River- Pliny the Younger
On tap at Capone's on 3/29/09. Served in a snifter.
On tap at Capone's...
On tap at TJs Everyday. Saved my notes so this could be review #400.
"so, after a couple of years of wanting to try this I get a growler courtesy of a gracious CA BA. Intense yet not brackish bitter piney resinous hop heaven! Smooth, so easy to drink. Wow. This one lives up to the hype. I don't know how they pack all that hop into one beer but it's well worth it. Funny note from day 2 on the growler. I popped the top and was greeted by the most insane rush of pine. It was mind boggling."
When I was lucky enough to get some of this beer it was a day old open growler. I liked the beer but I bet it would be better freshly opened.
Had this after the Firkin Fest at the Green Dragon. I would have rather had this early in the night but it wasn't an option. After drinking warm cask conditioned beers all day this was as an exceptional way to end the event. 
Had on tap at the South Philly Tap Room. Served in a wine glass.
"3/20 @ Russian River. 10 Oz. glass. Pours clear caramel with a head that quickly turns into lacing. HUGE aroma of grapefruit, pine, caramel and sweet malts. Equally huge taste. Finish is extremely well balanced. Hard to believe it's 11%. Incredibly drinkable. Very gracious to try this tasty treat!"
"Pours a golden orange into a Chimay-ette glass. Yes, that be a mini Chimay, a glass reserved for the heathens and the wannabees for such holier than thou brews! The rest of us, with permission, drink from a standard Chimay glass. Alas, we all fail. As this beer, and so many others are better consumed from a wine glass in my opinion, but alas, I digress. Brew looks good on the pour yet an off white head dissipates swiftly, leaving little lacing."
Just had this on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philly.
On tap at Union Jacks in Glenside. Served in a 10oz serving.
On Tap at the Local 44 event.
On tap at Local 44. Great event.
On tap at Local 44 and the Memphis Taproom yesterday
On tap at Local 44 and Memphis Taproom in Philly yesterday.
"Was able to do a nice vertical of the Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder, and Pliny the Younger."
Enjoyed this one several times throughout the week of it hitting seattle. First was at collins pub
"Had on-tap at Belmont Station in Portland, OR (they had it on tap for only one day during their IPA week)"
Served at Obriens $5 for a 10 oz. tumbler.
"Enjoyed on-tap at Uber Tavern in Seattle, WA as my first beer of the night (clean palate!)"
"Served cold, in a pint glass, on tap at Catalyst in Fort Collins, Colorado."
"On tap at O'Brien's, once again. Served in 10oz. glasses, a brilliant yellow gold with pristene clarity and a pure white 1/4"" foam head."
3/6/09 10 oz pour at O'Briens (x2).
"10oz glass poured on draft at Bailey's Taproom. Color somewhere between golden and amber, without much in the way of a head. Aroma of sharp, floral, piny hops, with notes of pineapple and cannabis. Palate is a straight-up hop bomb, possibly the hoppiest beer I've had outside of fresh hop season here in Oregon. Grass, pineapple, and cannabis notes peek through the sticky, syrupy, hoppy backbone, while a touch of bready malt comes through to balance things out on the finish, only to be overtaken by a serious grapefruit character that lingers long after the swallow. A fantastic offering, although somewhat brutal on the palate. But, if you love hops like I do, you've got to try it."
For sure one of the best IPA's in the world. Pours an orangish brown with a silky beige head. 
Appearance- Orange Amber liquid with a fluffy off white head
Tons of cheers to Beerzebub for this one. 
Appearance: That same hazy golden-orange color of the Elder with the same cloud-white head. the head sticks around for a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass.
"Had on tap at Fathers Office in Santa Monica, CA. A nice suprise on a recent trip there. Pours copper, looks virtually clear, with creamy head and decent lacing and retention (note: bar lighting was not the best so this is the best I can get to the look). Smell was superb. A nice kick of piney hops with some caramel maltiness. There is a presence of alcohol but nothing terrible. Taste was great as well. A strong citric kick to it, stong tastes of pineapple and grapefruit I thought. Strong malt backbone, a bit of a sweet caramel taste. Warming on the way down and leaves behind a nice hop bitterness to it. The first sip is pretty intense I must say. The mouthfeel was perfect I thought. Very smooth, somewhat silky...just great. Not too light or thin, but not too thick or creamy. Overall a great beer, not that anyone is suprised. I could easily have a couple in a sitting. I, unfortunately, had to drive so I could just enjoy the one. But between a great beer and a great bar, this was an amazing beer experience."
I have long since given up on milestone beers. That being said this beer is a milestone all on its own so I am going to make it review 900. It has been my holy grail for the past year or so and a great big fucking thanks goes out to Talisker for once again hooking a brother up!
Sampled at the 9th Annual Double IPA Festival at the Bistro in Hayward.
I had this one on tap at the Horse Brass pub in Portland.
I finally got the chance to try Pliney the Younger at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver and it was well worth the wait.
"Falling rock had this on tap, and I didn't want to miss it. served in small snifter at the half pint volume. "
Had this courtesy of gford217 - thanks!
"On tap at the Falling Rock $7 per 1/2 pint, wow. Served in a wine glass, nice orange color, smells amazingly hoppy like Pliny the Elder. Tastes bitter, hoppy, stronger. Honestly I think the Elder is better. This didn't seem to add hoppy value, only alcohol. A delicious IPA but the elder is better as far as I'm concerned."
"Evan, who works at Brewbakers in Huntington and is a regular at Beachwood, popped in and was nice enough to trade me some of the Abyss '07 I had just bought for a few pours from one of his RR Growlers of the newest PtY batch. Many thanks to him for allowing me to finally try Younger - it was worth it."
"Memorable Quality: The smell is an out of this world basket of hops, the hops punched me in the face like I have never experienced from a beer before. I felt like I was chewing a hop plant. I thought about this beer for days after I drank it, thoroughly deserving of the hype, the best hoppy beer on the planet."
"Pours from growler golden honey, substantial head dissapates to in impressive thin bubbly swirling lace that refuses to fade. Not expecting this with a brew of such girth. Rings of lace cling to the snifter. Pungent citrus hop aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, and sticky sappy pine needles. It's hard to keep your nose out of the glass on this one. Taste is again a rush of citrus hops with a nice piney bitterness. Some very lite honey like malts sneak in mid way. Mouth is smooth but somewhat sticky. Finishes with a slight boozy warmth that coats the mouth with some apricot and again piney bitterness. The 11%abv was extremely well hidden and way to easy to drink. This was simply fantastic. Thanks so much Chris, for the unbelevable opportunity to try this from the source."
It was on tap at Collin's Pub Seattle
"Found the Younger on tap - not once, but twice - today in Portland. 10 oz. pour at Concordia Ale House (tapered glass - $8), 10 oz. pour at Henry's Tavern (snifter - $6.25)."
Update 2/24/2010-
A- This had a slightly foggy dark golden color. The head held up petty well. The place I was in was a bit dark so it was hard to see all the finer details of an appearance.
Thanks to Grant for sharing this lovely growler treat.
"Poured out of a growler, shared by an extremely generous California BA, poured into a tulip."
"I got to enjoy this monster of a beer, thanks to beachbum1975! "
"Appearance: Pours an enormous sea-foam head that takes quite a while to subside, I quickly gave up the wait and fought my way through. Nice lacing all the way down the glass. I prefer a dirtier IPA with spots and flecks, this one was a clear peach-orange-lemon-amber. I love the sound of a RRBC growler opening."
Sampled from a growler.
I don't give up all 5's very often but this one deserves it.
Poured from a growler into a big wine glass at 50 F/ 10 C.
I had this on-tap at Toronado today so run and get some while they still have it! 
"Huge fan of Vinnie and Russain River. I went to the TION night at O'briens and the line to get a tast was out the door, to the street, then down to the back of O'briens, and almost to the restroom. No joke! "
"BIG, Huge Thanks to Abecall98 for providing this in a recent trade. AWESOME trader... Growler sent from CA"
"Poured from a growler courtesy of tzanio. HUGE thanks!! This guy went out of his way to send me a growler, because he felt he shafted me on our last trade, which he did not. Mega-karma his way!!"
Huge thanks to Jasonm for sharing this!
On tap at Horsebrass
On tap at the brewpub. Served in a 10 oz glass.
On tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad.
Sampled from a growler in my Double Mountain tulip pint glass.
"Thanks to a hot tip, I got to enjoy a couple of the first glasses poured at the Horse Brass Pub. Served in a small nonic glass."
"Wonderful. It's chock full of hop flavor. I've had a number of DIPAs, and this beer expresses hop flavor better than any beer that I've ever tasted."
I finally got to try the elusive Younger of the Plineys. 
On tap at at Downtown Johnny Browns on 02/15/09
All Hail RR
Oh my!! This beer was hands down the most amazing beer i have ever had. This beer sent me to beer heaven. I feel really bad for the beers that i haven't tried yet because they don't stand a chance!
Wow! That is all I can say about this beer. I think I said it about 14 times while sampling it. HUGE thanks to Swnicholson for the growler!!!! 
ok.... i have waited almost 2 years to try this. HUGE thanks to my homie for sending me this in his own growler! 
Dont know what else can be said about this one. 
10 oz pour from Johnny Brown's in San Diego
"With CrellMoset's before mine, it would make this #200 on here. Shared with Chris and dkachur with Clare. "
"Growler courtesy of urwatuh8 - many, many thanks for perhaps my #1 want. Split several ways w/ dkachur, proteus93, and one other friend (who has just begun to appreciate DIPAs - beeradvocacy at work!!)."
"2009 version. I've had this year's version a couple times, at Beachwood BBQ and Verdugo Bar. The hop aroma is much more pungnet in the nose than I remember, and I can taste a smoother, more balanced beer in this year's version. Some caramel and bready notes emerge alongside with the intense, puckering hops, and it's slightly cleaner too. Overall, I like 2009's version a little more than the 2008 version, and the latter was pretty awesome as well."
"Half pint at Russian River on 02.06.09. Board behind bar listed PiY as 10.5% with GOBS under the I.B.U. One of the most unique colors of beer I have ever seen. No head in sight and the glass was glowing orange. All I could do was stare for a few minutes. While doing this, I could smell Younger from a foot away. Crazy giant boozy grapefruit whiffs. Really. Chewy as hell. Grapefruit taffy. Cascade spearmint jolly rancher. Enormous whopper of a DIPA. Exceptionally drinkable for the size. Had a tulip of Younger Sunday night @ Toronado and could have had 6 more. But what's the point? This beer is the shit."
"A- Pours a super bright, crystal clear golden orange with a nice white head. Not too much in the lacing area though the only thing holding it back."
"Alright, time to review this beer finally. Current batch is drier than the last batch with less sweetness apparent from the malt. Citrusy and resiny hops just dance on your tongue with a beautifully filling yet light malt profile. This does live up to the hype. Better than last year as well. I'm loving this. So go, get yourself a pint of this beautiful beer."
Finally got to have a pint of this one. On tap at Pizza Port San Clemente.
Thanks to urwatuh8 for the growler.
"Finally got my hands on this one. Called Father's Office, found out it was finally in, and practically threw the lady in the car and raced off. I was not about to miss this. "
An incredibly huge thanks to Adam (Nanoslug) for sending a fresh growler of this to me. Served in my Kuhnhenn tulip.
"22 ounce hand bottle shared by Bobby91w. Pours bright sunny yellow with good whit head. Dank pine and Juicy Fruit nose. Just a big bold blend of hop goodness. Medium body. Balanced finish. Certainly a great beer, I'm just not sure it lived up to my expectations."
"Poured from a tap into a 4 ounce taster glass...Finally had my chance to taste The Younger, and oh my GOD, what a day to remember. First the sample, then meeting Vinnie...the brewer himself."
Huge thanks to Scott (swnicholson) for scoring a growler of this for me. Poured from a cool looking growler into my Corsedonk tulip glass.
I have waited over a year since I moved to the Bay area to have this beer and I was at Toronado the day they received the kegs. RR delivers on Thursdays to Toronado btw...might be good to know from time to time.
"HUGE thanks goes out to bifrostguard for this and his FIRST trade! Delivered on my doorstep on Saturday 2/7/2009 and shared with pwoods (&lt;-- this guys owes me a shit ton! Just kidding), DrewOSU and Ftownthrowdown."
Got another one of the always welcomed infamous emails/calls! These get togethers are starting to become epic!
On tap tonight at Monk's Kettle. 
"Huge thanks goes out to a very helpful and patient BA, largadeer. Thanks again Chris!"
"On tap at the Sonoma Wine Exchange (Wine Exchange of Sonoma?). Pours a yellow to orange and transparent, with a nice white head. Sticky, sticky lacing. Clear and gleaming in the light. Smells very hoppy, citrusy, but also very heavy on the alcohol. Some pine notes. Flavor is quite good. Very bitter, very hoppy. Citrus hops dominate, but again there's a pine sap presence too. Hops blow out my taste buds pretty early on. More of a malt profile than the Elder and definitely a more prominent alcohol presence too. The massive hops and alcohol don;t really work to its benefit, imo. Elder is a great beer because of how it manages to cram all that good stuff in and not be overwhelming, while Younger IS overwhelming. Still, its very tasty, just more on the overly aggressive side of things. Full bodied, but also a bit syrupy. Drinks well, but again, i prefer the elder."
Managed to get this at the brewery within the one week they had it on tap. A beautiful ride up through Sonoma County with apogee of a great beer.
"a - bright golden color, fairly clear with a slight haze, good sized white head with very good retention and lacing"
"My 100th review! WOW! And the perfect beer to enjoy on such an occasion. I had the chance to enjoy this beer twice. Once on 2/6/09 at Hollingshead in Orange, and yesterday (2/10/09) at Beachwood BBQ. This a combination review from both tastings. "
The downright worship of this beer is remarkable to me. A girl at the bar sounded like she was having an orgasm after each sip. But on to the beer.
A - pours the exact same color as Elder but with less head and very little lacing
on tap at the Toronado SF.
oh day of days the younger has come to town. as I sit here with my buddy olie I wonder about this beer. how can anything be this good in liquid form. easy younger can be.
On tap at Toronado. First keg tapping of 2009 in the yay area...Reprazent.
On tap at Toronado. Poured into a tulip glass.
"Finally...the elusive ""Younger""."
"Served on tap at O'brien's TION night in a 10oz taster. One of the first pours of 2009, I almost didn't want to drink it. The first keg blew in 7 minutes..."
A- this is the best looking IPA period!!!It glows.
On tap at Capone's. 
"Perfect 5 you say?! Well, I'll let you guys in on a little secret. I cheated a little bit, filling out these scores. Don't tell anybody, though... the truth is, I may have had beers that looked better than Pliny the Younger. (/sarcasm)"
Sometimes a beer kept in such high regard can falter when actually faced with reality. This beer somehow became even better than the old stories I had heard for years befor having the chance to try it out. 
"Served in a large mouth glass, the head was firm and perched on a nice golden pedistal."
Drank on-tap at Stone Brewing (Just freakin' 8oz pint glass. I want BIGGER!!!). 
Another tasty treat found at The Liars Club after CBC 2008 in San Diego.
"Thank the heavens, finally some Pliny! Thank you, Lucky B's!"
On tap at the Bistro DIPA festival.
"On-tap at Lucky Baldwin's in Pasadena, CA. "
Naja's Place - 3/28/08
on draught in a pint glass
On tap at Naja's! I was excited.
A: Crystal clear golden/light amber color with a very nice thick white head; especially from a growler. There is pretty decent carbonation. It is a bit lighter than I expected.
Props to DrSeamus for sharing his growler.
Thanks to Drseamus for bringing the west coast love.
"On tap at O'Briens, San Diego."
"3/1/08: What a day here in Denver. We spent our time outside enjoying the 74 degree winter heat, had some friends over for a barbecue, threw some darts, drank beer, played basketball with the kids, could it get any better? Yes, yes it can. The mailman delivered a package, not just any package, this was beer mail. Ladies and gentlemen, Pliny the Younger is in the building!"
"Huge thanks to rayjay for getting a growler of this to me in the mid west. He hooked me up with some great beers, but this was the best one he sent me"
"Pours a crystal clear and glowing amber orange. Big carbonation bubbles come up and a thin white head caps it off, leaving sticky spots of lacing all down the glass. I can only imagine straight from the tap."
"While in Santa Rosa I visited the brewpub and filled my Growler, brought it home and poured a small glass. I have waited a long time for this to be available and it was worth the wait. Without a doub this is the best over the top DIPA I have ever partaken, and this is my favorite beer type. Poured a hazy gold tending toward orange with a soap suds head that left big chucks of lacing. Huge citrus hops nose, and a rich mouthfeel that feels like port wine on the palate. Flavors are citrus hops and the finish is long and bitter, but enjoyably so. I was prepared to be disappointed after the long wait, but this is the best brew ever for me. So sad I only have a growler. I really love this beer. I was going to save a 5.0 for the very best. This is it!"
"Appearance - pours a hazed light orange amber. Very little head, but after transfers from tap to growler to bottle to glass, well, I can be forgiving. A thin layer of bubbles appears and kind of limps off to the side."
"Thanks a million to jwolfie70 for providing me the chance to try this rarity. Also, thanks to SirChugsAlot, kersta8, dsigmon, beavers, and NJpadreFan for the kind words in the thread that SirChugsAlot made. jwolfie70 saw that thread and decided to offer me the growler. So, Thanks everyone!"
"We are, we are...youth of the nation. On tap at O'Brien's in San Diego. Poured a somewhat hazy orange color. A good head when poured although did dissipate during the tasting. Some viscous sticks to the glass when you swirl it."
So I finally got to try this at hollingshead
Enjoyed on tap at Hollingsheads. Poured clear orange with ample but short lived head. I'm amazed a beer so hoppy can be perfectly clear like this.
Served to me in a Chimay chalice at Hollingshead's.
"What can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said? I believe this is my third or fourth year having it, and it has always been incredible."
"I enjoyed a half liter of this at Hollingshead today. I have never had a sip of alcohol at work for my entire life, but given that I expected this to be a once a year opportunity, I made an exception. Halfway through, the barkeep casually mentioned that they actually received five kegs instead of their usual one. So it goes."
2-13-08
"An exeptional beer. It pours a deep red copper, with a small white head. The smell is dominated by floral hops. The taste is definitely sweet, but it is balanced out nicely by a very strong floral hop taste that keeps the beer from being too sweet. The aftertaste is dominated by the hops. The beer leaves a hop stickiness coat on your mouth. Definitely a beer that I would recommend trying."
"12 ounce pour at Hollingshead's Delicatessen in the city of Orange for a whopping seven dollars after tax, 16 ounce pours were nine plus tax though, expesnive but definitely worth every penny"
"Poured off the tap at Pizza Port C'bad on 2-9-08. Poured into pint glass a golden color with no head by the time the bartender handed it to me but a lot of cotton candy lacing. Smell is like running through the NorCal forests of Humbolt while holding an grapefruit in one hand and in the other pineapple.( in other words giant forest pine aroma mixed with grapefruit, citrus, and tropical fruits.) The Taste was pine resin hoppy at first with a monster sweet malty backbone. But as it warmed up the bitterness took effect adding layers of citrus rinds to the pine flavor with the sweetness still there but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is as full as a TIPA could be without being cloy or overdone, it was sticky with a light creamy carbonation. Considering its 11% ,extremely hoppy and bitter, with a giant malt backbone this beers has a balance of those extreme features that keeps it from being a one hitter quitter beer."
I was skeptical of the hype for this beer but cutting to
"Bright peachy orange color. Nice fresh hop aroma, leans toward ripe citrus but also some earthy/herbal notes too. Nose is clean, citrus hops, with a permeating but pleasant bitterness that carries some ripe tangerine flavors. Slightly viscous, full mouthfeel. Malt provides perfect vehicle for all the hops, without getting in the way. Really nice hop complexity with the perfect amount of bitterness to finishing ratio. Hop flavors are complex, with leafy earth and pine coming through after initially ripe citrus burst. While this IPA is a whopping 11% abv, it is not overly sticky, cloying, or too sweet, and the alcohol is almost undetectable. Probably one of the best versions of the strong IPA style I've had, and almost worthy of its reputation, but not the lines and inconvenience of many of the release events. Tasted @ Toronado 2/2/08."
Served on-tap at the Toronado on 2/2/08.
A- Tangerine colored brew pours with a light head which dissapates fairly quickly with some lacing.
WOW!!
"Golden-amber in the glass with the faintest hop haze and a quarter-inch of white froth. Head retention is very good for such a high gravity beer, and the brightness and clarity are impressive."
Thanks to weeare138 for this one.
Had this beer a couple of times at some beer tastings in the East.
"12 oz. pour, at Hollingshead Delicatessen,"
Poured from a home bottled younger some months ago but never recorded. Recording on revisiting it this evening.
Clear faded orange liquid with quickly rising bubbles. A frothy bright white head rises up thickly and settles down to a firm half inch cap.
"OH MY GOSH!! [sorry about the cap lock, intentional though]"
Props to Redwood George for getting a bottle of this to someone in the Chicago area!!!
"Pours a pale, hazy gold. Creamy head of white foam sits steady."
Had on cask at Naja's Place on my 21st birthday.
"On tap at Capones in Norristown, PA."
"Nice golden color with an off-white head that retains well and leaves a decent lacing. Absolutely mind blowing aroma. Full of citrus; grapefruit and pine and other aromas I can't hardly begin to describe are not only blended perfectly, but are powerful enough to greet your tongue from a foot away. Amazing taste of aforementioned aromas with a strong, yet amazing bitterness. The bitterness seemed like it came in waves; extremely bitter, but only pleasant bitterness, not harsh at all. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a dry finish, leaving you wanting more and more once the explosion of taste leaves your mouth. I would drink the hell out of this if given the opportunity. "
"HUGE THANKS to todd1 for this growler. You are a god among men, sir."
On tap at Capone's 4/18/07.
Second of a group of growlers donated by kind hosts to the beer-sampling cause after being retrieved by a long road trip several days prior. Carbonation levels somewhat lower due to this treatment. Still sampled in reasonable condition and without having to take a personal trip down to Philly to have some. 
"Sampled on-tap at Capone's in Norristown, PA on 4-18-07 as part of a side by side comparison with Pliny the Elder. This review is from notes taken that night."
Many thanks to redwoodgeorge and mntlover for making this possible.
Pours a clear copper/golden color with a solid inch off-white sticky head. I honestly didn't spend much time eyeing this one as the aroma when the bottle cap was popped kind of put me into a trance. Wonderful punget hoppy aroma. The aroma almost dares you and invites you at the same time.
"On tap at the Toronado. After drinking Pliny the Elder too many times to count, I finally came across the much heralded and harder to find Pliny the Younger on tap. Like the Elder, the Younger pours beautifully with a clean, coppery orange and a nice two-finger head. The smell is pungent with citrus/grapefruit hops, but with less of the sweet pine and floral character you sometimes find in the other good IIPAs. Not a bad thing - just different and you know this one is going to hit you big time with the bitter end of the hops. Flavor is dominated by grapefruity bitterness, but kept in check with a biscuity malt. Mouthfeel is medium and fairly smooth for such a big beer. My only real complaint is I find this beer to be a little more astringent and hot with alcohol on the finish than I like. Where the Elder is the epitome of balance for me, I find this one a bit unbalanced. Some like this, but to me it makes this a ""have a pint and then Im done with it"" kinda beer. Another excellent effort by Vinnie, the Yoda of IPAs, but Id rather hook myself up to an I.V. of the Elder for the night!"
Presentation: Standard pint from tap
"Advertised as a triple ipa at hollingshead's. Nice hoppiness on the nose and mouth. The hop level is high, but the cascades (with another hop that I don't know) make it citrusy and easy to drink. A lot of ipas are just hop bombs with nothing else. This beer is a hop monster, but has enough malting (especially a delicate caramel malting) behind it to not just be hop oil. The alcohol presence is also not too extreme even though this an 11 percent abv beer. This beer is a work of art and you need to go out and drink it. Stop reading my review and go drink it NOW!"
"I have had this beer four separate times. I have in front of me four separate pages of notes and my head is swirling with how to put this all together. Twice I did a side by side with the Elder and the Younger. Clearly these are two, TERRIFIC beers! The Younger is the strong muscular, steroid juicing aggressive loud ostentatious, sibling to the more refined, Elder brother. Pliny The Younger gets right in your face and smacks you around until you pay attention. Wow!"
"On tap at Hollingshead Deli in Orange County, CA."
"On tap at Union Jack's on the Manatawny. Presented in a wine glass. Appears a rich golden amber-yellow with a finger of fluffy white head. Smells of grapefruit, apricot, pineapple and sweet malt. Tastes of the same fruits evident in the nose, predominantly grapefruit, alcohol. Just about the perfect balance of piney, fruity hops, and rich caramel malt. Finish is very dry. Moderate in both body and carbonation. What a sublime DIPA."

"on-tap at Pizza Port Carlesblad. The more aggressive version of the elder in a side-by-side tasting. Hop attack of the palate, and a lot of malt. Powerful hop attack, common amoung the double IPAs I have had, is not satisfying to me. The elder is much smoother, and now my favorite. White head. You don't detect the alcohol in the taste, but it's there!"
Much thanks to jgaston for the growler!
Appearance: Light amber/golden color and very clear with smallish white head that stays around and provides some slight lacing.
"On tap at the Liars Club. Served in a 10 oz snifter. This is a true hop heads dream. the smell is strongly of west coast hops, piney, citrusy. The hops dominate the smell as they do the taste. you dont get too much of the malt here but the hops are what you are looking for in a 2XIPA. This just tastes like fresh hops smell. The alcohol is there, but not in a bad way. I could get really drunk by dowining alot of these"
I've had every batch of Pliny the Younger and I wasn't about to miss out on this latest one.
"Again, big thanks to mcallister and pixel for having us over and letting me sample this prize. Much of this review compares the younger to the elder. Younger again is gold in color, maybe a bit lighter. Nice thick white head, which held together very well. Great piney aroma, not quite as much citrus as the elder. Very sweet, a huge malt backbone. Piney and citrusy hops, but without as much peach flavor as the elder. Nice full body. Big, but not boozy, the alcohol is very well hidden. This is very enjoyable, and I understand why this is rated so highly."
A - Pours a brilliantly clear golden orange with a 2-3 finger white head and spotty lacing through the finish.
Good looking indeed. Nicely carbonated with a large white and fluffy head that leaves some sticky lace behind. 
"Originally reviewed on February 10, 2005. Handbottle. Aroma is fuming blast of acidic fresh spritizing strong and sour citrus of grapefruit, fresh spruce and a hint of perfumy essence. Pour is a oranged yellow rimmed clear pour, with a lacy spotted sheets on the class of clean white. Flavor is a sweet fresh grapefruit, lime and cilantro. Savory and gushing with a gentle sweet maltness that superbly comforts and carries the hops as a delicate and sumptumous hop elixir. A true ambrosia. If the malt lent a little more character, and the hops were a little more transformed into that mouth warming bready goodness, this would be a top 10. Nonetheless, its an astoundingly drinkable high alcohol brew, with all those flavors carried perfectly, yet not leaving a harsh impression on the palate. Finishes actually quite sweet and floral, as opposed to typical dry grass, instead with lemongrass and a sweet cinnamon candy."
Served on Cask at Naja's Place in Redondo Beach.
"Wow! On cask this beer takes a different form. I love it from the tap, but I find it difficult to drink more than one. From the cask, the smoothness allows for many pints. The ABV does not."
Served on-tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia in a 10-ounce tulip-type glass.
"I was lucky enough to have this delicious beer at the Grey Lodge in Northeast Philadelphia. Props to them for bringing in the goods. I must admit that I had a pint of the Younger immediately after a pint of the Elder, so my palate was certainly well worked over. However..."
This is based on notes from The Drafting Room and The Grey Lodge.
"Clear orange with a thin, cream coloured head. Spotty lacing was evident from the fine bubbles, which showed excellent retention. The aroma was all hops - powdery, floral, tangerine, pine, and grapefruit, not necessarily all at the same time though. There was a lot of malt sweetness up front, but a very strong bitterness hits at the same time. Floral and citrusy hop flavour fills the midsection, with mild pine, orange and tangerine. Spicy alcohol appears towards the end and grapefruit bitterness really lingers. Full bodied served with moderately low carbonation and significant alcohol warmth and numbing. Drying hop finish with slight stickiness. This is really good, really powerful. Highly drinkable for such a big beer. Everything is just turned up on this beer - a lot. I think I prefer the Elder as a beer I could drink on a regular basis - this one seems to be fit more for special occasions. I'd be a happy dude if I could get either on a regular basis..."
"I had this on-tap at The Drafting Room. My glass was filled with a golden copper color liquid with a thin white head. Some lacing was left but not like the amount left by the Elder. The aroma was filled with pine and citrus from the hops and a sweet caramel / tofffee scent. The flavor followed the smell. Hops were there but so was the sweetness. Somewhere in between a 90 min. and a 120 min. with the sweetness. Very smooth and not as bitter IMO as the Elder. The abv in this one (11%) limited me to only two glasses but they were tasty. Great brew, but I think the Elder comes out on top."
Served on tap. Appeared copper color with a grapefruit smell and taste. The alcohol wasn't overwhelming at 11 percent and I considered it very drinkable. .
"On tap at Tria in Philadelphia, served in a 13 oz tulip glass. The beer poured a vibrant copper color, clear and with a thick off white head that disapated slowly and gave way to a nice ring around the end and a swirly island in the middle. The aroma was a strong pine and citrus nose that was similar to the Elder but kicked up a bit and more pure and extreme but enjoyable. The taste was very similar to the taste. There was the initial hoppy, piney taste with some citrus, grapefruit and a touch of sweet caramel. The mouth feel was very smooth with a nice alcohol burn on the way down that tells you this is a 11% beer. What a smooth ride the Younger was. I was expecting this to be hard to handle but found this very enjoyable and drinkable. I had 2 in this sitting and will go back for more wherever I can find it. Another RR hit and it has been a long time that I have waited to try this."
"Poured a bright golden color with a medium sized, creamy, white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of piney hops, citrus fruits, tons of resin, caramel malts, and light alcohol. Strong pine in the taste, more citrus fruits, bitter grapefruits, with some sweet malts, and alcohol in the finish. Much more enjoyable than DFH 120."
"Despairing over not being able to get this on tap at the RR brewpub, I was overjoyed to find it on tap at Toronado in San Francisco."
"I had this on tap at Naja's in Redondo Beach. It was presented in a tumbler, and had a pale orange color with a thin foam comprised of big bubbles. The beer was very clear which I guess I didn't expect."
Much thanks to hopdog for this hand filled bottle...don't know if/when I would ever see it on draft around here.
"I was pretty excited when I saw this on tap at the Toronado towards the end of their barleywine fest. Pours a hazy golden copper body, with a white fluffy head. Tremendous aroma, delicious west coast style hops. peachy, grapefruit, intense. First taste, so smooth, you don't notice the 11% abv at all. Tremendous beer, probably the best DIPA I've ever had."
"From my notes on recent trip, poured into a sampling glass."
"Appearance: Arrives at the table with a hazy light amber body, a solid head and lots of splashy lacing"
thx george
"22oz bottle obtained via trade with RedwoodGeorge. Thanks for the opportunity... Brewed 1/3/2006, hand-bottled via counter-pressure system 1/19/06."
"Thanks to RedwoodGeorge for this handbottled bomber, counterpressure filled from a keg and sent off to me. Pliny The Younger pours from the bomber an amazingly clear bright orange/peach color with a half inch of frothy bubbly white head on top. Slow carbonation rises up to meet some sticky lacing. Aromas of beautiful, vibrant hop cones attack my senses with bold citrus, grapefruit and pine needle aromas. A sweet, slighty doughy caramel undercurrent is present as well. Quite possibly hop nirvana. Green, leafy, floral and quite simply enchanting. Wow."
"1/2 Gallon growler. Mild peach color, bordering on orange. Unbelievable hop aroma, loads of fruit, particular grapefruit and orange. The aroma is very vibrant and fresh, but also extremely dry, emphasis of an enormous and ridiculous dry hop, which we all know Vinnie has trademarked. The body is very rich and full, giving not only malt balance, but a variety of rich malt flavors, especially caramel and toffee, along with a light fruit platter. The hop character is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous, but in such an unbelievably great way. Wow, such a hop monster, but still balanced in a completely maniacal way."
"Received from the BA's BA, RedwoodGeorge, as part of his recent Home Bottling Project. Thanks a million George for bringing smiles to this hoppy beer lover, along with many others."
Sampled thanks to RedwoodGeorge and his most Excellent trade!
"I recently had the pleasure of enjoying this lovely beer in a lovely 2 liter Russian River growler. Shared samples with some friends at Bethlehem Brew Works, then revisited it a few days later so I could write about it. "
"Pliny the Younger made the journey across the country in a 22 oz. bomber, bottled from a 5 liter keg using a counterpressure filler by BA RedwoodGeorge. While the bottling was unofficial, the beer coming out of bomber was in a very good shape. The head was one finger thick, which is a little small for the style, but it did stay put for a good little while. The underlying body was clear pale orange, and well carbonated. The looks were classic DIPA, while aroma took the style up a few notches. The smell was enticingly grapefruity, and peppery, with a very sweet smelling malt backbone. The juiciness of the smell was certainly mouth watering, and the taste did not disappoint. Quite citric and pungent, the hop laden flavor was cut by a lot of malt sweetness. The low perceived bitterness and well hidden alcohol made for an easy to drink brew. The mouthfeel was sticky, minerally, and thick, with a peppercorn zest in the aftertaste. With so much to enjoy in each sip, there was nothing to complain about the time that I had draining my imperial pint. The alcohol only became evident as the beer came near room temperature, but never did it feel like an obtrusive spoilsport. This drank much easier than the 10.5% strength it possessed would have suggested. A craft brewing masterpiece that deserves all the hype it gets. This beer was big, but still in a very delicate state of balance. Muscular, clean, and beautiful, there was none of the sloppy flab in here found in so many big beers. A Charlize Theron among beers."
Presentation: A Growler freshly plundered and expertly filled at Hollingshead Deli in Orange this past weekend. 
"To me, this is the perfect beer. I've since had 7 growlers of it from Hollingshead and am finally reviewing."
"Was very pleased to find this at a favorite little place of ours, Pleasantons Main Street Brewery. Nice crysal clear light amber color was topped by a nice white head that retained well and left nice patterns of lace. Aroma, hops hops and more hops. Very piney and inviting. Taste, very hoppy with emphasis on the pine, fantastic freash taste and very smooth despite the high bittering. Not thick and viscous like some other beers of theis type can be. How can I give a average drinkability score to a beer that tastes exceptional? Well I don't think beers in the 11% realm are the kind you sit around and knock back. This is a great beer but I don't look to get ripped on one brew."
"Tasted on tap 1/28/06 at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. $4.50 for a 25 cl ""half"" order."
"Finally got a sample of the all mighty ""Younger"" from the Liar's Club in Mission Beach @$2.75 a glass, can't beat it."
"After months of patience, I finally got the chance to try this fine beer. I had it on tap at the Liars Club. All I can say is wow."
"appearance: that's a fine looking glass of beer, that can't be denied. Pours a nice pale, slightly amber color. That is some haziness to it, the hoppier the beer the more hazy. poured in to a pair of pint glasses to share with my dad. that head stayed along time."
"This beer pours a golden color with a nice head that falls quickly but leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very well balanced with the high level of hops and maltiness. Smells very nice. The flavor is much the same. Very hoppy and resiny, but the malt backing is just right to make it very well balanced. Finish is very bitter. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is very good for the abv."
"Served on tap at the Brickskeller in DC in a pint glass. Cellar temps, to boot."
"Thanks to Kmpitz2 for sharing his growler...I wouldn't have done it for him. This beer is just too good. I have often criticized Double IPA's for trying to acheive balance when IPA's are supposed to be completely out of balance. This beer taught me better. Sweet and bitter can come together in a great IPA. The look is solid but to be expected straw, golden with a haze and incredible head retention. Aroma is bitter and hop flavored solidly, but not to knock your socks off. A boquet of hops is the fullest and roundest that I have had without intimidation. The flavor is a combination of sweet malts that hinge on confectionate sugar and cotton candy with a yeasty (almost musky) aura about it that adds much complexity. The hops give tremendous, but not sharp, bittering and pine, oak, nut, ginger, nutmeg, and pepper flavors. The carbonation always kept the beer soft and creamy. Never prickley or hot. Finishes a combined sweet and bitter. Not as drying as you'd think. The high alcohols hit only in the aftertaste and never become fusal or too sweet. This is truely and ideal beer."
"Pours a hazy peach color with a 2 finger white head taht sticks around very well. Just doesn't look dark enough for me. Nose is sweet and hoppy. Citrusy sweet with a nice caramel background. Light notes of earthyness from the hop. Decent spun sugar sweetness. Very enticing IIPA. Flavor is all about balance. Citrusy hop and deep sweet caramel malt blast initially, with just a touch of earthyness from hop. It fades to a mellow caramel sweetness and moderate, but very calm and mellow bitter on the finish. Wow. Everything is in awesome harmony. Feel is thick with a light to moderate carbonation. Bitter hangs on just long enough to beckon me back in. Burps are also all about the balance...sweet and hoppy. Drinkability is way too good on this one. Just looked and saw the 11% and I don't believe it. Hot damn. I am very pleased with this to say the least."
"A huge thanks to Kev for sharing this one. Also thanks to Lou91 for bringing this from Cali! 2L growler poured into a snifter. It pours a hazy medium orange color with two fingers of head. There's a decent amount of lacing. The smell is pure hop juice. Hop oil is what you get here! I'm lovin' every bit. If I knew what heroin was like, this would probably be damn close. The taste is also chock full of hops. The maltiness is there just enough to hold the beer together, but the hops shine through. No alcohol in sight, it's unreal. The mouthfeel is so thick and heavy. Just wow. The drinkability is beyond all awesomeness. I cannot believe this is an 11% brew. Lies I tell you! All lies!!! A really really fantastic beer."
"I was lucky enough to have a friend bring me a growler of this, last month after a trip to Northern California. Immediately after opening the growler the hop punch hit me. A bouquet of hops almost overwhelm me. It poured a golden haze while the aroma continued to permeate my senses. The balanced foam head filled out what looked to be a picturebook painting of what a pint should look like. The scents still swimming around my nose: piney, gorgeous hops with a slight citrus undertone. It was a complex aroma that was truly remarkable. "
"Mostly diminishing, but initially generous white head takes position above a straight golden body. Extremely complex hops nose hints at most nuances you can think of, all ahead prefumey and piney, but underneath hinting at a broad range of citrus fruits, leafy and minty in nature. Might gain a bit from being less liquorous, but this nose is truly fantastic, magical hoppiness Id dare say, with maltiness being certainly felt if not exactly managing to show any flavours all the way through the hops. Palate is oily, full, slick, tannic and liquorous, hence surprisingly sweet, but it works thanks to a controlled level of citric acidity."
"Growler split between a few people. Crystal clear golden orange body with a tall off white foamy head. Sticky and clumpy lacing galore. Huge hoppy as hell aroma that is spectacular. Pine and citric hops just bombard your nose. Some nice floral hops in there as well. Very light sweetness in the nose that seems to be just enough to make it seem balanced even though this is overflowing with hoppy goodness. The flavor is packed full of hop goodness. Very juicy with hops and it has a good amount of the hop sweetness that I taste in 120 minute but without going overboard. Citric, pine and floral earthy flavors are there in abundance. Pretty much hop juice is the way I would describe it. Its fairly bitter but not to the point of being a palette destroyer. Mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth for the strength and the hoppiness. Just the right amount of body to it. No alcohol to be found anywhere. It couldnt be any more drinkable, it almost went down like water. While most of my other favorite double IPAs are the smack you around and rip your tongue out kind this one manages to be a super refined and smooth hop bomb that managed to stay balanced and still hoppy as hell."

Many thanks go to RedwoodGeorge for this wonderful fresh 67.6 oz/ 2 liters of pure heaven on earth.
"Ap: Hazy straw color, nice white head, fades pretty quickly, but hangs on exceptionally long for an 11% ABV brew. Collar remains indefinitely. Bubbles rise to the surface at a slow pace due to the apparent viscosity of this big brew. "
Used 5 tickets to sample at the ABF. This is a combining of the notes I took each time..
"thee triple ipa of the west coast, had it on tap at the toronado's 18th birthday. served in a tulip. "
"One 1/2 pint wasn't enough, so I had a second."
I had this beer served off of a hand pump at Naja's in Redondo beach served in a 8oz chimay glass. I have no idea how they could possibly improve this beer. OUTSTANDING. 
Sampled (a few times!) at the ABF. One of a very select few beers I bothered to review while attending the ABF. Pliny The Younger was served up at the VIP session of the ABF.
"I swear, I want to have Pliny's alien love child. Forget that I'm male and have never met an alien."
Had this bottle at American Beer Fest in Boston.
Poured from a growler imported by brewandbbq from the sacred hop grounds of Russian River . . .
"Poured light gold and hazy from the growler, white, rocky head with a myriad of different sized bubbles. Quickly settled down to a thin whisp of carbonation."
"once poured from the growler, the brew slipped over the lip of the pint, and I had to suck up some...pre-inspection, I'm wowed by this beer! Holy dribble cup, Batman!"
On tap at O'Briens. Served in 10oz glasses. (2nd batch)
"Poured a clean light orange with a nice fluffy head. Laces all the way down. This smells like hops. Hops, hops, and more hops- it has the signature cascade piney hop smell, very citrusy. This is what God must drink when he wants an IPA. Massive hops, but very very smooth. Whereas some IIPAs are over the top and almost undrinkable, this 3IPA is bitter but very flavorful, with fruity notes and floral-piney-citrus-juicy taste with a clean bitterness in the back. Its well balanced and not overly extreme. The drinkability is high. Too high. So high in fact, that the bartender (who knows me very well) warned me that it would go down easy for an 11% brew. I could not taste a single % of that 11. I could drink this all night, but that would probably result in alcohol poisoning. "
On tap at the Russian River Brewing Company...
"Appearance  This one came out a deep, rich orange in color with a monster head that just refused to go down."
On tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad. 
Poured a hazy golden buutterscotch color with a creamy white head. Sheets of lace down the glass.
"Served at Naja's, Redondo Beach in 8oz. (owner approved) servings and unlimited at O'Brien's, San Diego in 10oz sevings. When first in posession of this beer, I had NO idea what a triple IPA was supposed to taste like. I thought maybe a Dogfish Head 120 or a Rogue I2PA? No. This beer is amazing in color, smell, taste and drinkability. I've tried pretty much every Double IPA that I could get my hands on and I was convinced that a tie between PizzaPort's: Frank and Pliny the Elder was fair. Those are GREAT beers but Younger follows after Elder and is simply astonishing and amazingly well balanced."
"This is not beer, it is hop juice. That said, it is the tastiest thing I have ever put in my mouth. Had on tap at Lucky Baldwins."
"A stout, small top covers up the ruby-tinted, dry and sticky orange frosted body. Nose is sweet constantness in a mighty, floral hop blast."
Billed as a Triple IPA with an ABV of 11.0% according to the taphandle.
01/27/05- Purchased at the Toronado on tap. I need to mark this date in my palm pilot as the day I had the best beer ever created by a human.
The pinnacle of West Coast style... Enough said.
Served on tap in a conical pint glass at Toronado Bar in San Francisco.
"I had this on a trip to Denver from Virginia. I definitely agree it's one of the most balanced ipas I've ever had, but it's nothing to go crazy over. Very enjoyable but it will not shock your senses. Definitely try it if you get the chance though :)."
Hoppines is overwhelmingly harsh.
Coming from the east coast I was anticipating getting one of these in SoCal. This is a good beer but I have to say I am a little disappointed.
Bottle poured into Dogfish Head IPA glass
"Excellent. Hoppy, balanced, dry. Pure resin and dank citrus hops."
The most balanced IPA I have ever tasted.
"08/2013 - The nose is dank, aromatic hops with some floral, malty notes up front; orange, pine, more malts on the palate; very impressive mouthfeel; bitter, sticky, chewy finish, yet it's clean and quaffable. That's a scary thought. One of the best West coast IPAs out there!"
"Pours a medium straw color, very clear, lots of carbonation bubbling up, foamy head recedes appropriately. Nice piney hop aroma with a touch of citrus. Pretty flavorful, hops provide plenty of bitterness with a piney flavor, lingering bitterness on the finish. Carbonation is present but not overpowering. Overall a solid DIPA, but today there's lots of great beer being made locally that I prefer. I get the high rating, and I am sure 10-15 years ago this was sought after. Not so much anymore. Worth trying if you come across it, but not worth hunting down."
"Hazy gold color - very nice looking. Hazy with a one finger white head. Bright citrus notes on the nose that really work. Taste follows the smell with nice, strong citrus notes, mostly grapefruit because of the medium to high bitterness. "
"Solid beer, very smooth and drinkable at 8% ABV. My tasting notes are from a draft pour, not a bottle. Nose: citrus and pine. Hoppy beginning, and dry finish. Powerful beer overall."
"Pouring from a 510 ml. bottle into a snifter glass. This beer pours out extremely clear (which I love) and golden in color, resembling apple juice. It forms a rocky and dense one finger white crown. The smell is a beautiful sweet smelling element like honey and comes in with slight resin and pine. Almost reminds me of hopslam based on the smell. The taste comes in a little more bland than expected. It has some ""crystal"" sharpness, if that's right. Seems like a lot of crystal malt was used. I wish it was either more dank/piney or had more sweetness. It has a sticky mouthfeel throughout but finishes dry. Overall, with no disrespect, can somebody bring me a Hopslam?"
"Bottled on 07/19/18, poured into a sniffer glass. Looks like a copper orange combo. Smells like grapefruit, pineapple and a hint of pine. Has a slight hop bitterness up front followed up with grapefruit and pineapple going down. What I love about Pliny the elder is the smoothness, it goes down dry and easy. I would drink this every week if it was more available."
"pours a clear golden color into 19 oz. Guinness glass from 510 ml. bottle. nice white 1 1/4 "" head which quickly dissipated to a thin white layer leaving fine lacing. citrus grassy/piney aroma but not overly hopped. a taste of citrus, grapefruit and pine with slight well balanced bitterness. Excellent brew."
"Although easier to get than Pliny The Younger, I personally prefer Elder."
Very good DIPA but only on par with the PNW fresh hop IPAs today. Tasty but only on par with the other delicious seasonals we will taste in the next month. Glad I was able to try it but not a cut above others on the class.
Poured from 510ml bottle into Guinness pint glass.
"A floral, citrusy, light, natural smell, like a sweet spring day. So easy to drink, goes down smooth, very subtle aftertaste. Light lacing, shiny gold body. A real gem."
This easy sipped double ipa is dangerous. I didn't
"7/19/18...on tap at Monks in Philadelphia. Pours bright gold, thick white foam. About 1/4 inch. Grapefruit malty nose,. Taste is even keeled, smooth grains and malts flow through. Super dry finish. Subtle but firm hop bitter. Pears and dried fruits are noted. Spectacular."
"Definitely good, hard to review it without factoring in the hype that this beer receives. I feel like it was definitely top tier compared to many IPA's I've had, but not sure it is worth the ""drive across the country"" hype that it gets. Great aroma, good blend of citrus and bitter flavors from the hops. Definitely great, not sure it is as legendary as people make it seem."
Picked up in Santa Rosa
Amazing feel. Not much in my opinion on the way of smell. So smooth it’s ridiculous. I can see this beer being beyond amazing ten years ago but in the new eWorld of hazy neipas this one is very good but not amazing.
"Smooth, full, and delightful."
A gold standard beer. The beer that instantly comes to mind when one thinks of a West Coast IPA and for good reason—extremely hoppy yet perfectly balanced at the same time. Just try it if you ever get the chance.
Smoothest tastiest beer of all time
Served in a tulip glass from the bottle. 
Long in the tooth
"In my opinion, Pliny the Elder is the epitome of what a strong IPA should be. What makes it great is the combination of a big character & taste, with unparalleled balance & restraint. A trifecta of piney hop bitterness with a touch of tropical fruit, a sturdy tasty malt foundation, and a slightly boozy & dry alcohol strength. This is not an extreme, experimental, or revolutionary IPA. Rather, it is simply an everyday, after-work strong IPA, made exceptionally well."
"Can't add anything that hasn't been said, so I'll just put my thoughts in."
Finally had this beer on tap. Very solid IPA. Interesting to taste this beer in light of today's IPA styles. I can see why this was an exciting beer when it was released. Very easy to drink for the ABV. Now I need to find Pliny The Younger!
"There's a reason why this beer is THE benchmark DIPA in the judges manuals. The balance is bang on when it's kept and drank as intended. This is a beer that absolutely must remain cold until you are ready to drink it. I have had this beer on numerous occasions and I will say that after about 30 days, the nose tends to open up more and that beautiful character really starts to shine."
"Just perfect. On tap at the incomparable Monk's, in Philadelphia."
"As good as it gets, consistency is the key and this hits every one of the catagories hard. Aroma starts with a smooth pine smell. Taste has several layers that encompass pine hops, all the way down to some flavour of apple, lime and pine apple. Highly recommended. Easy to get in California. Love it on tap"
"Super excited for this one. This is my 100th review, and for this special one, I am pulling Pliny the Elder out of my fridge. Now I came upon this brew about 2.5 weeks ago, when my new best friend Daniel asked me if I liked beer. I informed him of my beer reviewing hobby, and he proceeded to show me two bottles of this rare beauty he had just gotten from a friend. I was flabbergasted when he gave me one, just to spread the love. Thank you, Daniel. This review is for you."
Great brew by Russian River. It’s solid although I have had one bad bottle but overall the hops are on point and it’s something that’s very easy to keep sipping on! Can never go wrong when it’s on draft!!!
"Picked-up two bottles, courtesy of a trade with Treesonbrown23. Bottled-on dates of 3/28/18. This is the White Whale for us an the East Coast. Very nice, smooth brew. Did not quite live up to the hype for me, especially with all the great brews in New England, but it is very good."
"Yummy, had to wait to find this one."
"On draft at the Toronado in San Francisco, I was disappointed in the taste as seemed to be all hop and not much else. I would like to revisit this but that may never happen again since the limited availability. I thought it would be more like Bear Republic's Cafe 15 Racer or Dogfish Heads 90 Minute IPA."
"This beer pours a bright clear gold with a solid head. The aroma is classic through and through, with notes of grapefruit pith, orange peel, pink grapefruit flesh, and pine. The flavor is utterly clean and classic, with bold bitterness, grapefruit peel, orange peel, dry pine, juniper, and dry caramel. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with plenty of carbonation and a dry, bitter finish. Overall this is a spectacular beer. I have tasted before but this is my first full one. It really does live up to its reputation - there is nothing unique here, but it is instead a near perfect example of its style."
Simply the best ipa on planet earth. The color of this beer is just pure sexy. The nose is mind blowing and the taste and feel are second to 0 beers. I’ve only drank this beer at the Santa Rosa location on draft.
One of the smoothest IPA's out there. This one can get you in trouble if you're not careful as it can sneak up on you.
Bottled 2/12/18. Consumed 3/4/18. 
"I quit drinking 5 years ago, after having meticulously rated hundreds of beers. The white whale I could never catch was Pliny The Elder. But now I'm back, this once, for one last dance."
Most favorite beer of all times!!Always!!
So dang good not at the same level as younger of course but very enjoyable.
"Another over hyped beer that may have been considered great years ago, but just can't stand up to the multitude of other great beers out there today."
If you love IPAs you absolutely can't go round and this is a DIPA
"The ultimate Double IPA. Unparalleled in taste, smoothness, and balance, this beer is rivaled by none. The closest East Coast beer to Pliny the Elder is the now retired Victory Hop Wallop."
OK. So I'm from OZ and living the dream!! If I had never tasted the younger this may have been my first 5/5. Thanks to all at RR- it has been a rare privilege- I will be back .... and in the meantime if anyone says what about a tap takeover in Brisbane - you guys would smash it out of the park - my dream job - RR rep in OZ!!!!!!!!!
"This is a very good example of what can be done with hops, and a counter to what should not be done. Let's be honest. It's still too hoppy. There's really no call for it, but at least they've managed to get it balanced so that you get an interesting, complex and still drinkable flavor. Equally hoppy beers exist, but they are almost always undrinkable. This one isn't. The hype surrounding it isn't warranted, but it's a good beer."
Nelson beer Super Bowl LII
Yellowish gold color no haze. Unreal aroma. Huge floral and piney flavor with a hint of citrus. Medium feel with a big dose of hops at the end. Havent had many of the northeast brews and if they are better i cant wait to try them because this is the best beer I have had by a good margin
"On tap at Belmont Station, Portland"
"Great flavor, similar to heady topper but with a more acerbic finish. Recommend highly."
"With everyone and their mother going in on the crazy obsession with unfiltered ipas, I've really come to appreciate the Pliny even more. This beer is still perfect among west coast ipas. Bitter, piny, extremely balanced and dry, without any apparent alcohol present, and coming in a dated bottle. Pliny is world class!"
"Could be called “Piney” the Elder. Super piney hop aroma balanced with some citrus. The pour is golden brown with a nice head. Strikes a good balance between bitter and malt, assuming you love hops. One of my faves...when I can find it!"
"This beer is a classic. A trendsetting brew, the first double ipa. Still done well, but competing with New England style orange juice looking brew. I have suggested to the brewery about doing an unfiltered version. Well, at least I suggested that to the guy outside who checked me in.."
Bottled 4/5/18.
Enjoyed this Beer a week ago. Received as a Christmas present here on Ohio. Loved the aroma and beautiful color. Nice citrus smell and taste. The finish was very smooth. Would love to try on tap when've I get back to CA. Looking forward to bottle # 2.
"Very good beer, but also very overrated."
510ml bottle date of 12212017
"Its good, but I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed. expected to be blown away, but it was just a good, clean, clear IPA. Nothing really stood out. Had fresh at the brewery, brought home bottles and hosted a tasting with a nice assortment of Vermont IPA's, and two Tree House brews. Pliny was at the bottom of the heap, universally. Wanted to be blown away, but it just didn't do it. Granted the style is different from New England IPA's."
"12/19/17: $12 + tax and tip, 1 pint 1.25 oz bottle poured into a snifter at West 4th and Jane. Light blond clear pour, minimal head and carbonation. Strong pine aroma, hops, mixture of sweet and strong hops. One of the strongest aromas from a beer I have ever had. Hops and pine predominant tastes. Strong mouth feel, firm, dry pleasant drinking. Overall excellent beer, thanks David for the tip!"
This beer is very dissapointing
There is not a better IPA . Anywhere. This would get a 100/100 if it was on a 100 pt. Scale. Bravo Russian River. Bravo
"This was a gift for a friend, who shared it with me. I'd always wanted to try it, and here it was. Incredible, It is the standard by which all other IPA's should be judged. Slightly Hop forward, piney, and smooth. Perfection in a glass."
Amazing but strong.
"What can be said about this standard setter that has not already be said? I happen to love it and consider it the Gold Standard in American style IPAs. Fellow hop heads will say its over-rated, no so great, etc. I call bullshit. Its an awesome beer when you can get your hands on some, and never let it age, the quality suffers quickly."
Probably the most over-rated IPA out there. Solid. Tasty. I'll gladly drink it when I can. But no-where near world-class.
"This beer is amazing. But it is not interesting. If you can understand the difference, and why that matters, then maybe we can all stop hyping Pliny so much. Still, if you can get your hands on this beer, do so. You won’t be disappointed."
Wow. This beer actually made me like IPAs. Piney and citrusy. Smells like the forest. Tastes like a Christmas tree.
"Thin head with a nice clean color. Citrus, pinapple and piney smell."
Wonderful hop aroma and piney flavor! A very clean approach to a just above average ABV with the century mark on the IBUs. A very well balanced beer - definitely worthy of being a world class brew.
Could not tell this beee was 8% alcohol and 100ibu. Great balance for such a strong ipa.
"Liquid Gold. If you have a chance to snag a bottle, DO NOT pass it up."
This is hands down my favorite beer. I wish I could find it more. Nice piney hoppy flavor. Not too bitter. Has an incredibly smooth almost salty finish. Not too boozy for a DIPA. Just perfect.
Difficult to find fault with this one.
"The absolute gold-standard of double IPA's and IPA's in general!!! As far as I am concerned, it is Pliny's world and everyone's trying to be like him! Number one on my list!"
"great IPA, have definitely had better though, great hoppy flavor"
"TONS of hype surrounding this beer. Its good, really good, in fact. I just wouldn't line up around the block for it. Its a DIPA thats smooth and not crazy hoppy while maintaining sort of a floral backend to it. Its light and easy to drink but I find myself wondering if this beer was easily accessible, would it still have the same ratings here?"
Don't believe the hype! There are many other DIPA's to seek out before this one.
A: crystal clear; deep gold in color; 1 finger white head that receded to a thin film; very nice lacing;
Classic IPA. Bright fresh bitter pine notes with a citrus linger. Less than a month old with a strong malt backbone. Better than most west coast IPA's but in the saturated market the king has lost his crown these days.
Smoothest drinking double IPA I've had to date!
Great taste.smooth
"So. Wow. But not in a good way. Or a bad way. It's fine. It's good. Not great. Doesn't come close to Heady. Pours a clear light gold. No sticky lacing. Aroma is an even blend of pine and citrus. Taste is similar, nice and bitter, but no real juiciness to this. Feel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. My favorite part about this is the semi-dry finish. Overall, good, not great. Try it if you've been looking but definitely lower expectations."
I didn't want to believe the hype on my trip to CA but damn if it isn't that incredible!
"L - rich, golden color"
Bottled a month ago and tasted alongside a 5-week-old bottle of Blind Pig
Almost perfect
Absolute perfection.
"Bottled 8/18/17. Pours a lovely golden straw with a bit of a chill haze and a foamy, dense, pure white head that sticks around. Aroma is citrus, pine and stone fruit with a hint of candied fruit. Amazing taste. First sip starts bitter pine and grapefruit pith. Strong finishing bitter bite. As it opens up, sweeter citrus and stone fruit comes through. I get a lot of peach. It gets better with every drink. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, well-carbed and crisp. Outstanding all around beer."
Master of beers.
This beer will be hard to top!
I thought this was the Holy Grail of beers until I got tired of begging for a bottle from the local liquor store. There are several comparable Double Imperial IPAs that are as good without the hassle. This has become an overrated also ran.
"Pours a clear vibrant marigold colour. Citrusy hoppy aromas, sweet pale malts, piney hops, and a little spicy. Smells big and rich. Heavy bodied but the flavours are lighter than expected. Earthy hops, citrusy fresh spruce tips, a bit of passion fruit, some floral notes, and a squishy body throughout. Balanced and well-rounded with a clean finish."
"Tasted from draft. Pours a clear gold with white head. Aroma is floral, pine and resin hops. Some mild floral notes. Taste is incredibly smooth. Goes down way too easy. Nice clean bitterness balanced by a very nice malt backbone. One of the most balanced IPAs I've ever had. Pine, floral, caramel, grapefruit taste. Excellent beer. Definitely one of the best."
"Probably the most perfectly balanced IPA in all the land. Love it when I actually get bottles of this great brew. Clear dark golden orange color, and goes down very smooth with a pop of bitter on the back."
Outstanding
Bottle dated 6-6-17. DFH Tulip.
"Best beer I have had. A friend sent me 2 bottles from Davis, Ca.. Drank both watching th SF Giants win there 1st World Series. Ironic? You tell me."
This beer is what most west coast IPA's should shrive to be. Boldly assertive yet bitter. The fresh pine that comes through this beer is tempered by a perfect balances of hops. This beer is world class
"Seriously, why review it? if you've tasted it you know. Its amazing. Like the all father kissed my cheek. Odin has blessed us with this beer."
"A very nice IPA. Looks great, has tastes good, pleasing aroma, and is smooth. Probably over hyped, but an excellent brew. Looking forward to finding the Younger."
"Great IPA out of Cali. I put Heady Topper above it, but it's really an awesome west coast style IPA!"
"If you have never had some of the other top ranked beers, then this beer is great. However, it can't come close to any of the Northeast rock stars. You could call Pliny Bud after drinking a Julius or a Heady."
one of the best beers i've ever had.
"Finally found Pliny on tap in a small joint in SoCal. It is all that is cranked up to be. Clean refreshing, hoppy goodness. Drink it cold and fresh. I'd tell you where I found it, but I can't. This is my happy place. Though I'm 3000 miles away, I need to know there will be some left there on tap if I ever return. If you can find Pliny, drink it. It is the Holy Grail of beers!"
L: pours clear Amber color with a finger of white foamy head
This beer has a hazy golden look with a thin layer of head floating above that dissipates in about 3 minutes. The first sip was delicious in every aspect. It has an original thought out balance between a citrusy sweet and an excellence of hoppiness. It finishes with a hoppy finish on the back of the tongue going down and a spirited aroma going through the noise. 
"Pours a somewhat hazy golden color and leaves the same color body with a one and a half finger white foamy head that dissipates within less than a minute, carbonation is seen rising, light lacing is left in the wake but not that much as I thought I would have seen; the aroma has a combined citrus and piney hops up front and very powerful that it lasts through the entire drink, however, there are some malts that do come through ever so lightly as it warms; the flavoring is mainly bitter but has a light citrus sweetness comes through in the malts, strong bitter citrus/pine aftertaste, super dry finish; its somewhat easy on the palate or as much as a DIPA can be and assaults the palate as a superior DIPA should; overall, a superior DIPA that I would very much have again if available, but I got this in a trade and wouldn’t mind having it again"
On tap to pint glass at Monk's Cafe (Philly). Clear amber with lots of retention. Lots of pine and sweet aromas in nose. 
"Bottled 050517, after wanting to try it for several years now I was shocked to find a bottle."
"Excellent beer, came across this brewery on a trip to California. Glad I stopped in ! Simply put, Pliny is the best IPA I've ever had and that's saying a lot !"
Various pour on different beer ware.
"Awesome beer, super smooth"
"On tap at Russian River in Santa Rosa, CA. The hype is real with this one. I tend to overrates beers that I like, but this one really stands above the rest in a very clear and obvious way. Try it and believe."
"Finally!! Picked up this beauty at Vendome Wine & Spirits in Beverly Hills, CA. Poured into a Bruges glass, Bottles On date was 04/24/17. 8% ABV."
Best beer in existence. Everyone should try.
"On tap in a pint glass. Glad to finally have the opportunity to try this one (thank you Denver). Pours a straw yellow with a touch or orange. Dank and resinous. I expected more complexity from this beer - particularly given its pedigree - but it tends more towards one not, which it hits, and hits well. This beer trends more towards the blend of dank, thick, and piny that Heady hit so well, and did it well before that time. It's a great piece of craft beer history, and still holds up well, but though it's an exceptional beer, it's no longer one (in my opinion) that warrants a place among the best of the best. Though it may have been the first, many breweries have come along, duplicated, and improved upon what this beer had going. Excellent, but no longer world-class."
"On draft at Marriott Marquis in San Francisco. This, to me, is the quintessential IPA. Strong citrus and floral flavors, great nose. Wish this was available in Milwaukee. It's a beer worthy of its rating."
"Not overrated at all. Tastes like what an IPA should taste like, and thats how its been described. Easy to see why this is the holy grail of IPAS. Strong citrusy, piny smell with a great amount of hops."
Given as a gift. Thank you!
"Poured into a tulip glass, a beautiful hazy orange color with a bright white head that holds pretty well. Very floral nose with some pine and a touch of citrus peel. Won't know you're drinking a DIPA, as finishes much cleaner and lighter than most. I'll admit that for me it didn't live up to the hype, but a very clean, crisp and bright beer. Definitely deserves accolades, but by no means blew me away. However, it's a pioneer beer for the style and I certainly wouldn't turn it away if offered."
"Truly outstanding beer. It's tough to get, but worth it if you're able."
Pretty much what everybody else has said about it.
"This is my favorite beer. The theater associated with it! Great color! Classic IPA notes, but not too bitter. Grapefruit rind, and lemon with some apple."
"Pliny the Elder looks, smells, and tastes like beer...a really good beer for anyone. It's an IPA, but it doesn't kill it for people who says IPAs are too hoppy."
"Well where to start with this one..... hands down one of the best beers if not the best out there. This one definitely did not disappoint. The look was absolutely beautiful and crisp like a diamond. The smell was beyond what you would get with a typical DIPA a semi hoppy and friendly scent. The taste was probably the best part about this because the taste was so fresh and so delightful that grapefruit and the fresh hops and pine flavors all go extremely well together. The feel and finish was somewhat on the dry and somewhat bitter side I almost couldn't tell that it was this smooth. Overall one of the most if not the most beautiful and freshest, crisp, and clean beers ever created and does more than check all of the boxes when looking for a nice and fancy beer. I recommend to all to try it."
On tap at Liberty Alehouse in Santa Monica.
Had it a few times on draft and a few times from a bottle poured into a pint glass. I don't have much to add to the multiple exhaustive reviews. Currently drinking an extremely fresh one.
"Pours a unblemished golden straw color with a thick frothy white head. Nose is floral, pine with a bit of light citrus. Beautiful taste transition, first you get that smooth light citrus, orange and grapefruit peel, fades to floral and then finishes pine like. Minimal malt profile here but it is still a balanced beer meaning they loaded up this beer on it's malt base almost to the tipping point with hops but stopped short at the Percy amount! Nice clean bitterness to it if you let it sit on your tounge. Mouthfeel starts out sticky but quickly transitions to a crisp bitter clean finish that leaves your palate dry and craving for more Pliny! Excellent beer."
"From tap at RRBC. Can I gloat.... I had this from tap at RRBC! Never thought I would have the chance to try this beer, let alone from RRBC! Besides all the other great attributes mentioned from others, to what sticks out to me is the thick mouthfeel! Wow! Totally great and unexpected!"
Bottled on 3/6/2017 (16 days old)
Amazing. Hard to find. Always looking.
Bottle dated 2/13 (one month old):
"Bottled 2/11/2017, I brought home the max. (a 12pack of bottles direct from the brewery back to Chicago in my luggage) "
"Pour is golden orange. Thick, medium, Whitehead that last a while."
Awesome beer. Not as good as the hype - but what is as good as the Pliny hype?
"everything it was supposed to be, worth the wait with only one bottle secured i was disappointed there was not one more, definitely West Coast but one of the best...."
Well done
"On tap, had this right after Pliny the Younger for a side-by-side comparison. Pours a golden orange with a half finger of head. Hops dominate the smell, notes of pine. Medium feel with plenty of carbonation. Taste is mostly hops, notes of pine and citrus, with a bitter finish. Compared to Pliny the Younger, this is more bitter and harsh. Very good, but I think there are other DIPAs that are competitive with this one now."
"Bottled on 1/11, enjoyed 5 weeks later. Thanks, Jan! The bottles traveled a long ways to get here and I couldn't be more excited. Aroma of freshly cut citrus and pine needles bursts forth from beneath the cap. Orange gold pour with a frothy white cap that lingers. Taste is pine, orange rind, clementine, grapefruit, papaya over a biscuity malt. Not overly fruity or piney or resiny - just perfectly balanced. The 8% ABV is hidden until there's a bit of warmth at the end of the sip. A real gem."
Expected more for what it was suppose to be.
"Guess I'll just throw my voice into a crowded room full of high praise for this beer... this is the third time I've had Pliny and I always find it to be an incredible experience deserving of the laudation it regularly receives from those in the know. From the very first time I had this beer, I knew it was something special, yet so austere and seemingly ""simple"" that it really does exceed the sum of its parts. Here is potentially the single best double IPA in the world. A consistent, sublime experience captured in a pint glass to be savored and enjoyed. A sincere thank you to my buddy Joe, who bestowed a bottle of this (dated 1/20/17) to me as a quid-pro-quo for shepherding him to and from Logan Airport so he could attend a homebrew release party my buddy and I threw last weekend. Your attendance and contributions are appreciated!"
from bottle dated Jan 5 2017
Great strong beer with a clean finish. Always a go-to when available.
"Very fine beer but hard not to compare it to the Younger. But really, if it was a choice between this and my job, it would be a difficult decision."
"Pours a bit darker than most NE IPAs I'm used to, smells really good and the taste is good, not great. I feel like this is a superb offering of a basic concept."
Great Double IPA. This definitely lived up to the hype despite even though some people told me it wasn't anything to write home about.
"Maybe the very best West Coast IIPA there is. I was lucky enough to grab some bottles with my brother and share this great beer with him. Outside of Whole Foods in San Jose, you have to walk out of the store and upstairs to this great beer drinking spot. The bartender was great and we were lucky to share a couple bottles. "
Poured from 510ml bottle into standard pint glass. Bottled on January 13th 2017. 
"Well I finally had it, I probably over-hyped this one going in. This is just good beer. In an age where there's so much craft beer out there that it all tries to be crazy and unique, this one just hits all the marks with out trying. I tried to put myself back in time as well to when there weren't a billion IPAs on the market and yeah, this would have blown my mind. Simply put, I think this set the standard for a reason, but people are out there now successfully making beer just about as good. Not knocking this beer at all, but if you're waiting for a beer to change your entire life, that's not what Pliny is doing (in my opinion). Nice yellow color, quite a bit brighter than a lot of IPAs out there. The pine in the nose is 90% of what comes through. Mild carbonation and just a ton of hops in the aftertaste. This is good drinking, and beer as it should be."
"Very good, but in the brewpub I'm partial to the blind pig."
just 1 tasty smooth IPA. It can be sessionable
"Picked up a few at Whole Foods...$5.99 seemed like a good price. Brew date 1/13/2017, so pretty fresh!"
"Glad to finally get to try this one, not too detailed of a review there are 'Pliny' of those on here. One of the best overall beers I've had, if you haven't tried it you need to!"
Bottle dated 12-22-16 poured into a snifter about a month old. 
"Looks beautiful. Classy, almost fake looking advertisement contrived head. Two, nearly three fingers of firm, fluffy solid slightly off white foam provides a confident lacing that remains consistently about an inch high in design thoroughly across the glass."
Favorite beer ever.
Poured from the classic bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip
I've heard so much about Pliny over the last few years and I finally had an opportunity to have it on a trip to San Diego.
After more than 100 of these its time to rate. Piney aroma and taste coupled with slight tropical dry vibrant mouthfeel leading to a crisp clean very hoppy but so concealed with flavor and very little malty tone coming in a distant 4th dimension on this. Tried them all and still my amazing. You marry this kind of beer.
This might be the best double ipa i've ever had the pleasure of drinking!
"Had this at the brewery last month. After all the hype I was moderately underwhelmed. I'd definitely drink this again, but after tasting a lot of what the NE is pumping out in the IPA world, I'd much rather the fruitier juicier varieties. Having said that, this beer is very well balanced. Creamy, bready flavor without bitterness. I favored the Blind Pig over this one, but this is a solid DIPA."
"Fuck yea, amazing"
Was bottled about 1 month previous to drinking it. Tried it in a glass and out of the bottle. The clean finish was the only memorable attribute.
Very good beer from Cali.
Awesome. Everything about is.
17.25 oz. bottle dated 11/11/16
"This is it. This is probably the beer that will turn any beer snob snob into a beer snob (apologies, not really a fan of ""beer snob"" as a term but it sounds quite poetic). "
This is a solid ipa but it's super overrated some many people praise this because it's hard to find
"A clear light gold color with a nose of citrus and honey. A creamy effervescent mouth feel, a malty bitterness with citrus mingling and that same hint of honey emerging on the finish. As it warms, more is emerging. This seems like a simple beer at first but don't be fooled. There are subltle complexities here that need to be studied. That would explain the long run Pliny has enjoyed."
"Tasted from a 510 ml bottle on November 22, 2016."
Not over the top aroma but this guy packs a punch. Beautiful creamy head sits on a perfectly crystal clear amber body. There's a pine crispness and a deep woodsy undertone that carries the mouthfeel... Lingers just long enough to appreciate the complexity of the hops but not too long as to have your mouth feel caked over. I'm very impressed with this... It was on my to-do list for a long time. Cheers!
Very good. Old school
"Aroma: pine, some resinous notes, citrus/floral characteristics typical of West Coast IPAs"
Appearance - Pours semi transparent yellowish color nice thick foamy white head lasted several minutes and left tons of lacing down the glass.
"First had 6/6/15 at the Cheeky Monk in Denver. The process I went through to get this beer was insane. I drove from Easton, PA to Denver, CO just to get it. I mean I did continue on to Boise to move in my brother, but the beer was the highlight of my trip."
"Clear yellow with a slight tinge of a hue towards the red spectrum but not close to Amber. Smell is citrus dank. Hints of orange and grapefruit, almost juicy in some way. The taste is very balanced for what is supposed to be an over the top IPA. Strong pilsner malt sweetness up front followed by only a touch of bitterness on the back end. It feels medium heavy and sticky. Overall this is a solid beer That gives hope to those who do not normally enjoy IPA's that there can be some great ones out there. Malty and bitter but not overtly so."
"Poured from a 510ml bottle into a Teku glass. Bottled on 10/12/16, so roughly 5 weeks old."
Serving type: freshly bottled (10/31/16) 500 ml bottle into a tulip glass
Not an East Coast IPA.
I seriously forget how amazing this is. The two i bought were bottle on 10/11/2016.
This beer definitely lives up to the hype. While pouring it is could tell it was going to be good. It has that color all good IPAs have. About halfway through the pour the smell had reached my nostrils and what a smell it was. As good as it looks and smells it tastes even better.
Beer is a clear pale gold. Head is a nice and clean foamy white. 
"What is Happiness. From the forest green label which reminds me of the woods I grew up in as a kid in New England to the Red Circle a perfect BullsEye of perfection ""Pliny the Elder"" Simple yet such a subtle prolific statement. The cap three different tiny pushes as not to injury the perfection of the bottle..... Its happened.....the bottle is opened, what lies within is magical."
"Is Pliny an excellent DIPA? For sure. Is it the WORLD'S GREATEST BEER!??!? Not really... but it's up there and any beer lover should try it, and should also try Blind Pig, and Consecration, and pretty much anything else that strikes your fancy at Russian River. So Pliny deserves the hype, but hype is still hype."
"Looks magnificent. Good straw amber color, creamy head good retention. Smell citrus, sweet pine. Bitter taste-but smooth bit malty. Definitely gets the back buds goin. Feels smooth slick bit oily. Overall glad I got to try thanks NOYOUDIDNT."
"Pours a golden orange with a one finger fluffy white head. Aroma, grapefruit, and sappy, grassy. Taste- medium bitterness at the end first off. Lingers long after the swallow. Grapefruit, piney. Bit of alcohol in there. Not sweet. Mouthfeel is pretty soft. Overall, this is a classic bitter DIPA. Bit too bitter for what I'd prefer most of the time."
"I had it once in Venice,California for $18 but I would say it wasn't worth $18 but it was worth having."
"Light amber with a pearly white head that never disappears. Upon opening the bottle, aromas of grapefruit and pine explode, but the fruitiness tends to fade as you drink. Has the perfect balance that a well-made west coast IPA ought to; citrus, resin, malt and no detectable alcohol on the palate. This beer races over the tongue with a medium body. Delightful."
"This is a long review, so I'll cut to the chase and give the ""Overall"" first: This is hands-down one of the best DIPAs I've had in a long time. The clarity of the beer, the crispness of the taste, it's clean and unmuddled. It's complex but simple. I'm glad I have 2 more bottles."
L: Pretty pour. Clear. Scant head with lingering lace. 
"As non-hophead and as an occasional anti-hophead, I now know what you hopheads are talking about. (But it took the most iconic, if not your Holy Grail, to help me see your light.) Of course, living in the Midwest... I never expected to taste this. But coincidence had me in San Francisco's City Beer store and after they diligently went through my ""1001"" list told me that Pliny The Elder would be there at noon in two days. I showed up at the appointed time and bought three. I took one to a party that no one drank beer (lucky me again.) I took the two remainders home with one going to another party and found a fast way to make friends. (I may keep the last one to trade on BA, but I may also hog it myself this week... lucky me.)"
"Clear golden amber in color, minimal head and minimal lacing. Smell is sweet fruit and slightly astringent. Taste is bitter and complex and smooth, mild fruitiness , some grassy flavors, citrus peel. Light bodied and mild carbonation."
Good but over hyped and overrated.
"Sent from a friend in CA to me in Maine, 2 day shipping, bottled on Sept 19th drank on October 1st. Poured into a pint glass, pours a straw golden yellow with a 1.5 finger white foam head. Good lacing. Smell is of grapefruit, melon, pine, and an almost bubblegum. taste is much of the same mostly grapefruit, the bubble gum comes through more in the taste, pine, and a bit of melon. Mouth feel is typical of the style, not too thick like other DIPAS I've had though. Honestly it tasted a lot like Lunch by Maine Beer Company. Definitely a difference between west coast and east coast DIPAS though. Overall a great beer, and one I would go through lengths to drink again, but I wouldn't put it above a few New England DIPAS. Overall 4.5/5."
"Draft pour at Russian River in Santa Rosa, CA. Pours an Amber gold with a finger thick white head that's whipped creamy and won't die. Aroma is huge grapefruit, notes of honey, pine, citrus, and faintly yeasty. Flavor is bitter hops, pine, notes of citrus and a long smooth bitterness. The mouth feel is medium bodied and creamy, incredibly smooth going down. It's so round and lively fresh off the tap, and worth the trip out here."
"Nice big citrus aroma. Taste of citrus pine, hoppy, but extremely smooth, followed by tropical flavors. Extremely perishable, Must drink within 2 weeks, it loses flavor right after. Even if exposed to heat during those 2 weeks you lose flavor. I believe many who didn't give this a beer the raiting it deserved was due to getting a bottle that was greater than 2 weeks old, or delivered warm via ups/FedEx."
Got really lucky and had the opportunity to have a fresh bottle via a friend. It's everything they say it is...
Finally can check this one off my list thanks to a great trade with MitchellM.
"If your ideal IPA/DIPA is along the lines of Tree House and Trillium you will be disappointed. It is a solid beer, but it's not worth being rated as high as it is, especially in comparison to the NE coast IPAs (impartial reviewer, as in from the Midwest)."
Good solid west coast IPA.
Copper gold and filtered with lots of fast rising fine bubbled carbonation. Topped with 2 fingers of yellow tinged white foamy head.
Having been spoiled with some new England ipas and dipas can't say I love this one. Had no body to it compared to heady. Super smooth I give it that but I dont get it. Tried it 2 nights in a row to make sure I wasn't off but same taste. I guess when you have had beers like Treehouse Julius Haze Green Very Green Heady Topper Crusher Focal Banger Abner second fiddle etc you have become spoiled.
"Finally breaking 1,000 beers rated here on Beer Advocate. Go me! A celebration worthy only of a true legend, and a fresh sample at that: not even a month since the bottled on date. Props to my man out in Nebraska who hooked me up with a trade to bring this to my glass at last."
Solid all-round IPA- classic- will always be good
Perfect! It took me 6 years to finally try it. Did not disappoint. All IPA's should be compared. Just perfect!
"Look - Unlike any IPA i've ever seen, glowing, slightly amber, not a lot of head but nice lacing throughout. Very inviting."
A - clear golden Amber beer with a white head that sticks and leaves perfect lacing.
"Served in mid-July at a pizza party. The OG of DIPAs, and one that really drinks old-school too. Gone are the trends of today with the excessive haze, sweet malts, and tropical hop notes and in are the flavors of years past. Nice caramel malt backbone that carries the hops and allows them to shine in numerous ways- on the forefront of the palate is a quick blast of pine and resin, which mellows out into a grapefruit-like bitterness on the back end. Really excellent beer and one I was pleased to see didn't shy away from bitterness. Never change."
"pours a clear golden amber with a large, frothy head that hangs around. nose; pineapple, mango, grapefruit pith, hops. a very gentle & floral nose. taste; light caramel malt, light pine, mango, grapefruit rind, light onion, & orangey hops. well-balanced and the low malt lets the boil flavors shine, but i'm never a fan of the oniony vegetal overtones (which ring on the aftertaste). medium carbonation & mouthfeel. this one obviously has a longstanding reputation, but i feel like today's beer scene probably sees it swimming in an ocean of peers & superiors."
"Poured into a Pint Defiance tulip, bottle dated 7/28/16. The body is a slightly hazy golden yellow, with a one and a half finger white head. Aromas consist of strong orange peel and grapefruit, resin, pinapple and mild spiciness. Flavors consist of the same, and is very citrus forward. The bitterness is much less than expected, and goes with the dry lingering finish. The feel is smooth with medium carbonation and is medium bodied."
"Look: Hazy orange body, super creamy one finger white head. "
Bottled 8/5. Consumed 8/16.
"On tap, served in a tulip at the Library Ale House in Santa Monica. Pours Golden with a robust head. Smell is pine and citrus. Taste follows, piney, resiny, grapefruity, with intense bitterness. Relative to that bitterness, and the abv, a pretty low malt profile. Much more about the bitter than the sweet. Love that. Reminds me of why this one is a classic.  Terrific mouthfeel, too--balanced, with moderate, totally apt, carbonation. Some will now prefer the Dank NE hop bombs, some won't, but everyone should see that what this tries to do it does flawlessly."
"After seeing this on every ""top"" list for years and years, I finally got a chance to have one of these tonight - props to Ryan at the Cloverleaf for getting this for me and being kind enough to trade it! This was dated 6/1 and I wanted to get to it while it was still fresh, which was thankfully the case!"
Golden with a nice white head small bubbles stream upwards
"Got this one fresh from cali, all the way in England, just under 2 months since the bottling date. of 6/17/16. beer looks great standard for a double IPA. Smell is piney with a little sweetness. taste is piney resinous hops with some malty sweetness, really none of the tropical IPA flavours that are very popular (and delicious) at the moment more of the classic american IPA flavours. it feels good, real good. Overall a great beer and what i consider to be a nearly perfect example of this style. I got no off flavours, and perfect balance from this one."
"At first this beer doesn't blow me away, but what I love most about this beer is that the more you drink it, the more you want to drink it. For all IPA and DIPA lovers, you have to try this beer at least once in your life."
Still one of my favorite beers. Such a great smooth taste.
"Hop forward, notes of pine and citrus. I wish I was a bit older so I could appreciate it more before the mass of clones came out."
"Getting the big dog out of the way first. For my first ever review on this site, I've lucked out pretty hard. I will safely say that damn near every rumor you've heard about this guy is true. Not for the meek of heart, Pliny really is the stuff of bitter, bitter, monstrous legend. Smells like a grove of Juniper and Ponderosa, tastes like you dove headlong, tongue-out, into that grove. Pick the needles out of your teeth, sit back, and enjoy what Russian River hath wrought."
"On tap at Russian River Brewing Company (Santa Rosa, CA), served in a nonic pint. Slightly hazy amber gold with a frothy head of white foam and rings of"
"Golden in color, impeccable clarity. White head with excellent retention & lacing. Classic DIPA aroma. Pine, citrus, hint of melon. Taste follows the smell, so clean and hop forward. Mouthfeel is fantastic - medium body, moderate carbonation, & a bone dry finish. Fantastic!"
"Surprisingly subtle for what I was expecting, which suit me fine as I always find some of the big-name West Coast DIPA's overly extravagant. Very solid, very drinkable, and very very excellent."
Had it weeks after it was bottled so not fresh. Only knock I have.
"Well, not really a shocking revelation, but this is quite simply the most enjoyable IPA I've had. If you have not sought out a bottle of this do so now. Every type of beer style drinker will appreciate how truly great this beer is."
"Had poured from 17.25-oz. bottle, label stamped bottled on ""051616,"" gift from friend who visited brewery, into nonic pint. A bit late to my first Pliny, this now-traditional DIPA does not assault any of your senses, as do many newer IPAs, but rewards slow contemplation."
"Pours a very near clear (slight haze/cloud to it) yellow with a foamy 2cm white head. Head formation is nice and bubbly, with solid retention and lacing left behind. Aroma is bolstering with hops. Specifically, it has a piney, herbal, and sticky resin quality to it. The hop aromas are kept at a volume around 7 out of 10, in other words, solid, but not over powering. Taste is very much smooth pine hop qualities, with herbal and resin hop notes adding to the character. Pliny the Elder is a bit on the bitter side, but nothing overwhelming. It is well balanced, and well executed - the best part of this beer. Mouth feel is bubbly, with a slight abrasive quality in an otherwise velvety texture. It feels filling with a medium-thick consistency. Overall, it is a fantastic beer that does hops justice. It is worth noting that this beer is incredibly hyped, and while it is good, it isn't a case of the mind-blowing Master Exploder Tenacious D scenario."
This beer has been cloned over the years because it really is special. That said IPA hop profiles have moved along and in a good way. Pliny will always be a special beer and hopefully will continue in production forever. Let's be thankful Russian River created such an iconic brew and one we will continue to build from.
BIG thanks to my friend Nancy for trading me one of my home-brewed quads for this Legend of American Brewing. My fingers are trembling as I type this...tears are streaming down my face...LOL! I love IPAs and Double IPAs...this really is an honor.
Exceptional
Finally got to try this beer. I am so stoked. It is a medium amber color with a one finger white head. The head is creamy and frothy with a decent amount of lacing on the glass. A good amount of carbonation bubbles are visible in the glass. 
Strong iipa super hoppy great look & smells with malty finish. Would not drink again
"I don't get it. It's a fine light DIPA I guess, but don't get the hype. It was slightly harsher and more skunked than I expected. Yes, it has the nice citrusy and IPA'y goodness that we expected, but nothing out of worldly. I would rather have something by Knee Deep. However, one caveat. I've found that more than any other beer IPAs are dependent on their freshness and very greatly. I have previously sworn that other IPAs were great and than tried them later and not had the same response. It's possible the offering I had didn’t do it justice. Yet, I was not impressed. This was just another IPa to me. All hype. Congrats on the marketing."
"Bottle to snifter. Bottled 6/28. Very clear and light Amber. Sporadic lacing. Lots of hops, lots of malt in the nose with some pine. Hop forward flavor, obviously. Pine and citrus really shine through. Fairly well balanced. Mostly lives up to the hype, but falls short of some of the great east coast DIPAs, in my humble opinion. (Fiancé does not believe it lived up to the hype.)"
Shit is good when you drink it fresh.
"On tap at Toronado on Haight, 05-Jul-2016."
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 6-16-16.
"After months of searching I manged to find some bottles and tried ito on tap at O'briens in San Diego. Was incredibly excited to try this. First I would like to say that Pliny lives up and exceeds all expectations. Upon opening a bottle you get a strong aroma of hops, fruits and pine. The beer pours a clear golden with moderate carbonation, and leaves a bright white finger head. First couple of sips you are hit by the full flavor of hops, leaving a slight burning bitterness. But the more you drink, the more layers of flavors are revealed. Fruits and spice become more apparent as the beer settles. A slight sweet malty linger backs up the hops on the tail end. Overall a very dynamic beer with a depth of flavor rarely seen. Very, very good and a must have for those who haven't tried it."
"Bought a case at the brewery, after trying Pliny The Younger."
"Had this venerable ale on draft at the Monk's Kettle in SF. Ale was served in 16oz pint glass, deep yellow gold with an inch of white head. Aroma was hopped of pine and citrus. Taste was very smooth and balance for a double IPA of this strength. I did not detect any alcohol in flavor. Finished brisk and satisfying. Wow this was a great experience. I was expecting a hop bomb but this was a very drinkable, flavorful, smooth, exhilarating ale!"
"Had on tap at Russian River. Look, this is obviously a fantastic DIPA. A very dark golden and clear appearance, a very attractive beer to look at. Smells a little piney, a little hoppy, even a little bready. Almost goes without saying since its reputation long precedes my review, but it tastes very balanced. I'm not even the biggest DIPA fan, but I could really get behind this. Pliny really shines with its feel; so crisp and smooth. Feels incredibly medium bodied and light for its ABV, I love it. Overall I'm glad I've finally had one of these famous west coast beers I've heard so much about for so long."
Reviewed from notes.
"Smell is tons of citrus, pine, and a hint of tropical fruit - primarily passionfruit and pineapple. Taste is pine, orange pith, pineapple, and malt sweetness blended with surprisingly light bitterness. Just a really well put-together double IPA."
"One of my favorites. Light in color, smooth to the taste and a good abv."
Best ever.
L - Poured a nice clean golden amber (if that makes sense)
One of my favorite beers of all time. The flavor is so crisp and clear and the piney flavor on the back end is what seals the deal. Tremendous!
"The balance of this beer is what does it for me, everything about it makes it easy. Just sit back and relax, on a mountain range, on the beach, or on the back porch and enjoy."
"Over a thousand reviews laying out the details. Simply put -- see classic DIPA in the dictionary -- the edition before the overload of tropical smells and taste (not knocking those traits, love them too). See it done to perfection - a ton of flavor delivered with plenty of balance. A real treat for an East Coast father on Father's Day."
"I finally had the opportunity to try this beer. I found it on tap in Portland, OR. There's nothing I can write here that hasn't already been written. Given that I prefer IPAs above all others, this is the best beer I have ever had. Perfectly balanced. Complex and not obvious. It brought a tear to these eyes."
In blind taste tests I pig blind pig maybe 70% of the time so maybe that is a better beer but Pliny is truly legendary and doesnt need changed at all. Its higher abv makes up for the ever so slight difference from blind pig
"The first IPA I actually liked. Smells and looks great. Taste is great as well, notes that remind me a lot of pineapple and pine. I haven't seen it available in awhile, but when I do, I get some."
Bottle Date: 6/2/16
Poured a deep golden color from the bottle. The nose has a medium pine and and sweetness. The body is balanced very well with malt sweetness and soft hop bitterness. Balance truly is the descriptor for Pliny the Elder and it finishes clean with a soft restrained bitterness.
This beer was bottled 8 days ago it is excellent and has a great resin hop up front and finishes crisp.
Look: Amber and nice golden color. Nice 
"Look: Crystal clear, golden in color, head was a very bright white and dissipated moderately fast (about 10 seconds)"
"I had this in the bottle and upon first sip i immediately thought it was the best beer i had ever tasted. It is a must buy., get it whenever you can."
"Had this on draft in San Diego recently. Color is a beautiful golden/ light copper. This beer comes with a lot of hype and therefore a lot of expectation when someone who has been seeking it finally tries it. For me it lives up to the hype. Taste is an excellent balance of citrus, fruity and pine. Finish is excellent and leaves you wanting and able to have more. Ends pretty cleanly without much bitterness. Smell is almost better than the taste. Aromatic, clean and not heavy or overly piney/resinous. Overall, a beer worth seeking out an having for sure."
Picked up a case while at Russian River on a beer trip with my dad. 
Look: copper gold and clear. standard CA west coast imperial IPA colors.
"I have been waiting to taste this one for a very long time and it definitely lived up to the hype. The beer pours out to a clear light Amber hue with a frothy white head. I could immediately smell some floral, pine and citrus aromas. The taste is more of a mix of the piney and citrus hoppiness with a caramel malt flavor in the background. The mouth feel is very smooth. This has to be the most perfectly balanced beer I have ever tasted. In fact I'm not sure that I knew what a balanced beer truly was until I tried this beer. Very drinkable and satisfying beer."
"Given its current state, and its history, it is hard to knock this epic IPA. A perfect classic beer to get ts style, and even after all these years, a must buy when obtainable. Cheers!"
Awesome! Great balance. First time in a bottle.
I have a feeling I didn't get this one fresh enough. This is the second time having this beer and second time feeling there are better everyday IPAs
"So I bought this beer, but let it get warm for a few days and then put it in my checked bags to take home. So it definitely didn't meet strict freshness standards. Totally delicious though. Color is paler than I expected. Smell is floral and inviting. Taste has a sweetness I didn't expect, but works well ... reminiscent of how Belgian beers use sweetness to complement the booziness. But it doesn't come off as something decadent and rich like you would expect from an imperial IPA ... it's something that I want to drink a few of because they are so damn drinkable."
"So I know this beer gets all the highest marks, and I do think it's a good beer, but not a 5 or 100. I had an imperial pint at The Horse Brass Pub in Portland, OR. The head was thin and dissipated quickly. Minimal lacing. The color is golden amber, clear in appearance. The smell is very nice; pine, citrus and caramel malt. Also some earthy tones, and bread. The flavor is bright; citrus, pine and grapefruit, with a sweet malty finish. Bitter hops aftertaste, very resinous mouthfeel. An excellent beer overall."
"Very disappointed in this DIPA. The pour was too pale and had no head. Could have been a light beer. The nose is nice with good pine and little citrus. Will head back to my big VT and MA DIPAs from the Alchemist, Hill Farmstead and TreeHouse. Sorry, wanted to like this beer."
It was definitely worth the wait. Waited long time worth every minute of time...it must be in the top five IPAs of all time enough said enjoy
"Dated 4/26/16, consumed 5/13/16. Poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Has a clear, golden yellow hue with a white head. Strong lacing. Aroma yields notes of orange, tangerine, grapefruit, and pine. Very hop-forward taste with little-to-no perceivable malt character; taste follows the nose exactly. Fairly hefty body, but not super thick for a DIPA. Finish is perfectly balanced and super refreshing, leaving no lingering bitterness. "
"One of the progenitors of the style, it's now a bit dated. Still a great beer, well balanced."
Just a smooth double ipa that's definitely worth trying if it's easily acquirable
Don't take my review worth anything. I had an old bottle. Will re-review when I try this fresh.
"Overall good beer, nothing to die for in my opinion. Reminded me a lot of All Day IPA by Founders. Maybe mine was a little older/shipped incorrectly."
We get a shipment of these every other week in San Diego and it's always a treat. For a double ipa the new it seems like the new breed is taking over but this is still the classic.
Exceptional top notch Double IPA. One of my all time favorites. Pour a clear orange/golden color. Very smooth mouth. Tastes of citrus and pine. Very clean finish.
What else is there to be said? For once you can believe the internet. A must try for EVERYONE...
"poured from 510ml bottle, clear copper, creamy white head that sticks around for a while. loads of citrussy resinous hop on the nose, hint of grapefruit. The taste is amazing, there's just so much flavor, a really complex satisfying bitterness that's intense and smooth, can't really taste malt. feels luxurious in my mouth, this is just fantastic beer"
"Bottled 4/13/16, so I'm not likely to get it fresher unless I go to the brewery."
"Fresh bottle; dated 4/14 I believe and tasted on 4/30. Everyone knows about this beer, so I'll just give my general impressions having had a lot of other west coast IPAs. "
"My friend from California sent this to me, I've been wanting to try it for a while. I was a little surprised at the color, it was more of a dull gold color than I'm used to seeing for IPAs. Overall it was very good, maybe a little overhyped but definitely enjoyable. I would love to have it again."
poured into a tulip
Solid beer worth the hunt!
So... the almighty Pliny... we finally meet. Let us begin.
"Look: Clear, dark straw, amber, white head, remains foamy/creamy"
Perfect
Best beer I've ever had!!!
"Fucking, duh."
"On tap, this beer is mostly clear yellow-gold, much paler than you'd expect from most double IPAs. Two fingers of dense white head leaves full sheets of lacing. Smell is not particularly complex, but outstanding, featuring grapefruit, orange and pine. "
"Found 1 random bottle in a small fridge at Cask in downtown SF. All the way w HT and other tops. A little less creamy, thick than the others, could see through it."
"Appearance is a yellow color similar to macro, and an amazing clarity as well. Good white head forming 3/4"" depth. Awesome aroma of resinous mango, guava, tropical fruits, tangerine and citrus. "
Look:
Very Notorious beer. Lives up to the hype.
Honestly this is the best west coast ipa
"Pours deep amber with golden highlights, wide white foam head. Aroma is excellent, hops with fruity, citric, floral characteristics. Taste is hoppy and malty, extremely well balanced. Aftertaste is spectacultar. This beer is imposible to get in Mexico, a friend brought it to me from San Diego, very fresh. Amazing beer."
"Very hoppy, but not an overwhelming aftertaste."
"Thanks to MadDawg for sharing. Awesome DIPA of course. Wish it was readily available, but happy to have it. Juicy as all hell and just a near perfect beer"
Balanced!
"Pours a bright honey, the head and lacing are strong and linger."
"Pliny is definitely one of my all time favorites and worth the considerable effort required to procure. After two years of regular consumption I have found it to be a bit sweet for my changing taste buds, but compared to off- the-shelf doubles, it still reigns superior. "
Lives up to the hype and always a go to when on the west coast.
"I feel bad as this was bottled 6 months ago, but I was just given this now. So it's as fresh as I can possibly get it, since we don't get it in my area. "
Freshest IPA in the west coast!
"After all the talk and series of beer trades, finally got my hands on this. Dated 2-12-16, almost 2 months old. Hoping this doesn't affect the quality knowing fresh fresh is always way better. But took my chances anyway."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a thick white foamy head. There is quite a bit of a soapy lacing. The odor for me is pine, grapefruit, resin, orange, lemon, herbal, some tropical fruit, floral. The taste for me is pine, lemon, resin, grassy, bread, grapefruit, slight orange, some bitterness."
"Trying Pliny for the second time, out of a bottle. Big fruity aroma. Orange, pine,pineapple, and flowers. Taste is very bright with mango and other tropical fruits and pine balanced out by some earthy malt. Super flavorful. Moderate bitterness closes things off, along with some alcohol. This is a really wonderful IPA, very bright and drinkable. The 8% ABV is well hidden. Complex, tasty, and delicious."
The mothership of DIPAs. Brings instant jealousy. The standard for a west coast IPA. Drank from a snifter.
Just wow!
Well-balanced. Nice little bite of hops on initial quaffing. Solid mouth feel and lingering taste. 
Bottle. 2 weeks old
This beer did not live up to the hype. Finally was fortunate enough to try one. Raging bitch by Flying dog is better hands down!
"Pours a clear light amber color with a thick foamy head. Head retention is decent as is lacing. The aroma is just awesome. Big, big juicy orange citrus and hoppy resin. Big juicy citrus taste, strong piney resin. Everything you would hope for in an IPA. It is very astringent at the end though. Soapy aftertaste. LIght bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinks more like a regular IPA and not a DIPA, though. Been wanting to try this one for a long, long time. Parents went to Napa and shipped a couple of bottles back."
Great double ipa
Ahhhh finally. I don't want to sound like a hype beast but this beer was so delicious. Got it on tap at Toronado here in San Diego and felt like I was in heaven. Aroma was dank and piney with a hint of grapefruit. Taste was so balanced with hops and malts. Definitely crossed this off my bucket list
"Bottle from 2/19 and poured 3/22. Given to me unexpectedly from Tony -- as if you haven't seen it enough, thanks a ton! Obviously been high on my wants list since I started drinking craft beer. This is a big thing for me."
"Pliny of the ""big"" double IPA's did not win in a blind taste test. I am definitely more biased to east coast doubles but even in the blind test it didn't take me away. I still saw blind big is one of the best beers I've ever had. Younger was way better than this as well, the hops weren't as dominant as I like, but maybe that's a good thing for a double IPA."
Absolutely perfect....
L: Crystal clear orange body with a very small white head with very little retention. Leaves behind lacing around the edge with a see-through film across the center. Little streams of bubbles continue to rise throughout the whole experience. 
Bottled 2-19-16
510 ml into tulip. 1/25/16
"Pours a clean golden honey color with white head and lacing. Nose is floral piney citrus. Taste follows nose. Clean,crisp and hoppy.After all these years still one of my favorites and the standard to which others are judged."
This beer lived up to the hype.
"Ok so I feel comfortable rating this now as I've had a few at different times. Great beer and would drink it any day. However, it seems like a thing of the past. Personally prefer Heady, SOS, Green, Julius, Haze, and Hoof Hearted IPA's. Not to mention some others as well. Fantastic beer and legendary, just not up to par with what's happening now IMHO."
"Had on tap at a bar. Had good hoppy bitterness that fades smooth. Good citrus smell. Pine, bit of booze but not overpowering. Great mouthfeel. Overall a great beer. Compares with heady topper and some of the tree house beers out east."
Not a West Coast IPA fan but this is the pinnacle of that particular style.
"Outstanding beer! One of those beers where each sip is high quality, from the smell at the beginning to the hop and malt in the middle to the complex flavors at the finish."
On tap and out of the bottle. Well balanced with no overpowering bitterness and some piney flavor. Blind Pig hits the spot better and has more hop flavor. There are better dipas out there.
Smooth. As close to nectar of the gods as one can get
"Poured from bottle into pilsner glass, nice 3 finger tanish cream head, outstanding lacing. Clear golden look with a head that last. Smells like a big citrus bomb and the taste delivers. Nice residual sweetness at the end. Only beer on my radar for my Napa trip."
"Had an opportunity to get 3 of these bottles via a trade. I am not an IPA first and foremost but if you were to give me an unlabeled bottle of Pliny, I would tell you without a doubt that is one of the best IPAs that I have ever had. Bottled on 2/19/2016 this brew almost resembled liquid gold from its looks, the smells, oh my the smells, piney, with a hint of citrus as if I ran into a forest of freshness, and the same with taste followed with the ever present IPA bitterness BUT did not take away from the flavor profile at all. I'm glad to have had this brew."
"Oh man this is good IPA. Very rich flavor. Maybe someday I'll have a better IPA then the Ballast Point grapefruit Sculpin, or the Russian River Brewery Pliny the Elder Double IPA. I would put Odell Mercenary Double IPA just a touch below this, still great, world class. Maybe in blind taste test I would pick the Odell? I think perhaps the only IPA that is well known that I have not tasted and is better then this would be Heady Topper, and Pliny the Younger. Until that day this stuff and Ballast Points Grapefruit Sculpin are the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of imbibing. Cheers!"
Poured from a bottled dated 2/25/16 (9 days old) into a Hill Farmstead tulip glass.
"What more can I say, It's Pliny the Elder!"
"One of those brews I had been in search of for a long time - I finally scored a bottle a few days ago and popped it this weekend. I decided to pop it the same night as another sought out beer that lived up to the hype - Zombie Dust. This one sadly - did not. Good beer but def not up to the hype. I can think of 6 DIPA's that I prefer. Again, pretty tatsy brew but not worth searching out. Just MO."
I love the Elder its a great double IPA. Its the double that you always want to drink but you can't always have it. (unless your really lucky) All i know is when I see a case of the Pliny I get it. Its probably the best double Ipa out there or its at least in the top 5 best doubles IPAs.
ok
"Bottled dated 2/12/16; drank on 2/29/16 in a tulip glass; I have obviously been wanting to try this for a long time and got a random opportunity today; 2 1/2 weeks old is about my limit these days on hoppy beers so this fits in my typical review window; this beer is great but it just does not match the hype, nor my extremely high expectations for hoppy beers these days"
Service: Bottle
"Excellent beer. Over-hyped. Was the best on draught that day. Thought it could use a little more flavor. However, well balanced and enjoyable. Worth the taste, not the wait."
"Wanted to try this one for years. Lives up to it reputation. Not as hoppy as I thought it would, and that delights me. Big creamy head, smooth drinking."
"One of those beers. Beautiful color (dark golden) with a strong citrus nose. The hops aren't overwhelming bitter once it warms up a bit, gives a bit of citrus. Really smooth. Has distinct feel over say the NE hoppy beers. Very glad I got to try this out."
"Crossed off my bucket list. Beer had more of a malt dominance than I would have expected. I would compare this to Finch's Hardcore Chimera. I prefer the New England juice bombs over this malt/hop supplication. I am sure 5 years ago I would have rated this higher. However, with the surly's, Tree House, Trillium and other brewers on the scene; Elder is showing its age."
"Pouring a pint into a snifter, you get the clearest, rich butterscotch appearance with a pale white and foamy one finger head. Strong papaya and citrus nose, and those flavors definitely come through along with the creamy texture. The sweet and hoppy bitterness is so balanced. The carbonation is so fine it feels like cotton candy melting in your mouth. No other beer gives me this sensation. Although the Younger is so much bigger in every way, this is just as bold and delicate. I drink this everyday! Love it!"
"510ml bottle. 1/25/16 bottle date (19 days old). Appearance: crystal clear golden orange, with a thick slightly off white head. Nice lacing. Aroma: Strong fresh fruity melon and citrus, with a bit of pine. Taste: Light malt sweetness with a touch of caramel, turning to a strong, juicy, grassy, resinous hop flavor. Only the lightest touch of citrus comes across. Bitterness slowly builds into strong crescendo. Mouthfeel: Light body for the style with a moderately high carbonation. Finish: Very dry with a strong grassy bitterness. Overall: Probably the easiest drinking, most refreshing IIPA you’ll find. Lighter malt base than most but still balances the strong bitterness well."
L - Pours Clear and Golden with a nice white head and really good lace
This is the beer that opened the door to double IPAs for me (my favorite beer style now). I think it has a great crisp hop that is well balanced and sweet.
poured into a 16oz snifter from bottle
Bought two pints at Denver liquor store...bottled on Jan. 18/16.
A perfectly brewed and delicious west coast DIPA! 
Best smelling beer I've ever had. Taste was very good as well
"nothing special coming from Boston and Northern VT... try some treehouse and trillium then edit your reviews lol. beer has great balance and super drinkable w/ that little west coast bitter hop finish, but leaves a lot to be desired imho. cheers"
Moved to Italy last year and want to move back to CA as soon as possible to get back in the IPA scene... And the IPA I always used as my gold standard was Pliny. Perfect IPA. The End.
Outstanding!
Appearance: Hazy golden color. Less orange than some other Dipa's. One finger head that dissipates pretty quickly. Nice lacing left on my pint glass. 
"Overall very solid. Nice hop selection, lemon/citrus/fresh grass aroma. Very light as IPAs go. IBUs are not crazy but hang in on the pallet nicely."
Great tasting hyped up beer. Still like Heady better though.
"Pours a nice golden color. Nice aroma, hoppy but not over hopped. Nice aftertaste, very malty more than I expected, didnt expect that . No citrus or iney taste that I can tell. A very filling beer. Great but not excellent."
I've been snagging these when I can from a couple Whole Foods in LA which are held in back. They sell them one or two at a time.
"Drank it on October 21,2015 from a bottle that was bottled September 30, 2015."
Scored a bottle of this stuff for the first time thanks to HopsAholic79!! Bottled 12/24/15 
I often find these beers that are rated 100 tend to be a bit of a let down for me. Pliny bucks the trend. This beer is deserving of all the accolades. 
Part of my Pliny vs Heady session
One of the best Double IPA's around
"My favorite beer, so far. I am hopping to try Pliny theYounger in a few weeks. It is very flavorful and smooth. A nice amount of hops without overpowering. Cheers."
Poured from a bottle into a snifter.
I don't even know what to say about this beer. It's weird. 
"I feel this was a revolutionary beer when it first came out. Its still a great beer it just can't compete with Surly, TG or NE dipas. Tons of pine, tons of resin, tons of hop bitterness. Its a crisp dipa its just not a top dipa anymore"
"While it doesn't quite live up to Younger, it certainly does live up to the hype. Incredibly piney and citrusy in both smell and taste, it has all of the signature qualities you'd expect from a classic west coast IPA. Because this can be hard to locate, grab a Blind Pig if you have the chance as it is actually quite similar in comparison to PtE."
"Poured a 12/11/15 bottle bought and shipped right from brewery into a tulip glass. Look is a cloudy darker gold color with a nice 2 finger off white head. Aroma is all hops with floral and pine notes. Taste is bitterly hop forward with more pine, grassy, floral hints upfront with slight citrus flavors on the back end. Great bitter bite that lingers on palate for minutes after drinking. Mouthfeel was crisp with very good carbonation. Overall this beer lives up to its stellar reputation."
"I was a lager guy until I had this. ""I don't like IPAs,"" I said. ""They're too bitter,"" I said. "
"My only criticism is that this is not as good as Maine Brewing Company's hoppiest lovelies. Otherwise, my fav west coast hoppy beer by far!"
"Enjoyed this immensely - an overwhelming burst of flavors that coalesced into a whole greater than the sum of their parts. Balance is what makes this so incredible - the citrus doesn't overwhelm the piney-ness, and the bitterness doesn't overwhelm the sweetness. Amazingly crafted piece of work."
Best double ipa. So smooth
"L: Pours an absolutely beautiful golden-copper with superb clarity, an abundant white head with good retention and lacing."
"Bottle from 12/9. Pours crystal clear gold with lingering white head. Smell is amazing: citrus, pine, dank, slight malt. Taste is crisp and clean but not as solid as the nose. Mouth is is great, slightly sticky yet light. "
"Pours an unassuming yellow-orange with an inch of frothy white head. The nose is stellar. Very tropical and citric. I get orange, grapefruit, pear, papaya, sharp floral hops. The taste follows. Impressive. Creamy mouthfeel. Bitter but clean on the finish. Deservingly a classic."
"Had the good fortune to be close enough on a work trip to swing by the brewery. Definitely lived up to the hype and after a short wait in line we were seated at the bar. Enjoyed several brews, all of which were fantastic and the food was excellent as well. Service was fast and friendly and the purchase of bottles on the way out was hassle free."
"One of the best smelling and tasting beers out there (when on draft). Usually not a fan of the bottles, draft blows it out of the water. I feel bad for people across the country that can't experience this beer on draft, its a totally different beast. "
"Pale, almost blond look, with a thin layer of head which dissipates quickly. The smell is clean and pleasant, but not overwhelming. The aroma is hops and citrus. The taste is quite good, but very mild, citrus & pine flavors. I expected a bolder taste. It's well balanced, but very mild. Very smooth, and easy to drink, but for all the hype, I expected a bit more."
Popped the cap on a 510ml bottle and you immediately smell the hops. 
"Certainly my favorite double, I consider myself quite lucky to have it consistently at liquor stores and sometimes bars within walking distance of my house. As soon as it pours, you are almost overwhelmed by its strong and brilliant scent. It is a perfectly balanced IIPA, absolutely incredible. No doubt world class."
Amazing aroma and great smooth finish.
Very good. I enjoyed it.
"This beer was surprisingly bland! I had been waiting for over a year to find it. I finally found it on tap at Obrians in San Diego when I was home for the holidays. A surprisingly bland IPA. Very average. Not bad, but ridiculously overhyped."
"I had the good fortune of traveling to the PNW and then on down to Santa Rosa to get my hands on both draft and bottled Pliny. As many say the nose was the best part of this beer...until I tasted it. I got a lot of the citrus nose in the taste as well, balanced with the hoppy 'bitterness' too."
"Proud Pliny first-timer. The second I broke the airtight seal on the cap, before I even removed it, with my nose at least 3 feet up from the bottle, my eyes widened in awe with the immediate understanding of what everyone has talked about for so long. The fact that the scent could hit my nose that quickly, strongly, and pleasantly was truly impressive."
From the bottle. 
Love it
On draft at Monk's Cafe
"Bottled 10/26/2015. I was hoping to bring this one to a bottle-share, but it's already over a month old now that I finally have it in my hands. What can I say? I was out of town for Thanksgiving, and it takes a while to smuggle this stuff all the way from California to Alabama."
"Great example of classic West Coast IPA. However this isn't the best IPA out any longer nor is it IMO the top 5 IPAs. For me an IPA needs to be unfiltered it gives that great mouthfeel, head, and sweet/ bitter love an IPA needs. Also the smell on this is nothing fantastic, specially when u compare it to the great smellers like heady, resin, and space dust. "
Very hard-to-find double IPA. Seek it out; worth the drive to be able to try this if you are a big IPA fan. One of the very best.
Bottled 111015 at 42 degrees into snifter
"L - hazy straw color, clingy white head"
Be aware my rating comes as someone who hates IPAs.
Had many times...in bottle and on tap. Lots of great memories with this beer....in bottles with brother at GGF in Berkeley ...3000 miles removed with brother on-tap in Philly....RR in Santa Rosa...bottled 2 days old before buying on my B-Day.
"Thanks to @PatrickCT for this one. It's been a minute since I've danced with PtE; quite frankly, I missed her. Intense aroma in the nose. Honey layered malt bill is prominent. Grapefruit rind, and a bit of citrus, too. New car scent pine aroma lingers. Smoked barley on the tongue, amazingly. Ripe tobacco leaf, a tinge of spearmint and over ripened grapefruit. Creamy on the front end, semi-dry on the finish. Perfectly balanced. Pronounced head that lingers like the ex-girlfriend who won't move on. Beautiful. This is a master class in brewing. Cheers, Vinnie."
Having had this multiple times from about 2010 to 2015 I can say the quality is still very high and is still a stalwart among all IPA's.
"There are better reviews, so I'll keep it short. Had this out of a fresh bottle, alongside about 6 other 97+ rated ipas and dipas. This was not my favorite. I would have liked to have seen more cloudiness in the appearance, but the head was nice and lingered. Smell fresh hops with some pine tint to it. Honestly, less of a bomb than some of the competition. It'd be a treat to drink this regularly, but on this occasion I preferred green street, all green everything, and mosaic (ya I know, different styles)."
"Got this from a friend who went to the brewery while on vacation. Wow, so, so smooth. 8% but barely a trace of alcohol on the nose or palate. hoppy but doesn’t carry the overwhelming bitterness that is expected with a 100 IBU beer. balanced and smooth. Worth the hype & wait. Cheers"
"Finally got my hands on this thanks to a friend who brought it back from San Diego. Bottled on 9/30. Good looking beer with nice somewhat subtle aroma. Great balance of bitter and sweet taste that lingers. Medium very enjoyable mouth feel. Probably impossible to live up to the hype, but this is obviously a fantastic beer."
Bottle sent. Thanks Kate.
"Maybe if I had this a few years ago it would have left more of an impression. There are just so many amazing IPAs out there now it's hard to say this was the best I've had. Definitely delicious and at the top of its game, wouldn't hesitate to order it again."
"Fantastic! Had it on tap at the best beer joint in Philly, Monks! The flavor was as expected, fresh, clean, with a ton of hop. Cant wait for my next!"
Great mouthfeel. Hops up front then disappears with a more subtle bitter finish than expected. I do not like IPA but I loved this beer
"Unfortunately I was very disappointed in this beer. I don't know if it's overhyped or if my pallet judges it unfairly because I have regular access to lawsons, and have had other top east coast I.p.a.'s. I found the flavor to lack depth and I struggled to find any juicy hop flavors"
Have had both in bottle and at RRBC on tap. Pours a golden color with a thin white head. Smell is just amazing every time. Awesome citrus and pine hop aroma. Taste is very smooth and balanced. Medium mouthfeel with medium bitterness. Lingering hop flavor. Low/medium carbonation. One of my favorite beers of all time and the ultimate West Coast DIPA.
"Another great IPA out of Russian River. Hops lean to citrus instead of pine. The draught lace does not stand up , but this an appealing beer. This is why to seek out Falling Rock Tap house in Denver, because they always have it."
Fellow BA member sent to me in the mail from NoCA to IL - 510ml bottle
"Had this one on draft at Theresa's Next Door (Wayne, Pennsylvania) where I would recommend everyone to go .Excellent beer and an excellent place."
"From Florida and reviewing post-drink. I have a brother who lives in Northern California and whenever he visits, he brings The Elder. I trade him some Cigar City Jai Lai and call it good. "
"Pours a very clear golden color with long lasting white head. Aroma of pine, grapefruit, pineapple, floral, orange, resin, and malt. Flavors are all of the above with a bready/crackerlike note with a nice balancing malt character that balances the bitterness all the way through. Mouthfeel is med-med/low carbonation with a slick hop oil on the tongue. Overall I cant find much wrong with this beer other than maybe a little more aroma."
Pours a bright golden orange color. Large off-white head dissipates slowly. Excellent clarity. Masses of sticky lacing left behind.
Revisited 2/25/18
"Being on the East coast,I've yearned for this for awhile.I had two on tap at Monks' in Philly yesterday and it was tasty.Give me Heady or even 3Lb ipa from St.Boniface anytime.Very tasty brew but didn't live up to my taste.Maybe my palate was having a bad day."
"Thanks to a tip from another BA on the forums I checked Total Wine and they had Pliny the Elder. One per customer, behind the counter, $4.99 a bottle. I didn't even have to know a code word. This is just seriously a great IPA. Born on September 30, 2015. A subtle understated nose, and the first sip is like a west coast sunset. Pours a golden orange with a medium head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind a good amount of lacing. Taste is bitter pine all the way with a hint of fruit on the back end. Not too sweet and with a nice full mouthfeel. If I could get this fine beer all the time and price was no object I would drink it every week. Luckily I have to hunt for it, which makes the finding and tasting that much better."
"This is a great beer---it blew me away the first time I had it, and several times after that---all in bottles. Since then I had it on tap at the original pizzaport, and it was even better... However, I am now a veteran of hill farmstead, Treehouse, Trillium, and MBC (Dinner)... and it has lost its shine! Sorry PtE"
Appearance is golden with light head. Nice lacing.
"Description: Bright, clear, golden look that kind of reminded me of apple juice. The white head wasn't very thick but it did leave quite a bit of lacing on the glass. None of the aromas were overwhelming, but pine, citrus and floral were noticeable. The taste carried many more pine and bitter notes than the smell would have suggested and the aftertaste was very clean and dry. More hop forward than some the elite East Coast IPAs. Alcohol wasn't apparent and the feel was a little fuller-bodied than a normal IPA."
Close to perfect in a couple IPA
There's not much one can say when reviewing a beer of this caliber - it'd be like a finger painting 3 year old trying to critique the Mona Lisa. Believe the hype. There's absolutely nothing bad to be said about this beer - it is the gold standard West Coast IPA. I poured it into the glass and it was like the first time I heard the Beatles. I took a sip and may or may not have Jim Levenstein'd in my pants a little. It's simply amazing. Only drawback is it's easier to get a handy from a nun than it is to score Pliny in Chicago. 
"What can be said about this brew that hasn't already been said. I had opportunity to drink it head to head with a Heady Topper one evening here, and I must say that was a battle for the ages... Heady barely eeked out the victory in my opinion, but why listen to me, go get your own and do it yourself."
"Poured from a bottle dated 9/9/15, so a little more than a month old, into a snifter, pours a beautifully clear copper orange amber body with a thin head that fades to a few bubbles, outstanding lacing though. "
"fantastic beer, not sure if it lives up to all the hype."
"Overall, the hype wasnt worth the wait."
So well balanced ...
"This is the top of the line for me, and I would have rated it a 5, but I'm hopeful I find something that tops this one, one day. I'm doubtful of it, though."
Bottled on 9/21 poured into wheat glass
Really good. I had been chasing this for years. I got the last bottle today from Boynton Liquors in San Jose (RIP) they went out of business today.
Balance for dayz.
16.9 oz. bottle poured into tulip
"Clear golden with carbonation you predicted it. Thick white foam settles to thick layer , good lacings "
"Pours a clear gold with medium head and retention. Smells like walking through a forest of pine trees. Tastes like a good does of pale malt with a dab of crystal malt followed by grass, pine resin, and grapefruit peel on the back end. Overall I find this to be one of the better balanced ipa's out there."
"Holly cow. This is the smoothest beer I've ever had. Thank god, Russian River is only 2 hours away from me."
"I've been trying to taste Pliny for over a year. Finally got a pint at The Mayor of Old Town in Fort Collins, CO while visiting from Canada. "
"510 ml (pint) bottle. Pours bright clear orange amber, head fades slowly leaving lace everywhere. Aroma jumps from the glass, resiny pine and grapefruit, fresh baked bread. Great balance in the taste, toasty malt backbone with plenty of bitter resiny pine, strong grapefruit peel, floral notes. The flavor turns earthy, woodsy just before a super dry finish. Medium full mouthfeel is super soft and oily slick. Trend now is towards the big juicy NE IPAs, which I love, but it's nice to come back to this world class resiny bomb. So delishous."
Tap to pint glass @ Russian River Brewing tap 
"Super pumped to open this bottle of Pliny bottled <3 week ago. A clear, pale golden pour into a snifter producing a billowy white head and some amazing lacing. Smell is almost subdued for a double IPA. I get floral hops, grapefruit, with some pine and a little dankness. Very nice. The taste is a great blend of those hop characteristics with very little bitterness. Great balance. Damn, I am sold on this stuff. Definitely lives up to the hype for me. Wish I had another."
Poured into Teku glass and less than 2 weeks old.
"The beer comes in an amber color. The aroma is pretty muted with some pine, malt, and citrus coming through. The taste is an even distribution of sweet malt, hop bitterness, and citrus. It's a great double IPA but I'm not a huge fan of the west coast malt profile."
"Probably the cleanest IPA or DIPA I've ever had. Similar reaction to the clean taste of a fresh Sculpin the first time I tried that. Very well balanced, very light drinking for a DIPA or 8%. Again, exceptionally smooth, clean and balanced and it's obviously very well made, but the hype is a bit much. For flavor, I'd still prefer Cafe Racer 15 for a DIPA, but they're just different styles of DIPAs. I personally prefer a bolder taste, but if you appreciate cleanness and balance, then I'm not sure how you could do better for this style of beer."
"Look: An orange amber color, ever so slightly cloudy with a inch of white foam. 4.5"
Perfect... nuff said...
Poured into a New Belgium snifter bottle date 9/2/15 about 3 1/2 weeks old.
Good but not great. People are a bunch of sheep customers. Limit this shit and everyone goes gagga for it. Put it out as much as Ballast Point Sculpin and I guarantee it goes from a 100 to a 92-94. Anyhow. Bullshit marketing vs good beer.
"Nice medium lacing, gives an inviting visual to accompany the intoxicating aroma. Just waves of floral hops with a such a freshly squeezed vibrancy you'd think you were smelling it right off the vine. The taste is so smooth & elegant for an American IPA. This is the standard because they don't just toss massive amounts of hops in to hammer you with the flavor or the bitterness. You get a great sense and balance of the different hop flavors, so while it might not taste vastly different than many other great IPAs - your orange citrus, your grapefruit, your pine, etc - it is the balance and the ability of it to draw forth subtle hop variances to the surface that makes this such a well regarded beer. It is slick but not oily, lighter on carbonation than I expected and it has just a faint lingering bitterness but it never overpowers the palate."
"Look: A classic golden amber, mild carbonation. "
"Pours a nice rich golden color. Has a big aroma of pine, resin and a subtle sweetness. Flavor is hops, pine, & some tropical fruit. A little crisp bitter finish but a great IPA overall"
"Having had this a few times, I can say that this is best on draft. Bottles must remain fresh and cold for optimum flavor. It's always got a full nose, and the flavor is a great mix of refreshing, and bold. It takes the traditional Bitterness of an IPA, and glorifies it. It doesn't shy away from the bitter, rather leans into it. "
"Poured into a snifter glass, upon which a relatively thick head emerged. Fruity flavors on the front end that quickly get overpowered by the piney, resinous bite. Solid beer, but definitely overhyped."
This beer is the standard for IPAs. The taste is extremely complex and very distinct. The appearance is a strong golden color and it smells amazing.
On tap at Toronado San Francisco
A - Huge 1.5 inch thick head that holds well and doesn't move much. Cloudy amber in color. Some carbonation bubbles. 
Very Fresh Keg (as are all Pliny Kegs)
Simply one of the best. Delicious hops - dry finish. Crystal clear! A benchmark for all DIPAs.
Poured from a 510ml bottle (bottled 21Aug15) into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
Wow after having Heady I was unsure anything could ever top it. After having this however I understand how people can appreciate this beer more. Heady is definitely more hops forward and Pliny is definitely more balanced. I still would prefer Heady but this is by far the most well balanced and delicious double I've ever had.
This is a really excellent IIPA and I was on the fence between rating a 4.5 and 4.75.
L: Hazy Gold
From a 510ml bottled on 082115. 25 days old bottle. In a large tulip. 
Nice straw like coloration. Citrusy aroma light mouthfeel with a grapefruit and bitter finish. Very easy to drink. I will come back to this review as I will drink this again and provide better detail.
"Look: Golden Hazy Yellow, with cloudy subtle overall appearance, nice solid head"
Pliney is what I use as a baseline for great beer
Lucky to fine a Bottle up here in Kingman Az. Pours a nice orange light in color with great head thick white and fluffy with great lacing. Smells of citrus and pine feel the nose. When you close your eyes and smell this beer its as if your just stepping out of a cabin with axe in hand ready to take on the day. Get hoppy taste and ballanced very nicely. Very smooth and amazing taste! Beautiful beer
A mix of golden and amber with the light. A small amount of head and some lacing.
poured from bottle. golden yellow slight orange color. half inch of nice fluffy head. great lacing. pine resin cand citrus in the finish. unbelievably drinkable. im just glad i have another one!
"Although I've had much juicier IIPAs, and IIPAs with more interesting malt character, this beer probably deserves its exalted status on account of how exceptionally *clean* and balanced it is. It is not my favorite in the style, nor what I consider the tastiest, but as a perfectly executed example of what (I think) it was trying to do, it's definitely great."
"Finally got my hands on a taste of Pliny after several years of hankering for it. Poured from a three week old bottle, which is about as fresh as you can get it on the east coast. This was an incredibly smooth imperial IPA, completely belying both the ABV and the bitterness/IPU number. Crystal clear filtered appearance, with a big hit of pine and bitter citrus peel on the nose. West coast IPA for sure. The malts supported the bitter finish and pine resin flavor notes, and the mouthfeel was superb with a level of carbonation that made this extremely drinkable and dare I say, refreshing. Pliny the Elder is famous for a reason, and imitator beers which try to ape its intoxicating blend of smoothness with hop bite are unlikely to touch it anytime soon."
"On tap at Toronado San Diego, kegged 1 week ago. This is my first time having pliny, after all the hype and searching I took a sip. It came out as a light golden pint, with a smell of pine and some fruit. It was a fragrant aroma, but not the best ever. With the first sip, I was instantly hit with the hop bitterness and pine notes, but it was very well balanced with the malts. The ending was extremely dry, leaving you begging for another sip. There is no doubt that this is a great IPA, but is it the best IPA I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. I think the hype and scarcity play a lot into this. I have waited almost 4 years to try this beer, and I would say I was a bit let down. As a bit of a comparison, upon my first time having Zombie Dust, I felt the hype was completely worth it. Now, before I am crucified on what I just said, this is in no way less than an excellent IPA. Everything from the hunt to the taste make this beer an experience, and the fact that with all the great IPAs currently on the market it can still be counted as a top 10 is extraordinary. If you ever have the chance to try a fresh PtE, take it and enjoy it for the quality and for what it has done for the craft beer world, a true legend. But if you never get the chance, don't worry, there are many other great (and maybe better) IPAs out there."
"Russian River Pliney the Elder has a very thick, off-white head, a hazy, orange-gold appearance, some bubbles, and heavy lacing left on the glass. The aroma is of sharp, resinous, hop oil and white bread. Taste is of sweet, white bread, white bread crust, and very bitter hops. Mouthfeel is high medium and slick, and Pliny the Elder finishes puckering and decently drinkable (although, you will feel it in your head). "
"In sitting on Columbus Ave in SanFran after searching for a bar with Pliny the Elder. Most places when you ask look cross-eyed at you as they have never heard of it. Found it at Rose Pistola. Definitely worth the search. Perfectly balanced hops. Even on a warm day like today it is not over bearing, just a smooth hoppy finish. I give it one if my rare ""5's""."
I have had this from the bottle and the tap. Both are great ways to drink Pliny The Elder. If you are in Denver the Argonaut on Colfax often has some bottles and the Cheeky Monk nearby sometimes has it on tap. It has a great hoppy smell and taste.
"I wonder two things: if Pliny's been overhyped, and if I'm rating it high just based on the name. Tasty, but not a revelation."
"I finally get to try Pliny the Elder! This beer has already been described thousands of ways...so I want waste time here...it holds up to all the hype! It is very balanced, smooth and more sweet than I would have thought? Great beer!"
This beer is best out of the bottle within the first 2 weeks of the date IMO. The pinkness starts to die off after that and it becomes quite malty for a west coast IPA
"Poured clear amber color into a pint glass with a persistent fluffy white head. The aroma was the star of this beer: a monstrous blast of fresh hops, citric and spicy. The flavor was initially overwhelming sharp hop bitterness. This faded to a pleasant biscuity malt flavor. Medium high carbonation was almost prickly on the tongue, but helped round out the mouthfeel of a beer that could have otherwise been a touch heavy. Instead, it is an easy drinking beer that finishes clean and sweet, but short of sticky sweet, and with a hint of the citrus and spice of the hops. Overall, it is a fantastic IPA."
my sister brought some pliny out to KC from Denver. 
"I am lucky enough to live close enough to RR that my local store gets them fairly regularly. However, I did just get a case straight from the brewery. This is a well done IPA that is more finesse, and less about the powerful hops. Even a non-IPA fan would enjoy."
"Ive had it direct from the brewpub in CA, in kegs shipped to PA, and in bottles sent who knows where to my house. Its just clean and delicious every time."
This is my second favorite IPA behind the alchemists heady topper. I know that this is not a well respected IPA in California but I am a big fan of it.
"Man... such a disappointment. I'm not discrediting everyone's love of this beer, but it just didn't do it for me. And I flew all the way to San Diego from Baltimore just to get some. (sniffle) It's the alcohol... I found it to be alcohol forward, overwhelming the hop and malt. Too bad. I'll try it again one day."
I have been on a conquest for the best DIPA in the country. This just fell short of the hype. 
On tap @ Monks Café in Philly.
"seems overrated..did enjoy it though. little flat, no particular strong characteristics. would vote for heady topper any day..would like to try younger tho"
The color is a beautiful golden hue especially in sunlight. Has a nice head on a proper pour and you don't need to bury your nose in the glass to get a waft of that amazing Hop. Flavor is smooth and very piney. Has a bit of a bite upon the first sip but you quickly love every drop.
Probably the most drinkable DIPA I have ever experienced. Goes down smooth like a regular IPA. Bottled 8/12/15. Look forward to enjoying another one.
"Best Double IPA I have had. Had on tap at Toronado in San Diego, CA on 8-20-15. Would love to try some bottles and keep in my beer fridge. Do yourself a favor and try this beer when you have the opportunity. I was in search of this beer for 5 days while in California."
"Not particularly pretty and not particularly ugly. Had it on draft at the brew pub for the first time. Smelled nice of forest and pine, classic DIPA. On the palate, good balanced up front with solid bitterness. Grapefruit but too much resin/pineyness. I liked it, but its not my favorite."
"Bottle dated 7/23/15, drank 8/24/25. Is that too old? Cause I didn't get the hop blast described by many. Decent floral aroma and bit of citrus. It was smooth drinking and what many would describe as balanced. I though the caramel malt taste was good but way overpowering for DIPA. Overrated based on this one bomber."
"Probably the best double IPA I've had. The most drinkable as well. Some doubles I get sick of after a few but - without getting too technical about it - Pliny is a double that drinks like a single. If you find yourself at Russian River Brewery, do yourself a favor and grab a case!"
"The greatest beer in America, and little old me finally gets to rate it. As I said when I reviewed Heady recently, it's not my favorite style of beer, but this is similarly a spectacular example of the style - a benchmark, if you will. If I were new to IPAs, I could see this beer having the same earthshaking effect on me that Green Flash and Lagunitas' IPAs had on me, that realization of ""so this is why everyone likes this style!"" So it's a wonderful start IPA, and as good an IPA as I could hope for, but it's a big commitment to call it the ""best."""
This is one of the most wonderful beers I've ever been so lucky to quaff. 
Great all around IPA. Pours a clear orange with a nice head. Lots of pine in the aroma and the flavor. A really great west coast style IPA. Glad I finally got to try it.
Poured from a bottle three weeks old into a tulip glass.
"I was glad to have tried the West Coast Pliny here on the East Coast. It's definitely living up to the hype. Overall great body, smell and taste of citrus is there along with the hop flavor. This one deserves to be ranked as high as it is, cheers!"
"A: clear, dark, golden yellow with foamy white head"
Poured from bottle into snifter.
Thoroughly enjoyed it.
Finally had It on tap. Verdict it's pretty good. My takeaway is how very well balanced it is. Has an almost subdued hypnotic quality to it. But to me it's an old man on the block compared to what I can get in my area. Glad to try it.
"There was alot of hype about this beer. And I finally got my hands on one. First impression (drink) was ""its a good beer - solid IPA"" but nothing special. Then as I drank more, the taste built upon itself getting better and better. To mm whatt sets this beer above others is it has a lingering finish that is awesome. No other beer has had that long lasting after taste. Overall Awesome Balance of Beer ."
Got 2 bottles in a trade. 
Bottle poured into RR chalice
"Had my first bottle recently at the Cuban Cigar Factory in the San Diego gaslamp district. A barely 2 week old bottle. I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said, except:"
"Not as impressive as Elder. Had it at 1 week and 8 weeks. Seems to matter. Friends who hate IPA were very impressed. Very balanced. Hate the green design, but its very recognizable."
This beer is consistently delicious.
Took me a while to track down and believe me it's hard to track them down and manage to snag one before it sells out but overall the beer is ridiculously good . Goes strong in taste and flavor at first sip then almost immediately goes smooth and refreshing . For some ipa drinkers this could be good or bad . I however love an IPA that can give you all its got and slim down at the end for the a smoother consumption.
"Needless to say, this is really good, but at least at this point there are dozens of IPAs and DIPAs in California that are just as tasty. That being said, if you do find it, it is excellent and good value for money."
"Looks clear yellow, 1 finger slight head. Quickly disappears."
"Grassy, malty nose with slight resinous hop aroma. Not as citrusy as I expected. Flavor matches the nose - grassy hop presence with mild malt finish. Slight passion fruit tinge in the flavor as well. Mouthfeel was fairly creamy and smooth for the ABV and IBU. Wish the bottle was fresher! Bottled 3/25/15 and drank 8/6/15. I will be updating my reviews as I try fresher bottles."
Every bit worthy of the hype! Excellent brew!
"Pliny. The. Elder. So much hype, I had to get five on my friend’s latest visit to RR (thanks, Scott). Looking at this wonderful IIPA is probably something like seeing your first born child. And although the smell is orgasmic and the appearance is that of the Mona Lisa, the beer fails to live up to the buildup. This is not to say that the brew is poor or subpar in any capacity, but it is just not the third best IPA in the world. Simply put: it is not the third best IPA in the world. It’s fucking good. But it’s not the third best IPA in the world."
"I honestly believe this beer is way overhyped. Good IPA, not great. I was actually disappointed when I tried it. Heady Topper is by far better IMO. BY FAR!"
Delicious. My current fave and worth every penny.
Perfect version of the west coast ipa style. Dank and citrusy with great carbonation and mouthfeel. Perfectly balanced west coast IPA that is an amazing drink during a warm day.
Very good beer. Buddy brought it back from CA for me. Tried in MI
"Got a few 500ml Plineys sent to me by a friend in CA. They handled the shipping pretty well, despite the hot conditions of transit. Those that underrate PtE may just be too cool for school, or got a old batch. There's a reason it rates so high. Piney, but undeniably smooth for a DIPA. ABV hidden well by complex notes of pine and citrus"
"Be wary of shipping these things nationwide during these toasty summers. Fresh bottles + extreme heat can turn a once delicious Pliny into somewhat of a malt bomb. So if you can wait, acquire through shipping in the colder months to avoid disappointment."
"I picked up a case in Santa Rosa last weekend and, after ten days straight of drinking Pliny, I'm ready to change it up."
"Had a taste at a bottleshare and was pretty disapointed. Aroma was faint, taste follows the aroma. Not as bold/hoppy as more recent IPA's. To be fair the bottle was over 2 months old and the beer was not as cold as I would like (bottleshare was outside in 90+ degrees). Hoping to try an fresh bottle and will update score."
"I felt this definitely lived up to hype. Absolutely delicious, so drinkable, and so affordable (at the brewery)."
"Seeing where this one was ranked, I was very excited to try."
Heard about it for so long... Great hop and malt affect. Balanced and beautiful. I was not disappointed
A staple in my life that I don't want to think about living without.
Smells great much better than it tastes.
"Served on draft, poured into a pint glass."
Ah PtE - one of the classics. Unfortunately Pliny is also starting to taste a little out of date in my opinion. I've had it recently on draft at RR and picked up bottles while I was there as well.
So glad I got to experience it during my recent trip to San Diego. Had on tap at Pizza Port. Lived up to the hype. Hope to get my mitts on some more.
Beautiful bouquet and better taste. Pours clear with a bright white head. Decent amount of carbonation. The hops just keep on giving throughout. Love this one.
"So clear and clean with a beautiful hoppy scent. The taste is west coast dankiness but not overpowering, and some citrus fruits such as grapefruit and orange are there. Ever so tasty, and refreshing! One of my favorite beers of all time."
"Great beer, great drink, hard to find in my area. A friend shared with me and it was a fantastic glass! Would like to acquire more, if even possible."
Pours a clear golden amber about an inch of head.
"Very refreshing and smoother beer for a higher ABV. Pliny is a very well balanced beer, hops, notes of fruit and alcohol all mess perfectly for this Double IPA. Too good to only have one!"
Big but still crisp and refreshing enough for a hot summer day with complexity in the hop profile dominated by citrus fruits. Chunky lacing running down my empty pint glass confirmed the generous load of hops that went into this.
The grandaddy of all american ipa's.
Pours clear amber with about an inch head. Nose is smooth with aroma of pine and citrus. Smooth from start to end with crisp and slight malt and bitterness. Solid DIPA that definitely lives up to hype. Had it fresh and a month old bottle and was still a solid brew!
"Not an IPA guy, but this may be the best I've ever had...for what it's worth"
Pours vibrant amber with a small head.
"I was able to trade for a couple of these and let me tell you, it was a great experience. This beer lives up to all the hype. Smell is light citrus/fruit notes with a touch of pine, all balanced perfectly through to the back. No flavor out does the others. Nice and smooth feel throughout, no lingering after taste. The only thing that lingers at the end is the desire for another sip."
What could i possible say that hasnt been said about how slamming this beer is????? Wow
Was able to sample three of these (on tap and 2 bottles) a year ago in San Diego.
"Well, I was excited to try this one and the beer lived up to the hype. Apex Portland had this on tap and I happened to be in town. As it warmed I actually got more of the subtleties here. The bitter forward, grapefruit centered hop profile shines here and proves to be the star as the blend of dankness and sweet slight malt kicks in on the back end."
Yea it's that good. Can't imagine a better beer. If there is one I need to have one soon....
This beer lives up to the hype. Yum! Exactly one month old.
Look clear golden with 2 finger head.
"Perfectly clear with loads of fluffy white head. Smells dank and floral with a hint of citrus as it warms up--I don't get the same fruity-ness that has overtaken DIPAs by now. Taste is superb--bitter, hoppy, a little sweetness and citrus, with some nice nutty malt balancing it out. Almost a chewy, creamy hoppiness. Totally fantastic. A true classic. "
"The classic west coast double IPA. Excellently well balanced. Not too hoppy, not too sweet. The perfect daily drinker."
"Pours golden and translucent. Two finger head. Smells of pine and citrus. Taste is bitter and clean. Mostly hop forward, but not too much to throw off the balance. A clean dry finish, somewhat peppery. Overall pretty good beer. It didn't really live up to the hype for me. I was expecting a bit more for an IPA this highly revered. Good, but not great."
Not my first time having this but first time in a while. It's a truly fantastic beer. It is worth the hype as long as you think of it as something that changed the game and realize that there are countless other fantastic DIPAs on the market.
"Damn good double IPA, but definitely didn't live up to my expectations. There is a bitterness here that isn't present in better, more balanced DIPA's. Definitely worth drinking, especially at the price, but don't break your back over it."
This is just a phenomenal beer.
"Great taste, the IBU's do not overwhelm just help the overall flavor. The head is a soft white fluffy goodness"
"Had two from the 6-26-15 batch and I was super impressed, Such a great beer. Tons of flavors that all blend together great. The finish is so amazing.. I want more."
Had on draft at Russian River brewpub and multiple bottles over 3 week period from bottling date.
"Really? That's ""it""?"
"still massively consistent...immensely balanced on all points...the abv is hidden well...all those balanced points work together to make a synergetic leap (the whole is greater than the parts for sure)....there are 'hoppier' creatures out there, but the grand naturalist and historian's name is represented well here (which is become quite historic...nay, legendary!)....but there is solidity here with the basic package of all-out double trouble regal IPA-ish-ness....thickness and bitterness are generously slathered here, but the malt foundation serves it well to create, maintain and future fordwardfeed this enduring, timeless classic ale. so very hightly recommended. if only Nugget Nectar was as consistent..."
"Definitely lives up to the hype. This beer is nothing less than exceptional. I am totally captivated by the nose, so much so, that I don't want to stop smelling it to take a sip! Grapefruit and Pine blend together perfect in harmony. The taste totally bursting in West Coast fashion, bitter and pine resin dominate. One of the best."
"Exceptional on all fronts. The often sweet malty flavor of a DIPA is not there, more like an IPA. Yet, the hop dominance and smoothness pushes the edge of good taste without without getting to an unbalanced state."
"The first time I had this beer, I almost couldn't believe what I was smelling and tasting. I'm not sure you can really compare it to Heady, because they are entirely different beers. While Heady may be more easily drinkable, Pliny has more of a WOW! factor. I've had this on draft, and in a fresh bottle. Both were similar experiences."
I had this beer on draft for the first time at a bar on 30th street in San Diego. It might be the best beer I have ever had. It definitely lives up to the hype. Awesome double IPA. I wish I could get it where I live.
"To you fellow east-coasters who have heard but not yet tried, this beer lives up to the hype. It's on par with Heady, for sure. I hope to have this again."
Vessel: 16oz bottlepoured into a Russian River pint glass
"Incredibly, deceptively smooth. The mouthfeel is amazing! Glides down like a river of sweet hoppy deliciousness. The nose is sweet floral with a hint of dandelion and/or lavender. Alcohol is hardly perceptible, but makes itself known. This beer is truly worthy of it's fame!"
I've had this several times. The best experience was on draft. In the bottle not so much.
"Aromatic, smooth which is rare for an ipa. Most of my friends hate iPa's but they will drink this over and over again. This is the best beer in the world"
"Beer is an attractive amber/copper with a thick white head. Very nice lacing. Aroma is dank and bready, with notes of orange rind, pineapple, and fir. Taste is fantastic and follows the nose. Some bready malt in the background and a huge, complex, balanced dose of hops: a dry, bitter finish with notes of orange, fir, and tropical fruits. Mouthfeel is great. Nicely carbonated, a bit of warming from the 8% alcohol. Overall, a fantastic double IPA. Smooth, balanced, and drinkable, but incredibly complex and subtle."
"Friend shared a bottle. Truly fantastic. Tried along several other highly respected DIPA - Pliny is noticeably better, more balanced."
A gift from a friend. What I heard about this beer is true - it is sneaky!! It goes down so smooth for a DIPA. A tasty beer
"I liked pliney. I had some at the bar in santa rosa when i was in cali visiting. I bought a case to bring back to the house we were staying at. Blind pig was also very good. And they had another beer called Aud Blonde Ale that was really great. I will say though, i docked a couple points for two reasons. I dont think pliny is by far and away better than heady, larsons sip, or even sixpoint resin. Possibly my east coast taste buds prefer those brews. Also, there was a complete shitbag of a bartender working at the bar at RR. The other 3 or so bartenders were really cool and didnt have an ego stick shoved up their ass. This guy put a bit of a damper on my experience. He had an issue with me because i was a tourist, but he shut up after we engaged in great conversations with other attendees at the bar. Anyway, pliny is fucking good and they make some really good beers at RR. The food is excellent too. "
"What a fantastic rendition of an imperial IPA. Exceptionally well-rounded, great smooth flavor, and a pleasure to drink. Perfect combination of hoppy flavor and smells. Definitely not a juicy IPA. Very happy I was finally able to get my hands on this. Will absolutely be looking for more."
really enjoyed the awesome balance...more than anything
Very floral smell and taste notes that round out a very hop forward beer. The taste and feel in your mouth is so well balanced that the heavy ABV is barely noticeable.
Don't really know what the hype is about. Warmed up to it after some air got to it. Very malty and piney.
The perfectly balanced IPA. No bitterness at all. But also not that interesting to me.
"All hail the Pliny! Spoiled that I have easy access to this beer. It's a great one. I always pick it up when available. Russian River is special because you can tell that they really try their hardest to focus on perfecting their product. Creamy mouthfeel, sharp and intricate hop flavor, great body, and delicious all around finish. Pretty hard to beat!"
HUGE thanks to aViewFromTheHOP for this one! 500ml bottle into a teku.
"Hum, I may have missed something here. Bottled 6/10, ok 2 1/2 weeks old... good, but not great. Got a smokiness from it. Do they smoke any of the malts on the grain bill?"
My bottle was poured 6/11/15 so really fresh Its good but def a hype thing going on ...Maharaja is way smoother and i perfer it over this anyday!!
"From bottle poured into Stella Artois chalice. Strong floral and hops smell, smooth yet bitter mouth feel. Taste of bitter hops, but not too bitter. This is an excellent IPA, it's exactly what an IPA should look, smell, and taste like. One of the best."
"Was a very good Imperial IPA overall. I think there are better ones out there for sure, but it was still a delicious beer. A bit more malty than expected, but had a nice pine flavor profile from the hops that worked nicely. The bottle I had was 2.5 weeks old, so I don't think I will get much fresher in Ohio!"
Bottle dated 5/15 so a tad over a month old. I've been waiting for this.
Pours very orange with a long lasting thick head. It has tons of citrus to the nose. Finishes With Great Grapefruit taste. Top 5 IPAs in my book.
An amazing IPA. Lucky enough to have had this at least once. Is it better than Sculpin though?
Great beer. I'm not huge into IPAs but this was truly a pleasure. wish I had more.
"I have three IPAs in my best ever, buy it and drink immediately category: Pliny, Enjoy By, and Yellow Rose. "
Wow! I never realized what I was missing
"Simply one of the best IPAs and beers in the world. Truly embodies what an IPA should be. To maximize its full potential, you simply have to taste it fresh and don't sit on it."
4.7 AROMA 9/10 APPEARANCE 5/5 TASTE 9/10 PALATE 5/5 OVERALL 19/20
"Finally got my hands on some Pliny The Elder!! Found 4 pints, shipped one to my brother and kept the rest. This one definitely lived up to the hype for me. Was by far the smoothest IPA I've tasted, it had a great citrusy wonderful aroma. I will be keeping tabs on the delivery schedule for this stuff in the future."
"With all the hype, I was expecting more. It is a great, balanced DIPA, but I'm not experiencing much depth. In the Pliny Heady battle, Heady comes out on top."
"Before I had my first class I was so prepared to be disappointed by this beer, but it lives up to the hype in every conceivable way."
The beer Jesus drinks when he isn't banishing people from heaven.
"This beer tasted so fresh, felt like I was drinking herbs. Loved it."
Over rated not as big as the hype that was behind it. I love ipa but this wasn't that impressive
I mean just delicious beer.
I am a spoiled IPA nut and this tops all
"This was exceptional, three weeks in the bottle. Well sought out, highly hyped up, and lived up to every last praise. Picked up a couple of 510s at BDBS in Gaslamp (they were in the back), and immediately cracked a cold one back at the hotel. The only thing that may have improved this is my Spiegelau! Beautiful orange/amber color with a finger of white head. Huge West Coast IIPA nose full of citrus (orange, lemon) and strong pine. Similar notes to taste, yet exceptionally pronounced. Opened up greatly as the brew was slowly sipped and savored. Clean, dry finish. The benchmark for the IIPA style for me moving forward."
Appears a clear amber color. Cleaner than most I've had. Thick white head with lasting retention.
"This beer doesn't need a review, or a salesman...She makes the world class vinters of the region GREEN with envy. Legendary suds!!!!"
The perfect beer. Tastes floral and citrusy.
"Great fucken beer,I get this regular at Ramirez liquor east LA..."
"On tap at the Platypus Pub in Bend, OR. One of my white whales! Not enough superlatives to rate this great brew. Order, sip and savor. One for the ages."
Even old... this was an incredible beer. I can't wait to have it fresh fresh fresh.
"May 30, 2015"
The fresher the better! Great smell and amazing taste. Very hoppy but it is always smooth and balanced. This has become my regular everyday beer. It's one of my top three favorite IPA's.
"It's a really good IPA, but does it really live up to the hype? It's damn good, but not quite the best IPA I've ever had..."
"Wow! Well balanced through out the whole experience! Lived up to the hype. This is the second time I had it and I've had many ipas n dipas and tipas in between.. Still taste exceptionally great! Had the privilege to taste a heady topper last night with my bro who has a hook up from Vermont, and.... Both are definitely world class but I give the edge to Pliny, thanks to stone brewery for bringing Pliny down here to the Mecca."
Balanced perfection provides a phenomenal sensory experience that's hard to replicate especially at 8%.
"Went to the brewery/bar in Santa Rosa on way to Napa/Sonoma. Glad I made the side trip. They really know what they're doing. Place was packed on a random Wednesday. Pliny is one phenomenal IPA, possibly best I've ever had, definitely in top 3. Lots of pine and grapefruit but also incredibly well balanced for a double and the 8% is almost unnoticeable."
The clouds parted and light came down from the heavens above.....
Hop aroma. Thick head. Wow first time I've had this. Nice balance for a hoppy beer. I like it. I'm told this a highly sought after beer. I can see why it's liked.
"This was my first rare/extremely exciting double IPA. I never reviewed it when I went out to the Santa Rosa brewery and experienced it for the first time. Oh, to go back again after having so many world class IIPAs like Heady, SoS, Trillium, Abrasive, etc. But drinking Pliny now reminds me why it is so highly regarded. To date, this is the most balanced and wonderful double IPA I have ever had. It has all the elements of a double that are done so well. There's no overwhelming malt liquor sting and the hop balance is so perfect. Ugh this is such a dream beer. I'll review it now that my uncle brought me back 6 bottles. "
"Much easier to find then the younger and better tasting. A couple great bottle shops in Sd offer this beer once a month and it flies off the shelves. Scent is very piny, with small hints of citrus. Medium to low mouthfeel providing a smooth aftertaste. Always worth a pint or bottle purchase."
"Bought a bottle from Russian River. This beer has a good mix of aroma, balanced taste, and drinkability. This is an IPA that I could see myself drinking all day long. I feel like the name threw me off some, however. I'd love to try blind, with some others for comparison sake."
Toronado. San Diego. Perfection. Juicy A.F.
Great Double IPA Drove 6 hours from LA to get to Russian river
"Smooth, clean and well balanced. Very much a a West Coast IPA. Delicious."
on of my favorite ipa's. a little over priced tho
Probably the best IPA I've had the pleasure of drinking.
"Solid Double IPA, nothing exceptional, but well above average. Definitely is a malt forward beer with a decent amount of pine like hops. Has a mildly hoppy, bitter finish."
"Pours rustic orange. Nice head and retention. Nose is citrusy pine resinous. Taste follows. Balanced, nice malt backbone. Piney, resinous hops. Grapefruit. Lingering bitterness. Crisp refreshing body. Excellent beer."
L: pours copper in color and is transparent. After pour the 1 thick head stuck around for the majority of drinking. The head was very creamy and left some beautiful lacing lines after each sip. The lacing held strong the entire time. 
Hard to find. Got lucky late last year. Great stuff.
"Finally got to try this beast!...What a treat. The quintessential west coast IPA. Very similar bitterness and citrus fruit presence one would anticipate from the style, but every aspect seems to just be a little better than the competition. Excellent carbonation level and mouthfeel for an IPA with a great taste and a good nose."
"I do not know how else to say this without sounding grandiose, but I feel like I have truly found the holy grail of all IPAs. Being in NY I am unable to get this one and have thus wanted to get my hands on it for a while to see what all the hype was about. Luckily, my father went on a trip to the Bay Area recently with a request to find Pliny. He brought back three bottles, which did nothing to disappoint. Holy mother of all beers! I never curse in reviews, but,.... here goes...this is the greatest fucking shit I've ever tasted in my life!!!"
"Finally got to try this. Thanks Brian for bringing this back from California. Bottled on 4/21. Perfect golden body with a wonderful white head. Tons of pine in the aroma. Puts you right in the mindset of walking in a pine forest. Huge bitter pine flavor with tons of citrus taste. So good. Seems like an excellent balance of pine and citrus, probably leaning more on the pine side. Oddly, there was still some left in the bottle after the bottle share, so I went back for seconds.."
Don't waste your time trying to get this one. 
"It's a great beer, when you're drinking it you can't tell that it's a double Ipa thats 8%. Is it worth all the hype? Naw I don't personally think so, but if it is on tap I will for sure get a pint. I personally like a bitter bite when I drink an Ipa and it doesn't really deliver that."
"Gold draft pour, white head, and good lace. Grapefruit and pine nose. Tart fresh squeezed grapefruit with fresh hop finish; malt foundation holds it all together well. Medium mouthfeel with pine resin tongue coating. Excellent - one of the best beers I've ever had!"
"Cask - San Francisco, CA - bottle (but previously enjoyed on draft at Toronado)"
"Excellent beer overall (ie the 100 point rating). It's always a race to our local Total Wine to be one of the few to get one and always a treat if you're lucky enough. For me, I enjoy bright citrus notes which Elder only has subtle hints of, but this is definitely a beer in my top 5 and I highly recommend trying."
Lagunitas taste-a-like. -.5 for the hype
"Perfect example of the style. Well rounded IIPA with all the elements you look for. Glorious piney, bready and citrusy aroma. Pine, slight citrus, slight floral flavor with malt to back it up. Sticky, full texture with a slightly dry finish."
The king of the piney ipa's. The gold standard of beer. The granddaddy of them all. The sultan of swat. The.....
Friend brought me back two from a west coast trip. Pleasure to finally have this one. Another friend mentioned that it was like an IPA marshmallow that melts in your mouth. It was an incredible beer. Super thankful to try it. Damn good. One of the best I have ever had for sure.
Sublime taste. Thick and syrupy pine flavor and smooth sudsy mouth feel. Would drink again.
Perfection. There is no rival.
16oz bottle (4 days old!) poured into a Russian River pint glass
"Crisp and clean, all around great beer"
"The best IPA I have ever had. (That being said I have not had the pleasure of meeting ""the younger""). True definition of a beautiful double IPA. Perfect in look, smell, taste and feel. Every palate is different, and the introduction of each aroma and taste will be yours to discover when you have the opportunity to become acquainted with Pliny the Elder."
Thanks to my future cousin-in-law for saving me one of these after his trip to Cali. Definitely lived up to the hype. I'm from Vermont originally and this stands up there with Heady; although comparing the two of those is like apples to oranges (other than they are both DIPAs). Top notch beer and I can't wait until I can get my hands on it again
Picked this up in a trade on 4/28/15 with calitrie1486.
This really lived up to the hype for me. Very well balanced imperial. I would drink it all the time if I could get it.
Crisp clean golden pour
Better on draft. Bottles were 1 day old when purchased. Juicy hop aroma and flavor linger throughout the pour. Lived up to expectations.
Hits the nail right on the head. Best example of a west coast DIPA I've ever had!!!
"The aroma is outstanding, nice balance between sweet malt and bitter hops, would be a 5 al around of it wasn't for Younger"
I've had PtE twice at Russian River and my overall critique hasn't changed. It's a good Double IPA but in my opinion not even in my top 5. There's nothing wrong with it. The taste is a nice mix of pine and citrus with a good hop bite and it goes down pretty easily. I just think the hype has convinced people it is better than it is. I understand those who think it's the holy grail of IPAs. I feel the same way about Zombie Dust for PAs.
"Very solid. Beautiful orange color. Nose has a lot of pine and citrus notes. Taste is good, but comes off a little too bitter. Great pine and citrus taste, but the bitterness is just a little too much. I prefer Blind Pig or even the Younger. Feels a little thin for DIPA. Overall though, a very good beer."
Sooo good! Beat the pants off Heady! Real good balance!
Tastes like hoppy marijuana goodness that dances around your pallet.
Thanks to petty_crimes for the great trade I got three fresh Pliny's along with a few other Cali beers. This beer is even better than the couple I had in a trade a year ago due to the fact these were much fresher. 
Great beer. Would love to enjoy it fresh right off the tap.
"I hate to be all about the hype, but I live in Northern California and find myself making that hour and a half long trip to Santa Rosa at least twice a month to fill up my growlers and get a case or two, it is THE textbook double IPA. Citrus, and pine are present from the first smell to the last the sip, thank you Russian River"
Poured into DFH IPA glass
"The frothy head got me salivating immediately. The pine scent was unexpected and awesome. At 8%, the hops are present but extremely well balanced. Obviously wasn't ever going to live up to the hype, but a very good beer."
A must have... one damn good beer
"Probably a groundbreaker when it first came out, but now just above average...doesn't stack up against the best but a delicious beer nonetheless"
Probably the most overhyped IPA. Took me three months of bugging my local beer hub tonfinally get 2 bottles and it is probably one of my least favorite IPAs. Its hoppy. Its tasty. It has a decent abv in its class. Its not worth the searching or effort to get one.
The Pliny from the tap at Russian River is noticeably better than anywhere else (which is really saying something). Simply an amazing beer.
"Brewed on 3/19/15; opened and consumed on 4/18/15. I must say for New Hampshire getting to try this within 30 days on the born on date is pretty good. Light orange almost honey in color with a pretty solid frothy head that dissipates to a bubbly cap on top. Streaks of lacing transform to spotty in nature all the way down the glass edges. The aroma of pine, resin, citrus, and floral hops is rather subdued with nothing too overpowering. Flavor profile for this Imperial IPA is quite delicious. The pine and resin start off the flavors with a very nice grapefruit taste finishing the profile. Solid bodied and only a slight bitterness on the back end of the palate with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall, Pliny the Elder really does live up to the hype and is an awesome example of an double imperial ipa."
a great smoothing tasting beer
Not a big DIPA fan but this one is special. I'll be looking for more in the near future.
"Have had this a number of times, and my original view was strong pine aroma and taste with a bit of citrus thrown in. It was one of the most flavorful and ""hoppy"" beers I'd ever had. That was prior to me getting in to the ""craft beer craze"" and trying many more different Double IPAs (and even Triple) over the past 3 months (late bloomer i know). My palate has adjusted a bit. While I still sense the pine, its not nearly as strong and now i taste a little resin on finish. It is incredibly smooth to mefor 8%, which actually is fairly moderate these days for a Double IPA. Perfect balance to me of hops/malt. Hard to find, but lucky my local place has it and can find bottles if i get to my liquor store early enough. Will need to trek up to Russian River to try at the brewery. Prefer draft to bottle and prefer closer to room temp than fridge cold."
"Hard to believe I conquered the mountain and secured a couple of these. Hate to nit pick but two of these were purchased 4/01, but we're bottled 3/07?? They don't sit in the shelf so I guess they sat at the brewery? In any event impossible to live up to the hype. More bitter on the back end than I expected. Good but not mind blowing. Purely from taste, Heady and Zombie way better. Update- One day later, had another and I have to admit the balance of malt and hops is pretty fucking good."
"Ah, the original"
"Personally no different from any IPA out there, however I do like the fruity after taste. Weirdly enough I always find myself taking off early from work on Wednesdays to pickup Plinys for the weekend..."
"Had it on tap at the brewery, awesome. Had it in a bottle from a trade, pretty good."
Classic go-to. Superb IPA. Enough said.
"An amazing Ale, It's pungeant smell is that of pine and light citrus and for those who smoke herb, a great deal dank. The taste follows, and for 8% this ale goes down smoother than silk. The only problem with this amazing beer is the fact you can only buy 2 bottles at a time and it's limited availability, but if you live in CA or are visiting, definitely you have to try this at least once."
"Finally had the opportunity to try Pliny the Elder and must say I was extremely disappointed. While it's a solid IIPA, I've had much better. Don't believe the hype."
"Muy bien equilibrada, amargor persistente en el fondo de la boca, sabores cítricos, piña y pino."
Finally got this in a trade it definitely lives up to the hype this is a ridiculously well balanced dipa
Great great great beer!!
Tasty but very bitter. Not as good as everyone says.
"Great beer, could drink it all day."
"it's tough to live up to the hype around this beer, but Pliny gives more than a fair shake to that task. i could go on and on about the hop/malt balance, but it's pretty redundant at this stage in the beer's storied history."
I never want to die after tasting this glorious brew. IPA for life!
"Again, not the biggest IPA fan, but this is tasty. Had it from bottle and tap, tap is the way to go."
"This beer is perfect from start to finish. Yes it does in fact live up to the Hype. Only problem I have with this beer is I am out of it. But I look forward to getting some in the future, hopefully sooner rather than later. My only advice is Get Some!!!! "
Poured from a lovingly shipped aliquot (thank you MNishCT77) born on 021115 into IPA glasses and enjoyed in both sips and gulps over 30 minutes.
"Pliney the Younger's ""older brother"", available year round and in bottles / growlers. Very hoppy and strong. By far, Russian River's most popular brew. Weird thing is, the Elder and the Younger are two very different brews. The Younger is not the Elder only more so, if that makes any sense."
"Imperial IPA very well done beer. Gotta try it if you haven't, must remember it if you have."
"Exceptional IPA, indeed sets the standard. Hoppy goodness flowing throughout bottle and the citrus crushes any alcohol taste. Definitely wanted more as soon as I was done."
"Lucky enough to get to try this at the Falling Rock Taphouse in Denver. Didn't think it could live up to the hype, but damn if it isn't just about perfect."
Awesome beer! Maybe not the greatest I have ever had... but it is in the top 10. I think there might be a little over-hype going on... but it is an amazing beer!
Wish this was in CT. Really great flavor...love this beer
Its really an awesome beer :)
"Not a fan, I just dont get the hype. Pretty sure the hype train is just pushing it up"
"Fantastic beer. Update: It's amazing beer advocate changed the rating system. Now, only ratings That come with a review of 150 characters will count. They've now just discounted thousands of ratings just because they want ""quality"". Well guess what, you now have a smaller sample size and beers with only 159 ratings are cracking the top 20. So stupid. It's 2015, people are busy. I don't want to spend 10 minutes describing my feelings about every beer I drink!"
First sip at Rock n Brews El Segundo spring 2011 DIRECTV happy hour. Second sip with John at Naja's Redondo Beach February 2015.
The most balanced DIPA I have had but didn't live up to the hype for me. But overall very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is exceptional.
Perfect dipa worth every hype. So glad I can access it easily
Golden shimmering with light
The best IPA ever. PERIOD
I have been looking for this beer for awhile and I will say....it did not fail to meet its hype. Great smell! And even better taste.....we'll played Russian River Brewing Company.
It's okay but not what I was hoping for with all these high ratings
one of the most tasty DIPA ever!
as good as advertised .very hoppy but well rounded and smooth finish
"Long wait to get it, but easily the smoothest I PA I've ever had. Kinda miss the East Coast bite."
"On tap, in a nonic pint glass, at the Russian River brew pub."
"This is a great beer but it was hyped up so much that I feared it wouldn't live up to my expectations. It partially did; great initial flavor, color and smell but it fell flat at the end, it was missing something. After being around heady topper, dinner and lunch all my life this beer did not live up to its reputation. I would definitely get it again if I had the chance but if I had all the others to choose from, I would go with any of those."
Its as good as its reputation. I prefer the elder over the younger.
33 days old. I'm told its better younger. That smell though... I'd wear it as cologne if I could.
One of the Best IPA's on the market. hands down.
Finally had my first draft of Pliny; damn it was good!!
"If I had to chose one beer to drink the rest of my life, Pliny would be a serious candidate. Amazing taste and drinkability, there is not much to dislike about this beer."
Best on draft at Russian River but wouldn't kick a bottle out of bed.....wait. Fantastic beer. Pliny and HT tied for best DIPA in my book.
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter - probably not the glass choice of most, but mine holds the whole bottle well. A stunning looker - phenomenal head, with massive lace. "
This is the only beer I would wait in line 6 hours to have! It's so smooth
Aromatic and full bodied. Smooth hoppy finish with some floral aroma. Just an all around great imperial IPA
"Poured into a pint glass. A clear golden color with a two-finger white head. Great head retention and lacing in the glass. Bright aromas of oranges, grapefruit, some stone fruit, pine, earthy tones, and white bread. The taste was classice West Coast IPA with aggressive but clean bitterness and the flavors listed above. Beautiful."
"It was ok, for a west cost beer it mostly hopped with a piney hop flavor and medium body, i would not rate it higher than a lot of other very good Double IPA's but its still an ok beer."
Respectable beer! Just has a nutty flavor/aftertaste that I'm not crazy about
"Thank-you to my future son-in-law for bringing this from CA to NY for a little gift. Actually a big gift. Born on 02/10/15 and savored on 03/10/15. This beer has earned all the top ratings this beer has gathered. My pour produced a slightly larger head than I was expecting but I think it was my fault as I wanted to get right to it. Turned out well as all the best aromas of a top-notch DIPA were released. Taste is (I'm writing as I savor) is superb. Though now on my ""got"" list it remains on my ""want"" list as in want more. Nicely done Russian River Brewing Co."
I may have had a bad keg of this but it really disappointed. I did not detect any aroma from my beer and there was no hop flavor to speak of.
I am a believer. 
Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Drank 2 days from bottled date.
"Definitely lived up to the hype, but right behind Pipeworks Square Grouper and Sure Bet."
"Great beer, but something about Blind Pig makes me choose it over Pliny"
Best looking beer I've ever drank.
No re-inventing the wheel on this review - this beer is outstanding on every count - manged to consume about 10 bottles over the last month and I have to say this is just about the best beer I've ever had. It deserves all the accolades it receives.
"A-Golden yellow color, white head with gracious lacing"
"On tap at Beechwood BBQ. Lots of hype for Pliny. Got citrus, roasty, spruce. Excellent!"
"such a delicious beer, 10/10 "
"Oh, Pliny.... Where do I start? I first had you when I was just getting into craft beer and I totally fell victim to the hype. While you are not a bad beer by any means, in fact, I would drink you far more often if the craft beer hipsters did not hoard you and if bottle shops would not gouge your price and/or hide you 'in the back'. "
"Phenomenal, just wish it wasn't so difficult to find."
"Bottled 2/4/15. Poured into a 6 ounce stemless wine glass. Vigin-white-bridesmaid-dress head forms on top of an a.a.milne-Winnie-the-poo-colored honey base. The lace transcribed into Wachowski-bros-Matrix-title-sequence-like movement frozen into a Pangea by a Zack Morris timeout. The smell is starfruit and pomegranate mixed with a freshly opened pack of Upper Deck baseball cards. A perfect West Coast hop/malt balance that rolls over the tongue; can only be described as sitting in the back car of a rollercoaster being whiplashed over the apex, with a new year's champagne/light almond oil finish. Overall, it's the equivalent of hugging my dog after a bad day at work."
What more us there to say.... One of the best!!
"Golden appearance, fruit and pine on the nose. Tropical fruit and grapefruit give way to bitter pine. "
"Tasty, but not as smooth and flavorful as Blind Pig and underwhelming (only because of the astronomically high expectations.)"
"Bottle received in a recent trade, dated 1/28/15. Poured into snifter. Nice nose on this one, poured to a one finger head that laced well. Expectations were through the roof, and though I really enjoyed the beer (I have to admit I was expecting a ""5"" here), it wasn't quite everything I hoped for. That being said and to no one's surprise, it was a terrific IPA. Smooth and pretty delicious. Just not the best beer I've ever had."
Heavenly...it really does live up to the hype...
A masterpiece. Lucky to have it on tap in Philly year round.
"No question this a great representation of the style and a pioneer in the way of great IPAs. Piney, bitter but balanced. I do think it is a bit hyped for the ratings it receives but none the less amazing."
Pretty damn good. Can't wait to get my hands on more of it.
Perfect mix of bitter/citrus flavor
"Wow. I can't believe I'm about to write this. I've never felt like a 'beer snob', but WOW. I feel so misled. Being from Vermont, where massive IPA's are de rigueur, I totally expected more based on ratings and reviews. I obtained my sample(s), via trade. They are very fresh (less than 2 weeks). They arrived well packed and cold, so I don't think mishandling is involved. My first impression: this is such an average feeling DIPA in 2015. Sean Lawson was brewing this same beer a decade ago in his shed. It is relatively clean, smooth and true to IPA form. But that standard sailed a half decade ago, at least in New England. Five years ago I might have been blown away. Today? I am sadly unimpressed. I am dismayed at how this is perceived by the public."
This brew is a masterpiece of balance for the palate.
On tap in Philly - amazing!
"Purely tastes like grapefruit. Hop, hop, hoppie. But many wish they could brew this beer. Many Pliny clones are brewed."
"Poured sideways into an IPA spiegalau. Heavy amount of head with constant bubble trails to the surface. SRM of ~15 , amber in color though slightly darker than expected. Lattice work formed along the sides with consumption. About 1/4"" to 1/3"" of resurgent head consistently formed upon agitation. Smell was incredible, with an overall pungent floral smell with obvious hops and pine. Taste was a fresh, crisp fruity tartness, reminiscent of grapefruit. Perfectly astringent, with a slight but not overpowering pucker. Finish was a slow build of bitterness that progressed, but finished asymptotically smooth. Definite presence of pine and resin. Mouthfeel was medium, with some definite body though counterbalanced by its refreshing taste. Overall, probably my favorite beer as of now, and anyone who is interested in hoppy beers ought to try this!"
Still not as good as all the hype.
Pours a clear golden apricot. Two fingers white head that reduces to foam leaving awesome lacing. Medium mouthfeel with aromas of tropical fruits and pine. There is a reason this is a top 10 beer.
"There are some really, really good double IPAs on the market."
"This beer is my new IPA favorite over Dogfish Head's 60min. Amazingly well balanced floral notes, sweetness with bitterness. The upfront bitters are subdued with only a slight reminder that you just took a sip of a delicious fruity, piney, crisp, and sparkling golden IPA."
"510ml bottle, yellow, white head."
Phenomenal IPA and I don't even really like IPAs. The nose is incredible with hints of citrus and other fruit. The taste is spectacular and the mouthfeel is on point.
It lived up to the hype. It made me realize how over hoped some beers can be nowadays. It had hops but yet so drinkable.
The best beer on the planet!
"Finally found it on tap at Hamilton's on a recent trip to the SanDiego. It was dark and busy so my review of this and a few other beers will be a little lighter than usual. Overall an outstanding DIPA which lives up to the hype. I will seek this out whenever I can. As with the Heady Topper I acquired a little while ago, I have a hard time saying it is the best beer I ever had, but if I was condemned to only drink this for the rest of my life, I would die very happy."
"Pours from the bottle a clear golden apricot with two fingers of white head. It reduces to foam, leaving heavy lacing. Loads of citrus, tropical fruits and pine in the aroma. There's plenty of piney hops, but it's nicely balanced with grapefruit, mango and pineapple. There's enough malt to give it a nice creaminess. Medium mouth with a touch of lingering bitterness. This certainly lives up to its reputation. Being Valentine's Day, it reminds me of my wife: Close to perfection and better than I deserve."
Finally got 2 try some Pliny's : not easy to find on the East Coast but worth the legwork to seek this one out.
This is one of those beers that truely lives up to the hype. I cannot think of another American Double Imperial IPA that has a crisper more satisfying and full bodied taste than PTE.
"Such a great beer, it really is one of the best and if you never had a DIPA before this is probably the best one to start with."
Had it on bottle once had it on tap yesterday with my youngers it was all awsome.the fact i. An get this in town 8 or nine times a year makes it my fav. Even more then yonger.
One of the few American IPA's that is worth the hype. This is a beautiful and remarkable beer.
Www.substrand.com I have posted an article on Pliny. Check it out
2 pint bottles sent from a friend. bottled in December
Fricking unreal..hoppy aroma to no end flavor of grassy hops and mango. Best ever.
I mean...there really doesn't exist a better DIPA
"Picked this up at Tahoe Central Market in Kings Beach Lake Tahoe. As usual, GREAT!"
I went to a local restaurant looking for a good IPA and I winded up getting the most delicious beer I have ever tasted. They offered me a tasting of it (they had just gotten it on tap that day) and I fell in love. I got a full pint and I was in beer heaven. Everything about this beer is delicious and it has a great finish. If you like IPA's then this beer is perfect for you.
The pinnacle of beerdom. Sorry other 49 states.
Been drinking Pliny for years and finally had the opportunity to visit the brewery in November and try one straight from the source on draft.
Got caught up in the hype. It's good but not in my top 5. Has a dry bite to it. I still like it though.
Another great double IPA. It is shipped as far east as Philadelphia which is still a drive but well worth it when it's in stock.
"I never thought I'd actually take the time to write a review, but I figure, what better beer to start with?"
Damn!!!! Speechless. A perfect balance. Double ipa nirvana. Why can't this beer be available in maine?!
Perfect IPA. From start to finish its a hoppy citrus followed by pine w the perfect amount of limited malt. 100/100 After I drank this beer I hack loogies and swallow them just to get more of the tastes and flavores this beer possess.
"One of the best there is. Piney, citrusy, beautifully balanced."
Really nice IPA
A: Nice golden orange color. Clear with a full head and nice lacing.
"Yo beer world, you need to get your shit checked cause this beer is just alright. There is nothing wrong with it, but it sure as hell isn't the second coming of beer Jesus, thats for damn sure."
Pliny the Elder is a very fresh and delicious double IPA with great balance.
"Clear amber pour with a tall white head with relatively good retention. Complex and pleasant smell, quite delicate, with notes of citrus, pineapple, mango, caramel and pine - this beer has everything. Extremely well balanced taste, bitter and sweet. Citrus, exotic fruit (pineapple again), pine, honey. Medium carbonation and a very soft and smooth mouthfeel, almost a bit oily, it goes down very easy. The aftertaste is mildly bitter, with notes of pine. An extremely well balanced and drinkable beer."
Its a very well balanced IPA. It doesn't leave that very bitter taste in your mouth as you drink it.
"Poured into a tulip glass from the 1-14-15 bottling. Bright light orange reminiscent of cider given the clarity. Finger of off-white head that dissipates gradually. Nose brings an explosion of orange marmalade and pine. The first sip brings orange to the fore followed by huge pine - tastes like I'm chewing a cud of pine needles. Flavor is more bitter than many of the IPAs rolling out of CA these days, which is nothing but a good thing. There is a reason this beer is a standard bearer."
First time having this. Amazing beer. Wish it was easier to get!
"Perfect balance of malt character with a beautiful dank, resin, citrus hop flavor. Best IIPA IVE EVER HAD."
"Incredibly consistent IPA, always awesome"
"Very unique complex profile...have only had this on draft and never in a bottle... if blindfolded, you could pick this one out of any number of IPAs/DIPAs, which is a good thing! Potent ABV... They went for it with this and hit a home run..."
Bottled 122314.
A big shout out to Hopasouras for hooking me up with this beer on my first beer trade!
"This is a good all around IPA/DIPA. I was lucky enough to give it a try last night and can't complain. Great aroma, nice color, feel... well balanced... almost perfection. Flavor is the only issue. It seems watered down in comparison to what I'm used to drinking - all the AIPA flavors are there, but it's all very subtle. Nothing overpowers, which is good, but when I grab an IPA, I'm looking for that hoppy wow factor and this just doesn't have it. That may be why it's so appealing to others, and if I wasn't big on IPAs, I'd probably make this my first choice. I think in the category of beer (in general), this is definitely a 5; but in the DIPA category, it's lacking...."
"Well, we meet at long last. 5,527 current wants for this bad boy. Hype is an understatement for what this thing is all about. As I sit here and enjoy this one, one word keeps coming to me: flawless. This beer did not cause me to stand up and cheer, nothing crazy in terms of smell or taste, but it is absolutely flawless in its delivery. Looks exactly the way a IIPA should, nice beautiful golden with a small head. Smells are west coast 101--pine and grapefruits. Bitter as hell on the palate, but the balance is incredible, leaves you dry and ready for another sip. So glad I had this beer. Would I go crazy to get it again? No, probably not. But when it comes to a perfect representation of this style, yup Pliny is where its at all day!"
One of my favorite IPA's.
the look of it overall is basic but thats the only basic part of this beer. Got it in a trade today and have to say it is better than the heady topper that i traded for it. Hands down the bees knees!
It doesn't get much better than this.
Lovely amber hue. Nice carbonation. Pillowy head. Beautiful lacing.
"Very refreshing and always pleasant, had one that was 3 1/2 months old and the hops still held up to fresher bottles I've had.There's not much to say about this beer that hasn't already been said. Not as good as Zombie Dust, or Myrcenary, but much better than Heady."
Piny/flowery hop. Not my favorite hop flavor.
The beer is perfect. Not much left to say.
"Hops through and through. Wonderful Pitney, grassy, herbal deliciousness."
Bottle about 2 weeks old.
"Was actually pretty underwhelmed by my first. Had Heady, Mastermind, Sip of Sunshine, and Abner back in October, and this just felt inferior. Much less balanced than the latter, and had lost some of its flavor on the journey from CA to NJ. Still a delightful DIPA. Maybe my next one will feel different."
Month old bottle brought back from a friend who was in LA. everything about this beer was perfect. Now I know what all the fuss is about. Can't wait to get this one again.
"Finally my lips had the mind- blowing honor to gulp this prestige IPA... Pliny the elder gents !!! Within seconds of popping the cap off the bottle you can already notice and admire it's freshness. Oi!!! Don't linger to long with the aroma, go ahead take a swig mate, it's just like sucking on the majestic nectar out of Gaia's bosom. Complete piney crisp flavors whirling down your throat with a memorable hoppy finish"
"Had a hard time finding it on my trip back home to the Bay, but got a few bottles. Bottled date was just 1 day old when I finally found it. It's a very good Double IPA, but I don't think it lived up to the hype of a 100-rated beer."
Heady is better but this is great
Just new to the site and wanted to have my opinion of Pliny out there.
"Bottled on 12/08/14. Previous bottles have been more memorable. Aroma has always been its strength, in my opinion. Not quite as present this time around.Still, judge for yourself and try this excellent beer."
"Hop bomb, this lives up to the hype. Glad I'm in California, makes it pretty easy to find it on tap or bottles."
From a bottle. Poured a clear but golden yellow with thin white head that quickly dissipated. Aromas of hops with pine. Taste strong hops with malt and sugar sweetness which cuts the bitterness. Smooth hop aftertaste with no bitter bite back. Light and carbonated in the mouth. Little chewy for an IPA but it is a DIPA. Big time hop bomb. Very balanced and smooth. Not sure it lived up to the hype though. .
What I like most about this beer is the smell. It smells like no other beer I have had. I feel like I am the forest. Than I take a nice long sip and my taste buds come alive. A very nice crisp taste. This is beer to me is one of the more drinkable beers I have had (it tastes so good I don't want to stop drinking them).
Appearance: Clear and gold with a smooth white head.
Def. a world class IPA
The standard for over hyped California beers. Not that it's bad. Just really boring.
Wow. Just wow. Meets all expectations.
"Acquired in trade with Zach. The highlight for me is the explosive hop aroma. Grapefruit, peach, pineapple, and tropical fruit. The taste is grapefruit, citrus with a pleasantly bitter hop aftertaste. Definitely a must try."
"Great but a little over hyped and priced. Great value at the brewery esp. on Sunday but quite pricey to bring home. I will try to find the Younger this year, but I have had a number of IPA's that hold up well to the Elder. I enjoyed it and will enjoy the last three bottles but not sure if the all of the hype is well founded. Living in Northern CA, great IPA's are not in short supply especially if you can go fill a growler."
Really nice and smooth imperial ipa. It has a nice subtle alcohol taste. Just the right amount of hops initially with a hoppier after taste. Smoother than idiot ipa and hoppy just like sculpin
Over rated. Not their best by far.
"Great IIPA. Deserves the hype. Less fruity with more bitterness/grass than Heady, but personally I prefer Blind Pig over this, and this over Heady."
A: little too clear for my taste golden orange very clear good white head and lacing. 
"Poured into a Stella Challice beer glass. Aesthetics are all there and the aroma of hops just blasts out of the glass. Beautiful in your face flavors of pine needles, mint, earth and spice. Not too bitter, just right. Well done! I have discovered the local delivery pattern and ritual so more to come."
"Great beer, glad I finally got to try it. I had it on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philly. One of the better beers I've had."
"Top shelf IPA , a must try"
The elusive and strange Pliny the Elder! Finally found this one. Got on trade. Thanks man! 
Best beer I've ever had. I could drink it all day.
Bomber to tulip. 
Aroma is like a pine tree. Very balanced and smooth.
"Thanks to dmsanchez for seeking this 15 day old bottle of Pliny to enjoy in Michigan. Creamy white head that lingers and floats on top of the golden liquid. Huge hop aroma and flavor of pine, orange and grapefruit citrus and stone fruit. Flavor follows nose. Exquisite balance. Crisp biscuity malts, finishes with just outstanding balance. Definitely one of the best IPA's I've had and totally lives up to the hype."
Pretty much the Heady Topper of the West Coast.
Tasty beer with an incredible pine smell
Great IPA. Balanced is the word.
When fresh this beer really can't be beat.
Good balance. Taste stays with you. Love the hoppiness. Like a wet hop but not as strong.
My favorite beer hands down
"Got this at the never failing to excite bierkoning in Amsterdam. I was extremely lucky to pick up the two last bottles from their fridge, only 2 hours after the posted the arrival on social media."
"What a fresh IPA should be, the Gold Standard"
"What to say about this that hasn't already been said. It's what West Coast IPAs are all about -- beautifully defined notes of citrus and even tropical fruit, without going into muddled fruit salad mode, perhaps because of the light floral/pine undercurrent. Just enough malt to balance out the hop onslaught. Refreshingly bitter. Absolute classic."
"Hoppy, but not as bitter as I expected. Wonderful beer"
Respect for The Elder.
just amazing... perfectly brewed
"It’s my smashingly good fortune to have a somewhat nefarious pipeline to this Elder concoction. Lacourt, my unwavering old sommelier was the first to acquire this grog on behalf of the estate; I’m assured at an utterly pedestrian price to boot! Of course, Monsieur Lacourt is accustomed to somewhat less modest orders of fine wines of sundry provenance, however my dear nephew Henry was visiting for a fortnight and much to my displeasure the poor boy imbibes not in wine or spirits, but solely that grain infusion of the tiresome hoards."
"My extremely good and awesome buddy Jon Passow, who as of a few months ago became the Manager of Barrel Room Operations at Anderson Valley Brewing Company, recently sent me this in a package from northern, CA. This is my third time having this beer, and this really is a holy grail of Double IPAs. Poured out of a 16 oz bottle into my tulip glass, this beer pours a very clear, surprisingly clear I'd say, light to medium golden color with steady streams of lots of little bubbles rising tot eh top of the glass. Has a nice white head about 1/3 of an inch thick when first poured that eventually settles to a solid 1/5 of an inch with good retention. Good lacing here too. Fresh aromas of grapefruit/citrus, earthy, floral, and piney hops all packed in here nicely. Followed by some other fruity notes, but the hops sure dominate. Flavor wise there is almost no caramel malty sweetness, this beer is certainly dominated by citrus/grapefruit, earth, floral, and piney hop flavors. This beer is not overly bitter though. Each different aforementioned aspect of the hop flavors stand out from each other while yet also somehow intertwining and blending together so elegantly. Truly a unique flavor profile that is just down damn right delicious! Has a medium to full bodied crisp, somewhat prickly, resiny, yet smooth and slightly frothy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is so easy and superb. You really just want to keep drinking the hell out of this and you wish that your glass was never ending. WOW!!! Drink this beer every chance you get and be kind and share it with people who you know will appreciate its exquisite awesomeness! An absolutely phenomenal beer!"
"This IPA is perfect. It's fruity, bitter, has a great nose, and aftertaste. Deserves the score it has on this website, I just wish I had more of it!"
"if I had one word to describe this beer it would be RARE. a great ipa for sure, but not that great. after a newbie search for ""the best ipa"" a store worker at whole foods here in HB suggested that if I ever found one of these get it. about six months later I finally found one at a liquor warehouse and the guy said only 1 per customer as they sell out in one day. I thought wow this is it I stumbled on the best ipa out there. Basically all the hype must be for its rarity, great color, more bitter than most especially in this price range but should be comparable to a sculpin or 90 minute."
"No need for long review, SOLID excellent beer!"
"Great beer, clean, beautiful color unbelievable taste. After waiting so long to get my hands on it was definitely impressed."
"I went into this thinking there is no way the beer could match what I was expecting. But, it did! Just from the aroma I could tell this was going to be an amazing brew. It is not the best beer I have ever had but it is definitely top of its class!"
Definitely the best dipa ive ever had. I usually cant stand dipas/ipas either. Not as bitter and way more balanced than any other ive had.
Had this a couple weeks ago - I have been trying to find it on the East Coast for several years now to no avail. Took a friend heading to SFO for a week to score me a bottle. I drank it probably 3 days after he handed it over so I followed the rules of Pliny!
Great IPA. Tastes very similar to Zombie Dust.
I have had this one several times now since my rating. Anywhere from 8 days to almost 5 weeks old. It seems to hold true each time. 
Simply Amazing. Best beer I have ever had.
"Enjoyed this beer tonight with great friends... lived up to expectations... awesome smell, great taste... cannot go wrong with this one."
Great beer nice balance and bright hop flavor but the things people to do to get it in my area is insane. Great beer but there's plenty of other just as good beers readily available to me on the shelf and at a better price (i've never paid for it but I know what some have)
"Pours a clear honey orange with light white head. Smells of citrus, pine, sweet malts, a little floral. Grassy pine, grapefruit, some barely flavor, sweet malts. Medium carbonation and body with a smooth mouth-feel. Nice moderate pine aftertaste. Excellent"
"My first experience was a shared bomber. This past weekend I got my own bottles. This could easily be called ""Piny"" the Elder as it is distinctly a piny IPA ... a very good piny, resinous IPA. I do think a lot of the hype of this beer stems from how difficult it is to procure, however, but it is a damn fine, smooth beer. Truly a treasure worth seeking."
"Finally got my hands on some fresh Pliny. Don't get me wrong, its damn good, but it is not perfect, and there are other beers out there I would prefer."
On tap at Hamilton's Tavern in a shaker pint (with great anticipation)
The citrus and hops are the perfect combination of tart and snap! Love this beer--its a fan favorite in my town..
"A solid beer. I was expecting angels to visit me when I opened the bottle from all the hype around this beer. Not the best double IPA I have ever tried but well worth getting your hands on. Bitter up front, lacking some aromatic flavor that the nose suggests it would have."
Worth the hype. Super complex flavors. Great on tap
Appearance: a yellow to golden color. Fairly good clarity but some slight haze to it. About an inch of frothy head.
About a month old due to trade.
"This beer is like giving a grapefruit permission to discharge in your mouth. I always tried to deny that I liked grapefruit, but this beer helped me come out of the closet. "
"Pours a beautiful golden color with a one finger white head. The nose is fantastic. Pine, lemon, floral, herbal, and a thin bread smell, like a cracker. The flavor is delicious. It's soft and delicate, yet extremely hoppy. This is a very dry beer, it doesn't have the sweetness that a lot of other DIPAs have nowadays. This is a very good, high quality, beer."
"Very glad to get my hands on this at Keller's Bouchon in Yountville, Napa Valley. By all means I should have been drinking wine.."
"I took me a while to be able to try this beer (I live in ohio). The bottle I got was born 10/21/14. It pours like a world class beer and from there out it is not a let down in any category. This is truly a great beer with a lot of flavor...But, thats not what is amazing about it!!...it's all about the feel of it. Smooth and balanced to perfection. That quality of this beer cant be overstated. "
This beer absolutely lives up to its hype!
"I have to start out by saying I'm not enumerated buy beers just cuz they are famous nor do I particularly like IPAs, however, I have to say that this is a world class beer delicious very well balanced beer. The hops aren't overwhelming although it has a huge ibu measure. Doesn't kill the taste buds. I absolutely loved drinking this beer both at the brewery and later at my home with friends. World class! Even for a non IPA guy."
"Piney, hoppy, citrusy. Classic west coast IPA. Excellent beer? Yes. Worth waiting 2 hours in line to try? No."
Worth the hype. LOVED this beer.
No words can really describe this brew.
Overrated at best.
"Great beer, but not sure if it really lived up to the hype."
no need to rate we all know what it offers . glad to have it at my command :)
"It took me a while to get my hands on this, once I did it was worth the wait. This is the ideal IPA. Very clean balanced taste. Not overly hoppy. The color is lighter than I expected, but that was no indication of something missing."
First time I've ever had this beer and it lived up to the hype. Crist and refreshing. Can't wait to have more.
"Dont get the hype, dont have a tongue for it maybe. "
"Opens with malt and herbal, citrusy fruity hops on the nose. Pours brilliant gold with a snow white finely bubbled foam cap that persists and leaves thick lace. A big malt backbone supports luscious hop flavors, especially melon, citrus and a dash of mint on the finish. A touch above medium body, medium carbonation. Very well balanced."
"Bottle from Lothore, thank you very much Tyler! "
First experience with this legend. Had on tap in Hollywood over the weekend and it matched the hype. A memorable experience indeed. Was much clearer than I had anticipated. Was expecting a hazy glow after drinking so many DIPAs with that profile. 
"Incredibly good, drink them fresh."
"Bottled on 10/10/14. Poured from the bottle in to a snifter on 10/26/14. I went in to it hoping for the best, but fearing disappointment due to the hype. Hype can really kill things for me. As it poured I was struck by the honey color. Beautiful. 1.5 finger white head. The aroma was very pineapple-y. I took my first sip, and was completely blown away. Each drink afterwards somehow got better and better. The taste was a balance between pineapple-y citrus and pine hops. The finish was exquisite. Pliny is perfectly balanced in every way. This was the best beer I have ever had and is likely to remain the best."
"Bottled 29 days ago, poured into a snifter glass. Smell is pine, citrus, lots of citrus. First sip is a grapefruit bomb. Continued sipping reveals well balanced DIPA. Glad I got to try it!"
"Golden honey in color with massive white head that leaves chunks of lace on every sip. Citrus consumes the nose with grapefruit, orange and tangerine. Great aroma but not as pronounced as expected. Taste is an amazing isolation of citrus hop flavor. Grapefruit, orange and tangerine in a wave of hop driven flavor with a perfect level of caramel sweetness to keep it in check. Not overly bitter which allows all that hop flavor to come through. Creamy burst in mouthfeel with a medium body that crisps up and finishes bone dry. A showcase of hop flavor, this is an amazing DIPA I'd love to try again."
"My top 3 IPA's is PTE, drove up from LA to Santa Rosa just for a case of it as well as some Blind Pig. Anytime its on tap I'm all in for it, even though I've had it numerous amounts of times, still does the job."
I need more!!!
Poured from the bottle purchased at Belmont Station in Portland into a snifter on 13 July 14.
"A-Pefect. Clear, but not crystal. Beautiful color tint of orange."
"A bit over rated in my opinion. Leaves a dry, stale after taste. Good beer but wondering why the 100 rating. I like a few others there they had over this one."
"Bottle from Full Throttle Bottles in 2012. Slightly cloudy, pale on pour. Modest amount of head, with small bubbles, white colored. Clear, pale gold, medium, creamy, white head. Strong floral and hops notes, with grapefruit and other citrus as well. Taste is an exemplary balance of sweetness with a long bitter finish but not overpowering. Really top notch balance. Medium body, alcohol tones, long, long finish, medium carbonation. Fantastic DIPA - the standard bearer."
Maybe the most well balanced DIPA.
Drank on draft at Barcade's (Philadelphia) 3rd Anniversary event.
Fresh and smooth.
One of the best beers I've ever had.
My all time favorite brew! I don't live in an area that sells Pliny so during a recent trip to San Diego I hunted down a bar that had it on tap. Because of all the Hype I was prepared to be disappointed but to my surprise it was amazing. Now I've just got to convince my wife that we need to retire in San Diego!
"As big as the anticipation was to try this, it exceeded all expectations. Fresh, I've had no other IPA that is as wonderfully balanced and flavorful as Pliny is. Perfect."
"Didn't know what to expect once I finally laid my hands on one. Hard to get here. Semi-boring bottle, not overly informational or catchy with a banal label."
"I had this a few years ago and loved it, but didn't review it. I will correct that today. The pour is a gorgeous rich golden color, nearly clear, with a nearly dark tan head. One of the most beautiful beers I've seen."
Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. I can't believe the moment is finally here. Pliny is right in front of me collecting condensation.
On tap so fresh
"There is a reason this beer has the reputation it does. Amazing DIPA. Smooth, Hoppy, Delicious."
Combined notes from on tap at Russian River Brewing Co and a bottle poured into a Russian River nonic pint glass
Taken from my Moleskine.
wow. Great taste great finish.
"A: Bright orange, clear, moderate lacing on the glass. So juicy it almost looks syrupy."
What could I possibly add to the Elder that hasn't been said before....nothing. However I will say that I really enjoy when out of state friends come to Cali to try the Napa area wines and I tell them to find the Elder. They end up talking more about that beer t hen any of the wines lol!
the perfect beer. Top to bottom!
Pours a light clear deep gold/ slight amber color. Nice white head with good lacing.
"Had this as an extra in a trade with GetMeAnIPA, Thank You! "
"One of the best ipa's around piney with hints of grapefruit great mouthfeel, full flavor not too high of an abv nice color the only beer that I have given a 5 to"
"Pour from tap at Stone Liberty Station (I mean, if they have it, it isn't a faux pas to order, right?). Sunny day in the bocce court revealed a gorgeous orangey-gold. Exactly the citrus, floral hop notes one hopes for in a DIPA. Pretty much the ideal hop character up front, immediate and sustained. A little alcohol on the finish with an appropriate stickiness to hold the hops until the next sip. Other reviewers with more refined palates can provide the specific hop profiles. Just get some if you can."
"From the bottle marked 071614. Sampled on September 19, 2014. Received in trade from a non-BA member."
Better than Younger in my opinion
"I have had Pliny about 6 or 7 times now. Each time it blows me away how smooth it is. While I am a fan of bitter IPAs, Pliny manages to pack a hop punch while being extremely drinkable. Whenever I find it on tap it's a must order."
had out of bottle and on tap at brewery. out of tap this might be the best dipa i have had. balanced great tasting and just damn good
"Poured fresh, only 3 weeks old."
Possibly the greatest IPA I have ever tasted.
"These too like Blind Pig is tough to get a hold of. Wholefoods gets a case once a week (sometimes) Here's a tip....you gotta call and ask for the ""specialty department"" on Wednesdays or Thursdays and see if they got it in stock. Best $5 you'll spend!"
This is everything you want an IPA to be.
"Had this awhile ago, got it through trade, Excellent IPA, unfortunately I forgot to take notes as I sipped, but rest assured if you like big, hoppy IPAs, you love Pliny"
"The only thing better than the bottle of Pliny I just split with the husband would be to have a glass on tap. Outstanding, bold and refreshing!"
About as stellar as they come. Beautifully balanced and alive.
"I can't recall having a more well balanced beer of any sort, and for a DIPA, this seems to be the Holy Grail that the most celebrated brewers in the world have given up on achieving. "
"I have been wanting this beer for years and finally got my hands on two fresh bottles. My first impressions of this beer surpassed my expectations. I have been let down by so many hyped beers (ipa's especially) like all of dogfish beers, Stone beers like Vertical epic, The abyss.....etc... This beer has upheld its long reputation. Most IPA's have to much weird citrus, earthy bitterness, or are to malty sweet, etc. Pliny has all the hop flavors I enjoy like sharp citrus, grapefruit, fruity, sticky resinous pine but all in a harmonious marriage of pale and copper malts. As IPAs get bigger and ""better"" I find that higher abv seems to equal sweeter. Pliny is a great balance of hops and malt, not overly sweet or overly hopped."
"Enjoyed, perhaps a touch too warm. Need to try again."
Delicious. 
Just a great beer! So well balanced and easy to drink. Wish RR could expand just for this beer. Funny how DIPAs are becoming just a regular drinking beer and all the IPAs are turning into session beers.
Really god
Pours straw golden in color with a foamy white head that retains nicely. Smell has huge juicy and piney hop aroma that is incredibly fresh and balanced by a sweet grainy malt aroma. Hops also dominate the taste with a equally piney and juicy citrus and fruity flavor. Hefty amount of bitterness is balanced perfectly with a big amount of sweet malt that comes off almost fruity as well. Medium bodied and super sticky lets you savor all the hops in this.
Respect your elders!!
wow just wow
From tulip glass
"Went to look for a certain pumpkin ale today and saw people walking out of the cooler with these! Pours a crystal clear amber with short head that leaves a bubbly slick as it dies down. Nose on this is out of control - super citric orange peel and tropical fruit mixed with a soft floral aroma. Taste is solid all the way through, you get a quick bite up front, some spice and citrus in the middle and a lingering resiny bitterness on the back end; this beer hits it all. The alcohol at 8% is barely noticeable, but does leave you with a nice warming sensation in the belly. Mouthfeel is medium with a delicate champagne like carbonation. Overall I think this is a great West Coast IIPA, but I prefer a little more malt balance, and I'd say FW Union Jack is comparable if you can't find this. I really never expected to see it anywhere so pretty stoked to have tried it!"
"Despite its 8% ABV Pliny remains super smooth with a malt balance and a strong hop presence that is oaky, grapefruit, and floral without a lingering bitterness."
Complex dipa with a nice caramelized malt finish
"Bottle from Evan. Thanks, bro!"
Comparable to a hoppier Stone Enjoy By imo.
"Big, hoppy, and delicious, I don't need to say anymore."
"I was prepared to be let down, but I was not. As good an IPA as you will find. Lighter and more balanced than most DIPAs. Crisp and piney, with enough citrus to keep it bright. It won't change your life, but it deserves the hype."
500ml Bottle.
8 oz. pour into tulip
"I honestly don't get the hype behind this beer. I just had it on tap, and it didn't do anything exciting for me. Yes, it's a great DIPA, but i could say that about a dozen others as well. I'd drink it again, but not at the premium price it usually demands."
"I have had this several times on draft and freshly bottled, I still don't know what the big fuss is all about"
Such a smooth finish for such a deliciously hoppy beer. Really rolls into the bottom of the tongue and top of the throat. Good in any circumstance.
"Bottle from the 8/6/14 batch, picked up at the brewery and enjoyed at home in a teku."
Serving type: bottle 7/20/14
Just not Heady
"From a tap at Teresa's in Wayne, PA."
"Second verse, same as the first. Exceptional in everyday. Desert island beer status."
"There is nothing I can say that hasn't been articulated. So balanced. Like being in a piney dream. It will always have a special place in my heart. Light amber color, great lacing, great malt balance, tropical notes resonate throughout with a great pine smell and resinous taste, but not sticky and not overly dank. I am already craving my next experience."
"Poured from fridge temp to tulip. Should note that this was bottled about 3 weeks ago. Pours golden brown with good carbonation. Nose is pine, orange peel, tree sap, hops, funk. Taste is amazing. Smooth - not overpowering hops. Follows the nose. Perfect balance of fruit peel, hops, and pine needles. Lovely, with great mouthfeel."
What can you say? It's Pliny the Elder.
"Great beer. The smell alone is outstanding but the entire beer is delicious. If you have the opportunity, drop by the brewery and get a growler filled."
Crisp and fresh. Best DBL IPA. Hands down.
"Great beer, worth the trip to CA."
A perfectly balanced IPA and a near perfect beer . Russian River set the bar pretty damn high with this one. Outstanding!
Exeptional
A: Golden with white foamy head.
"Slightly hazy, vibrant orange, and a creamy white head with pretty great retention for the style."
"I have to say that even though this is clearly a really good beer, it's not without equal. In fact, I would argue that these days it has many equals. The strong bitterness of the hop profile is a little harsh and detracts ever-so-slightly from appreciating the nuances encompassed within the rest of the experience on the palate. The huge pine notes intermingled with citrus and hints of grass and tropical fruit are wonderful when detectable, though. Also, the malt profile does the beer no favors. The slight sourdough notes and marginally excessive maltiness again detract a little from the overall experience. Frankly, my favorite part of the Pliny experience is the aroma, which is amazing and unimpeachable. I know I'm splitting hairs and will gladly acknowledge that this beer is fantastic, but I just don't think it's worth the hype."
"A classic DIPA, that is well known but has been surpassed by others. I have had Pliny from 5 days old to a few weeks, and it is always good but not great. It is darker in color than most due to the malt bill. It tastes strong and malty to me."
"Have this six times in bottles, twice fresh on draught at Toronado on two separate trips, and once more at Hamilton's."
510 mL bottle in to a Duvel tulip. Bottled on 7/16/14- it doesn't get a whole lot fresher than that for a New Yorker! Thanks a bunch JDubbelStout!
Look: see through golden liquid with a loose white head
"Had to adjust my rating up to a 5 just drank a fresh Pliny for the first time, only thing better would be on tap."
"Perhaps all the hype surrounding this one has tainted my opinion, but I've never been one to just follow the crowd. If it didn't taste good I'm not going to pretend it did just because of the name wrapped around the bottle. With that being said, I was a little disappointed. I have another one in the fridge, so after a second taste another review is definitely in order."
"After several months of searching, I finally found the mythical Pliny the Elder that I was starting to doubt even existed. Pangaea Bier Cafe in Sacramento has it on tap. "
"A - A little light for an IPA, but looked very clear and very nice. Great amber color."
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. First time with this beer and I'm really stoked. Expectations can't possibly be met.
"A: Poured a very nice orange-amber. Very pure looking, almost translucent."
"Pours from the bottle a light amber color with a good amount of creamy head. A lot of people mention the pineapple nose and it's vibrant with also a heavy amount of grassy/piney aspects. The balance on this DIPA is spectacular. Great malt backbone with a bitter hop bite that keeps you coming back for more. The alcohol is well hidden, making this one of the more drinkable DIPAs out there. Heady Topper or Pliney, that's a tough choice!"
Perfect blend of citrus and tropical fruits. Pineapple really stands out with orange/tangerine and some pepper. The crispness and cleanliness is what sets it apart from others. Probably the best beer I've ever had.
"The beer pours lighter than expected with a white, fluffy head that quickly gives way to the army of bubbles marching to the top of the glass. A big, fruity nose, expected from one of the world's best IPAs, is no less welcome without the surprise. Bright grapefruit, pine, and lemon notes dance up from the glass. Even the bottle cap smells like delicious hops"
"Its become trendy now to start hating on Pliny (well, not hating perhaps, but talking about how its so overrated)."
On tap at the RR Brewpub in Santa Rosa. 
"IPA and DIPA's are not my go to style but I appreciate and seek out the highest rated brews, obviously Pliny falls I'm this category."
A: 4.5 Really nice color. Amber copper with a one inch white head that lasts about a minute.
I've been drinking this for a while and never reviewed it because I was honestly annoyed by all the hype. Here in South CA we can only buy one bottle at a time and when its on tap there a bunch of people waiting for it. 
"Lighter in color (almost lager-esque) than most ales, particularly IPAs; refreshing, floral aroma; VERY drinkable for an IPA, smooth, bitter notes appearing later; slightly more carbonated feel."
Great Double IPA... it's hype is well earned.. only wish i had a steady supply of them. haha. I had this on my trip to the brewery while visiting San Fran.. was worth the trip up there to santa rosa.. the flight at the brewery is insane 16+ beers.. they make a lot of good stuff.. hope to get back there soon.. highly recommend trying this beer if you can get a trade for it or get up there yourself to visit.
Bottle poured into Nordic pint glass
Few doubles reach this level of awesomeness.
Poured from a bottle into a 16 oz. snifter.
"A: brilliant clarity, dense white head, light copper, almost gold color. "
"Acquired in a trade for Alchemist brews. Poured a clear honey/amber with a thin but attractive head. Lacing was nearly artistic. A fresh and lightly citrus scent. Lemon, orange, and pine taste, but all subtle. This beer feels light and drinkable for 8% ABV. Perfect bitterness, and possibly the best balanced brew I have experienced. My wife, who generally hates double IPAs actually enjoyed this. Truly an awesome beer, lacking only the wow factor to make it my #1."
This beer is outstanding. 
"Poured from bottle into RR bubble pint. Right off, this is a great looking beer. Crystal clear, nice 2 fingers of head that stick around and sticks to the glass as you sip. The nose sells this beer for me. Pine and citrus, especially grapefruit. Taste follows nose for me. Big hops, but in a very well balanced format. Not the hoppiest DIPA in the world, but it might be the most balanced and well done. Love this beer and I am not disappointed after hearing a lot of good stuff about it."
Popped open a bottle and poured into a chilled stein ... Big shout out to Neil at Red Carpet in Rancho Cucamonga for providing a bottle out of his personal stash!
"A - Clear golden in color with a thick, two finger white head that dissipates quickly."
"A - Golden, light haze, an inch of froth"
"Smell's the winner here, right after exceptional taste. Pliny the Elder knows your name, wants to hang out, and makes an afternoon simply swell."
Appearance: a yellow to dull golden color. Fairly good clarity but some slight haze to it. A finger of a frothy head that hardly fades at all and leaves a huge lacing on the sides. A damn good looking dipa
"This one is harder for me to acquire now that Russian River no longer distributes to Washington state. I'm not really sure what else I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said many many times over. It is a near perfect example of a west coast style double ipa. It has a huge nose of citrus, dank, and tropical fruit. Excellent bitterness level and hop flavor that matches what is expected based on the aroma. It has a low amount of body and a fairly dry finish as I believe all west coast ipas should have. The first time I tried this beer was after a day of hiking in the north cascades and it changed my life and my outlook on what an IPA should taste like. Cheers to Vinnie and the RR crew on this beer!"
Opened a bottle yesterday that was dated 01/14. Still good stuff.
"On tap at Monk's Cafe, poured into pint glass."
"My buddy brought me back a variety of Russian River stuff from Colorado. The Pliny was by far my favorite. One of the smoothest IPAs I've ever tried. Taste was sweet and buttery, could drink this regularly if it was in Texas. If you love beer and are scared of IPA s this will spoil you. Loved it til the last drop!"
"Crisp and perfectly golden, looks like a shitty domestic honestly."
"Had it on tap at the Station Tap Room in Downingtown,PA. It was amazing! All of the RR beers I have tried blow me away! Too many beers of this style fall short of the quality and balance. "
Golden copper color with a good paying film. Smells like a tropical fruit explosion. Tate isn't as explosive as the smell but it's still good. Has a good hop malt balance with that tropical fruit taste. Medium body with light carbonation. Fantastic beer! Reminds me of zombie dust but more hoppy.
"Was lucky enough to have a friend who traded for this and came over with a bottle. Right off the bat I was already seeing how it would compare to Heady so it was a little unfair. That being said it is still a fantastic beer. Strong hop notes, perfect color. "
"Bottled on 051414, fairly fresh, 10 days mark."
Poured from bottle into a tulip.
"Had this recently on tap at Monks in philly. The server came back with it in a 16 ounce pint glass which surprised me. Smell was very piney, did not get a lot of citrus notes. Taste was very earthy and piny with a nice hop bite and quite delicious and easily quaffable. Alcohol content is completely hidden and could easily drink more of these than I should"
Updates:
"Love this beer! With its fantastic west coast hoppy, estery tad sweet flavor of an imperial IPA from that region which is and can be mind-numbingly delicious. Always a faithful standby whenever on tap in the places frequented when I lived in Philly. Now that I live in TX, I truly miss RR."
While my expectations were so high that I think they were impossible to live put too. This was a great ipa. Just about perfect combination of hops to flavor the beer. Not to overpowering bitterness and a good malt backing makes pliny stand out even to a guy who mainly drinks stouts.
"I tried this one back when I wasn't a big fan of IPA's. My brother flew a couple bottles back from a trip to California. Poured it from the bottle into tulip glasses. Poured hazy with a 1 finger head (probably poured too gently on my part out of respect). Pine and grapefruit aromas with a moderately strong piney bitterness through the sip. I appreciated it at the time as a great indication of the style, and I hope to try it again soon, now that I really enjoy IPA's."
"Overall respect for the beer and it's maker. Im always comparing all the ipa's to Pliney. The smell is subtle balanced grapefruit. Its probably a West Coast thing but I take pride of what this beer has accomplished, so it's worth it. Blind pig, supplication, consecration are my favorites from Russian river. I just wish I was alot closer. Cheers!"
Bottle to tulip!
A: Golden yellow/orange
Had it on tap in Colorado. So impressed. I wanted to freeze it and skate on it. And then in the summer melt it and drink it some more. Can't wait to try the younger. RR brewing has got there heads in the right place. Please if any one sees this hook my up with a trade. I'm dying out here. Oklahoma has some decent brews let me know.
"The Mrs. and I were in Napa last weekend for a wedding and some wine tasting. But after all of the hype surrounding Russian River Brewing, we had to make a pit stop. We walked in on a Sunday night and while was there a 45 minute wait for a table, it was happy hour all day. That means $3.50 for 16oz of Pliny. Yes and please. "
A- gold hue with white head and good lacing.
"You say citrus, I say CACTUS."
"Not gonna give details here, just my opinion it's great, but hill farmstead double Citra, and heady topper are by far better. I would never turn.down a Pliny but after you have heady or Pliny you don't really look to aquire it as much. But. It deserves it's spot and is a great brew!"
The hype is for real . . . If the bottle is fresh. This a great example of an American ipa. Pliny at a glance doesn't appear to be anything exceptional. After a whiff the nose doesn't give the impression of world class but it does point in the direction of a solid crafted beer. The taste and feel though is what elevates this beer to world class in my opinion. The mingling of floral and tropical flavors that give way to pine is impressive. Overall it's the mouth feel that leaves me wanting more. Probably the best beer I've had in the feel department.
4/9/14 bottled date.
Pliney the Elder is my top IPA.
Serving: bottle poured into a pint glass.
A gift from Mark Rodda (and his friend). Bottled 2/19/14. I consumed immediately upon receipt. Poured into a chalice.
The best beer i have ever had so far. Poured into my Stella Artois glass. Pale Golden color with a little bit of head. Smells of the hops are not too strong and the taste of the hops are the perfect amount with the perfect amount of bitterness for a perfect beer. I long desired this beer and now i have finally have tried it. It went down smooth as well
I have been wanting to try Heady's west coast brother for a while now and I was absolutely not letdown.
"Poured very smooth, smelled awesome,tasted even better can't wait to get my hands on more Pliny."
Bottled 11 days ago.
"This is a special one. Honey color, white foamy head with moderate lacing, rich citrus and tropical fruit smells hit you right away, sweet taste up front with a red grapefruit-y bitter finish. It’s bitter but balanced, sweet but smooth, complex but super drinkable. This is the gold standard my friends. Only to be enjoyed in the presence of a globe and leather-bound book. "
"Appearance: Darker than expected. Somewhere between amber and golden and extremely foamy, creamy head; beautiful appearance."
"Snagged one of the last few at my neighborhood market. After quaffing this several times in the past month, I'm finally sitting down and giving this brew the review it deserves."
Major thanks to Tammisbutler for the opportunity to sample this one.
"Not going to lie...friends of mine hyped this beer up to be the second coming...I expected perfection. Although it was a VERY good beer, not worth the hype. I'd put a Deschutes Fresh Squeezed or a Stone Enjoy By up against PtE any day of the week. Would definitely buy this again but won't be so anxious for it to become available as I was the first time."
"Simply put, Pliny didn't meet the hype for me. I had it on a wonderful trip to SF at Toronado (great beer bar, btw), and just didn't love it. Give me a Fatheads HeadHunter over this any day of the week, please and thank you."
"I frequent total wine on Tuesdays and Thursdays to find this beer. In the past couple of months I managed to come home with more that a few. Including other russion river beers. The worst part is having to drink it, because then you don't have any left! At a 1 bottle limit I manged to have one of these babies every week for the past 5 weeks! I love it! Arguably the best!"
"Quite possibly the best beer I have ever tried and just stating that from the hype. Always try to get my hands on a bottle for special occasions: birthday, graduations, and holidays. I recommend this to everyone I know. Opened a few weeks old bottle and poured into a tulip and saw a great 1.5 finger head form with great retention. Giving it a nice whiff you get a great scent for pine and other citrus notes. I had high expectations about this beer and after tasting it I can honestly say that they were meet. Not bitter at all very smooth and goes down at a relatively quick rate which can be a problem since its about 8%. I think the best part of this beer is that the more you drink it the more you enjoy it. It is consistently good and stays at the top of my top beers. I can't find myself to get tired of this beer and once you taste it you will see why."
Bottle poured into snifter.
"This is one fantastic IPA. After searching the entire West Coast for over a month, I found one."
Preface: I've been around the world tasting beer and wine. I've had nearly every beer on the Beer Advocate top 250. I appreciate all styles but have a preference for Double IPAs. 
Finally reviewing after having countless bottles over the years. Bottled on 4/9/14
"Finally was able to trade for a few bottles and I had extremely high hopes for PtE. After pouring into the glass, beautiful golden orange brew sat in front of me. A frothy white head sat atop the beautiful liquid. Some lacing was left as the head quickly dissipated. The nose and the taste are typical of west coast IPAs. Citrusy fruit flavors swirl around the mouth. It goes down smooth and it is not overly bitter. Very flavorful and very smooth. Very pleased with this, but would still prefer Heady over this great one."
"Pliny is the finest beer I've ever tasted. For a 2X IPA it's as crisp and refreshing as it gets... for ANY beer. Some people say it's overhyped, which I don't agree with, but it depends on what type of beer you like. If you're an IPA fan and you think this beer is overhyped then I don't sympathize. But if IPA's aren't your thing then I can see how you might not appreciate it as much as someone like me who drinks almost exclusively IPA's. It is so perfectly balanced and smooth. Hoppy, citrusy, fresh, and perfect all come to mind every time I have a Pliny."
I am lucky enough to have enjoyed Pliny countless times both in the bottle and on draught. First time was several years ago and every time I get a glass of it I take 2-3 whiffs of it before even taking a sip. That's how good this beer is. If you haven't tried it beg borrow or steal to try this one!
"Wow!!! Finally got a bottle of this coveted ale and it definitely lives up to the hype. The pour is one of the sexiest golden copper colors I have ever seen. The head is thick, bone white, frothy and long lasting. Plus there is silky lacing for days. The nose is dank and citrusy. An abundance of grapefruit, pine, grass, mango, and tangerines abound. The mouthfeel is great but I'd actually like it to be a bit stickier. The flavor is a balanced bomb of west coast hops; taking all the notes of the nose and making them shine even more. This is mist certainly one of (if not the) best dipa I've ever had. Just wish it'd show its face in Michigan more often."
Appearance - pours golden amber with a nice frothy two finger head. Mild carbonation. Head disapates slow with a great lace on the glass
"Aroma: Citrus peel, pine, and dank. Sweet malt aroma is there in the background. "
Pours a clear bright golden color with a two finger white head. Beautiful looking beer.
Poured from the standard 500 ml bottle(2 weeks old) into a tulip glass.
"I was at Russian River Brewery last week, and there isn't much to say about this beer except it is exceptional. I grew up in Escondido, California, and saw Stone grow from a roll up garage to a big, pleasant machine. Enjoy By is good, but I think Pliny the Elder is a tad better. It may be because I drink Enjoy By often, or it might be because the Pliny was fresh. These two beers are comparable, I love both of them. That is why I brought some home to Washington."
"I have to say, being in the land of plentiful West Coast IPA's, this really is the king of the land. I just can't say anything more about Pliny that hasn't already been said. It's perfect from start to finish, and when it's gone, I'm sad. Believe the hype."
thanx to my new trading partner robb for this one!
"Since beginning to drink craft beer in 2009 this beer has been on my wishlist. After moving to Denver, I have had this beer a couple of times. A first I wanted to purely take it in, but the time has come to give it a rating."
"Very basic and uninspiring offering. Huge dissapointment. Taste is of a traditional west coast IPA, which is fine, but its a very unimaginative attempt at the style. Have had this fresh twice, felt the same way both times. Heady Topper is vastly better, as are most quality west coast ipas coming out right now."
Poured from 500ml bottle into a stemmed tulip glass (about 4 weeks old).
"Bottle poured into tulip, raises 2 fingers of sticky white head. Dissipates slowly and laces nicely. Color is perfect, beautiful shade of orange."
"Received a bottle in a trade, dated: 3-13-14. "
"General: This was directly from the brewery, the brewed date is 1/21/14. Poured this into my bottle logic lab glass for the tasting. "
"Light amber hued with some serious haziness. I see microscopic sediment suspended within it. A minuscule layer of white foam partially covers the top. Serious Brussels lacing. Intense floral hop aroma beckons me to taste. The flavor is a nice balanced floral hop assault. It really lasts throughout the palate from front to the back and throughout the fade. The body is moderately carbonated, yet smooth and refreshing."
"This is the perfect DIPA! I usually don't like the abrasive bitterness of regular IPA's but this one, when fresh, has the perfect balance!"
Bought at a liquor store and drank 10 days after the bottling date. 
Since this one is so tough to find I actually had to drive up to the brewery to try it. This is a very good beer but certainly over-hyped. Very nice aroma with definite apricot overtones. It looks and smells great but tastewise it matches up to some other great beers including Belgian macro-brews. One plus is it also tastes good a few days later from a growler.
"I have been into IPA for a while, but the Russian River Pliny the Elder is by far the PERFECT beer that I have tasted. It is perfection bar none. I have only had four bottles of them but they are worth all the hype around them. "
Bottled: 11/13/13 
This beer was bottled on 3-10-14 and consumed on 3-18-14 cannot get much fresher then that really...
"A: Pours a very nice copper color with a large two finger white head, good retention and lacing."
"I've heard it's better in bottle, but I wasn't impressed with the draft version. good aroma and color. Taste was kind of a hop smack without much character or balance. Good mouthfeel. Way overrated, unlike the younger, which is really well balanced."
Thanks to my California trade connection(Jesse) for this one!
"This beer is pure perfection in a Double IPA, the hops burst out in a perfect symphony of flavor leaving wants and needs for more on my tongue! A warm finish sets nicely in my beer belly and a desire to down endless glasses of this is set in motion! I reccomend this over any and all double's!"
Bottled: 3-10-14
Date: 4/20/14
"Can never have enough Pliny! This is one of the best bank for your buck beers out there. Great dry hop smell and flavor and that not overly bitter. Smooth dipa that you can drink again, and again, and again...."
This is know my favorite beer of all time. I just found out that this was made by accident? This beer is better than the younger but not by much. Well worth the hype. I have not tried this in bottles but the draft is second to none. Phily is the Only place outside of the west coast to get it.
Another beer I never expected to be able to try at least until the next trip to visit relatives in California. That I can do so now is thanks to the seemingly unbounded generosity of BigStein88.
Absolutely the perfect beer. 
Bottle served in a Spiegelau IPA glass.
"A - Pours a nice golden body. Amber hues, light orange. 3 finger head, dissipates very nicely."
American double / Imperial IPA 
"Amazing hop flavor,nice and clean and crisp. A friend of mine makes a Pliny clone home brew and it's spot on. Love this beer. Just wish I could get it more often. Haven't had the younger yet, but I've always been asking for it. Reminds me a lot of Heady Topper."
"On tap at Russian River in Santa Rosa, Ca"
Bottle poured into a tulip. Bottled 2/6 enjoyed on 3/4
"Poured a 510 ml bottle into a Sam Adams custom (wish I had a craft IPA glass for this). I let it warm for about 45 mins before I poured it, too."
The honorable Pliny the Elder!
"Received a bottle in the mail from a good friend out in California. Having tasted Heady and knowing of the greatness of Pliny, I HAD TO HAVE IT!! Poured into a Tulip. Beautiful clear golden color with about a 1/4 head as compared to a more cloudy golden color of Heady. Smelled of amazing floral hoppyness. As far as a mouthfeel I felt it was a little thinner than Heady. VERY similar in taste to but with a little different finish at the end of a sip than Heady. All in All this beer is amazing and delicious. And left me wanting more and wanting to move to California for the rest of Russian River's lineup. Great stuff and I see why Heady and Pliny get so many comparisons. "
The Elder. This is a great beer from Russian River. I like the hop notes in the smell and the nice bold finish. When trying this beer with a group a newer beer drinkers (21year olds) I was told it was the best beer they had ever had. They don't have a lot of time with craft beers but I like to think they will keep trying more of them after a taste of this little number.
Thanks for Sebowksi for the trade. Had Pliny a few times before. Very fresh bottle. 2/14/14 This will be my first 5.
The best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best
"Don't get me wrong, it's a superb beer...I just don't think it's worth the hype it receives, which I believe is due in large part to it's limited releases. I personally think Stone Enjoy By is an all around better crafted double."
"Draught @ Monk’s: My first impression was ""what is all the fuss about?"" So I asked our waitress if I had gotten the correct beer. She brought me another. As soon as I saw it we realized the first one was the wrong beer. They have Damnation on tap as well and mistakenly given me one of those. The Elder pours a darker golden color with about a finger of off white foam. It didn’t linger long but did leave a little lacing. The nose was huge! Lots of grapefruit and pine notes. Hard to smell the malts, but can faintly pick some up. The taste is excellent! Hops are not overpowering. Big malt body. Extremely well balanced. An extremely good beer."
Thanks to Jake_ramrod for the share. He's the man.
On tap at monks cafe over the weekend. What else is there to say about Pliny thAt hasn't been 100 times. Terrific double IPA and the most balanced beer for its style I've ever had. 
"Bottled on February 6th, 2014, drank on February 19th, 2014."
"Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is I need wiggle room for something I might taste down the road. But this lived up to its reputation. Double IPA that somehow manages to remain almost ""light"" in a perfectly balanced way. Hops were more floral than bitter. Amazing."
"The perfect Imperial IPA. (In my opinion). The limited availability, even for Southern California, makes it more of a scavenger hunt to find it. The aroma is a dank, hoppyness that can't be beat. The taste is amazingly mouthwatering, getting better as you go. Mouth feel is a bit dry, but that's what I look for out of my beers. 5 across the board for this legend of west coast IPA's. Pay your respects to the originator."
Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass. (bottled 1/31/14)
Bottled1/31/14 drank 2/19/14
Bottle dated 2/6/14; 2 weeks old. 
It's taken me about 5 tries of this beer to truly appreciate it.. When I first tried it I loved IPAs but had a much less developed palette. I've now had it both on draft and in the bottle and this bottle (bottled about 6 weeks ago) is the most I've enjoyed it by quite a bit.
You had this beer. 
"Presentation: green 510 ml bottle, poured into a Sierra Nevada tulip pint glass."
"Appearance- dark gold, almost copper w/near perfect lacing and great retention."
Drinking side by side with pliny the younger at russian river brewery. So review will be stilted by the direct comparison.
"Bottle was less than 5 days old, and the freshness was very apparent. Clarity when pouring was the first noticeable thing. Very similar to Firestone Walker Union Jack in that term. Gorgeous color in the tangerine spectrum of orange. A fluffy head that stayed for a really nice amount of time. The greatest part of the beer was the aroma- and that is not short changing the taste- but the smell of this beer is just so wonderfully clean and complex. And that translated into the taste. Amazing how the malt characters come through so distinctly at the front with the amount of hops within this gem. "
You had this beer. 
I sought this beer after reading reviews here is my overall impression: 
Poured 510ml bottle dated 1/17/14 into New Belgium globe
3 week old bottle poured into a nonic glass. My 1st beer of the evening.
"On tap at Hopyard in Pleasanton, CA"
"My impressions of this beer were all good. I found this to be very dry, but not overly astringent. The hop aroma was strong and citrusy, with a light malt note to back that up. The flavor really matched the aroma well with no huge surprises. The dry finish and lack of alcohol warming makes this beer deceptively smooth and easy to drink, perhaps the most dangerous of the ones I tried. Folks not prepared for this alcohol content could put down a few of these before realizing just how strong they are! I have tried the bigger brawnier brother (Pliny the Younger) and that one takes it to the next level--more in line with a lot of the recent additions to the pantheon."
Excellent. Best IPA out there.
The color is clear and light gold. It actually is really light in color.
Bottling date of 010614 and acquired at Coaltrain Wine and Spirits in Colorado Springs.
a: clear golden amber with some faint faint purple. 2 finger solid marshmellow white head
Appearance. poured from the bottle into two pint glasses. With only two bottles I had to share. A thick tan head subsided to reveal perfect lasing 
"An amazing IPA. Great nose on this beer. Lots of citrus fruit. The mouth feel is good and I like the ABV at where it is at 8%. I think any higher and you would be able to taste the booze in the beer. I don't think it is as high as quality as Heady Topper or some of the Three Floyd's beer that has been out there, but still a amazing beer."
Bottled 1-6-14. Poured into a tulip glass on 1-26-14.
"Bottled on 1/10/14, so I think this counts as fresh. Poured from 16oz. bottle into a tulip glass. "
"Bottled on 01/10/14, opened 01/14/14"
Finally reviewing this one. Bottle is 10 days old.
Pours clear straw-gold with thick white cap. Moderately effervescent. 
"I've sampled this beer many, many times; always very, very fresh and under optimal conditions. To start with, Pliny looks nearly as good as you could imagine in the glass. The nose is citrusy and inviting, but too tame and subtle for me. Taste follows the nose. Mouthfeel is very nice; medium-bodied and extremely smooth. Pliny is very balanced and an overall excellent beer; however, there are several IPAs I would recommend over Pliny, that are much easier to find. Good beer but don't jump through hoops to get it, and don't swallow all the hype."
A: Nice light copper color
"An absolutely wonderful DIPA, the demand on this beer is high. So its always a little challenging to snag this beer in a bottle, but our local craft bar has this on tap every month or so. The taste is a well balanced combination of grapefruit,oranges and lime. The smell is a piney aroma tossed in with a wonderful burst of hops. A very refreshing beer that is not too high in abv but suitable for the DIPA lover."
Poured aggressively from a 6 day old bottle directly into a sniffer.
"Poured from tap into a Russian River pint glass at Monk's Cafe in Philly. Beautiful, inch-thick, white head. Lots of tiny bubbles. On the nose, this is the definition of what great DIPAs should smell like -- textbook piney grapefruit. Great lacing & retention. On the palate, strong pine and grapefruit/citrus florals with huge hops balance well with smooth malts. Maintains head & lacing throughout. Moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and thick. Overall, a memorable experience, even if the hype was bigger than reality will allow. I drank three over the course of lunch, and could have kept going. Will definitely (hopefully) reach for this again some day."
This is a world class beer. The pour was crystal clear with beautiful orange honey and amber tone. The head is thick on the pour and lacing near perfect throughout. Wow the smell of this beer is a balanced sweet honey pine with citrus and slight floral fruit peach notes. The bitterness and hop is there but again balanced and not overpowering. The taste hits every note from the smell and is long and yum(couldn't think of better word there). The mouthfeel is light but rich and all the taste permeates. Overall this beer is one of my most memorable. The taste and smell is one that is stuck in my head and I will be craving this beer a while to come.
On Tap at Monks Cafe
"I've often thought Sculpin and PtE are of similar quality. And they are, to be sure. But side-by-side comparisons are always very telling. Keeping in mind that there's no such thing as a great beer, only a great bottle, my experience last night could certainly be a particularly great bottle of PtE and a less-than-great bottle (which was actually a can) of Sculpin, but there was no comparison on this particular evening. The Pliny was simply far and away superior. It is incredibly rich, despite its high bitterness and hop character. Floral, fruit and sweetness combine to make this a compelling drink on its own, and compared to other world class beers (we also opened a Belching Beaver Dammed DIPA and a Port Brewing High Tide) this was simply better, at least for my palate. The bitterness was balanced nicely by the richness, but (unlike the BB) there was no overt malt characteristic."
Bottled: 12/12/13
"A: Light orangish, yellowish, with a white head."
Big thanks to Orthodoxkardia for this one.
"I had three of these over Christmas, thank you Ben in Denver!!!"
"I was able to find this gem a few months ago and it lived up to the hype. When i saw it on the shelf I thought i was dreaming. There was a two bottle limit so i bought two, went to my car changed jackets and bought two more."
Initial smell was very aeromatic with many citrusy flavors behind it. 
Side by side tasting with Lagunitas Sucks:
Poured from a 3 week old bottle into a pint glass
"Without a doubt all the beer snobs are much more versed than I. Everyone says this beer is way over rated... I don't know; every time i pop a cap off a bottle I enjoy the shit out of it. its such a good beer! Screw anyone that says different...without a question its a top ten IPA! others in my top ten with no order: Heady, Sculpin, Knuckle sandwich, Hop Venom...Cheers"
Big thanks to drbenzo for this one!
"The top three beers on beer advocate are all some variety of an IPA. Although I like a good IPA as much as the next guy, I wonder how much of this is just hype that builds on itself as more and more people review these particular beers. A few months ago I was privileged enough to try Heady Topper. Although it was very good, I couldn't possibly rate it as high as most people do. I feel the same way about Pliny the Elder. "
"Okay. I was so psyched to try Pliny the Elder I was like a kid on Christmas morning. I was on vacation and went to the Horse Brass Pub, which is freaking amazing, and promptly ordered a pint. It is a really, really good beer but I think the hype and wait got to me. I wasn't blown away but I think that may be my fault. It is super hoppy, not much malt just the way I like my IPA's. I think my expectations were just unreasonably. I have tried it since and I think it is one of the top 5 IPA's I have ever had."
"A- nice bright golden color, half finger of white head"
"The beer pours an oranging yellow with amber highlights, kind of like a sunrise… The beer forms a big, pillowy head of rocky white bubbles that are slightly off-white. The head lasts nicely, but does mellow down from its initial height to about a half-finger’s width. As the head dissipates, it leaves a nice sticky patchwork of lacing on the glass. In body the beer is crystal clear and clean, but does present a slight haze from the malt. On the nose, the beer smells of citrus and spicy pine. Floral and herbal notes dance around the edges of the nose but big citrus tangerine and grapefruit are the primary players in the beer. The nose is not blowing me away, but is just a very solid example of a hoppy beer dank pine and a touch of sweet caramel can also be sensed in the smell. As a whole, the smell tends to remind a little of a fresh pineapple blended with pine. On the tongue, the beer tastes surprisingly balanced. The bitters are big and coat the mouth, but there is a strong bready sweetness to add balance. Light stone fruit notes can be picked out in the hop character, as well. The finish sees the strongest bitter kick, which is a bit over powering and should feed any one’s bitter cravings. Acidity in the beer is light but bright on the sides of the cheeks. Again, this beer tastes like a classic DIPA. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet, candied citrus, expanding into fresh Florida oranges, with a touch of orange peel and rind. Grapefruit, pine needles, and pineapple dance in the back along with the malts superbly balanced sweet caramel bread, which helps to give the hops their candied quality. I wasn’t that taken with this beer on the initial sip, but that was foolish of me. Pliny is a subtle beast, building simple complexity from its hops, and making each sip different. Soft boozy heat can be felt in the back of the throat, but that is just another part of the complexity of this beer. This flavor is one I could sip all night. In the mouth, Pliny feels surprisingly on the light side of medium in body, with a fluffy carbonation that pillows the tongue nicely. Mouthfeel is slick, and crisp, making the beer dangerously easy to drink. Slight astringency can be felt as the beer moves across the tongue leaving the mouth only softly tingling with bitters. Saliva does gently pool in the cheeks, but overall the mouth is left rather clean and ready for further sips. Overall, this beer is a whale worthy of whaling after. Beautiful complexity and subtly make this a beer I could drink several of, which is dangerous for its ABV bracket. Where many of the modern DIPA’s slam you in the face with juicy hop character, Pliny is subtle and perfectly balanced. This will please the hop heads and even those that are skeptical to hops. My mother, a diehard stout fan, but “pale and hoppy beer” hater, actually loved this when I brought one over last night. My only complaint is that the nose is mild compared to some DIPA’s, but to be fair to Pliny, its recipe was developed before the designers of those other DIPA’s even knew they liked hops. Pliny the Elder is a pleasure to drink. I can’t wait to get my hands on more Russian River beers."
"Bottle. Pours liquid gold with light head. Aroma is citrus and pine, some tropical fruit. Taste is tart apple, bright hop, resin. So well balanced (did that need to be said?). Short, clean finish. This is an amazing beer. Need to try the Younger for comparison."
Full of pine and tropical fruits this beer captures the essence of what a American west coast DIPA is all about! One of my favorites! 
"Not much more to say than what's already been said; this is legit. Balanced is the best word to describe; everything - appearance, smell, taste, etc - was just 'right'. "
"Have had it several times, but it's my first review of it. Poured out of a bottle into Russian river pint glass. Nice frothy looking head but thinned out fairly quick. Aroma is citrusy, grapefruit, very juicy, has some pine too. Tastes like the nose. very smooth and well balanced with the malt. Dont taste any of the alcohol. Overall, I think this is a fantastic DIPA, one of the first and best of its kind. Though slightly overrated, I think the high rating reflects the fact that this came out before most of the newer solid DIPAs in its class. I definitely don't think it's a top 5 beer , or even a top 5 DIPA anymore, but I'm sure it was both of these things just a few years ago. Now that competition in the DIPA arena has gotten tighter, there are so many other worthy competitors to pliny."
Picked up a few bottles at Toronado in early December 2013. Poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass.
"Excellent American Double Ipa. Had It ON Tap In Ca, Nice Head, Caramel Color, Very Complex Flavor Palate But Very Balanced And remarkably Drinkable And smooth. This Is Easily On Of Top Beers I Have Ever Had Wish It Was Available Outside A Small AreaIn CA"
"My review is based upon bottles that have made a 3500 mile trek. That being said, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this beer belongs on the stage of the world's elite, regardless of style. I VERY MUCH want to try it on tap fresh on site someday."
Appearance is a golden yellow color with a 2 finger head.
Appearance- Aggressive pour yields a nice thick head that lingers as a 1 cm head forever. Love the look...this is where Pliny excels vs HT. Really nice clean golden hue. Perfect look for a double IPA.
My big thanks to my good friend Derek for bringing this bottle back from Cali for me.
Smells like cannabis in a glass when fresh. Not worth drinking if it's more than a month old. So much fresh hops in here to count or even make sense of.
Bottle sent in a trade - 11/15/13 bottled on date.
The folks at Russian River never cease to amaze me. Pliny sets the bar for all others. You could spend your remaining years searching for something better but you keep coming back. Gorgeous golden smooth pour. The hops are so intense they turn the corner and mature into a lovely malty finish. Heaven....
Warning... If you drink this is quite possibly will ruin all other beer for you. Now I have an IPA and it's always compared to this. I've tried to brew a clone of this 3 times now (because I can't get it in NY without trading for it) and it never comes close. This beer is pure genius. 
Re review! Brother was just in Santa Rosa and picked me up a sixer as an early bday. 
Poured from a bottle into a 12oz. pilsner glass.
Poured from bottle to Sierra Nevada IPA glass. 
"A perfect IPA. Thanks to my buddy for this hookup from his growler, and bottles from the brewery!"
Finally time to review this. Eight days since bottled.
Pours cloudy golden. Smells of flowers and green leaves. Initially tastes very light and fresh then the hops come in with weight only to quickly move to a smooth buttery taste and feel. Finishes with strong delicious hops. Pliny is fantastic fresh and is highly encouraged to be consumed shortly after bottling for maximum flavor.
Thanks to Christy and Robert for getting this for me. It has been on my list for a long time and I had it in my refrigerator for a month so I could take the time to review it.
My comparison of Heady and Pliny head to head....
"An amazing IPA. Great nose on this beer. Lots of citrus fruit. The mouth feel is good and I like the ABV at where it is at 8%. I think any higher and you would be able to taste the booze in the beer. I don't think it is as high as quality as Heady Topper or some of the Three Floyd's beer that has been out there, but still a amazing beer."
The last time I had this beer was maybe ten years ago and they have since pulled back thier market.
"Pliny the Elder...the beer I heard so much about when I really started delving into craft beers. I heard everything from it being the Holy Grail of beers to it being the most overhyped beer ever. All I knew was that I wanted to try it. After searching I was able to find a shop that would deliver to NY, so I ordered 2 bottles of the elder, 2 blind pigs and Redemption. Figured why not make it a RR care pack lol. Well..."
L: Bright clear gold with a nice white head and some excellent lacing.
Had an 8-23-13 side by side with a 6-1-13 Heady Topper. The Pliny does not hold a candle to the Heady. It had basically become a malt bomb whereas the Heady literally tasted as good as the day it was purchased in Waterbury. 
16 oz. bottled poured into a pub glass. 
"Not sure what to say about Pliny. It's basically perfect, but at the same time it's not terribly interesting."
16 oz. bottled poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Bottled on 10/30. Consumed on 11/9.
The class of Russian River Brewing. It's the perennial answer to the question: what's the best American 'big' IPA.
"I am blessed enough to live in the Bay Area. And though it is still a bit difficult to find this because of the demand, its not too difficult to strike gold. After a few phone calls and swiftness, the thirst was quenched."
I had the privilege to finally try Pliny the Elder thanks to a trade and what a treat it was!
"Overall, this beer is perfect. It is one of the rare beers that absolutely lives up to its reputation."
2 weeks old
"Served on draft at hotel outside of Napa Valley. Had several 3 or 4. At the time, didn't realize how much of a sought after beer this is outside of Cali."
"Literally, the best beer i have ever had. It lived up to all the hype. The only thing that might compare is when I finally try Pliny the Younger.. which may never happen.. Anyways, i'm not gonna fully review it. It is the best beer ever, period. The russian river legends will never fail."
Pliny the Elder 
"Had it too many times to care, it's good. But no one cares any more."
A big shout out to my friend Bob who hooked me up! Bottle date 10/3/13.
A- Served in a tulip glass at Stone Bistro in CA. Deep golden color with thick frothy head
"I wasn't really into IPA's until I had this one here, both on top and in a bottle...over and over and over again. It's a must have whenever it's on tap and a take home when your local craft beer store has it in stock. "
"This is easily one of my top three favorite IPAs ever. If it were available all year round, it would be my favorite hands down. Although, having it all year would take away one of the most fun aspects of this beer. Its rarity. Any IPA (or craft beer) fan needs to try this beer at least once."
"Bottled. Courtesy of Jim - huge thanks. Clear orange pour with a foamy white head. What sets this beer apart is the massive fresh hop aroma. Incredible. I smell pine mostly, but my wife says floral. Probably a little of both. It's the oily richness of the aroma that counts. Good solid IPA flavor. Very smooth. Bitterness balances with the massive malty backbone. Earthy finish. Warming after a few sips. Overall a wonderful double."
Pours a perfectly clear golden hue with a beautiful creamy off white head. Holds at two fingers and leaves hug spots of lacing all the way down the glass. 
"Bottle, poured into glass. Pours a mid-dark orange. This smelled heavenly. Tasted quite bitter but not extremely. Very hoppy and more citrusy than piney. I had 1 fresh bottle and 1 that was about 1.5 months old. They tasted the same, so I'm guessing it ages decently well to a point."
20 oz. bottle poured into a wine glass.
Have drinkin a couple times a free weeks out of bottling and had a weird soapy taste. Drank this one less than a week from the bottling and it was amazing. Poured into a tulip glass that really let the aroma of this beer shine. Great beer. Appeals to all senses!
Short and sweet review. 
This beer is what everyone else says it is: a fine example of an IPA. 
Bottled on 10/03/13
"Freaking delicious!! Tried it for the first time at Falling Rock in Denver,CO. at GABF. Great bar, atmosphere and people! Great characteristics, obviously, beautiful color and head. The nose was heavy and the finish was smooth. Wish i was able to bring some home from the trip. it was at the top of my list and i Loved it. Great beer!"
"So much hype to live up with this beer and I have to say it did. The appearance was a light amber color. The smell was of citrus, with piney notes. And the taste, similar, hints of pine, citrus, grapefruit and lemon. Mouthfeel was just perfect. Not too thick, not too thin. One of the best IPAs and beers I've ever had."
"Huge thanks to SebD for sending us this beer I a great trade, huge want. "
Pours clear orange-tinted gold with ½ inch of off-white head that leaves heavy lace.
"If you haven't tried this beer, PLEASE do. "
Edit*
"A: light golden color, about a finger of head which stuck around nicely"
Bottled on: 9/30/13. Drank on: 10/4/13.
A - Pours a golden brown with good clarity. Nice 2 fingers of oily white head that retains to a ring around the glass and a pillow of bubbles in the middle. 
"Bottle date: September 3rd, 2013"
Made a friend of mine go 100 miles out of his way on his California trip just to get me this!
"Mmmmm mmm mmm. Still unbeatably balanced! Sure, there are a lot of other more EXTREME DIPA's and even IPA's out there now, but Pliny is just so damn drinkable, and consistent, every single time. It really took until the second or third time I had it to really appreciate it against all the other hoppy beers I've had. Actually, the first time I had it ON TAP, at the brewpub, was the real revelation for me. The hops are full of both citrus and pine aromas and flavors and each sip allows you to taste a different part of this beer's magnificence. And the crazy thing is that this is the THIRD-BEST Russian River beer I've tried (behind PtY and Supplication)!"
"This is hands down one of my favorite beers. Being am IPA fan it's hard to get any better than Pliny. The hoppy grapefruit finish is amazing. Great aroma, taste, color how can it get any better. I have had this from a bottle and at the brewery restaurant in Santa Rosa and there is no better IPA in my opinion. "
"T: A burst of sweet pine, and bitter grapefruit. I was a bit worried about trying this one. I looked at the bottle for days, scared of what it might be an epic disappointment. I'm glad to report that it wasn't, it was a ride that you want to ride over and over again. This beer has tropical notes, and many fruity notes live int this beer. I don't feel orange, or lemon, but something more. "
"I wish I could say that Russian River Brewery's Pliny the Elder was just overhyped, considering how difficult it is to find, but it as good as they say. I find myself driving to multiple stores just to find a bottle this fabulous double IPA."
Appearance: It has a nice hazy golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderately slow and leaves nice lacing.
"My first encounter and it is by far the best smelling beer that I have ever came across. Thoroughly enjoyed and the hype has been validated. My simple statement: it is the epitome of any IPA and practically any beer for that matter. That is my review. I am so determined that my short review is quite adequate that I am willing to type out the minimum amount of words in order for this review to be posted. So, I am going to ramble just a bit because I feel that my first 42 words said enough to convince anyone that this beer is absolutely fantastic and should be sought after by any beer enthusiast. Most people specifically describe the appearance, taste, mouthfeel, etc., etc. My take on it is plainly simple. Find it, drink it , relish it, but you may depress over it because it's over and hard to come by."
"Bottled 4-21-15. Poured a crystal clear golden color, with a nice two-finger off-white head. Pretty little carbonation bubbles continually floated to the top, which meant the head lasted until the bottom and left great lacing all the way to the end. The aroma was very big, piney and citrusy. The flavor was very bitter pine up front, moving to a nice orangey/grapefruity citrus flavor, followed by a nice sweet malty aftertaste - phenomenally well balanced. The mouthfeel was superb- somewhat thick and creamy, nice carbonation and left a nice oily feel on the tongue. This is just one outstanding beer in every respect, lovin it!"
Bottle share poured into a snifter. Born on date 9/3/13
"Had on tap at Monk's, 9/14. This is a big, juicy, aromatic IPA, dripping in tropical fruit, most notably mango. Yet surprisingly dry, with a lemony crispness. Balanced by a sweet center and rounded out with well-executed pine. Mouthfeel is velvety soft, but still effervescent."
"Poured from a bottle dated ""bottled on 8/16/2013"", into a tulip."
A - Fairly wonderful golden yellow with a slight hint of orange. Nice white head with good retention
"Acquired through trade with Cynic-ale - who definitely hooked it up! If you ever have the chance to make a trade with him, DO IT!"
"A- Pours a totally transparent and luminous orange hue, capped with a solid finger of bright white head. Even as the foam dissipates, remnants of head form a halo on the edges of the glass and a light lacing on the surface of the beer."
Just got a FRESH bottle from a friend that came back from Cali...
"My favorite double IPA. Great balance of flavor between malt and hops. Aroma is nectar like and doesn't flood the senses. Awesome sweet finish that doesn't leave any bitterness. Extremely drinkable, however packs a swift punch. Best to drink after a Blind Pig."
"YES THIS BEER IS THAT GOOD! Don't let the light color full you. This beer packs a ton of flavor. Great balance of malts and hops! Nice caramel undertones. Fantastic mouth feel. Very smooth finish which makes this a very drinkable beer! Beware at 8.00% ABV it sneaks up on you. Thank you Craft Ale House in Limerick, PA for having this on tap!"
Beer pours clear amber. A nice fluffy off-white head. 
poured from the bottle to a tulip glass 
4.5
"Very pretty color of light radiant gold fills the snifter as a loosely built, fizzy head sets atop. The complexion is more reminiscent of a wine than an ale but it certainly looks good."
"This pours a dark banana yellow, slight haze, golden honey color with a creamy soft white head that fell slowly and left really great lace. The nose took a while to fully realize itself. It had a light pineapple and a light pine. Pale malt and lightly breaddy. Hop resins even on the nose. Hop floral and a sweet honey with the malt. There was no alcohol on the nose but there was a nice deep round hop scent."
"While vacationing in Southern California, went to the Stone brewery in San Diego. They are the distributor for Russian River. Bottle was three weeks old. Being from Chicago, looking forward to my first taste of Pliny. Smell was okay. didn't get the pine smell others mention. Taste is best described as boring. I didn't get any hop bite or tingling or malt sweetness. Definitely easy drinking but that's not what I'm looking for in an 8.0 abv beer. Overall, glad to try but reaffirmed that there are plenty of great local (Midwest) beers to enjoy and much better West Coast options."
"Pliny the Elder pours a pale amber, lighter than expected, with a white, fluffy head that dissipates quickly. Not much lacing but that may be more because of the shaker pint it was served in. Aroma is big and fruity, lots of grapefruit, pine, and lemon. Grapefruit and pineapple hit the front of the tongue. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel can best be described as smooth, medium-light bodied with light carbonation, drinks much easier than its 8% ABV. Overall, this is one of the smoothest, easiest drinking Imperial IPAs out there. Outstanding job Russian River."
Had this (along with other dipa's) at a East VS. West Dipa Head to Head Showdown I hosted on 8/27/13
"My very first Russian River experience - no availability here in BC, but was recently in OR. Background: IPA's are actually a ways down the list of my favourite styles. I am a gueuze / lambic / saison guy by summer and imperial stout and belgian quad guy by winter. I still drink a wide variety of big IPA's just because they are so plentiful over the warm months and it's not like I don't like them or anything."
Poured into a tulip.
A - Nice head and color
Love this beer and Pliny the Younger is just as good. 
Look: Transparent gold with a very active white head! Lots of legs keep the head up high. Very active beer! 
"Had this on tap at The Hopyard in San Fransisco. The beer was excellent but not the best I've ever had. It was served in a room temp glass and the beer was not all that cold. I guarantee this had a negative effect on the taste. For all the hype this beer gets I have to say that there are better beers out there. Russian River makes it so difficult to get a hold of and people perceive that as being a good thing. It's not. There are better beers out there people. Love the beer, dislike the breweries tactics."
"Able to snag one of these from Krisp in San Diego. Thought about shipping it to myself, but it was already cold and I wanted it as fresh as possible. As a result, I had the bartender at the Courtyard Marriott give me a room temperature pint glass (not optimal, but what was available) and poured myself a nice one. "
"Had this on tap in a nice 17 oz mug at Hollingshead's yesterday, and had one with a sandwich at the same place last month (also on tap in a mug)."
Bottling Date: 06.25.13
"Finally got me some of this courtesy of dabeel, thanks!"
"Had last night after a friend of mine brought some up to the frozen north form a wedding in Portland, OR. Poured into a Kenai River Brewing Pint and man this beer really is one of the best in the world. When something is hyped this month it is hard to really enjoy it, but this really is the standard by which all other West Coast DIPAs are judged and rightly so. It was already almost two months old, so I must say I don't think I have had the full experience, but man... The head was a little thin and the smell wasn't quite as expressive as I would have liked, but the flavor was really exactly what you want for the style, truly a hop heads dream."
"Never fails to blow me away. Most recently had on a trip to Amsterdam late June 2013. Was at De Bierkoning geeking out when they happen to pull some Pliny out. Felt like I had to get ""approved"" to buy two bottles (rare in the U.S., imagine in Amsterdam), but passed the test. Always lives up to the allure. Drink at all costs."
"Long awaited sampling of PtE....Can't say I'm even close to signing on with all the hype. Nose was boring and non descript. Mouth feel was good, smooth and full. Taste was average at best. IMHO, not in the same league as Heady or Gandhi Bot. Just a good, not great, dipa."
"My second Pliny, but first since 2009 and first full review. This bottle is courtesy of Eduardo."
2 month old bottle via r/beertrade poured into a snifter
Second try (+compare to enjoy by 4/20)
Bottled 7/22
"Overall: Heard all the hype, so I drove 30 minutes in pouring rain to have this on tap at Isaac Newton's in New Town, PA on August 1st which is now IPA Day for some reasons? Bad news was they limited it to one glass per person (was not loving that). Good news was the WOW factor. This beer is everything I expected it to be. Huge fruit bomb in the nose...super smooth drinkability with a variety of tropical fruits (too many to list going on here), hops, and some subtle bread notes. The hops were not at all overbearing as I sometimes find with this style of beer. The flavors were so balanced and tasty...This is without a doubt the best Double IPA I have ever had and could have easily drank this all afternoon despite the 8%. And they say the Younger is better...if that is true, I eagerly await that one to come around. Cheers!!"
"Bottle. Pours is golden with white head. Flavor is incredible hops, not overly bitter but no malts to be tasted. Really well done, clean hop taste and absolutely fantastic. One of my all-time favorite beers. The hops are really strong, but I could drink a lot of this."
"Mailed to me by a California friend, Poured into a Sam Adams glass yielded a nice head, plenty of lacing and beaucoup small bubbles for a few minutes. Color was golden, Smell was wonderful with a nice hop forward, citrusy piney character and a hint of malt flavor. Mouthfeel was a little weak, but offset by the outstanding taste which was very hop foward , pleasantly bitter and just sweet enough with a malty finish and the alcohol is hidden well. My first from Russian River which I wish were available in my area. Nice to start with one of their best. It is hard to compare to other great DIPA's but it has to be one of the most balanced DIPA's I've had. Enjoyed with jambalaya and crawfish pie, a great pairing."
A: Bright copper with a decent bright white head that is leaving tantalizing lacing around the glass.
"Pliny was a huge letdown... First, it took me a month of going from store to store to track it down. And when I finally found it in stock, I was rationed to two bottles."
"on tap at venti's downtown - seems they do this every 5th monday of the month - 8 oz for $4.75, worth the try. "
"Bought at whole foods, Bottle date 7/11/13"
A: Poured into a teku with aggression it produced a pillowy white head roughly 2 fingers tall that susatained for quite a while. As it fell it left honycomb lacing on the edge of the glass and small bubbles along the edge. The color was a soft orangish color with a small amount of haze. 
L - filtered golden deliciousness. 
"Just hit paydirt when I stopped in at Beerworks in Medford Or. I had given up hope of finding Pliny in bottles, when, what is that over there? It's Pliny the Elder on tap! I walk straight to the bar and can only utter one word,""pliny"", which spurs the hippie bartender girl into action as she pours me my first taste of this beer that I have read so much about. "
"After traveling 800 miles and visiting 4 Denver liquor stores, I finally struck paydirt. Picked up 3 nice Russian River products...time to determine what all the fuss is about. Starting with Pliny the Elder."
"A - Huge, frothy, perfect white head (possibly an overly aggressive pour). Pale golden straw color, fairly translucent; looks like a lager. Nice bubbling and incredible lacing. Good head retention."
This is pretty close to the perfect beer in my opinion. 
"Definition of a hop bomb! Not only that but one that has set the bar very very high. Well balanced, delicious and so very drinkable. What everyone wrote holds true. Yes it has a bit of a cult following but it has earned it. You don't have to be a hipster to enjoy this cult classic. If you stumble across some bottles grab them and hold onto them!"
Had on tap at RR Brewpub during a vacation to Yosemite and San Francisco. Pours a beautiful golden color with nice lacing. Kudos to the pub for serving in a proper imperial nonic glass. 
"Had this beer multiple times, thankfully I live in northern ca....it is my favorite beer to date. Finally writing a review after I tried Heady Topper. This beer is amazing and it's a must try for beer enthusiasts and hop heads alike."
"A very great beer. Close to perfect. I've been lucky enough to have had it both on tap and in a bottle. I prefer it on tap, but the bottle is also great. Definitely a must buy whenever it comes around, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great IPA."
"I am about 10 miles from their brew pub and have had this many times. Yes, this is a great beer. It is best on tap, but the bottled version is also fantastic. This is my favorite double IPA hands down. I can't give it a solid 5 because I'm still questing after the perfect IPA. And the hype around RRBC is getting way out of hand. Yes, it is fantastic, but the hype turns me off. "
"Pliny the Elder is the world's best beer in my estimation, and I continue to be stunned at how delicious it is every I time I drink it on tap. In the bottle it's not quite as perfect, but what can you do."
"I finally got to try this beer on tap (I live on the East Coast), and while nothing could live up to the hype that this beer gets, it is certainly a fantastic beer."
Had to travel out west to finally try this beer. It was great. I don’t know if it is possible to live up to the hype that it receives but certainly a damn good beer. Definitely possessed some of the best balance I've seen in a double IPA. Would like to see this become more available on the east coast for sure.
Received as a present from my girlfriends college friend when she came back to Philly to visit. Bottled 6/25/13. 
"Had this one on tap at a bar in Philly. Poured a light amber color, a little head that quickly disappeared, minimal carbonation. Smelled a combination of tangerine, pine and a little grapefruit. The taste was very well balanced. The hops were definitely not overpowering like some of the other DIPA's I've had before, but left me with a nice bite at the end. "
This is about a 12 day old Pliny. Not bad given the brewery is under a thousand miles away. I've reviewed this beer several times before but I like to revisit so I can compare it with other world class DIPA's I've had of recent and see if it still lives up to my previous rating. I've had Pliny on draft in SF and the brewery for that matter so this might not be the best specimen to put to review but it will have to do for now.
Poured from bottle into a pint glass
"I may have had this over a year ago when my brother brought one home from Portland, but damn I see what the hype is about. This is a double ipa with major hop flavor and nose; incredible malt backbone, with none of the sticky sweetness that typically characterizes most examples of the style. If you can get it...do it"
"Great beer, Russian River seems to have it down when it comes to 90 percent of their beers. Pliny the elder is a very smooth hoppy feel. Offers satisfaction throughout the paler providing an array of hops. Pliny the elder provides its uniqueness as well as a great beer overall!"
Appearance: Pours a clear yellow orange with a light and bubbly two and a half fingers of white foam.
"From bottle. Poured into tulip. This is a great beer, but I don't understand why everyone sees this as a diamond in the rough. I work at a fine wine/craft beer store and get at least 5 calls a day asking if I have any Pliny. There are other things to get excited about. Try some new stuff."
"Someone brought me this pricy pint-size (seriously?) bottle from CA and I finally got to taste it. Honestly, I was not blown away. Nothing bad, but nothing really stood out either - fairly delicate, but there is not enough taste to keep it interesting. Maybe because it's a few weeks old, though kept in the fridge at all times."
"My first time trying Pliny the Elder. This IPA is a must have for all hopheads. Being a hophead myself, I had to try this one."
Saw this beer was being sold at a local liquor store and wanted to taste the hype all over the Internet. The pour was an impressive clear amber. Smell was a strong ipa scent on the nose with some piny notes. Taste. Eh. The hype killed this beer for me. Good ipa. Not great.
"Got in a trade with TopsecretWaffle. 510 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/27/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, pineapple, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, pineapple, grass, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, honey, light caramel, floral, grass, pine, bread, and floral earthiness. Awesome balance and complexity of hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, sticky, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! Great hop flavor complexity and moderate malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering; but certainly not near the hype it gets."
Poured into a Stone IPA glass from a bottle dated 5/21/14.
"Very, very, good IPA. Was looking for the younger to try, but this definitly stood on its own! I would recommend this to anyone. "

"A solid dipa for sure. Loads of sticky hops with piney notes, tropical fruit, and a hint of resin. Wouldn't have guessed that hop extract was used, but nonetheless it doesn't deter from what's going on here. Enough solid malt to be there and support the hops, but the hops are the star. Rich mouthfeel and spot on carbonation make this one heck of an enjoyable brew."
Bottled on 5/27/13
Bottled on 5/16/2013
"This beer is certainly better on draft, but either way it is exceptional. The bottle was about a month old, and the age was showing already. Slightly degraded hops, but the fact that it still scores this high is a testament to how great the beer is. Only compared to The Younger, which I had prior to having this bottle, does it suffer a bit. If possible, the booziness came through on this one more so than when drinking The Younger. Again, the age did not do it any favors."
"What a treat. I came so far to find you and now, we say our last goodbye."
"I finally was able to get my hands on the fabled Pliny the Elder and I have to say, i'm not all too blown away. "
"I was amazed with this beer. Having had numerous DIPAs, I expected this to be about the same. Boy was I wrong. This is absolutely the smoothest DIPA I have ever had. The hops, of course, were front and center. But it did not nearly have the usual ""hop blast"" that every other DIPA I've ever had has. My wife, who tastes every beer I give her, usually makes a ""scrunchy"" face over the bitterness of the DIPAs I give her to try. This one, even she said is really good. This is a phenomenal beer. If I ever get a chance to buy multiple bottles of this, I wouldn't hesitate for a second, no matter how much it costs, to buy as many bottles of this as I could."
Bottle date 5/9/13
"What a great beer! A lot softer in that hop taste than I originally thought. This beer is so smooth and drinkable it ridiculous. I give this a lampshade hat rating of 8.5 out of ten. A few of these will def. catch up with you. Cheers to Russian River, excellent beer!"
Bottle from the brewery. Born 5/27/13. This beauty is nine days old. 
Very smooth. Enjoyed the aroma and taste. 
Bottled 5/13/13.
"Bottle at a bottle share, and again via trade. Pours a clear light amber color with a moderate head. Nose and taste are both quite bitter and hoppy, with some amazing floral and piney elements; this was a fairly fresh bottle, so it was amazingly crisp and clean to drink. Great brew."
"Really looking forward to this, obviously. I've had Heady and some great DIPA's, and I dont expect it to match Heady but if it can come anywhere close I'm in for a serious treat."
A-Amber brown/burnt orange with off white foam. 
I love this beer. But I have so many better double IPAs as of late it's hard for me to rate it really high. I am a little biased I have probably had more Pliny the Elder then anyone in the Santa Cruz County area. Russian River in my opinion should be known more for their sours.
This is one beer that lived up to the hype. It had the quality bitter hop flavor one expects from an IPA but it also had a smoothness and a sweetness that had it soaring above all others. This is a well balanced flavorful beer that must be tried by all beer lovers!
"Not worth the hype, it's ok super hoppy"
You had this beer. 
Very excited to have my first Pliny. Bottle poured into a snifter.
"Favorite brew, about time I gave this one a full review."
Did a tasting of this at work when a customer brought some back from America. Had it about a month after it had been bottled.
"Poured from bottle into a glass , a yellowish brown color to it with a 1/2 finger white head that stays around for the ride to the bottom"
Oh Pliny. We've enjoyed each other for a while now; time to give you the full review.
Man this is good! Just opened my first bottle and it's pretty fresh; bottled 5/09/13.I don't know if this is a good analogy but opening the bottle is like letting the Genie out the lamp. It's insanely floral and sweet just smelling from the tip of bottle. Kind of like opening a BRAND NEW canister of Folgers ground coffee in the morning. 
"Well, thanks to a fantastic Cali BA, I've just had my first Pliny. Poured into a tulip, tall head, lingers a bit. It's hoppy and smooth. Very balanced and drinkable, doesn't overwhelm the palate. It's not the hop bomb I was expecting, for better or worse. Not the best or hoppy-est, but better than any other IIPA...except one..."
"17.25 oz. bottle purchased at Ales Unlimited (gotta ask for it!) in San Francisco, CA, bottled on 5/9/13, poured into a hotel style glass and drank over ~30 minutes. Of note, I drank this back-to-back with RR's Blind Pig IPA, so feel free to see that review for comparisons."
A - pours a clear gold with a standard white head. Some lace. Light bubbles.
This is definitely one of the best tasting IPAs I have ever had. I wouldn't recommend drinking this first and then following it up with another IPA. The second IPA wouldn't taste right. If you can get your hands on a bottle I wouldn't think twice to get it.
"God, I love this beer. Over-hyped? Yes! But damn well worthy of all that hype!"
Bottle date: 4/12/13. Enjoyed 4/28/13.
"Got three bottles from a trade. Thanks, Jasonrm72!"
"traveled far and wide to taste this legend, this mystery."
"Bottled 4-17-13, enjoyed 5-7-13. Poured into a tulip glass."
"Clear orange glow with tightly laced white head. Lots of tropical fruit on the nose. Lots of tropical fruit on the palate too, mangos and pineapples. Enough malt to balance the hops along with a nice building bitterness that grows with each sip. Lot milder then expected but great flavors, not overbearing, and extremely drinkable. One of the few beers to live up to its reputation but still not my favorite DIPA."
"This was my second DIPA (had Lagunitas Maximus in bottle the prior day). Was out in the Bay Area so drove up to Santa Rosa to try it right at the source - the Russian River Brewpub. Had a pint at the bar before dinner. It was definitely unique but not something I would seek out for future drinking. For me it finished too bitter and like the other DIPA I had (Lagunitas Maximus) had a hint of something rank on hitting the tongue. Comparing the two it was definitely preferable to the Lagunitas with more interesting flavor components and a smoother mouthfeel. I ended up getting a sampler of all 15 beers they had on tap after this pint, and ended up preferring several of their other beers (Perdition, OVL Stout, almost everything except the sour ales). Obviously YMMV and if you like DIPAs I can only assume you'll love this. Thinking about my preferences, I'd take a good Bock/Eisbock/Barleywine in the cooler months and a tasty Hefeweizen/Lager in the warmer months over Pliny any day. I'd still be up for trying a pint of Younger if I am around here in February just to make sure this tasting wasn't a fluke."
This is truly an American treasure. Had heard about this one but was unprepared to try it.
10oz. pour into a Duvel Tulip at Hawthorne's Cafe in Philadelphia.
Poured a straw yellow orange with a nice frothy white two finger head that leaves a touch of lacing. Head dissipates to a nice skim of froth and carbonation. 
"It's fortunately pretty accessible in California, so I've had it on tap and in bottles numerous times."
I am filling this out from memory. 
"Appearance: A nice clear amber-ish gold, with a good white head that leave nice lacing"
"This was a great tasting smooth beer with well defined hops and a terrific aroma of honey, citrus, and grapefruit. I tried it at DLD 2013 from a generous pour while waiting in line. The beer was well carbonated and a great refreshing summer beer with hops that don't linger longer than necessary."
Finally got the elusive Pliny! (I'm on the East Coast) Trading is the only way to do it out here. Traded 3 Heady Toppers for 2 Plinys... I think its equitable and I was very happy with it.
"Picked up some Pliny last week in California and was very fresh. Printed date of production was two weeks ago. There is nothing to not like about this medium bodied beer - Pours a nice golden yellow, smells woodsy/fruity, mouth feel is good with not too much carbonation and doesn't linger for a whole lot of after taste. World class, but hard to obtain here on the east coast."
"Golden color with medium white head. Fantastic aromatic hoppy aroma with oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, grapefruit zest, pines. Taste starts sweet fruity with oranges, tangerines, lychee, pineapples, continues with strong portion of aromatic hops. Long very hoppy bitter finish. Very tasty."
bottled 1 week ago (4/17/2013).
"I should note that Pliny (the Elder) is not a beer I have traditionally thought as highly of as many of my IPA-loving friends. But I do need to start critically tasting and reviewing beers, and what better to start with than this staple brew."
Russian River Brewing Company - Pliny The Elder
"Poured out of a bottle into a 20 oz snifter. Bottled on 4/13/13, so nice and fresh."
Date bottled: 4/10/13 - poured into an Irish imperial pint. 
"No review is really needed for this beer, but I wanted to have this listed under my review list. That said, the beer is a favorite for obvious reasons. Its balance and flavors are so good, and are still considerably unique among so many beers even after all these years. May be my favortite beer during the summer time. Such a fresh, clean flavor profile. Simcoe hops are balanced perfectly. The slight champagney mouthfeel gives you a deliciously refreshing beginning with a semi-dry finish that begs for another gulp. The smell is good, but does not represent the beers taste and overal experience. I did notice the hop smells came through more as it warmed up a bit, but this beer should be served colder them most IPA's. I recently had PTY and although it was a great beer, (basically a bigger version of elder), I think Elder is a better beer as for as craft goes."
"I'm a hop head and this beer is by far the best IPA I have ever had! Enjoyed this pint while down in Santa Rosa one day on a road trip. An explosion of citrus, floral, earthy and grassy hops. Perfectly balanced malt backbone. It doesn't get any better than this. I usually don't write reviews, but this beer gets one. Way to go Russian River!"
Bottle brought back from San Diego by my mom. What a nice mom. Bottled 4/10/13- 7 days young. Poured from the bottle into a goblet.
I drink this regularly on tap at the pub. It's probably a little biased.
My turn to take a swing at the much hyped Pliny the Elder. A big thanks to the Apt family for making this happen. I know this bad boy is hard to come by. 
Bottled on 3/14/13 
"Got this from a buddy that came back from California- thanks Jamie! I was so excited to try this beer, as I have heard all the hype. Had this in my Hill Farmstead tulip glass. Pours a nice looking pale ale with a nice head that with moderate lacing that sticks to the glass, creating nice layers with every sip. The initial aroma is floral and super hoppy, but fades quickly. The light body holds only an initial hop flavor that fades quickly as your pallet declines with the bitter bite of the hops, and the flavor just seems bland after the first 2 sips. No real complaints with this beer, except that it didn't live up to the hype. Definitely a very good beer, but I would not go out of my way to have this. 4.27/5"
"Ah, Pliny. It's been three years, but we meet at last. Pliny the Elder pours out an orange-copper color with a head that retains very well. The aroma is that of resiny hops and citrus. Pretty standard, but still well done. The taste puts any fears to rest I had of this not living up to the hype down pretty quickly. It brings in a strong grapefruit flavor at first, with some tropical flavors in the middle leading to a big, resiny, piney finish that lingers for an eternity. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, Pliny the Elder is an excellent double IPA. Highly enjoyable and highly recommended."
"Poured a clearish orange gold body with monster two-finger head that died slow and left lace everywhere the whole beer. Huge hop aroma of sticky, wet, earthy hops with that familiar grapefruit and citric/clovey spice hop zip, along with some sweet or plush tropical fruit smell that is a tad noticeable and there is a touch of some caramel and/or bready malt. Beer is medium-bodied, easy to drink, incredibly smooth for the amout of hops in there and it packs a lot. Almost chewey and a dangerous session ale since you can't even pick up any alcohol, this beer is the exception of most DIPAs in that instead of crushing/drying out your tastebuds it wets them and leaves you wanting more. Not only are there the strong grape/citric hops flavors with spice but there is a sweetness to this beer that gives it nice balance and a strong, bready crackerlike malt backbone that holds everything up and what a delicious finish. For everything I heard about this beer it was definitely worth the wait."
Poured a bottle into a Deschutes Teku. Bottled 5/13/13. 
Bottled 6/17
"I had two on tap in Philly. Very excited when the waitress mentioned it, because like many, I thought I might never get to taste it. This beer has a golden-red, rather clear hue. A small white head. An amazing citrus smell that you know is gonna taste good, just from one sniff. Taste is very crisp, refreshing, and citrusy. Grapefruit mostly, with medium body. Could drink a lot of these in a single sitting. I still give an edge to Gandhi Bot as slightly better tasting, because as a local, I have my biases =), but I liked Pliny so much, I thought I would add to the chorus of complimentary reviews. Worth the hype in my opinion, of course I was lucky and didn't have to wait in a line or trade to get a taste, very fortunate on my part. Right bar, right time."
Bottled 3/8/13
"I live a block from a bar that has this on tap and I have it at least once a week. Hands down, a fantastic beer. Just a lighter version of the Younger and less malt. Great balance of malt character and fresh hops. I'm really luck to live a block from the fountain of PtE."
Will this live up to the massive hype?!
A HUGE thank you goes out to my friends at Pinnochio's for hooking me up with this mini growler. I swear this place just keeps getting better and better. 
"Summary - After waiting 45 minutes at the Russian River Brew Pub in Santa Rosa for a table and a beer, I started with the flagship brew. I am not an IPA fan, but found this one so well-balanced, that I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"A: hazy golden, with mild lacing and very thin head. "
"One of the finest beers put out by Russian River. Had it on tap at the brewery. Very hoppy aroma hits you first, drinks incredibly smooth for such a big beer. It is hard to find but well worth the hunt. If you happen to locate a bottle, or better yet find it on tap, do not pass up the opportunity to try it."
Review #300
"The East Coast hop junkies, particularly those of us in Vermont, have been spoiled to Heady Topper,Lawson's Double Sunshine (among other splendid DIPAs),and Hill Farmstead varieties. The legend of Pliny The Elder was one that intrigued me, and thanks to my buddy & hop mentor, I was lucky enough to sample this nectar."
"Before I had a chance to have this for the first time, I was worried that it was going to be over hyped; I thought my expectations were going to be too high, and I was going to be disappointed. Nothing could be further from the truth. This beer is simply fantastic. It puts all of my other favorite DIPAs to shame. It pours a rich golden amber that is perfectly transparent, with some bubbles effervescing. It has a nice thick dense, white head with great retention and lacing. The smell is amazing: fresh pineapple, mango, hops and grapefruit. The definition of fresh. The taste follows suit: sour citrus up front, some sweet caramel and mango in the middle with some herbal hints, and resiny hops to finish it off. Absolutely no booze. Silky smooth, crisp and refreshing. This beer is simply fantastic, and considering its price point, and availability (check local listings), I would go on a limb to say it is probably the best beer overall on the planet right now."
Bottled On: 021913
A special thank you to Taylor Ross for hooking me up with this rare and hard to find brew.
"So bloody good. This beer showed me that brews can be flavorful in a very broad sense, crisp and refreshing on the pallet, and without any of that nasty Pale Ale/IPA aftertaste that we all so love and enjoy."
Bottled 3/8/13. Enjoyed 3/15/13
What can you possibly say about Pliny the elder....this beer is awesome just too hard to find in socal!
Poured on tap into tulip.
"Just after finishing a 750ml of White Chocolate... thank God this beer tastes soooo good. Pine, citrus that I am sooo glad I am tasting. If you can get this beer; I would suggest drinking The Bruery BT, WC, CR, or GT prior to bring out the glorification of this beer. Unreal. Sounds counterproductive... I know. It works"
"BIG thanks to IanSpindler, a local beer advocate and complete stranger who reached out to me randomly via this website and offered me this bottle for trade. The beer gods have shone their light on me today!"
Bottled two weeks before opening.

Medium-full body, some syrup. Clear amber body with off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, grapefruit, caramel. Taste is moderately sweet, pine/grapefruit, caramel. Hops are strong but not overpoweringly bitter. Medium body. I like hoppy beers and this is one of my favorites!"

"At this years Abbbp Beermageddon, actually the first official Abbbp Beermageddon of its kind, this was a lucky, lucky score for us. Along side the Westevleteren we had this proved to be in the as advertised, lived up to its legend calling."
I received a couple bottles in a trade. Poured into my Southern Tier tulip.
"Just had my first one since I cannot get it here in Houston. I had my fiance ask her cousin in San Diego to ship some here. Overall, the best beer I've tasted so far. Smell is fantastic and taste is superb. Wish I could get PTY. I've heard it's very hard to get sometimes..."
I've had this many times in the bottle and on tap over the years...it's considered a standard for the double IPA category.
"Made it Russian River on 1-30-13, 2 days before Younger was released, the most well balanced beer I've had, it was so dank on tap, I'm in love with it and have some being shipped to me now...thank god for friends that love beer as much as I do...trying to see if I can get to Philly to try younger..."
Probably the best beer have ever had. 
"Bottled on 2/19/13, bought from Fred at Beverages 4 Less. Big thanks Freddy. You're the man."
"A...pours clear, honey yellow with a white fluffy head. Lots of vey sticky lacing down glass."
Finally writing a review for Pliny. poured it into a pint glass from bottle. Bottled about a week ago.
Had this at the Urban Tavern in the Hilton Union Square in San Francisco a few weeks ago. Very easy to drink. Hints of pine and citrus with a perfect balance. This I felt was a medium body work of art. Appearance is a fire orange. A must have if you can find it.
"I've tried several Plinys now, and not one has been bad. Great IPA. Has a great, refreshing smell to it. Pours a light white/yellow head. Very citrusy and bubbley too, also has a really clean, crisp taste. Light orange in appearance. Beautiful lacing."
"Poured from a 16 oz bomber into a tulip glass. Acquired a few of these from two different trades on the same day. Thanks h2k2c and frizzzle for hooking me up! Bottled 1/25/13, less than a month ago. Allowed to warm as I drank it, served fresh out of the fridge. "

Poured from a 510 ml bottle to a pint glass
2 days shy of a month old and I can tell it is a bit less vibrant.
"I was lucky enough a couple weeks ago to try this for the first time along with several other world class beers at the same sitting (2010 kbs for instance), and it delivered the goods."

500 Ml poured into a tulip
"This beer is awesome! Stopped off on my way back from the bay to try out a pint. From the aroma, to the appearance and the flavor, this IPA has it all! I must admit, I was prepared to be a little dissappointed based upon all the hype that surrounds this beer, but it rose to the challenge. Again, the only downside I see to this beer is the fact that you can't get it easier if you aren't in the Sonoma/Surrounding bay area. Definately a favorite."
"Tasted on January 12, 2013:"
"510ml bottle (bottling date 1/29/2013) poured into Bells tulip glass and consumed today, 2/19/2013- making for a 3 week old Pliny."
"Just a great solid West Coast IPA. They just do it very well. It is pretty traditional in it's taste compared with some of the newer beers. That being said, it's a great beer. If PTY is on tap I'm drinking that. It's a no brainer. "
hop blast at first that covers entire palate and tongue
"To date one of the top beers that I've drank. Clarity on the beer is ridiculous, and has a great orange amber hue. Aroma to me is floral. Taste is awesome, everything a double IPA should be, bitter, piney and aggressive. What makes this beer different for me is the smoothness as well and after a lot of hops it has a very smooth and clean finish with some lingering bitterness. Overall an incredible beer that I wish was more accessible and not so difficult to get. Got a few brought back from cali from a co-worker on a business trip. Had a another friend out that way this weekend and he was having difficulty finding it. This beer gives you a great excuse to take a trip out to the bay area."
Major thanks to lymph for throwing this in as an extra. Bottled on 1/29/2013 Enjoyed on 2/15/2013
"Wonderful beer. But it's hard to stand a chance when the little brother is simply superior. And I just had Pliny the Younger before tasting this one. If not, the mouthfeel of Pliny the Elder would have seemed so much better to me."
Huge shout out to beachstrength49 for this one!
On Tap at Monks Cafe Philadelphia
"Bottled on date of 1/10/13, poured into Duvel tulip."
"First full review, I figured this was a good beer to start with. "
"Had the pleasure of visiting RR brewery last month and Pliney did not disappoint! Just an all around great beer. Lovely huge piney scent when poured from the bottle, Excellent two finger head with great lacing, Light light golden color with huge points for clarity, and the taste...oh the taste! Super hop forward with tons of spice with a long bitter, but mellow finish. Seems like drinking hop nectar. This beer is certainly tops for West coast IPA's and really has forced me to rediscover the whole style. I'd drink this when and where ever i can find it!"
"Great story of my friend, Brian, at the Reef Restaurant in DC. He is a beer nut who has travelled and brings in the best possible tap beers to his place in the Adams Morgan Area.of DC."

Re-Reviewing with a 5 day old bottle. 
"Finally get to try the infamous Pliny. Big ups to terrapinbrian for supplying me with some. Poured into a snifter. Label says Bottled On: 081412. It's not the freshest, but it'll do. "
Bottled on 1/4/13. Enjoyed on 1/20/13
"Bottled 12-21-12, drank on 1-20-13."
"Had this beer multiple times and every time it was amazing. Not because it jumps at you with something in particular but because of it’s perfect balance and extreme dinkability. Almost clear golden color, white head. Resiny, green, hoppy aroma. Really good combination of malt and classic hops with pine and grapefruit pith. Medium body and carbonation. Extremely drinkable and tasty."
Pours nice yellowish orange with nice head. Very piny smell that hits you quick. Taste is extremely smooth and hit you with a big pine taste at the end. Very nicely put together but may be a little overhyped. Still a world class beer but maybe I'm not a huge fan of that much pine taste.
Bottle poured into Free the Hops snifter bittled 12-26-12 drank 1-19-13. Not as fresh as i would like but lesa than a month
"Thanks to a friend from California I was able to try this super fresh! Bottle was dated 1/4/13, drank it on 1/16/13. I have had it before, but it was about 2-3 months old so I thought I'd try it again fresh before I really made up my mind. "
Bottle from 12.27.12. Consumed 1-13-13. 
Bottled (12/27/12) into lawson's sniffer
"Oh Pliny...the benchmark of all IPAs. It is fresh, it is piney, it is bitter, it is well, worth it! Some say its over-hyped, some say its the best beer in the world. I say it is the best rounded out IPA you could ask for. "
"The easier to find, gentler Pliny. Great taste, STRONG like bull, awesome finish. The best way to enjoy it is AT Russian river on a hot day, followed by a dip in the waters... Plus, the guys at the brewery are awesome. If they have any of the younger, don't let it pass you by"
"Fresh in trade from IBrew2or3. Thanks! Bottled 12/27/12, drank 1/11/13. Decided to make this my 50th DIPA tried. Pours a nice golden color with one finger head. Aroma comes off this thing like heaven. Floral pine notes abound, with a zesty citrus on the nose. Thr flavor is a piney orange bite with a lot more body than I had expected. Citrus aftertaste balanced nicely with the malt backbone that still highlights that great hop flavor. Medium resiny mouthfeel. Very smooth. Hop candy for sure. Highly rated for good reason. I think there are a couple I like better in the style, but this is awesome."
"10 day old bottle. Pours clear copper with a finger of off-white head. Aroma is piney with notes of tropical fruit and a touch of funk. Flavor is big on pine, grapefruit and funk. Extremely refreshing while still being big on maltiness. Medium body, light carbonation and a dry finish."
"Got a chance at a bottle of this while at Martin's Gastropub in Palo Alto. They only had 14 bottles left and I hadn't tried it yet, so I snagged one. Right off the bat, I loved it. One of the best beers I'd had. This class of beers is currently my favorite class and this beer sits at the top of the class."
"Pours golden yellow with a decent head. Complex lacing left on the glass but head disappeared to a rim. Smells of piney hops. Taste is big piney hops, but somehow also balanced and not over the top. Citrus undertone may help to smooth the hops. Caramel sweetness up front turns to an excellent bitter bite on the back."
Fresh and poured from bottle into a chalice glass. 
"Pliny is a good Ipa, I look it as the best of the average and a baseline for a good ipa. Looks pretty clear and filtered, smells good with a nice body. It just doesn't come close to newer new england offerings."
Fantastic IPA poured from the bottle into a tulip stem glass. I was fortunate enough to have this in the same night as the Heady Topper and Harpoon Leviathan IPA. 
"Bottled on 27 December 2012, tasted/reviewed on 12 January 2013. Bottle poured into a tulip glass. "
"I've had this beer for the first time on tap at the Tornado gastropub in North Park, San Diego. "
I have had this beer bottled and on tap. Not much of a difference.
Appearance
"It's been a while since I had this beer. A friend brought one back last winter when he came home snowboarding. I won't go into a lot of detail because it's been so long, just the things that stuck out. The smell was amazing! I know lots of people talk about it but it was amazing. Sooo much Simcoe. As far as the hop taste, it makes it very evident that hop profile is more than just IBU's. Definitely big on Simcoe but I suspect Columbus, Centennial and maybe Cascades. I'm sure it died off a bit as it was almost a month and a half old when I had it but this was one of the only beers I have ever had where I started writing clone notes while I was drinking it."
"A- poured from bottle into founders snifter. Pours pretty clear, two finger white head."
Fabulous beer. Drove from Spokane to Seattle to try it and well worth the drive. Managed to bring one home with us. It's too bad they're no longer selling in Washington State. But I'm willing to drive to Oregon to try it again. Well done Russian River.
Poured from brown bottle with fresh date of 12/27/12 into tulip glass.
Poured into an oversided wine glass. 
Poured from a 16oz bottle on Nov 26
Appearance: A beautiful and perfectly clear light straw beer. Overly carbonated like a glass of champagne. Thick full light head that fades but leaves sticky foam rings with each drink.
500ml bottle served in a snifter.
"Not a new beer for me, as Pliny has been plentiful these last few months in Colorado (both on tap and in bottles), but I hadn't written about it yet, so, for the sake of adding to the list, here ya go:"
"I'm not going to do my usual review style for this because it has been reviewed to death already. However, I feel the need to document my experience in some fashion."
41 days after bottling. Poured into a SN flared glass.
"Pours an orangey apricot color, maybe peach. Not clear, not cloudy, something in between. The head is a finger thick and fleeting, mostly white. When all is said and done, it's a peach colored drink with a white ring around the top edge with a splash of lace."

Can't believe I got my hands on this stuff. Thanks to my buddy for giving me a bottle after a trip to CA. 
Served from a bottle in and 8oz Smuttynose glass. Shared with RoninTK3. Thanks Lymph!
This beer is flat out incredible. It is hard to believe that this beer comes in at 8% alcohol by volume. 
"A: Simple label. Not going to hold it against the beer in my scores, but almost feel like it could more 'Greek-epicish'. Pours a medium marigold, almost no head and minimal lacing on the top."
Appearance is brownish orange smells of citrus and pine slightly bubbly
Seductive is the best word for Pliny. In a world full of uncertainty Pliny is one of those constants it's always nice to come back to. 
A: Pours a bright and transparent gold with a huge white head thats slight rocky. Decent lacing. Looks great.
"Came across this at Perry's in Livermore, CA while out west on a business trip."
510ml bottle poured into a pint glass. Thanks to SanFranJake for this opportunity!!
"Had this on-tap at Teresa's Next Door in Wayne, PA approximately 2 weeks ago (which is the only way to get it in Pennsylvania). Have also had it two other times from bottle."
Special thanks to litheum94 for this long time want of mine. bottled on 11-26-12 so this is fresh!!
"510ml (?) bottle, 14 days old - fresher than I would ever really have expected. As I was approaching my 2500th review, I was at a bit of a loss as to which beer would be (potentially) worthy enough to mark this particular signpost of mine. Lo and behold, and damned near out of the blue, comes this early Christmas present, from the good DoktorZee - many, many thanks! Into my Laughing Dog Yankee pint glass this goes, in honour of my first bastion of hoppy indoctrination."
"Finally got to try this one thanks to Johnny Ramirez. Can't thank him enough! This has been on my wants list as long as I can remember. Pours a perfect amber color with amazing clarity - something not necessarily expected from a DIPA. Very clean looking with a long-lasting head, super white, thick, and foamy. "
A: Pours a clear gold/orange with medium eggshell head. Nice lacing.
"A: The beer is clear orange to yellow in color and has a very slight amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a half finger high head that died down and left a large patch of bubbles in the center of the glass, a collar of large bubbles around the edge and some delicate lacing in between."
Appearance - Golden rod with a white head
"Bottled 11/1/12, so a little over a month old."
"Bottle date 112112, bought it at Russian Brewery "
"Freshie bottle purchased at Hollingshead Deli when I was in CA (Orange) last week. Bottle is dated 11/26 and today is 12/5. I drank more than my share of Pliny while I was physically in CA. Some bottle, some draft. This is my last one that I brought home here to MA. Bottle poured into Hill Farmstead stemware. "
18 oz bottle bottled on 11/21/12 poured into a tulip pint glass. 
My favorite IPA of all time.
"Had on recent trip to Stone Brewery in San Diego. Initial appearance is a decadent hazy gold with foamy white head and excellent lacing. Aroma is simple--hop forward with classic grapefruit and piney notes. Exactly what I was anticipating. Taste is the same. Wonderful balance of hops, citrus, and malt. Great finish transitioning from the sweetness of the malt to the hop bite at the end. Medium body with good level of carbonation. Unbelievably easy to drink for the style (had 4 that day) and well balanced. A fantastic offering from Russian River."
"Boy, am I excited about this one. We ended up in San Diego for Thanksgiving this year, and being so close to the Russian River Company, I just had to track down a bottle of this. This beer is VERY rare, but not as rare as Pliny the Younger. That beer, from what I hear, is only available at the brewery and is only available a few times a year. But this beer is bottled, but is also rare. I didn’t realize that until I started calling around. I called BevMo! first, and was informed they don’t even carry it. I started calling liquor stores around the area (we were in La Jolla) and found a really small wine shop that had two bottles left. It was 10 miles away, but we went to find it and grabbed the last two bottles."
"510ml bottle, born into this world on 10/23/12, so about a month old."
Had on tap in pint glass.
This was previously a had for me. I thought it was time to give it a full rating.
"Beer snob is what this beer usually is what we are called when you talk so highly of this beer. Well, I am a beer snob and this beer helped create the title. Full flavor, very clean finish. It bites but than smooths like butter. It is actually a little strange. The fruit makes it sweet but hops make it bite. This beer stands out from your centennial, cascade blast of most. It is full of love! I never give a five! Hint of fresh juice and maybe a sweet flower. Simcoe maybe but just enough. The malt could be thinner for color but I love the power so I am just fine with it. Fresh beer! To say the least."
"After fearing that I'd never have this, my brother-in-law scored a bottle and split it with me. It was poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint. With a beautiful crystal clear rich golden appearance, there was a frothy one finger head, a little bit of lacing, and a constant stream of bubbles rising to the top. The nose was fruit, grass, resin, bread, malt, and hops. Taste was awesome. It had a wonderful sweet malt profile which seamlessly gave way to a massive hop bomb on the finish. The mouthfeel was very full and satisfying, with just the right amount of carbonation. I have never gave all fives to a beer before, but this one earned it."

"Stunning! Bottle brewed 10/23/12 and purchased last week at the brewery, having finally made a pilgrimage to Santa Rosa. Although this bottle can never compare with the awe at enjoying the first sip of a full pint during the brewpub's phenomenal happy hour, it is definitely the benchmark for this style and a world class beer."

"Bottled on 8/14/12...YES, I realize this probably should have been enjoyed sooner; ""hoppy beers are not meant to be aged"", yadda x3; I hadn't encountered a Pliny until some time in August having kept my eyes open (albeit somewhat passively) for a couple of years, and then I encountered and bought 3 within a 5 week period; I was trying to save this last one as long as I felt I should, and realized it's now 2.5 months from the bottled date."
"Drove two hours to get this and it was worth it. Im writing this the day after so details escape me, hower pliny the elder is a wonderful perfectly constructed IPA. What I will say is that it isnt overly distinctive, rather I found its real appeal in how well it was put together. Unlike Heady Topper or Double Citra which are wonderfully artful and unique beers, Pliny the Elder seems less creative yet amazingly thought out and well planned, like amish furniture. A perfect balance and of malt and hops, both playing off each other. Sort of a fusion east coast/west coast IPA. Good body, if maybe a little thin, and lively but not intrusive carbonation. Really just perfect. This beer doesnt stike me as being a centerpiece and while Heady Topper seems somehow more interesting, I dont think you could really do too much better than Pliny the Elder."
"This is my first review, and what a review it is! Not gonna lie, I'm kinda scared to even open this thing, but here we go. Bottled on 10/17/12"

"Pint bottle, just over a month after the born on date. Pours a nice three fingers of soapy, rocky head, which has excellent retention. Colour is a brilliant med gold, carbonation appears fairly light. Leaves plenty of delicate curtain lace and a thick soapy film that last till the end, perfect."
"Does it live up to the hype?No. I guess I'm the odd man out. The Emperor is wearing no clothes. Aroma is good, sweet and astringent, apricot/orange and orange peel.The appearance is fine. The taste is unbalanced. The bitterness bubbles too strong to the back of the mouth leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. The palate is fine. Overall for my taste, sweetness and bitterness should have been blended better. Being a new beergeek, I'm not that sophisticated yet, so I'll take a Dogfish Head 90 Minute over ""The Elder"" any day."
"I had heard so many great things about this beer, that I was possibly over hyping it to myself. All said and done it was a great tasting beer, but really wasn't what I had expected. The body was very thin in contrast to what I had expected. Great aroma and flavor, just very little malty backbone to support the aroma. Happy, but surprised"

Poured a 16oz bottle brought back from California into a pub glass.
My brother brought a case of this back from his trip to out west. There was almost too much hype around this one before i had a chance to try it. It didn't disappoint but it wasn't the best ipa I've ever had either.
"Thanks to user quirkzoo for this bottle, which was sent to me out in Hawaii for no other reason than being friendly. Much, much mahalo! Bottled on 09/10/2012 which was 50 days ago, as of this review."
A: This beer pours a beautiful clear golden body with a thick white head that quickly fades away.
Poured from a 16oz bottle into a snifter. The bottle was just shy of three weeks old according to the bottling date.
A Nice color and white cap lacing.
Heard from the Newman at Olive Tree Market that these were coming in for the weekend so I was on the lookout - scored the last 2 bottles from Baron's Market for $5.99 each and poured them into a Thirsty Bear branded .5 liter glass.
"Great beer, just enough hoppyness to get a great after taste. I would recomend this beer to anyone who is into IPA's or even just starting to venture into IPA beers. This beer is on this strong side of ABV so beware , it might go down smooth but will creep up on you."
"Mostly clear, yellowish orange with a nice white head. Nice lacing down the glass. A very pretty beer."
"Fresh pears, pine, citrus...I had super high expectations and it delivered big time. Toronado (SF), poured a pint that I wanted to roll around in. A truly special beer. I've had some of the best IPA's out west having worked at a brewery in Portland, lived there, and traveled up and down the coast searching for that quintessential west coast IPA. This is in the top five without a doubt."
First of four growlers filled at the Russian River brew pub yesterday to a pint glass
You had this beer. 
Thanks to Chuglife for this want!!
"I had heard about this stuff for a long time. Then there was a charity event here in Charlotte where you would be poured a pint if you made a donation to a local soup kitchen, since it is not distributed here. Fabulous."
Fresh bottle picked up at the brewery. 10 days old.
"I traded a couple bottles of homebrew for a bottle of Pliny last night, and quite frankly, my friend got the short end of the stick. This beer is wonderful. "
"A few hours after I finished it, so not the most in depth or accurate review. I plan to come back when I open by next bottle."
Draft at Monk's Cafe in a pint glass.
"Pliny is by far one of my top favorite Beers! The color is perfect, pours excellent with a beautiful white creamy head! The nose is just amazing with it's citrusy, piney, earthy amormas with hints of herbs. The taste is nothing short of a hop party in your mouth! Starting of with sweet honey mixed with citrusy hoppy undertones moving into a multitude of barley and malts mixing with the taste buds in my mouth bringing me to the pinnacle of Imperial IPA ecstasy! 'nuff said! It's a real Hop Heads dream! Kudos Russian River! Cheers!"
"App:Golden, thin white head."
Had this last spring after I gave in to the hype and ordered two bottles. Poured into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. Fully stipulating that my review is jaded because of the expectations I had when trying it.
Poured into a Bells tulip. Driven back from Denver in a cooler. Bottled 9/10/12
Huge thanks to Tarheel4985 for this bottle. 500 ml poured into a snifter. Very excited to try this beer.
"Poured from a bottle into a large tulip glass, I first enjoyed this perfection in the Rocky Mountains of Denver, CO. I've never tasted anything like it. On top of the floral hops are hints of grapefruit and mango, so impeccably balanced one has to wonder what the secret is. I've heard that Heady Topper is superior so I put them head-to-head one night - pfffft, not even close, but to each his own."
You had this beer. 
"Pours a medium, crystal-clear shade of amber. Citrus/herbal hops hit the nose with a faint hint of malty sweetness. These notes continue into the taste with a surprising crispness added in. Drinkability is above-average for this kind of beer,"
Head was nice and it was consistent with the appearance. It maintained the head for an average amount of time
Big thanks to ehammond1 for sending me my first bottle!
"First of all, Pliny is not pronounced with a long ""I."" It's a short ""I"" like in ""tin"""
"On-tap at Apex in Portland, Oregon. Thanks to JA for buying - I'll get the next round, brother."
"Having heard so much about this beer, and being a big fan of Three Floyds, I had to get my hands on this one, to see if Pliny the Elder lives up to the hype... It is a wonderful beer!"
The 2000th Review of Pliny in the bottle! Geek moment. 
"Pours clear gold with nice 1 finger foamy snow white head that fades slowly, leaving a foamy layer on top and very good foamy lacing along the sides. Must admit I surprised at how basic this beer looks in a glass, but I can smell the hops from 6 inches away, so that made up for it."
"Had this tonight at Hamiltons in SD on tap. Have had it in a bottle and some home brew clones. On tap, it was very good. I was surprised since I wasn't too impressed with it in bottle. Nice mouthfeel, light amber color, very smooth, and explodes with hop flavor. Not as bitter on tap as I perceive in bottle. "
"510 ml bottle (dated 8-14-12, consumed 9-5-12) poured into a tulip."
Appearance – It pours a clear gold with a huge foamy head. The head sticks around and never goes away.
"Benn waiting to get my hands on this a while now, big thanks to APreacher for the trade!"
Bottled on Date: 07/25/2012
16.9oz bottle poured into a New Belgium globe. Bottled 3/5/13.
"This is my 2nd time tasting Pliny and I come away simply thinking that sure, its very very good, but if I was given it in a blind testing without knowing what it was I certainly wouldnt think ""this is one of the greatest things ive tasted in my life""... It seems on par with most really good IIPAs.. Making me thinking its high rating comes largely from fame rather than innate worth.."
A- Pours a clear gold with a huge foamy head. The head sticks around for a while and never really goes away. 
A: Golden clear with a nice 1 finger head.
Reviewed from notes. A big thanks to TCHopCraver for hooking me up with one of these!
"A - a little light in color. Just a little darker than most pale ales. One finger wide, white head, that leaves no lacing on the glass."
Served at Pete's Brass Rail & Carwash in Danville
Bottle on June 5 2012 into Duvel tulip. Approx 12 days old from bottling.
"Great, great ale. I love it and will definitely be trying it again.(too bad there is a one bottle only limit hehe.) well balanced IPA that has a fantastic citrus fruit smell/taste. I did try this at dinner(salad with steak strips/vinaigrette .) plus i opened a bottle of Stone's Ruination 10th anniversary which overall probably affected the drinking experience because the ruination was soooo strong. But i found this to be a fantastic beer. MUST HAVE"
"Oh Pliny, how many ways can I enjoy you? I picked up a growler on my last visit to Russian River and didn’t get to it until a few days later. Still holds up—despite what the jokers say about it falling off minutes after being brewed. This pours a crystal golden color with a great Pliny aroma. Some straw and grass but mostly orange zest dominates the scent. The flavor has an incredible hop bite and bitterness. Straw and orange peel, with a pronounced bittering midpoint and a dry zesty finish. I enjoyed this until the last drop."
500ml bottle thanks to DeanoMac. Bottled 8/1/12 (exactly 2 weeks ago). Poured into HF tulip.
"One of my favorites, this has been a long time coming. Bottle to tulip glass."
Thanks to Rob for acquiring this one.
"First off, huge thanks to brabuse430 for the ""extra"" in our last trade."
"Bottled May 4, 2012 (drinking 3+ months later)."
Poured from a bottle 4-Aug-12 on sunny clear 22C day while finalizing my home-brew equipment list and working in the garage.
Had this on tap at Belmont Station in Portland.
"I was lucky enough to try this brew at Choice City in Fort Collins on IPA Day. Not sure how fresh it was (presumably incredibly fresh as it was still flowing) but it lived up to the hype. Bottle, with some weeks on it make a big difference than fresh on tap."
"A - Golden and clear, pours with a bright white head that dissipates quickly. "
"A rare perfect 5! There's a reason for the hype. If you drink it fresh, there really can't be an IIPA better than this. That orangy color, that big fruty, hoppy smell, that rich flavor and surprising ease of drinking are unreal. Russian River is close enough where I can have one every now and then, but it's not sold in my state so often if I'm in the mood for a IIPA I have to look elsewhere. And as much as I love Hop Stoopid and 90-minute, they can't replace Pliny."
"It has a hazy golden appearance with a nice two finger white head. Once you drink it down a little, you see the nice legs on the glass."
"Hype is legit. Wonderful earthy hop smells, modest white head with excellent lacing. Great spice, low carbonation and perfect creamy mouthfeel contributes to an ideal balance. Dangerously drinkable but not to worry as the taste is long lasting. 8% ABV is lost in the robust and classic biscuit and caramel flavors. Gets smoother and creamier as it warms. Ruins the tastebuds for a lesser IPA. It's 3k mile journey to my table led to lofty expectations. In the end, Pliny delivered."
On tap in Denver:
"It is what it is. Much hyped, and much anticipated to drink when I received this bottle with care from the northwest coast. After taking the bottle out of my beer refrigerator, I allowed it to get to a bit above 50 degrees (I wasn't going to pair this with anything but tasty cheese, bleu and aged cheddar in this case). My wife happened to have made a nice salad of corn, cilantro, tomato, black and garbanzo beans etc. Anyway, the pour, a beautiful golden haziness. Vivid white fluffy head. The smell, as great as any other regarded IPA I've enjoyed (citrus/piney splendor). Artful lacing in the Chimay chalice used here. When I tasted this I immediately realized this is a benchmark brew. The balance is impeccable for a hoppy ale. Bitter sure. And the malt is there, but everything else is too and it is well, well done. Like I said a benchmark. Drinkability off the charts. If i have to pick one bottled beer that epitomizes quaffability, thus far this is it. I can only hope to vacation in northern CA soon in order to sample the Younger!! The only disappointment I had, and it's nothing that can impact the perfect scoring, is that I only have one of these! But then again that's all I need to realize PTE deserves the cult-like status it possesses. As a double IPA, everything is right-on."
Had my first Pliny ever. Got it through a trade on this forum and man am I glad I did. 
On tap at Monk's Cafe in Philly (6/25/12). Poured into a shaker pint.
"pliny the elder is an amazing beer. one of the best i have had it has magnificent color unbelieveable taste, the taste is very smooth probably the smoothest i have had it has a great mouthfeel i would love to try more beer from russian river to review them as well"
"Pours a beautiful, bright light orange with a 3/4 finger of soay lacing."
"Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle into a Duvel tulip. Bottled on June 14, 2012 printed on label. "
Bought a bottle from total wine and poured into a tulip. First time drinking from a bottle. Had it twice before on tap. 
"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a medium orange amber. Light head, but nice lacing. Fresh spicy hop aroma. Hops up front. Sweet malts, citrus and a hint of pineapple. You know there are some nice malts underneath, but they stay below detectable levels supporting the spicy hops flavor. A beautifully balanced IPA. Deserves top ranking."
"Bottle, shared with a couple friends."
Lucked out when a friend of a friend brought 12 bottles of PTE back from Colorado. I tried not to let the hype take over when I poured it into a heavy pint glass.
"A: Huge 2 fingers worth of head retention, a nice sharp golden color with high transparency. Retention is great with huge lacing. Thin film remains"
Finally able to try this in Santa Rosa at the RR brew pub on 7/20/14. 
"Bottled on 5-31-12. Picked up at the Brewery along with all the other ""Russian River to go"" beers."
Bottled 5/25/12
Appearance: Dark golden with 2 finger white head that stays. Bottle is very adamant about drinking this beer fresh.
"Poured from tap into pint at Falling Rock in Denver. Pours a hazy golden with thick white foamy head. Smell is fantastic! Sweet grapefruit and cotton candy with a tad blast of malts to finish. Taste is super bitter hop flavor but mixed with sweet cotton candy and pine notes. Its a little too bitter for me but its amazingly balanced. Overall, a truly amazing brew that does live up to its hype. Although I may like hopslam a tad bit more..."
"Pours a glowing pear/honey gold with a finger of sticky, stanky white head that dissolves to form a neat collar and spotty bits retaining in the middle. Slow needlepoint beading persists. A lovely glass of beer indeed."
"Got 4 of these in a trade. Very excited. Held off on the review because, to be honest, was completely underwhelmed. Let it age a little bit, even though the bottle says not to about 100 times. "
"Ok, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. This is a great freaking beer. Honestly, I'm not a hop head and don't rush for the IPAs. But, this is truly one of (if not the) best bottled IPAs you can get your hands on. On the tap, I'm not sure if I would rank this above Blind Pig, but RR obviously has the IPA gig down. Great, golden appearance with just the right carbonation. Wonderful, grapefruit nose with all the things you love about hoppy beers and none of the stuff that scares you away. Wonderful taste and mouthfeel. I could keep going, but what more can you say about perfection. Buy this when you can find it. You won't find a better IPA in a bottle."
Half liter brown bottle with a bottled on date.
It's hard not to penalize this one because it didnt quite live up to my unrealistic expectations but I tried to rate it on merit alone. I wont do a full review because i had it yesterday afternoon...It is an awesome beer no question. I was expecting life changing waves of flavor and it was more subtle balance. In the end if someone were to offer me a Pliny or a Dreadnaught I would kick them in the nuts and take both but if they were bigger than me and I had to pick one I would take Dreadnaught without a second thought.
Pours a light amber color with a small white head that dissipates and leaves some nice lacing.
4.99 for 1 pint .90 fl oz
"There is quite a bit of hype surrounding this beer and it is nearly impossible to get on the East Coast. My tasting notes: Rich amber, slightly cloudy with medium carbonation. Strong piney hops on the nose. Tastes crisp and pleasantly bitter, very refreshing; not overpowering like many other American double IPAs. 8% alcohol, but very smooth, no strong fusel notes. Extremely well balanced with pine and citrus notes dominant. One if the best beers I've had in a long time. If we lived where this is distributed, Pliny would enjoy an honored place in the beer fridge. Salud!!"
Rarely does a beer live up to the hype but Pliny not only accomplishes that but even exceeds it. Lucky enough to live in the only place outside California the distributes the kegs to bars. Had it for an early lunch (before it sold out) in a 12 oz. tulip glass.
Drank from the horse's mouth at Russian River Brewery during NoCal mircobrew vacation in Jul 2011.
"Hand delivered from San Diego to here by my good friend Dan, with whom it was split. Bottle poured into two Duvel artist series tulips."
Thanks to Brendan for bringing this surprise to an IPA tasting.
The bouquet is lovely and reminiscent of the best hoppy beer ever: Goose Island Imperial IPA (hallowed be his name)
Served just below cellar temp-&gt;Melbourne Bros. Stemware
"I think the hype of Pliney may have affected my first impression. I excepted fireworks works would go off and Bob Barker would scream out telling my i won a brand new car. At first i felt Pliney seemed like an average beer, but after a few sips i realized how balanced and perfect this beer is."
"A: Golden color, almost yellowish. Great pour. Not much of a head, it poured with a great quarter inch head, but made some nice carbonation after dissipating. "
7-3
A- Golden/amber colored body with a thin white bubbly head that disappears quickly.
"This is just an amazing beer. Even with all of the hype, I was not disappointed. I'm very impressed."
Reviewed from notes taken 4/21/12
Revisit: 6 Apr 16
"I tried Pliny the Elder courtesy of a great bartender in town. I was sampling beers to serve at my upcoming wedding. Honestly, I hadn't heard of the beer before coming to BA."
"The color of this beer is a beautiful golden translucent hue... if you've ever dabbled in homebrewing, then you know how difficult pure gold color is to achieve. an aggressive pour gave a thick 3-finger head and lacing all the way down the tulip."
"Strong, hoppy aroma has a strong overtone of grapefruit. Very grapefruit-y. It pours a clear amber with a respectable white head that leaves some good lacing. Flavor is - WOW! Very hoppy, mainly of grapefruit, hardly bitter with a hint of honey sweetness. Firm body is smooth and has plenty of fizz. No wonder this is so recherche."
"Had it on tap, now getting to have it via the bottle."
"Ok, just mowed the lawn...now for my just reward! Thanks Matt!"
500 ml bottle poured into pint glass. Bottled on 4/3/2012.
"As a person who lives in Minnesota Pliny the Elder is not available as easy and as often as I wish it could be. I was lucky enough to have some fresh bottles sent to me (as fresh as they can be) however I was even more lucky in early January to get a growler set to me the same day it was picked up from the brewery and delivered to me super quickly!!! I can still remember the huge pop of the 2L swing top growler. So from the grower into a tall pilsner glass the color was light orangy brown in color with a thin white head that disappears quickly. The smell is very big and hoppy and sweet. The taste is super balanced with the amount of hop and sweet. All this high ranked IPA are all so hard to rate because they all are so amazing, it's hard to decide which one is better."
Poured into a pint glass at cvm4's Yeti tasting. This was the warmup beer. And what a warmup it was!
Poured from 500mL bottle into Hess Willi Becher glass. Bottled on 05/16/12. Purchased for $6.99 from Holiday Wine Cellar.
"A - Hazy golden orange with a good sized white, foamy head. "
"A note: This beer was bottled 5/14 and I am doing this review just past midnight making it officially 5/19. The bottle says to enjoy it fresh, so I figured I will listen to it..."
"Because I'm drinking one a little out of date (bottled in February, it's now mid-May), I'd like to not put numbers in, but am forced to."
"Appearance – A clear, orange golden color. Medium white head, with very good lacing."
"Appearance: Looks like liquid gold. Bright, clear gold. Head is bright-white, chunky, creamy, and super sticky. Lacing is thick, and sticks around for a good bit. Leaves a small cap on the beer for the duration. Solid carbonation pulls from the bottom of the glass. It's missing some of the copper notes I would expect from the style, but damn if it isn't pretty."
"Poured into a standard pint glass, this double IPA showed off a murky orange/amber color topped with a firm, resilient off-white head that left clumps of lace down the glass. The aromas of pine needles and juicy grapefruits delivered a slap to the sinuses. Once getting past the pungent hops, I could make out a grainy malt aroma that added an added incentive to taste. "
"Bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a Holden straw color with two fingers of creamy off white head that lingers. Lots of lace as the head slowly dissipates. Smells of pine, grass and citrus fruits. Wonderful aromas, strong example of how a DIPA should smell. Taste is the same as the nose, bitter pony biogas lead the way followed by juicy citrus notes and flight biscuity sweetness. Finishes dry and bitter, perfect amount of carbonation, medium body. Pliny is an amazing beer, totally lives up to its reputation. Well worth grabbing a bottle or two even chance you get."
"Acquired in a trade from StevenT562. Poured from a 500ml. bottle into a Russian River tulip. Bottle date: April 30th, 2012."
Brother was lucky enough to have one bought for him by a friend. I made sure to sample half the bottle! amped to drink this beer i've heard so much about.
Gift package from a friend in San Fran. Was included with some other Russian River brews.
I couldn't care less for the appearance of any beer. I take that back. If it looks like chunky Kombucha I may have an issue. 
"Pliny the Elder (bottled 3/19/12) poured into an etched Allagash cervoise, consumed on 4/9/12. Big up Travis for this gem! And Finch the beer guy in Huntington beach!"
500ml bottle served in an oversized wineglass. bottled 08-25-10. (big thanks to my wife for fetching the long awaited PtE from california.)
Bottled on 4/3/12.
"Pours a slightly hazy dark orange color with a white head, which after a minute settles into an almost clear appearance. The aroma is full of citrus, some floral notes, and some sweet notes like tangerine/orange, nice and crisp, mostly hops in the nose. The taste is pretty amazing, some of the bitterness can be strong on the first taste but once the malts catch up on the tongue, by the second taste it settles in to be incredibly balanced with sweetness. The malts are nice and caramally (is that a word?) with maybe some breadiness to them. The hops are strong in citrus flavor. The body of the beer falls pretty inline with other double IPAs as a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. "
"Aroma is a nice subtle tangerine base with hints of grapefruit. It's not underwhelming, and it's not over the top, it's absolutely divine!"
Ticking a pretty big want. Thanks to tripelhops for getting me this bottle. Bottled on 4/17/12.
"From: CE, from Colorado, much thanks"
I picked up my bottle at the brewery so it is fresh. Poured it into a Russian River pint glass. It pours a beautiful golden with a half finger head. The head is nearly white and lingers shortly.
A: clean and clear.
Had this at the brewpub. Tastes very hoppy with a bitter finish that attacks your tongue nicely. Lots of citrus and grapefruit notes. I love how these California beers give me hop burps. the alcohol is well hidden in this one too. This is a top quality iipa.
Received in trade. Bottle dated the end of March 2012. 500ml bottle poured into a pint glass.
You had this beer. 
Re-review. Had this beer many times. 9 day old bottle.

Review from notes on 4/28/12. Bottled on 4/3/12. 
A - just beautiful. Light golden color with just a perfect 1/2in of head. One of the prettiest beer colors I've ever seen. 
"I've had Pliny on tap, from a bottle and a growler which is the same as tap I guess. Anyhow, on tap is the perfect blend of freshness, coolness and taste. It encompassed everything you want in a beer; taste, high ABV and did I mention taste? Perfection in a glass. The color is a beautiful orange with a bouquet of hops. The taste is a perfect balance of well, just about everything. ""Just get it""."
A buddy of mine brought me back a bottle on his brewery tour out in Cali. Needless to say I was very excited to try this little gem. I had had it once before on draught out at the Lagunitas Skunk Train Event off of a cold plate at a revelers camp site and remember it being phenomenal!
Finally had Pliny The Elder on-tap at the Neighborhood in San Diego. 
"On tap at the brewpub, served in a pint glass"
A- Golden orange with medium density sticky head.
"Ahhh the holy grail of IPA's, finally a chance to try. Poured from 500ml bottle into large pilsner glass. This is pretty fresh as it was bottle last month."
"after years and years and years of waiting for this one and reading the heavy hype, my new beer drinking girlfriend sourced 2 bottles of this for us. apparently she called all over denver and finally hooked it up at mr. b's liquor. thank god she did. this mythical beer pours a slightly cloudy honey orange color with a one inch bone white head that has excellent retention. the smell is amazing, really tropical hops. im picking up passion fruit, clementines, and something even more intense like a pau pau or a mango, im not quite sure, but its all from the hops. makes me think there is nelson sauvin in here, but i cant confirm that, similar profile though. flavor has all the same hop essences, but is rounded out with a crackery seedy malt flavor that lays just under the hops, which arent in any way overbearing and bitter. this is really sensational. mouthfeel would be a 6 out of 5 if that was a choice, it is light feeling and smoothly creamy despite its squarely medium body. its got this perfectly made richness of feel when its held in the mouth, it gets foamy and huge and cloud-like. well carbonated but not like soda pop, its more tame and gentle, different vibe totally, but equally bright. quite a surprisingly dry finish, but appealing in this context. the aftertaste is legendary, hanging on forever. forever. every tastebud on my tongue is firing, bitter ones are dancing up front, sweet ones are tickling me in the back, and fruity like the islands somewhere in between. my inner beer geek is just brimming with accomplishment and radiating joy. this is fucking excellent. worth every dollop of hype, i cant wait for my next go!"

"Very excited to have had my sister ship me three of these from Cali to Florida. Date on these is 4/3/12, today is 4/18/12."
"Pours a light copper color with a small white head and good lacing. Aroma is all about citrus and pine hops and a bit of caramel in the back. Taste is caramel malts with loads of hop flavors mostly citrus, grapefruit and pine. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation."
Finally got my hands on one of my hoppy white whales. Pliny The Elder looks the part of a proper IPA. A crystal clear copper body is topped off by a couple of fingers worth of thick bone white head. Head eventually settles to a ring. Plenty of lace is left coating the glass in its wake.

"Bottle share in Hoboken, NJ."
Lemme tell you a story.
pours a merky golden in color with a nice white head decent retention and good amount of lacing left behind.
"Bottled 4/3/12. Head is slightly too thin for a 5, but otherwise a beautiful beer. Pale malts leave this beer a lovely straw color. Aroma is crazy dank herb, light citrus notes. Hop party on the tongue, malt stays the hell out of the way, like it should for a west coast DIPA. Nice moderate carbonation throughout. This truly is a world class beer deserving of st acclaim!"
"Was really looking forward to this, especially on tap."
"Pours a copper golden color with a huge, fluffy, white head. The head seems to have a life of it's own and taunts the would be consumer with contempt. It's like a watched pot that never boils. I've never seen a head retain so well. You think you're taunting me beer? Well, guess what, I'm reviewing you on BA, so I've got time. In keeping with the theme of this weekend past, the bouquet is as if a golfer at Augusta National had missed the fairway and ended up in the pine straw. While he waited for his partner to hit his ball, he dropped the big, juicy grapefruit he was eating into the pine straw. Hints of biscut malt come through as well. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for this style. The oilyness is very pleasing and complimentary to the flavor/aroma. This is a masterfully balanced IPA. Everything works together to deliver a whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts experience. It not only involves, it demands the attention of your sight, olfactory, taste, and tactile senses. Pine up front, then some orange citrus, and finishes with some grapefruit. Just a wonderful beer."

"Picked up a bottle about 20 minutes ago, in Orange County. Bottle date 03-20-12. Fresh. First review for this, but i've had it before many times. Message me if you need help getting some, because we have it every week at several places down here."
Big thanks to Matt (Crawbee87) for sending me a few RR goodies. This happens to be my last bottle of Pliny. Bottle dated 3/5/12. 
Not sure I understand the wild obsession with this beer.
"Rated this beer a couple years back, now time for a full review. 16.9 oz. bottle from Craftshack. Bottled on 5/21/2015, imbibing on 6/16/2015. Into the Sam Adams perfect pint glass it goes. Crystal clear yellowish-gold with a one finger head. The smell is not as pungent as I remember, but still great stuff. A plethora of tropical and citrus fruits with a hint of the onion/garlic component found in many of my favorite DIPA's. I could sit and enjoy the aroma for quite some time, but on to bigger and better things! Taste is moderate hop bitterness up front followed close behind with all the fruits mentioned in the aroma. There's also a bit of pine and herbal notes here. Sturdy malt backbone supports all the hops nicely, and that's where this beer really shines. It's perfect balance. Not overly carbonated, enhancing flavors and drinkability. Dangerously drinkable in fact, and more than one of these will get me talking to my ancestors. Not as heavy as many other DIPA's and I like that quality. Perfect lacing rings around the glass at the finish. I am one of the believers of the hype surrounding this brew, and it is a treat to score a bottle of this."

A: It had a very clear and yellowish golden hue to it with little to no head which diminishes quickly.

"I am lucky that Pliny the Elder is very available in my area. I like to find the subtle yet nice changes from batch to batch. I always get excited to see the new dates on each bottle so I can compare this glass to my last. All in all, RR puts out a consistent and high quality beer here."
"App: Fizzy yellow beer in color, eggshell white head, foamy with good retention."
A: golden with a thin head
"This bottle is 12 days old. Possibly the freshest bottle of commercial beer I have ever tasted, and how fitting it would be my first taste of Pliny the Elder. Yes, after years on BA and hundreds of beers, the time has finally come for me to taste this beer. This is one of the 5 most hyped beers in recent craft history. Poured into a tall, antique Czech pilsener glass that easily swallows the entire bottle."
"Flawless, golden color that is as deep as it can be before it starts to move towards bronze. Could retain its head just a bit more. Smell is great, nothing but a one-stop education in American hops with their citrus, pine, and resin, but its strength is also its weakness; I feel like there could be more depth to the hop bouquet. I don't believe DIPAs need to be one dimensional on the nose, since in my opinion the best ones certainly aren't when it comes to flavor. Taste is a perfect balance of towering hop bitterness on a firm malt foundation, not too sweet, not too dry; while this is obviously a thoroughly bitter beer, the rest of the elements keep it in check and prevent it from overwhelming the palate. Goes down nice and smooth, just a little overcarbonated, but that isn't an entirely a bad thing as it kept my pace more toward where it should be. Overall, an absolutely stunning beer, a must-have, not the undisputed greatest double IPA I've ever had, but it is certainly fairly high up on the list."
"Approximately 2 months old, I know some people would toss this little guy in the trash...but I think it'll do the trick."
Served in a pint glass at Toronado in San Francisco. 
Bottle dated 2/13/12. Poured into a tulip. 
The heavens opened and filled my pint glass on glorious tap.
"Living in Texas we have no chance of getting PLINY (Elder). So, I have waited for months to get my hands on one and after a trade with a friend in Colorado I finally got one. The anticipation from all the hype made it feel like a present and me a little kid on Christmas day. I just wanted to stare at the mythical green and red label. Finally I opened it, poured it and took my first smell and drink. WTF? Who thinks this is the best ""bottled"" IPA there is? I was severely underwhlemed. Instead of fireworks and heavenly harps playing in my head I rattled off 5 local IPA's that blow this one out of the water. BUMMER MAN!"
"Not sure the hype of this beer. Seems most people are willing to kill to get their hands on such a mediocre beer. It's supposedly a double IPA, but in my opinion lacks the hoppiness to be even called a West Coast Style IPA, less that of a DIPA. The smell is reasonable, the taste is just ok. For the money and availability of this beer, the number of other beers outweigh any reason for me to enjoy this product. The color is nice, but that's hardly an achievement. If I could get this everyday, I could rate it higher."
"Just had PtE for the first time after reading all of the hype. Purchased a half dozen bottles from Del Mar Wine Company in San Diego, Ca."
You had this beer.

"I really enjoyed old Pliney. I love in the midwest so, it was a nice treat to get my hands on a couple of these... theyre rare. Fortunately, a buddy of mine sampled too many beers at cincybeerfest a couple weeks ago and decided I was in greater need than he, and gave me his last two bottles.."
"A: Very nice transparent, clean looking beer. It is a lighter shade of amber, with a white fluffy head. Perfect head, perfect lacing."

"At Belmont Station, side-by-side with Younger"
"Picked up some fresh bottles Friday along with some Blind Pig. Pours a beautiful light orange with a perfect creamy white head. The nose is very fresh, hops and citrus in perfect balance. The flavor follows on key,bitter hops off set by gorgeous grapefruit and tangerine flavors. The mouth is very clean, a balancing act of weight and crispness, perfect. Another great batch of Pliny."
"I got this at the Total Wine and Liquor in Tustin, CA. They had ONE case and it was ONE bottle per customer."

Just had a fresh bottle of this bottled 1/19/2012. I drink this frequently and just thought I would quickly review my favorite beer.
"App: Crystal clear, golden color, fluffy white head, good retention and lacing. Tiny bubbles rush to the surface as you work your way through the glass."
"scored a few bottles recently from ipa247. Jeff - you are the MAN. I still hate dook w/a passion, but you rock."
"Got a couple bottles of it and I can say I was a little disappointing for such a critically acclaimed beer. It had a beautiful golden, slightly brown appearance. Lacing seemed to be lacking on the glass the first bottle but the second it stuck on very well, though I was using a wine glass since I was at a friends house. I also was not able to pick up much of an aroma and I was not the only person of the group to feel this way. While it does emit a citrusy and slighyt sweet aroma I feel it should have been a little more pungent. Also I found it to lack the hoppiness I would expect to find in an Imperial IPA. It is a little bitter and has a light mouthfeel. I really did enjoy the beer and would definitively drink it again, in about 5 minutes when I open up another."
Served in a tulip glass. Poured an amber-orange transparent color with a foamy white head. Good retention and nice lacing.

In the mouth it's pine with a touch of citrus, but mostly pine finishing with a lovely hop bite. Very mellow mouthfeel. I could drink this forever! Amazing beer if you can get it."
Thanks to hophead247 for my first Pliny and also which happens to be my first trade. Been looking forward to this for a long time. 
Sharply hoppy aroma on this one...a fight between grapefruits and floral notes going back and forth. Seems to be a solid mix between the two. Very nice.
thanks to cardinal79 for including this as an extra. 12/07/11 bottle date
"Poured from a bottle dated 1/3/12 into my Sierra Nevada Tulip. The pour produced a large, creamy, 4 finger head. The head dissipated very slowly as I consumed it, leaving behind a ton of thick lacing on the glass. It had a very nice aroma, though a tad understated (I was expecting more in this area). I could smell That being said, the smell had some citrus and pine notes to it. The flavor was great. A nice amount of hop bitterness. The beer finishes very dry and the alcohol is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is amazingly smooth. Not sure that I have tried anything with this type of mouthfeel. "
Bottled on 01/03/12 and served in a tulip.
Appearance: Very good amber color with a thin head and great lacing.
"The key here is the smoothness. Big hop flavor, but somehow it does not have the bitter after taste. It is truly harnessing the hop flavor but ditching the major bitter taste. I guess this is called balance."

Reviewing the infamous Pliny the Elder from Russian River Brewing Company. This is universally hailed as one of the top ten beers in the world by beer connoisseurs and is only sold in California. This is my first experience with the brew and the brewery. Thank you BeerAdvocate user LieutenantSours for hooking me up with this one!
Nice orange color with a beautiful white head
"This has got to be one of my favorite beers of all time. I first tasted it at the brewery in Russian River land (after visiting a farm where we picked fresh hops). The place was packed, they had a ton of beers on tap, but I went straight for the Pliney. The aroma was identical to the fresh hops we had picked and was blown away after tasting it."
"The color is pretty standard but what stands out is the nice fluffy white head, its about 2 fingers width and lingers for a while then it leaves very nice lacing with each drink. This is one of the best smelling beers I have ever had absolutely huge piney aroma that smacks you in he face then a hint of some citrus. Taste follows the nose perfectly huge pine flavor right off the bat then some citrus and finally just a touch of sweetness from the malt. I wish there was a touch more sweetness to this but still its pretty outstanding. Mouthful is good for me its thin compared to other DIPA beers that are out there, and the carbonation is on point. This is a great beer I wished we could get some in Indiana at a price point of about $5 for a little over a pint I think this would be a great once a week beer to grab off the shelve if you could."

Pours a solidly beautiful orange with a slightly off white head.
"Grabbed a few bottles of this when I was in Seattle, fresh off of the delivery truck!"
"first had this in PA 3 years ago - struck me as unique: light gold in color, very crisp, very dry, like hopped champagne... fast forward to recently - second and third times trying it: at Monk's Cafe in Philly and at Russian River 3 weeks later - both tasted virtually identical yet quite different from that first time - could've been a hoax, although they had 3 other RR beers that first day which all matched up in later tastings.... anyway.... my thoughts on the recent sips...."
I just don't get the hype. There are plenty of other IPA's out there that I would rather drink. I wouldn't turn it down but having a choice I'd try something else. At 8% I want a little more body. I love the smell but the taste doesn't really follow through for me.
"A: Shimmering golden, with a crisp whit head, exactly the way an IPA should look. Picturesque"

"I'm not going into details because it has been done in the other million reviews, but I will say that I feel this may have deserved its 100. Its hard for me to rate an IPA after having so many but my first drink made me literally say ""Oh my God"" out loud. and I didn't want to take my last drink because that meant it would be over. That seems like something that deserves a 100. Awesome. Just awesome."
trade from ThaFATkid - thanks!
A - Pours a beautiful copper orange color with a nice frothy one finger eggshell head. The head does dissipate rather quickly but comes back rapidly when you disturb the beer. You can see both really nice carbonation as well as a little alcohol clinging to the side of the glass. Beautiful beer!
Consumed @ Hamilton's most of the time. 
"Pliny the elder was the first craft beer I had that made me fall in love with beer. It has a nice golden/amber color and nice thick creamy head. It has very citrusy aromas with grapefruit on the forefront. I have tried many other Dipa's since trying Pliny to better understand the style. Compared to 90 minute, sculpin, hop stupid, panzer wolf, dreadnaught, lagunitas sucks, and ruination none compare to Pliny and for that we must respect it. I am doing this review on Christmas day and I'm looking forward to the new year and February when the younger comes out (never had it). I am very fortunate to live in Sonoma county with Russian River so nearby. Happy holidays!"
A - Dark gold. About what you wold expect to see in a DIPA. Stronger head resilience then most.
"Bottle from Chuck’s into my Duvel Tulip. 12/02/11 batch. Pours somewhat murky golden orange with three fingers of white head. Smells of pine, grapefruit, hops, resin. It’s not intrusively bitter, but you can sense the hop presence. Smooth, crisp, refreshing front. Grapefruit citrus middle. Pine finish. Remarkably complex, and sits on the palate very well. Very well done IPA, certainly up there among my favorite. It’s an experience to say the least."
"I know, right? Another great review of Pliny the Elder. I would say Russian River has earned it!"
"This is the beer that got me hooked on craft beer several years ago. Naturally then, it should be my first review. I can't add much more than what's already been said; this is a great benchmark for what an American IPA should be. The smell, taste, and feel of this beer are all outstanding. The first time I tried it, I described it as tasting a bit like a forest. A lot of earthy hops balanced with a nice malt background give it a complex flavor. It's very smooth and inviting, and you definitely don't taste the alcohol, which at 8% can catch up to you quickly."
"On tap at the Russian River brewbub in Santa Rosa Dec 22. Poured a deep amber, they actually handed it to me with out much head, but great lacing. Fantastic citrus pine hop aromas matched by the outstanding grapefruit, citrus pine taste. For me the mouthfeel was the most impressive aspect - how are they able to get such a juicy hop finish with it being so very dry at the same time? I was somewhat skeptical with all the hype, but this one (and every other RR beer I tried) was wonderful."

Had this beast on tap at the Falling Rock Tap Room in Denver Colorado. Came so close to the heady topper but fell just short at my #2 favorite DIPA. That is meant to take nothing away from how amazing this beer is.

"The cap came off and I was treated to what I can only describe as heaven in a bottle. No other beer has ever had such a wonderful aroma to me as Pliny. I poured this magnificent brew into a sniffer glass and was rewarded with a medium golden colored brew that gave a fingers worth of fluffy white head and good lacing. The well balanced aroma's of citrus, grass and pine pleasantly greet your nose. The taste is amazing, the crispness of citrus was perfectly balanced with a strong malt backbone that left a slightly sharp aftertaste on the tongue. Despite having a relatively high IBU count and above average ABV, this beer is extremely drinkable. I can't help but think, this is the perfect DIPA!"

Have this on tap every time i go to falling rock tap house. The smell is just floral and fruity with pine and pot smells to it. Looks like a golden hazy cloud with great lacing to the glass. The taste is smooth as anything on the market with the mouth being full body. Top three IPA/DIPA in the us. cant beat the price at 5 a pint either
"First of all, I would like to thank Callmecoon for sending me several fresh bottles of this incredible beer, you're the man. Secondly, I am a diehard Imperial Russian Stout fan and I never thought that I would find an American Double/Imperial IPA that I would enjoy until I tasted Russian River Brewing Company's Pliny the Elder. All I can say is WOW and what an outstanding beer! From the very first sip I feel in love with Pliny the Elder. The aroma and taste (fresh grapefruit) is truly something to behold and I am really impressed with this DIPA to say the least."
This bottle is seven weeks old-going to try to secure a super fresh one in a couple months and plan to re-review! Bottle poured into a DFH Signature Glass.
Some pals of mine were awesome enough to bring this home for me from the States without me even mentioning how great it would be if they did. Champions. Had a pint or two of this on tap at the brewery about 2 years ago and adored it. This bottle is about 3 weeks old. 
I gave a simple 5 out of 5 a few years ago when I first tried Pliny. Part of that may have been my lack of exposure to world class IPAs and part of it may have been the allure of obtaining this hard to obtain beer. To that end this beer holds up to my original rating and below I reflect on my latest experience.

"It is a magical moment in the WoodBrew household during this TG holiday....my bro-in-law brought a bottle of Pliney the Elder back from his summer trip out west. The beer pours a pale straw color with thin white head that is lacing. The smell is fresh hop with pine foundation, in addition there is some caramel malt undertones. The taste is very balanced between malt and hop...very smooth. Once the drink goes down a pine followed by grapefruit finish on the pallet. The mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall the beer is fantastic."

"Really, I can't add much to what's been said. I had this last year and wanted to say it's the measuring stick other Imp IPA's are compared to. Too bad for them. If you haven't tried it, find it. I pray Russian River continues to make this beer, call them, beg them."
A - Pours a nice two finger off-white head. Crazy amount of bubbles in the golden body. Head sticks around. Some strong lacing.

"After so many reviews, no beer is perfect"
On tap at the Hulmeville Inn for the Russian River & Taco Bonanza Event
"It has a huge creamy head with a lot of lacing. The hops jump out in the aroma as well as grapefruit, honey, and pine. I was expecting a bigger punch from the hops. Instead it's quite balanced. Good hop bitterness throughout but not overpowering at all. Nice tones of grapefruit, a honey warmness from the alcohol (8%). For an IPA it's creamy as well. Honestly, for such a big IPA, it's extremely drinkable. It finishes very cleanly with just a bit of bitterness on the tongue. And an earthy exhale of pine and clove."
"Clear golden slightly orange coloring with a solid, slightly rocky head that follows with a good lacing. Fruity nose (pineapple, orange, grapefruit) with slight floral undertones. Medium body with light carbonation. Great balance with hop sweetness out front and a dry finish. Excellent all around!"
I find myself staring at the last two inches of PtE in the glass and quite frankly I don't want to finish it because I realise I ain't gonna be in this position again in the near future....
"Just arrived today in a trade from ales4baldo, thanks Baldo, cheers!"
A - Poured a clear gold color with a pure white head on it.
Much thanks to TicoCali for the trade. Very excited.

A - Pours a translucent gold with a decent white head
"16.9 oz bottle, just arrived in a box from Tim today. Bottled 10/25/11, so its right at 3 weeks old."
Thanks to some awesome friends for letting me taste this gem. Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass.
A: Golden and crystal clear with one finger head that slowly fades with nice lacing
A: Beautiful golden color. 2 plus fingers of creamy white head. Lots of lacing. Tons of lasting power to this head. Can't imagine a better looking IPA (given that there are a lot of DIPAs that look just as good).
A: A medium golden yellow with a pearl white two finger head that hangs around for a good amount of time.
Just add me to the long list of Pliny lovers...
Thanks to ThaFATkid for sending this west coast jewel to me here in ``Kentuckiana''.
This review is for a growler of Pliny purchased right from the brewery on Thursday 11/10/11. Poured into my brand new Russian River stemmed glass. I also had Pliny there on tap on Thursday and from a bottle earlier this evening and all three really seem to match up quite well.
One of my good friends and I lucked out this past week. I received a bottle of Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout and he bought two bottles of Pliny the Elder. We had the most epic beer tasting afternoon ever. We began with the famous beer from the Russian River Brewing company...
"1st review, ever—forgive the inexperience. Made it a Pliny, which I was excited to pick up recently. Bottled 10/25/11."
"A: Average look, no big deal there. Perfect carbonation got it a 4/5."
"Enjoyed on-tap @ Toronado in San Francisco, CA."
"Lives up to the hype which is rare. A citrus/grapefruit bomb, but nicely balanced and very drinkable. Very hoppy and definitely not a sweet DIPA, maybe a bit thin for a DIPA. IMO just a notch below 2008 Hopslam in overall greatness, and much better than the 2008/2010 Hopslam which IMO seemed a tad too sweet. The only problem is obviously distribution and freshness. I would guess most styles like this the hop hit would fade quickly, I'm sure a two month old Pliny wouldn't be as good as as 30 day brew. But by trade or by internet store a must try for any IPA lover, and reasonable too. If I lived in Ca I'd have year round it's that good. Sane ABV levels too."
"I'm lucky enough to have this at the packy a block away from apt, Le Beau."
A: Bright Golden to Orange in Color. Nice 1 finger head. Left lacing all the way down the glass.
"This is my 100th beer review, and I have to thank scottfrie for getting me the freshest bottle possible! Thanks for shooting me this great brew Scott. Bottled on 10/25/11 and poured into my Deschutes tulip... Cheers!"
My favorite IPA I've ever had. It is such an explosion of floral grapefruity notes and the hops just keep coming and coming with no bitter aftertastes. A pleasant sweet malty mouthfeel is also balanced in there. I live in Michigan so I have to always have the homebrewed version of this at all times in the keggerator. A++++
"Clear goldenrod body, whitish head. Rather a bit of lace."
Poured from the bottle into a schooner at my beer tasting club; as one would imagine this one was highly coveted and absolutely lived up the reputation. A gift from a business partner; we're all now best buds...:)
Poured into small snifter glass.
A - Pours a deep orange hue with a fluffy white one fingered head. Great lacing.
"The illustrious Pliny. Finally managed to get my hands on some of this. Just for full disclosure, I wanted to think that this beer is over-hyped and overrated. It isn't. "
"Many thanks to my friend Al from California for getting this to me. Bottled just about one month ago, so it's not exceedingly fresh but it's close enough. 6-7 oz. into my C&B tulip on Halloween 2011. "
Big thanks to Thafatkid for this one.
Wow thanks to vissai for my first chance at pliny! From my new favorite russian river growler
500ml bottle poured into my Ovila goblet. Yet another Cali IPA from my parents Halloween package. Bottled on 10/14/11.
Poured from a 500ml bottle to a Dogfish Head Snifter. Thank you Bdige!
Big thanks to Guy Forget from Truckee for hooking this one up! 
Everything about this beer is Exceptional all the way down the line. The best IPA/DIPA that i have ever had.
Probably reiterating all of the other posts but a Benchmark DIPA for sure..
Decided maybe I should get into reviewing again so starting with a good one. Picked up 3 fresh ones on my trip back to the parents place. 
"I have never been a fan of the insane IPAs brewed on the west coast (or anywhere for that matter), but this one is amazing. "
Served in a Sierra Nevada Imperial Pint glass
Poured a crystal clear gold with a full finger of frothy white head that stuck around a while and left a lot of lacing. Carbonation bubbles continued long into the glass.
Poured into a pint glass from a bottle.
Thanks again to McCafferty for the trade.
Bottled on 10/4/11.
Bottled one month prior to drinking (9/21/11 to 8/22/11)
Poured into pint glass after I made sure the temp was right.
Poured from a bottle dated 8/18/11 into a Duvel tulip.
"Received a 1 PINT .90 FL.OZ. (500 ML) bottle of this from mdvatab in a trade. Poured from the Forest Green bottle with Pliny the Elder labeled in a Red Circle & is bordered w/ sayings like ""PLINY IS A HISTORICAL FIGURE, DON'T MAKE THE BEER INSIDE THIS BOTTLE ONE"", ""CONSUME PLINY FRESH OR NOT AT ALL!"", & many more into my 0,4l New Belgium Oversized Snifter Glass. Has BOTTLED ON: 071911 on the side in a box & enjoyed during Game 1 of the World Series- STL vs. TX. Go Cards!"
Intro: I must say up front the review is from notes that were taken at the time of tasting. Posting the review is done much later. The “Bottled on Date” is 07/11/2011
500ml bottle poured into an imperial pint glass.
Presentation-Seems to be in a very simple labled bottle. Like how it refers to the freshness of the beer and makes a constant reminder to not age and drink as soon as you can. Freshness is key to this beer. 
"Bottle dated 9/21/11. Poured into a New Belgium globe. I've had this beer a few times in the past and an thankfull to have it again. Honestly, I didn't really care for it in the past, but it seems that I'm just in the mood for a good IPA this evening."
"The archetypal DIPA; got this from bstaffor today in a box for a BIF and wasted no time at all opening it up. Could not ask for more from the appearance. About 2 fingers of bright white head sits on top of a clear golden beer. Amazing lacing and extremely long lasting head. Aroma is very nice as well. Big grapefruit citrus hop bomb. Very clean, very grapefruit, very citrus. Taste is great as well, clean, pretty dry, very citrus hop forward, with a big bitterness that follows everything else. Very enjoyable. Screw balance, this beer is all about the hops. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for an 8% beer, with mid-high carb. Overall what a great beer. Not usually the biggest DIPA fan, but I have been looking forward to trying this for a long time. Damn good beer. Was looking for problems and flaws, but really couldn't find any."
"Remarkably clear with a sticky beige head. The nose is full of grapefruit hops. Spicy hops at first followed by pineapple, pine, grapefruit, and a chalky finish. A lingering malt sweetness, as well."
My first review has to go straight to the top. Luckily I found Pliny the Elder at a local shop and have been enjoying it for months now.
Bottle opened one month and a half after it was brewed : time to come to France and rest after its long trip from California.
"A very nice complexity of hops crammed into this beer, citrus, grapefuit and a hint of pine. Malt body is substanial, hinting toward syrupy, to carry the hops burden. Finish is a satisfyingly dense, lingering hops that grabs the back of the tongue with tenacity. ETOH is evident, but not hot or harsh."
Loads of thanks go out to n8dietz for picking this bottle up for me whilst in CO.
sampled 08-04-11 (bottled 06-29-11)
Served from a bottle poured into a tulip glass (46F). Bottled on 21 September 2011; served on 15 October 2011.
"Bottled on 9/16/11, opened on 10/14/11"
"Bottled 9-7-11, Consumed 10-11-11"
"Finally got to try this brew after a very long wait. I am a huge fan of IPAs and Double IPAs. After reading a little while ago that this was top in its class, it was a must. Very hard to find though since I am on the East Coast."
"Fresh Pliny, consumed last Friday. This was actually the first fresh Pliny I have recieved. Served in a New Belgium tulip glass. The Head and glass retention was perfect. The smell was piny and a little floral scent. The taste was phenomenal. Grapefruit, pine, and HOPs!! The abv very well hidden. It blew the doors off all the other Pliny I have had. Fresh Pliny is where it's at!! love it!! Thanks Riko for the extra!"
"Poured into a New Belgium globe. Perfect,golden cream colored frothy, silky head. It dissipates some, but leaves a thin yet frothy layer as it goes down. Massive sticky lacing on the glass. The smell is bold, a combination of pine and citrus, a very clean aroma that's not overpowering. I'll admit, i don't drink a lot of IPAs or DIPAs, but this beer is extremely tasty. Again, the pine, citrus, grapefruit flavors are all well balanced and work harmoniously. The mouthfeel is crisp, smooth, and for lack of a better word, perfect. Overall, I waited a long time to try this beer, and in fact I had to overpay for it on Ebay just to get it. To say that I was skeptical is an understatement, as this beer has reached mythical status. But I can attest to it's reputation, this is a fine, fine beer. I'll probably never have it again due to the price, but I'm glad I got to see what all of the fuss was about. I don't drink DIPAs usually, but surely, this one is King."
"Poured from bottle dated 9/21/11 into my RR-tion glass. This is not my first, nor my last Pliny thanks to Cisco619 and killer PA distribution (we get it on tap)"
"A. Very nice caramel color to it. There's a nice white, foamy head that leaves a ton of lacing. Basically opaque. "
"Bottled 9/16/2011, drank 10/8/2011"
Bottled 9/16/11 consumed 10/7/11
Picked this up and brought home in a checked bag from GABF in Denver.
"Surprised I haven't reviewed this, I have visited it many of times. This particular bottle was gifted by baybassboy after a weekend of beer drinkin and double haulin, thanks Mo."
On tap at the Russian River tasting room. 
I've had this beer several times both on tap and in bottle and have experienced quite a bit of variation ranging from the best IPA ive ever had to a slightly underwhelming (although still good) IPA.
"Another enormous thanks to cpferris for yet another kick-ass brew I don't have means of acquiring, except through extremely generous BA's. 500ml bottle with a 8/11/2011 bottling date, also lending itself to sport some pretty stern, yet comical warnings against aging this; I got to it as soon as I could."
I really don't see a point in explaining myself here. Awesome beer. I gave it a 4 on appearance because it looked too perfect. This beer is dry hopped to hell and it still looks like a crystal clear pilsner in the glass...
"A: Pours a clear golden amber with a great fluffy white head. Nice, thick lacing follows."
Three week old Pliny in a tulip.
"On-tap at Hops & Pie, served in a pint glass."
"Everyone raved, raved, raved, raved about this beer. Okay, I get it. "
A-pours a pretty golden color with little head. 
Bottled on: 9/16/11
"Bottled on 9/16, poured into my Pints for Prostates pint glass on 10/1, now that's fresh. Respect hops, consume fresh it says on the bottle, OK, this one's not leaving Denver."
Bottle served in a tulip.
"A- pours a yellowish orange with a quarter an inch of foam. Great retention, decent lacing"
"Living in Michigan, Pliny The Elder is not an easy thing to come by. Thanks to some maneuvers, I've had about a dozen. I was apprehensive at first, given all the hype, but I have to say this one lives up to it."
500ml bottle dated 9-21-11 into Duvel tulip
Bottle dated 9/21 consumed 9/30.
"Enjoyed from the tap at Stone’s bistro inside some stemware. I’ve tried this beer twice from the bottle and rated it less than favorably (well, compared to everyone else). Having been heretofore unimpressed, I’m excited to see what a difference a tap and guaranteed freshness can make. "
quite simply this is the best dipa i've ever had. This beer lives up the hype and more. 
I've been a fan of ipas for awhile now and after having this beer it has set a whole new standard for me as far as ipa's go. Pliny and ruination are my top two favorite beers. Pliny has the lead a little because sometimes ruination can have a little bit to much bitterness to it. love the color of this beer pours a nice clear burnt orange and the hop scent for it is spot on perfect. because of this beer I now know that simcoe hops are the bomb and I'm always on the hunt for beers that have that piney simcoe taste.
Fresh Pliny is out of this world. Definitely one of the best DIPAs around. Pours a medium amber color with sticky white head. Aroma explosion of citrus and pine. Straight dankness all around. Fruity and piney with a sweet malt backbone on the tongue. Hop profile marinates and lingers. Medium bodied. Deserves its reputation as being one of the best DIPAs in the world.
"Overall WOW thanks Mike for sending me this brew. Bottled on 8/18/11 this brew pours a very light golden hue. Hops up front, in the middle and in the end. Very easy drinking 8% abv. I also picked up on a buttery taste that made the beer even smoother. I honestly really cannot explain how good this brew really is. Find one or move to California and get it all the time. Awesome brew and once again thanks Mike for the trade."
"Beautiful, almost dayglo, orange with a thick sticky white head. Smell is pure hops. Lots of pine and grapefruit, very clean with almost no vegetal or malt aroma. Taste blasts you with bitterness. It is strongly bitter but again very clean. The hops dominate with more pine and grapefruit which are so strong it was hard for me to detect much subtlety behind them. Everything about this beer is super clean which lets the strong hops and bitterness shine, front and center. Good carbonation and a very easy drinking beer. Overall this is a great beer. I didn't give perfect scores for smell and taste because I like a bit more complexity but what is there is very strong and clear and enjoyable."
"Pouring from the bottle, one is immediatley struck by the yellowish orange color of the beer. Notes of hops, pine, and citrus are striking in the aroma. Even before tasting, it is very apparent that this is not your average beer. The beer is uncommonly smooth. The hops and well balanced with the smooth texture. There is potential for this beer to go down easy, and consume in mass quantities. It is not an IPA, just for the sake of being hoppy. Pliny the Elder is not trying to out-hop other beers. It has a unique flavor and texture which sets it apart. A well designed beer."
"Pours a clear orangish gold. Nice sized head. Lacing on the surface and sides. Smell is huge piney, citrusy, and spicy hops. Cloves, lemons, and grapefruit. Taste is tremendously hoppy and sharply bitter. Bitter grapefruit. Resinous. Piney. Hops overpower everything throughout. Some sweet maltiness far in the background. Lingering bitterness. Full bodied. A bit boozy. Well carbonated. Overall a hop powerhouse. Really great stuff- an awesome DIPA."
"An amazing fresh and hoppy beer. In the top five for me, although I am a hop head! Hard to find though. I have discovered most stores keep this in the managers or stewards office. The aroma is a truely fresh hoppy one that Is hard to come by. I would love to travel to the brewery in sana rosa"
Crystal clear golden-peach color with a solid frothy white head with nice retention and lacing. 
"A: Pours a golden straw color; small head, light lacing"
Served in a pint glass. Bottled 8/18/11
Finally. Thanks to Ynot2 for this unexpected gift.

Poured from a 500ml bottle into a Founders pint glass.
Thanks to my friend for trading me this. I have hear all about this beer but never had the opportunity to try this legendary beer.
"Served from bottle to an imperial pint. Bottled on 8/18/2011, enjoyed on 9/20/2011."
"Bottle from cduckett16, Thanks!"
A growler fresh from the brewery. Definitely the freshest Elder I've ever had.

A: Pours a nice tangerine gold color. With a good head that is sticking to the sides of the glass.
Bottle date of 8-18-11...poured into a Duvel tulip
"I made tasting this beer a bit of an 'event.' In a Glencairn Scotch glass to get more of the nose... which was a very complex & reminiscent of a spring meadow and sweet nectar. The taste lived up to the hype as well as the amazing aroma- hops of course up front, with a juicy citrus right in the middle of the flavor, finishing nicely with a pleasant bitterness. Did I mention fresh?? it's ever so fresh, it reminds me of drinking the purest bottled water. What's amazing about this beer is how balanced it is, and how the alcohol is masked... almost every IPA is somewhat undrinkable 'all day' in that it is not refreshing - it gives you a dry mouth after a while. This is quite the opposite... What sort of witchery is this??"
"4's on the board. I think this one might have been a little old... probably about 3-4 months old... it was a bit ago and I didn't write down the bottle date so I can't tell you exactly how old it was. Regardless... poured a slightly hazy orange color with a finger of foamy white head that retained pretty well and left a little lacing. The aroma had notes of citrus and piney hops, with some sweet caramel thrown in. Not as much hop aroma as I would've liked, but see above. The taste was nice and balanced, nothing too overly present. There were notes of caramel, pine, citrus and some grassy hops. The mouthfeel was relatively smooth and finished clean. Overall a great beer... would have liked to try a slightly fresher one."
"Thank you jmmy2282! Heard a lot about this brew since being on BA, here goes..."
"I am enjoying this beer in a Tripel Karmeliet tulip. It is 2 1/2 weeks old, but I have had it super fresh, so I feel somewhat qualified to review it..I have really nothing to add by reviewing this beer, except to say that this continues to be an impressivly consistant beer.."
"Appearance - clear amber with a small white head and heavy lacing. This asked me to drink it, and I obliged."
"Pliny th Elder is golden and gorgeous. Deep straw yellow. Not watery looking, but a nice solid gold. Really a beautiful beer. "
"Mostly transparent gold-orange in appearance. Adequate head that levels out to a dense ivory ring that leaves super-thick sheets of lace. Mmmm: Candied pineapple and other tropical fruit dominates the aroma, with some citrus and a little pine underneath. There is a very unique depth to the nose -- it is quite different depending on how far the glass is from your face (more Centennial-like sweet orange from far away and resiny Simcoe up close). No malt to be found, which suits Pliny well. Amazing nose."
picked up a 500 ml bottle from the Beer Junction in West Seattle the morning after the beer mail went out. poured into pint glass.
"A: Poured a nice golden color with a small, off white head. "
A- wonderful dark golden pour with perfect head of carbonation.
100th Review – PtE
Glass:Tulip 
"Well, damn. Thanks Pino (peensteen) for bringing this out for me, been wanting to get my lips on this since I first got into craft. Mouth was watering the entire bus ride over. Thanks a ton dude. Bottled July 19, 2011 - enjoyed August 29, 2011. Just over a month old. "
On Tap at Brew Pub in Santa Rosa.
"On tap at the Horse Brass in Portland a couple weeks ago. It absolutely lives up to every accolade ever written. Not only is it the most balanced and refreshing IPA I've ever had, but the hop flavors, my god, it was unlike anything I have ever tasted. They melded together into one unified lupulin note that rode a delicious juicy malt wave down my tongue. No harsh bitterness or alcohol present. A true hop artwork that never strays too far in any one direction but stays perfectly focused on its expression of the hop."
Poured from a bottle with a 08/09/11 bottled on date into a SA perfect pint glass.
Big Thanks goes out to Futra123 for this awesome beer!
Finallly I got one. A big thank you to my mom who picked this up for me on her day off while I was at work.
"A friend from cali came to NJ by train and brought me two 500ml bottles. God bless him. Bottled 7/19/11, poured into chalice glass."
"It seems that the more I drink this beer, the better it gets (or perhaps the more I appreciate it?). "
Bottled about 12 days before enjoying.
"Poured a very nice copper color with excellent head and some very nice lacing. Very nice scent, with a huge hoppiness right up in the nose (pine and some citrus), and some decent maltiness behind it. Nice flavors, with a nice two-row malty sweetness and a huge piney and slight citrusy hop flavor that is very much in front; good overall, but very unbalanced, even considering the style. Goes down fine, but there is quite a bit of hop scratchiness."
"Sent away for a case online. I had been waiting a long time to taste this, so the anticipation was more than ripe..."
"From Tasting Notes on 08-29-2011, poured from a recently made bottle into a Snifter glass."
Picked up a couple bottles while up in NorCal recently. Bottle date of 8/9/11. Had many times before both bottled an on tap. Finally getting around to a review. Poured into an Allagash chalice. 
"They put the blindfold on early in the evening, told me to trust the darkness, to follow my nose through the forest, to let my bare toes lead me along the damp floor towards the sunset..."
A: Amber/orange colored body. Head dissipates fast and retains a white surface/ nice lacing. 
Bottled 08/02/11
"Ah, the Elder. I have had this twice before, but it was quite some time ago when I was just really getting into craft beer. While I know I enjoyed it immensely, and it was well worth the hunt (big thanks to the good people at City Beer Store in SF for helping me acquire it when I was down there), I didn't have the foresight to review it. Well, the generous leschkie sent me a bottle as an extra, so now I have the opportunity to revisit this one properly. Thank you very much Kurtis! This one was bottled on 06/29/2011 and consumed on 07/15/2011; this review is from my notes."
"500ml bottle 8,0% Abv."
"On-tap at HopMonk in Sonoma. It's a luscious golden amber with light highlights, a firm head and impressive lacing which lasted all the way down the glass. The smell is pine and floral and citrus and the taste is the same--hops hops hops! Hops hops hops! Bitterness! Flowers, citrus, pine! Just a little bit of cracker malt and a long slow dry finish. Lingering spice. I have had a lot of hop bombs before but what sets this apart is the mouthfeel--medium bodied with good carbonation and no alcohol feel or even that much sting, just hoppy goodness. Lives up to the hype."
"A - Nice yellow orange like, some lace and no head but I dont like head on ipa's."
"A treat to have a few bottles sent all this way, thanks Amdy. It's been a good long while since I had some fresh Pliny. Bottled 8/2 I do believe."
500ml bottle born on date 8/18.
Special thanks to N. Ketchum for the opportunity to finally try this brew.
Finally got my hands on a Pliny the Elder thanks to a good friend's trading skills.
"Pale golden orange, one finger of white head, nice tight lace left on the glass. Smell is ripe with citrus, grapefruit, tangerine and orange are all present, some light pine note are present, white grape skins, nice malt profile is there as well, tons of hops and hop oils present. Taste is bursting with citrus fruit, grapefruit, lots of orange and tangerine, lots of hop bitterness, some pine in the finish, long drying finish, after a while the bitterness almost subsides into a complex balanced beer unlike anything I have tasted. Light-med carb, full body, lots of resiny oils, great feel, nice weight. Overall this is near perfection, ABV can not be tasted, very drinkable, certainly lives up to its reputation, absolutely outstanding."
A friend of mine traded this bottle for me at BA. It was bottled on 07/19/2011.
Russian River Brew Co. If only they could brew more of there beer on a larger scale. I live less than a hour from there brewery and I still only know of a few places to get there beer. Hope to see them grow without sacrificing there craftsmanship of what they brew. Excellent stuff.
Bottle on 8/2/11 consumed on 8/24/11 first taste at 50 degrees. Picked up on a trip to Seattle 2 weeks ago.
"I have had PTE on tap and in a bottle via trade. Great beer both ways, but on tap is better. On tap the beer in taste and smell is a bit more ""upbeat"", that is the best way I can describe it."
This is an exceptional beer. Especially if you do as the label says and drink it extremely fresh. 
"500 ML Bottle with bottled 7/19/11 stamped on the side of the label. I'd like it fresher, but sister-in-law picked it up for me while in Cali, and I'm stoked to have it at all."
"Everyone seems to have already put their two cents in about PTE, so I'm going to keep this simple and to the point."
Served on-tap at the Khyber Pass Pub in Philadelphia.
"Had this on tap at the Russian River Brewery. Found out they not only make great beer, but awesome pizza and ""Pliny Poppers"" which are jalapeno poppers made in a Pliny beer batter. Awesome!"
Traded Hunahpu for another historical figure (thanks Azurescens).
Big thanks to JLindros for sharing this brew.
"This brew pours a toasted amber color. It holds a one and a half finger cream colored head that retains nicely. It holds a latticework of huge bubbles, leaving monster lacing as it goes. Carbonation appears active and there is a faint haze to the beer. Little bubbles stick all around the snifters, submerged under the golden liquid. The nose is a walk through the grapefruit grove. Hops are bold, piney, and citric, with a sweeter twinge of tropical fruit way off on the back. The malts, too, are sweet, with a small toast and pale character. The sweetness goes one step beyond the fruit and the hops, with a dash of raw honey to round off the nose. As we sip, a beautiful balance between bitter hops and sweet hops is stricken. This gives a big grapefruit and citric sweetness, but also a biting grassy pop as well. Through the middle, alcohol moves over the tongue, with more steely bitterness of hop and grain. The flavors become crisper here, with a faint toast to the malt, and surprising darkness (not black, but certainly deeper than pale) that wasn’t palpable in the nose. The finish is with more bright grapefruit and gloriously citrusy hops. The sweetness also returns, with a metallic and sour grain, to offer further balance to the finale. The aftertaste breathes bitterly of more hop, flecks of alcohol, and the tiniest hint of grain. Again, big hops steal the show. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium. The nicely retained head and bubbles offer a nice creaminess and smack to each sip. The mouth is coated, but quickly dried and left a bit salty. One negative is that we expected a slightly thicker body and feel to it, where at times, it came across borderline thin. The abv is appropriate and the beer drinks with great, refreshing ease."
"Original ratings on Aug. 8, 2011: 4.50, 4.50, 5.00, 5.00, 5.00"
this is my first review i've ever done and this is the first time i'm trying Pliny the Elder. I have read many reviews on this beer and have been uber excited to try this one out. hear it goes...
"Appearance: Rich, clear amber color with one finger nearly white head. The head slowly subsides leaving a thin layer of fine bubbled froth and a beautiful web of fine delicate lacing on the glass"
I have enjoyed Elder a number of times via draft and bottle. I give the nod to on tap being my favorite experience until this point. Huge thanks to Smoked for bringing a growler of this to my place after visiting Russian River.
"Pours golden golden golden. Regular ol' head, light and foamy. Lacing streaks thinly down the sides of my pint glass. Wonderful aroma of, strangely enough, pine hops, warm and inviting with a note of creaminess."
Had in multiple bottles and multiple drafts.
"What can I say that hasn't been said before? This is quite possibly my favorite beer on Earth, my desert island beer, my last beer to drink on my death bed. "
A: Pours a nice amber orange with 2 fingers of pillowy head. Probably the best looking IPA I've ever seen.
"Could this beer live up to it's hype? OK, very privileged to get 6 bottle from my cousin for free. Very fortunate to even get a fresh batch bottled on 8/2/11 and first tasted on 8/13/11. I live in PA, so it's nearly impossible to get it in bottles on the East Coast."
"On a recent trip to Portland, Oregon, I had the opportunity to experience this highly rated beer."
"On-tap at The Bottle Room, Whittier, CA"
Received as an extra thanks to Thome50. Bottled on 6/29. Chilled and poured into an imperial pilsner glass.
"It pours beautifully. The bouquet is already obvious and potent, but I'll get there soon...beautiful pale orangish gold not much head or lacing."
"I had a nice fresh bottle, just 20 days old, poured into a tulip glass."
Managed to score a couple of these while visiting in San Diego; I feel fortunate. 
"The appearance was great and the nice piney hoppy aroma really had me going, but the taste just fell a little bit flat in the mouth to me. It tasted good initially, but those bitter hoppy flavors I was craving just didn't seem to stick to the palate long enough for me for an imperial."
"A nearly perfect beer. I used a pint glass as nothing else was available. The balance of hops to malt was just right. The appearance seemed right for a beer with less flavor. It looked like a lesser beer but hit hard. Just before the bitterness seems about to hit you it backs off. This makes you wonder why out of so many others, this beer stands out. The main theme I get is balance. Every characteristic of a great IPA exists here and sets the bar for the style. It is also fun I might add."
3rd review on BA. Bottle dated 7/19/11 served into my Stone IPA glass on 8/4/11 for IPA day. No better way to celebrate than with one of my favorite beers.
Just now reviewing this after grabbing a growler from the brewery in Santa Rosa. I have also had by bottle and on tap at the local pub. 
"Finally I get my hands on you Pliny last bottle in the store too guy pulled it out the back and only gave it too me because I was from Phoenix, that guy is the best."
Pours a clear filtered golden to slight copper body. Good head that retains itself nicely with a good lace. 
"I have already reviewed this one, and in my previous review i stated iv had it (pliney) many times before. I said it was a three day old bottle. Well this time i managed to get my hand on a bottle that had been bottled with in the last 24 hours :)"
"What can I say about Pliny that hasn't been said before? Nothing, that's what."
A: Color is a deep yellow to amber color. Not all that complex in terms of hues but the main focus here is the head. Wow! Big and really sticky. The lacing is all over the glass. Nice job
I finally got to try this when I took a road trip to Colorado. Happened to go to a beer store and arrive right after they recieved it. Mine was bottled on 071911 and I tried it on the 25th. 
"A: golden orange body, finger head, amazing lacing. "
"This beer lives up to all the hype. It is wonderful! It has very nice deep orange color and a good 1/2 inch head. The smell alone makes this beer fabulous with an explosion of grapefruit, orange and floral scents. The taste is a hop heads dream --- heavy hops, smooth full-bodied taste and a wonderful bitterness at the end."
The Perfect Beer!

"Pours a pale golden straw color with a finger of head which sticks around briefly, but just long enough for you to get a good look. Smell is of hops, wonderful wonderful hops. There is a kiss of malt in there too for balance. This is a remarkably balanced beer. Pliny has a wonderful hop forward profile but nothing that punches you in the face, it compliments the well rounded and nuanced malt profile which has just enough caramel going on to be interesting but not so much that it ruins the hops party. Moutheel is wonderful. Somewhat silky for an IPA, Pliny has about the perfect amount of carbonation when makes all the flavors pop just right. "
"Pliny the Elder, Double IPA, 8% ABV"
"It pours a really lovely golden copper color that’s not too clear, but not too opaque. Atop the beer sits a single finger of soapy foam head. The nose is incredible, it starts with a huge citrus burst followed by a nice coniferous backbone with hints of malt. The flavors are exceptional, lots of grapefruit up front and like the nose it finishes with strong pine flavors but actually has a nice malty backbone to it. The body is great, big and full yet bone dry that leaves your mouth salivating for more. It’s exceptionally bitter while being very approachable and easy to drink."
Poured from a 16oz bottle into five juice glasses.
On tap at Memphis Taproom in Philly. Poured into a tulip glass.
"The one and only, bottled 06/16/2011"
"A — Brilliant gold with a bright fluffy white foamy head, perfectly translucent"
"Courtesy mashmaster. AWESOME! This stuff really is fantastic. Awesome orange pour with a big fluffy off-white head that laces for days. Amazing balance, wonderful hops flavor and aroma. This is a stellar beer. Plenty of citrus, floral, pine and more. Not overwhelmingly hoppy or malty - wonderfully balanced and delicious."
"This is quite possibly my favorite beer ever, as it's the craft brew that I have drunken the most ever since I discovered it in February. I'm glad to have found a freshly bottled Pliny, which as of this writing is 4 days old. Yay! This was poured into a tulip glass as well to enhance flavor (even though I usually take it in a pint glass)."
"500ml bottle into a Russian River ""TION"" glass."
bottled: 6.29.11
The best. This is the godfather - repect and love.
"For those who've tasted this. You know that no review is really needed. It's just a freak in a bottle. It's a force of nature that everyone should or rather needs to experience. It's hard to rival this king, and some come close. But all in all, This is just a treat for me to obtain and share with close friends."
"I waited a long time for this...I was on a trip to Colorado and not only found it in bottles, but found it on tap too, along with several other Russian River brews which I tried."
Russian River Pliny The Elder is a top quality dry IPA. It is very hoppy but not overly bitter beer. Don't expect much fruitiness or other unique flavours though.
Big thanks to HEADYGLASSdotcom on this one!
"Poured from a 16 oz bottle into a pint glass. Freshness date is 7/11/11, which puts it at a whopping 9 days old. It's strange, I used to live in northern California about 40 minutes from the brewery and I don't know if I ever got one in a bottle this fresh and now I am in San Diego. Go figure. Pours an ever so hazy orange-yellow. Frothy white head that leaves a little lacing and a thin foam on the top. The aroma virtually defines the word ""hops"" citrus (grapefruit, orange) and pine. A bit of malty sweetness and finally on the end I get another aroma that my friend used to describe as a ""funky aged cheese"" aroma. I thought he was a little crazy for a while, but I think I finally get what he was talking about. I also get a bit of the bubblegum backbone that people are talking about and I guess I would associate that with the malt sweetness I mentioned earlier. Medium bodied on the palate, with a nice bit of carbonation. One of the things I like about this beer is that it is not a thick sticky-sweet DIPA. It actually finishes fairly dry. That brings me to what might be my favorite and most impressive thing about Pliny. The balance. I think that in here at Beer Advocate and in the beer world in general, balance is under-appreciated. People get a taste for hoppy beers and they seek out more and more extreme examples of them. The beauty of this beer is that it has incredible complexity both in hops and malt, but one never totally dominates the other. In my opinion that is much more difficult to do than make an over the top hop bomb. Thats why for me, even though this beer gets an incredible amount of hype and attention, I still believe it is deserving."
"outstanding, I have had this beer in all forms, bottle old and new, and growler. All amazing. The older bottles you can mos def can discern from the new ones. My favorite is right at 2 weeks of age. Everything of this beer screams hops, from the color to the taste and ultimately to the color. If your a hophead, you cant carry your badge until you try this beer."
"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one! Served from growler into a Mikkeller flute. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, pine, pine hop, and citrus hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this is always a good brew. However, Pliny was much better out of the bottle. The growler that we drank was QUITE fresh, but it just seemed to lose a little bit of the edge that it has from a fresh bottle. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance and I would LOVE to try it on-tap or even on cask to compare the other serving types in the future."

"On tap at Hopmonk Tavern in Sebastopol, CA while on my honeymoon."
"A: Great frothy head, sticks like resin to the sides of glass. Hazy and golden."
"Bottled 6/16/11, Served in a stemless Chardonnay glass. Thanks Jeremy! (Chickencoop)"
Bottle into a tulip. Bottled on 071111.
"I've been waiting to get my hands on this beer for years, and my future mother-in-law just returned from a trip to Napa Valley and brought a single bottle of Pliny the Elder home for me. To my pleasant surprise the bottling date was 7/11/11... 5 days ago! Let's get to it!"
"Beer pours an orangish color with some yellow and a big white head. Left a lot of great lacing on the sides. Smells of super pine hops and just a little bit of malt. Lots of citrus and other things going on, smells great. The taste isn't any type of let down, with great pine hops and things that turn bitter on the end. It doesn't have tropical fruit notes that other ones do, more of a piney grapefruit beer. Really like this one, fantastic on tap."
Bottled on 062911.
"This beer is good. I don't understand why people freak out with A+ ratings. For me, Ninkasi's ""Maiden the Shade"" is a better choice for a similar beer. I don't get why the ""bros"" give ""Total Domination"" a C rating and then give this an A+? Guess my palette just isn't as refined!"
Poured from a 500mL bottle purchased at the Russian River brewery into a highball glass in a San Francisco hotel.
I dont know I f I got a bad batch of this beer but it is definitely NOT WORTHY OF AN A+! 
Finally got the opporitunity to try this while on my business trip to SD.
500 ml bottle poured into a snifter.
"Thanks for fellow BA thryn for the bottle! Bottled June 3, drinking on July 12. I had this on draft at O'Brien's in San Diego years ago and remember loving it, but this is my first review."
On tap at The Englander.16 oz pint glass serving. Pours out a slightly cloudy tannish orange color with a nice little head. Smell is lovely. Tons of hops but some balance as well. Nice citrus hops with some earthyness mixed in. 
Looks nice. A medium to medium low concentration ever-so-too -little-slightly-hazy-golden-orange. Good fluff and sticky lacing.
Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass. 
"Like most people who have reviewed this beer, I have been looking forward to this moment for a long time!"
Date on bottle: 6-26-11
"First of all, I love Russian River. I've been looking forward to trying this beer for a long time. Well, the time has come. The beer pours a nice golden orange with a decent head that settles into a thin ring. Aromas are beautiful: Sharp acidic citrus fruit, grapefruit namely, with pine undertones. No doubt this is a west-coast IPA. The hops and malts play nicely with each other on my tongue--dry saltine crackers and oranges with dabs of piney herbs. All-in-all it is an extremely balanced IPA, but at 8% ABV, I'm tasting booze way more than I should be. Unlike some IPAs, I did not regret reaching the end of the glass. Certainly worth seeking out at convenience-store prices, but please don't go mortgaging your home for BA's number 3!"
"A: I'll be damned if this isn't one of the prettiest DIPAs ever brewed. Pours a majestic, clear gold with just enough haze to it to indicate its flavors. The head comes up at just the right pace and slowly drifts down from an attractive two finger to a small but really respectable layer. Lacing all around the glass from where the head previously was. This beer is beautiful, it almost seems fake it looks so good."
Bottled 6-3-11. Five weeks new.
On tap at the brewery. 
"This is one of my favorite beers. I recently had an opportunity to try it on tap at the Russian River Brewery in downtown Santa Rosa and it didn't disappoint. IPA's tend to be my favorite type and this is a fantastic example of a strong American style double IPA. It has a hoppy, citrusy aroma with a bright clean taste that is perfect for sipping on a hot summer day. This is a beer that I could drink everyday."
Bottled on 05/26/2011/ Poured into Silver Rimmed Chimay Chalice
Appearance: Amber with a nice layer of head that fades with good lacing. 
500mL bottle (dated 062911; 7 days old) poured into a tulip.
"his is my third dance with Pliny and I’m still lovin this stuff. Bottle 7/14/10, so it’s less than three weeks old. That being said, this beer needs to enjoyed in the Bay Area, or better yet at RR. The color is a clear golden yellow with a nice frothy white head. The citrus and hops waft through the air and engage the senses. The taste is fantastic, big piney, citrusy, hops explode on the palate with just enough of a malt backbone to keep scoliosis from setting in. Great balance, huge hoppy characteristics, this is the mold for west coast DIPAs..."
Beer review #1 - go big or go home! Here goes...
bright yellowish orange with short white head.
Poured from bottle into Stella Artois chalice.
A- Pours a nice amber color with a nice 1 finger white head.
"500ml bottle dated 6-11-11, into Oversized Wine Glass; after work offering. I was pleasantly surprised to find this in Bristol farms while looking for Black Butte XXIII in Palm Desert, CA. This is the first time I've seen Russian River in my local store, and I felt like I had to be supportive of this by purchasing 6 bottles. This might have also been due to the lack of bottle limit by the store (haha, they'll catch on soon enough). "
"On tap at Noble Fir. Seattle, WA. June 2011."
"I feel blessed to finally be able to review this. Those in the Southeast like me, know it is impossible to find this without either going to the west coast to get it or through a trade. In this case I actually did both to get it. Thanks a ton to jeff1973 for the trade. You are the man! "
Bottled on: 06/16/11
"Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for not one, but two of these... and a pint from a fresh growler"
"I tried this double IPA on tap at the Russian River Brewery, and it was a focal point of my trip out to California. Needless to say I was not disappointed! The serving was in a standard pint glass, which sort of surprised me; I was expecting a 10 oz. pour. The nose of the beer was incredibly floral, which gave a good indication of the hefty hop presence. [Being a hop-head I was very happy with the level of hops included in this beer] The mouthfeel was somewhat standard compared to other double IPAs I've tried, but the taste lasted just long enough to entice another sip. I would definitely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and would recommend it highly to anyone who can find it. My only problem with this beer is that it is very difficult to get on the west coast. Russian River if you are reading this, please distribute to the East Coast."
"Bottle dated 050311, picked up at Argonaut in Denver. Poured into a Stella glass."
Bottled today!!! I am blessed to have pliny this fresh!
"Pours a clear bronze-orange color with a decent head that hangs around awhile, leaving globs of sticky lacing."
"It looks great, perfectly clear bright orange with a huge pillowy head."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with a big foamy white head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of lacing. There is a steady stream of carbonation throughout the life of the beer. The aroma fills the room with floral, piney hops as soon as the cap is popped on this gem. The aroma really opens up as the beer is being poured and starts to showcase some citrusy notes as well. No real malt aromas to speak of The flavor is bursting with piney, floral hops. Not nearly as much citrus in the flavor as in the nose. Surprisingly there is really not much in the way of alcohol presence, hard to believe this is a 8% beer. Medium bodied and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation and a dry finish. Really quite good, and I can see why it is rated world class."
"Poured into a Spaten tumbler. Bottle dated 05/24/11. Bright pale orange, almost yellow color. Very clear and filtered in appearance. Lots of tiny carbonation bubbles lead to a bright white two finger head that is soapy to sea foam looking. The lace sticks in a nice patchy pattern."
My first Pliny will be a memorable experience in my beer journey...
"Finally had my first pliny the elder last week, scored a couple of bottles from beverages4lessinc.com amongst many other things. Did it live up to the hype? Yes and no. It is a great DIPA, the piney and citrus hop notes were amazing, the taste and mouthfeel as it goes down lingers in a good way on your pallette. But i was expecting to be blown out of the water by this beer, everyone saying its the best ever of the style. I will give it #2 of the style, i prefer dogfish head 90 min to pliny, there i said it!"
Poured into a Palm tulip
"Here it is, the greatest beer in the world (according to you BA’s): Pliny the Elder. I turned 21 only three months ago, and here I am now, savoring a classic. It’s amazing how quickly the culture of craft beer just sucked me in; I don’t think I’ll ever find a more engrossing hobby. I love it!"
"I find a bottle in Chula Vista Ca while picking some other beer, bingo! my first"
On tap at Eureka Burger in Redlands.
Bottle poured into a Russian River tulip glass. Thanks Brian for both of these! Bottled on 6/03.
"I was quite surprised to find a bottle of this in Steamboat, CO. It seems to be a rarity in most parts. As a lover of all things IPA, I had high expectations, which were not met."
"Shared with a dear old friend on fathers day, from my notes."
Pours a sightly hazy golden color with a 2 finger head and much lacing.
"Bottled 05.24.11, poured into a snifter this morning."
Bottled: 6/03/11
"Fantastic, overwhelming hop aroma!! It seems as though they have squeezed every bit of aromatics from the hops. Beautiful copper/amber color with a lasting white head. Good body, not too chewy. Malty sweetness is overwhelmed by bitter and citrusy hops. The aroma stays through the end. It leaves your empty glass smelling like hops. PHENOMINAL."
"Impressive. I'm trying Pliny the Elder for the first time at Eureka Burger in Redlands, CA. I am from NH, and this is not a beer you can find easily out there. My kudos to them for carrying this and so many other great selections."
500ml poured to snifter. Bottled date of 06/03/11.
App golden with a generous rocky head. The head settles out at around 1/4 inch. Clear and yet still has excellent lacing throughout the glass.
My 500th review so I had to make it a great beer! 
"Bottled on 6/3/11. Pours slightly hazy with a nice foam that lingers throughout. This beer has smells of pine, dank, floral hops mixed with a slight spicy note. The aromas are very similar to the taste, where the alcohol is quite nicely hidden amongst the hops and malt. Speaking of the malt, it is there in such a great way that this beer seems balanced. Even with the huge amount of hops, this beer has drinkability. Very nice beer, I love picking up a bottle whenever I see it available and this fresh."
"The most highly inticipated beer ever for me. I had a coworker get this in Cali for me, thx Joyce! Poured into 13 oz tulip glass. Very bright yellow / orange with a sticky white head. Grapefruit, pine, pineapple, & some grass. Taste with all of those flavors together, a little more powerful then the nose, with a blast of piney grapefruit in the finish. Mouth feel is perfect for a DIPA. Nice carbonation. This was what the hype is all about, the best in this style I have had. Double Trouble close second. Bottle date 5/26/11."
"EDIT: Drinking this again, from a 16oz bottle into a pint glass, bottled on 03/14/13, drank 5 days later, awesome."
"Bottled on 06-03-11, drank on 06-18-11."

"On-tap at Toronado, SF. Poured into a pint glass."
Poured from a bottle into a teardrop beer glass. Bottled on 05/26/11.
"there are many beers on beeradvocate and ratebeer that end up with an A+ out of superhype and super limited availability. this isn't one. not only is it not super limited in washington, but the superhype is justified. it is absolutely the perfect double IPA. it doesn't even stand out - there's not really anything i can say jumps out at you - it's just what every double IPA aspires to be."
"Here's the most important part the review: Bottled on 6-3-11, consumed on 6-15-11. This would make this Pliny in its absolute prime. A month old Pliny is in the shadow of two week old Pliny. It's not even in the same league. "

Pliny the Elder: Botted 5/04/11 Consumed 5/23/11
Much thanks to dubinsky for getting me a brew I've been waiting to try for quite while. 
A: Pours golden with an amber hue with one finger of head that dissipates slowly. Low carbonation.
"I was lucky enough to get my hands on a Pliny, and I have to say I was a little skeptical. Is this beer worth the hype, or is it hyped because it's so hard to get?"
"When you pour this beer, you will note the nice golden color."
"I can see why this is the Imperial IPA that many a beer aficionado thinks of when discussing world class offerings in this style. Golden orange in color, Pliny The Elder has big notes of grapefruit up front, highlighting the array of citrusy hops. The hoppiness is complimented by roasted malt and caramel with a crisp, clean finish. It never fails to amaze me how this ale can have such a sizable hoppy presence, yet be so surprisingly smooth to drink."
"Even though this beer needs no further reviews or introductions, since I got a hold of a couple I wanted to represent for the East Coast:"
Pours an amber color with a foamy/soapy white head that leaves plenty of lacing all over the glass.
"First had: on tap at Monk's, Philly, PA"
I received this beer from lisomiso in Urbancaver's NOOB BIF.
"I just got a 2+ week old bottle from Eric W in California, and poured it into a tulip glass."
"Nothing but good things to say about this one. Great color, amazingly light, crisp feel. A lot of balance to the herbal/citrus hops, more of an exotic (yuzu?) tang to them than the more familiar pine/grapefruit notes. Nice maltiness that doesn't at all get in the way of the finish. Just a beautiful beer overall."
Look: Beer pours a nice copper color with visible amounts of carbonation bubbles and a half inch think head and a tad bit of lacing
"500 mL bottle, chilled and poured into a Duvel tulip. "
Pored into a straight pint glass.
"My favorite beer for my first review. Pours a beautiful amber with a couple fingers of white head. The smell is delicious, pine and citrus, but not quite as strong as I'd want for a 5. Taste is sublime, this beer is perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing."
Bottled on 5/24/11. Fresh as I'll ever get it...
Received this in a trade with badboyrsl84. THANKS!
"Week old bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a light honey color with some head and minimal lacing. Smells of pine, floral notes, and not even a hint of alcohol. Very well masked for 8 percent. Taste is quite smooth...very piney with just a touch of citrus and floral components. Mouthfeel is top of the line. No abrasive bitterness, so clean. Great beers, world class."
Poured into my Mikasa tulip.
"I went in to my ""specialty"" liquor store to pick up a bottle of DFH Squall IPA that they had put away for me when they got a shipment of it (they called me to let me know it was in), when the owner told me that they had just received three cases if Pliny the Elder earlier that day. I ended up buying two bottles of Pliny. LOVE my liquor store!"
11 day old bottle sampled in this review.
"Obtained a fresh growler from my new best friend Azurescens, he said I was in for a treat and that might be one of the biggest understatments ever."
"A: Light yellow, slightly small but good head, excellent lacing."
"Was at a picnic this weekend, when a friend pulled 2 bottles of this out of the cooler. Mind you, everything else was BMC stuff. I really has to convince him to let me enjoy one of them. He's my new best friend!"
"Poured from a 500 ml. bottle into a SA Perfect Pint glass. This beer pours a golden honey amber color with a large foamy head which leaves a ton of lacing. Aromas of pine,hops,citrus...particularly grapefruit and touch of malt rise from the glass. Fresh citrus is up front which gives way to a strong pinyness,followed by a hoppy bitterness. The finish is balanced off with a slight malty sweetness that tails off to a dry finish. Mouthfeel is very good and there is plenty of carbonation to accent the crisp,clean nature of this beer. Alcohol taste and presence is well hidden. For me this brew lived up to expectations. "
A – Crystal gold amber with a fluffy white head.
Glassware: pint glass
Glassware - Tulip
Had this Bad MoFo on tap at Toronado SF.
"This was the perfect double I.P.A., no question about it. The beer pours a hazy golden color with not much head. I found it to have more carbonation that some of the other double I.P.A.'s I've had. Pliny gives off an incredible aroma of pine with barely a hint of fruit. It was a little too cold for our first few tastes so the hop explosion was very intense, but as the beer dropped in temperature you could taste every element to this beer perfectly. An initial hop explosion that leaves a citrus, grapefruit, taste lingering behind with absolutely no undesirable aftertaste. The only thing that I can find wrong with this beer is that it is incredibly difficult to find. Places were sold out of it or had limited quantities. If you are ever on the west coast, this beer is a must!"

Thanks to daniloknezic for going out of his way to find a FRESH batch of this for me!! Bottled 5/4/11 and drank 5/24/11.
"Early April bottling date, so six weeks old. Thanks headyglassdotcom for both the beer and the awesome oversized wineglass I'm drinking from."
"Bright amber yellow in color with slight haze. Poured with a fluffy white head with excellent staying power that ultimately reduced to a pillowy white cap. Nice sticky lacings on the glass. Very smooth with a slightly resinous feel toward the finish. Big tropical/citrus aroma, grapefruit and orange the most prominent, with a hint of pineaapple. After your nose gets accustomed to the hope aroma intensity, the sweet malt aromas begin to show through. Burst of citrus hops on the palate with a delicate malty feel underneath. Finishes with a touch of piney hop bitterness. Although this a showcase of hop aroma and flavor the flavors and feel are smooth creamy and delicate. Excellent!"
Appearance: Medium yellow color with a moderate white head that slowly faded. 
Big thanks to Trappistlover for this one! Reviewed from notes.

A- Awesome bright gold beer with a little off white lacing.
Just about to top 1000 on karma so I figured I'd do so in style and pop my Pliny cherry.
"Extremely excited to try this beer, thanks James. Bottled on 4/28, poured straight out of the fridge into a snifter."
"Thanks to my friend who randomly asked me, ""hey do you want a pliny the elder i got one."" The shock and hysteria just made my day and i now have a new best friend."

"Finally able to have this beer fresh, I have bottles from 5/4/11. I have waited to review this until I had a bottle that was less than a month and a half old."
appearance: Pours a slightly lazy but mostly transparent golden orange with about a fingers worth of head which leaves some lacing. A pretty nice looking double IPA.
"Bottled 6 April 2011. Not quite as fresh as I'd like, but for my first time drinking it, it'll have to do."
special thanks to JoshuaGarrett4 for the surprise box with cali stuff.
"I now know why people get so nuts over Pliny; having had a healthy pour from a 4 day-old growler, I can safely say that it is about as good as a hop-centric brew can be."
"Pours a clear burnt orange, a rocky white head clings with lace, smells of citrus, pineapple, pine, caramel malt and subtle alcohol. Hop complexity dominates the flavor, moves around with different intensities of bitterness, excellent balance. Light bodied and lively but a little chewy on the end. Overall it's a perfect example of the west coast style. I finally got around to reviewing it. One of the best"

"Bottled on 04/28/11 - First time trying PtE, big thanks to eyeenjoybeer!"
picked a bottle up during at City Beer in SF during a recent West Coast visit. bottled on 4/28/11. I've had Pliny on draft before but its been about a year and I haven't tried it from the bottle until now.
"Clear honey golden base (maybe a touch of hop haze) with 2 fingers of bubbly, slightly off white head. Initial smell is all tropical fruit – fresh pineapple, sweet orange, and mango. Pine needles and an elegant astringency from the hops follow the initial tropical fruit attack. Taste echoes the smell with the initial attack really showing off those tropical, sweet fruits. The fruit is followed by a nice transition to bittering hops. This is virtually the only IPA/IIPA that I’ve had the pleasure of tasting that has such a fantastic transition from the start to the mid-palate to the finish. Overall, bar none, the best IPA I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying. If/when I am on the west coast and this is available in bottle or on tap, it will be sought after…. By any means necessary."
"A ~ Crisp 14 K gold along with a nice clean, clear white lace hugging the pint. "

"Always a favorite when fresh, tasted from bottle about two weeks old. Great lemon peel and grapefruit aromas with a hint of purple basil and herbaceous notes. Body is medium and the alcohol is well hidden. Flavors of grapefruit and Meyer lemon dominate with a touch of the herbal components coming through on the finish. This beer has always been worth the hype to me and it can't be beat for the price, incredibly smooth for a double and impeccable balance makes this a little too easy to drink."
From 500ml bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 5/2/11
"Poured into a ccb pint glass. Golden and translucent, two finger head with lots of lacing. Aromas of citrus and pine in the hops with malt in the background. Taste follows the nose, very hoppy, some malt bitterness is high. it doesn't seem as complex as the hype around this beer, it's a great dipa just not as great as all the hype."
A: It pours a beautiful golden color that has very light orange hue in the light. the clarity is remarkable given the amount of hops that are in this brew. There is a rocky two finger white head that presents great retention. Sticky lacing covers the sides of the glass.
Made date of 03/29/11 and consumed on 05/03/2011. Kept cold and dark the entire time.
Thanks to 
A - Pours a golden orange. Quite a looker of an DIPA. The head came easy without much pressure and created a nice pillow above.
Poured into new belgium growler with a 1/2 inch of foam head and surprisingly clear copper color. Foam head fades to a quarter inch. Looks like it will have a decent amount of carbonation
This bottle was courtesy of BrewerB in a recent trade before DLD. Thanks Brian!
A: A mix between apricot orange and honey gold with a decent white head that stuck to the glass.
Worth the hype. This is a great IPA. 
A: Straight from bottle to GAsP... {
Secured 17 bottles from an amazing west coast connection. My dream came true when the boxes arrived today safe and sound. Poured into a brandy sniffer that I wish I could swim in for a summer or two. 
"ALWAYS my first pick. Has the IPA bite, but isn't that what is all about? yay it is! Color is beautifuly set. Taster is is full of depth but not heav. ABV is average to other ales of this type. It sells out at the local Liquor store that has it sometimes. Local pub always has it on tap or some Russian River Beer, which are all gooed in my opinion!"
Btl poured into a Schlafly tulip at DLD
"A: Pours very nicely, like gold in a glass. An impressive 2 fingers of thick, ivory colored fluff rests at the brim and nicely holds to the glass until you're finished."
650mL bottled poured in my Russian River Pint glass. Bottled on 4/06/11. Tasting against the Surly Abrasive side by side.
Big thanks to kylehayworth who just gave me this bottle for no reason other than being a cool human being!
Received in a BIF from holden303 -- opened mere minutes after unwrapping and poured into a Duvel tulip.
"Lovely pour resulting in a wonderful three finger head of thick fluff. Lace is full and clings to the bottom of the glass. Color is a 13 on the SRM color chart. Snell is intense, with aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, apple, mint, and malt. Taste is very complex, with flavors of grapefruit, orange, pineapple, apple, lemon, mint, pear, and malt. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy, with goodly amount of carbonation to add zing. I really like this beer!!! So refreshing with the great citrus flavor smashing over the top. So refreshing, and a great buzz also. I will get some more."
Had on tap at Encinitas Ale House from. First glass from a freshly tapped keg
pour is a very clear golden/light amber with minimal white lacing that disappears quickly and leaves a stringy lacing.
"Pours a hazy orange sunset with red tones. Bottled 4/06/11. The head is three fluffy fingers of egg shell white foam that slowly dissipates leaving thick spider web lacing. Nose has rich malts, floral/pine, some lighter citrus notes and almost a little spicy hop bitterness. Taste is alot of bitter piney hops upfront, a touch of earthiness, rich malts that balance nicely with a hoppy finish, not overly sweet. Very drinkable for a dipa but i still like a touch more complexity out of what i am drinking - maybe some tropical fruit or heavier citrus notes. The beer is well balanced but it is simply perfect with just a hop/malt balance and not much else there."
"I have to thank my buddy Nick for the trade and getting me this beer fresh! The bottle is only 21 days from being bottled. I poured the bottle into a pint glass to find a great golden colored body with an one inch white head. As I drank the beer you could see the white lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma is dominated by the grapefruit hops and at the same time is very inviting. The taste is exceptional the floral citrus flavors hitting your pallet immediately. Though at the same time it has a great balance and is not over powering at all, its clean and crisp. There is a perfectly balanced bitter - sweet aftertaste that after a few seconds leaves you wanting more. The mouthfeel was great, like I said its very balanced and you don't really notice the alcohol at all, especially being at 8%abv. "

Poured from the 1 pint .9 fl oz bottle... 
"OMFG, let the hate begin. Poured a golden color into that damn shaker glass. Aroma of citrus and pine. Taste was citrus with too much bitterness in the end for my palate. Good but I don't see the ""holy crap. I HAVE to try this. My pallete just doesn't sem to get it."
"Pliny we meet again and you are 21 (Days) today congrats....Welcome, im pouring you into a stone specialty glass and you give me a white cloud of God 2 1/2 fingers of head (its the glass) your color i call, goldenhoneyfuck "
bottle date 3/29/11 got on a trade
"Thanks for the trade Dnarx, really appreciate you coming out there."
"BA review #100, perfect timing on this one."
"Appearance: deep golden color, nice head, and carbonation."
"I have had PtE several times on tap and from the bottle, so I thought it was time to give it a review."
"Pours a light, golden color with thick white head that does not dissipate."
Thanks to Dnarx. Mad props for hooking me up.
500ml bottle dated 03 21 11.Poured into snifter at fridge temp.
"Thanks to Preismj for helping me obtain this one! Drank from a tulip glass on 4/19/11, bottled on 3/21/11... Tough to get it much fresher considering my circumstances, though I'd be curious to know the difference that a few weeks made! Next time I'm out west..."
"Bottle split with me by Malreever. Super fresh, bottled on 3/29/11."
My first Pliny
"ive had it many times before and also on tap, but this is the first time ive gotten around to writing a review."
Thank you Brian for bringing this bottle to Lakewood!
"Spectacular golden-orange color, white head - chunky when on tap, foamy and even from the bottle. Usually about two fingers. Beautiful, beautiful lacing."
"Received in my Secret Bunny basket from mymrnngjckt. Thanks, Kevin! Bottle dated 2/17/11."
Drank at Mad Monk Fremantle
"Poured from a bottle dated 2/2011. Is this the bestest, most hoppiest, but well balanced beer ever?"
I lived in SF for the past 5 years and this brew was fairly easy to find. Walk to a local Whole Foods and grab a few bottles. No sweat. I've had my fair share.
"Bottled 3/21/11, if I remember correctly. Anyways, it was super fresh."
"This is a four week old bottled directly send to my by a friend in the US, thanks. Pours a golden color with a nice fluffy head. Smell: huge American hop aromas dominates the nose, grapefuits, flowers, grass, and a bit of orange. A bit too dry in the mouth, with clean malts, more grapefruit. Very strong bitterness, not very drinkable to me. Still nice to try"
What can I say that hasn't been said?
"A big thank you goes out to Dempsey16 for this wonderful brew (I suspect he equally enjoyed the Dreadnaught). Bottle to (frosty) pint glass. Delicious :P Hoppy, but wonderfully balanced. Perfectly sketched; drawn from the very palette VanGogh uses for his sunflowers. Beautiful on both ends. One of my top 2 beers (tied with Dreadnaught, although the edge goes to Pliny because I can't get RR with the same regularity that I can 3 Floyds."
Nearly skipped this for another ipa at hollingsheads. Ended up choosing the classic and was not disappointed. Probably the third time I've been lucky enough to have it.

"500mL bottle with bottling date 3/21/11 poured into snifter, reviewed on 4/6/11"
"Hops anyone? This is the first time I have actually saw hops in a beer. As soon as you crack it you can smell the hops. But it's balanced - nice sweet malts and alcohol in harmony with the bitterness and citrus, pine and earthy, hops. Try it, you'll love it."
"Got this one via trade with baycat, thanks Ryan. Bottle dated 2/24/11. Poured into a Victory snifter."
Poured into a pint glass.

A - Gorgeous orange pour with a nice .15 inch head that is white and a bit sticky. 
Thanks Thickfreakness for the Pliny and an awesome trade.
Have now been lucky enough to have this beer 3 times from the bottle and once on tap. I will review the bottle I am currently drinking. Bottle dated: 2/24/2011.
generously gifted to me from some friends that just got back from san francisco.
"Pours a beautiful crisp and clean caramel burnt orange, with creamy whipped pure white head on top that laces like a dream. "
A pure and clean hop explosion.
16oz bottle poured into a .5L spaten mug.
"I had this on-tap at Capone's during the Russian River beer event. Every time I have this beer, I can't believe how much I like it. I never thought it would live up to the hype, but it always does."
HUGE thanks to portable for picking up a growler across country and getting it to me in less than a week (and as a surprise no less...and with a RR pint glass!!!!)
Poured from 500 mL bottle into snifter. Bottled on 3/14/11.

Glass - Tulip
glass: Tulip
A: Pours a clear golden straw color with a small white head. Minimal lacing is left behind.
The bottle i had was bottled on 2-24-2011. Everything abut this beer was Very Nice. The pour was very nice clear and clean. The smell off this beer was very inviting. There was a rich body and clean finish. There is nothing i can say bad about this beer except i can not get it on the east coast. HA HA
One word: AWESOME.
Had on tap at Russian River on a recent trip up to Santa Rosa (not my first)
"Acquired this via trade. Bottled 12/17/10, drank 3/31/11. Great head. Nice citrus aroma and tast. Even better(fantastic) balance of flavor and hops. I would Def drink more if available in Florida. Did not beat my current fav DIPA Unearthly. Rock on Russian River!"
"I received this in a trade with dsgolovin (as an extra no less). Usually I won't drink a trade beer until both sides are complete (mine is still en route) however I couldn't pass on Fresh Pliny. Bottled 3/21/11. The beer pours a beautiful amber/gold with a nice tall head. The smell is citrus and orange, the taste is the same. I don't know if this is my favorite DIPA of all time, doesn't really matter it's damn good. I wish it was available locally. I've wanted to try this beer for a long time and I wasn't disappointed."
"a: served in a wide snifter, clear golden-amber in color, an initially thick off-white head falling to a nice layer"
Poured into a New Belgium snifter
Thanks to badboyrsl84 for helping me get my hands on this. Never been more excited to get something in the mail.
I had this beer on tap at Falling Rock in Denver....
"Thank you so much to Robb at Poppy's Pizza in Estas Park, Colorado for this one. Check out my review of Poppy's and please go there next time you're in Estas, had a great time and he is one of the friendliest beer-geek restaurant owners I've ever met. "
"Finally, the day has come where I can sample the word-class Pliny The Elder."
Huge thanks to Jlt6116 for sending me 6 of these in a trade.
Special thanks to kingkong for hooking me up with this bottle. Dated 2-24-11
A-pours a hazy golden color with a thick two and a half fingers of white head that has solid retention and leaves a nice lacing on the glass
"Pliny the Elder-Reviewed 1/21/11, Bottled 11/30/10"
Poured from 16.9 oz bottle into a Duvel Tulip. Bottled on 2/24/11 (approximately 1 month old). Thanks to HEADYGLASSdotcom for the trade.
A: Bright yellow bordering on gold. Thick sea foam head that stuck around and laced the glass beautifully for the entire drink.
"Received this in a trade from SolomonGrundy, thanks as always. "
"Ok dont tar and feather me, but i feel this beer is overrated. Yes, it is a very good beer and a fine example of american IPA. My problem with it is that it is extremely hard to find, dam near impossible in bottles on the east coast. I had to travel from delaware to colorado to magically stumble upon this beer. I guess all the hype ruined it for me, but i would be perfectly happy grabbing a 90 minute or even a sierra nevada and avoiding the cost and hassle of tracking down this beer or even trading it. Try it to put the hype to rest but dont go too far out of your way..."
Poured from a 500mL bottle into a Chouffe tulip. Beer was a hazy orange color with a one-finger white head. Moderate carbonation and light lacing around the glass.
"Oh the mighty Pliny... Waited quite a while to finally try to gem. I was tipped off by a gentleman that moved to Pa from Cali about where to get Pliny in our area. He spoke if the Spinnerstown Hotel as if it was a sacred holy land of beer... He wasn't too far off! Long story short about a year after he mentioned it to me I saw the S. Town Hotel got it in on tap! I wanted to leave work early that day and fly down there asap! I walk in the door and the same dude from a year ago is tossing back Pliny's like he just bought the keg. I walked up to the bar and got my 1st one. The guy didn't remember me from before and got upset that I was ordering ""his"" beer! I told him that it's his fault because he tipped me off about it... Anyway it's got a lovely golden yellow color with a nice head in it. The aromas are breath taking. The flavors of pine like hops sting your mouth and make you beg for more. This beer is so tasty! I ordered 5 in a row that night. Coulda had 5 more, shoulda called a cab!"
"Cracked this beer after it was only 2 week old. Rich gold in color, clear and translucent, almost looks like it would pour like honey. The rich smell of pine sap and grapefruit permeates from the glass immediately. It's almost like a wicked citrus fruit juice, except it's 8.0%ABV is inescapable. A truly magical representation of the DIPA breed with a drinkability unequaled to any but hopslam."
I was taken aback by the smell of this beer upon opening. I just happened to be standing over it and the smell was intense. 
"As spectacular a smelling beer as I've ever experienced- conspicuously so, especially after being underwhelmed by it's appearance, Pliny's flat yellowish color. Russian River has clearly generated quite a mystique around this brew with their tight reins and limited distribution. In fact, at two extremely well stocked local retailers, I actually had to ask for it because they refuse to stock Pliny on their shelves, keeping it refridgerated 'in the back' for specific requests and VIPs!"
Bottled on: 02-07-2011
Finally got the chance to try this!
Bottled 2/24/11
"On tap at Russian River Brewery in Santa Rosa, CA. "
"my first pliny thanks to huskyinPDX, thanks man "
"I went to Haven Gastropub at the Orange Circle and was shocked to see this beer on their ever rotating beer list. I quickly jumped to order it (thinking that the tap would run dry any second). I ordered it, and my server asked if I had heard of it or tried it at all. I responded with, ""I've definitely heard of it, but this will be my first time trying it."" He told met that I was in for a treat. He was right. This had a beautiful bronze coloring to it, that normal run-of-the-mill IPAs cannot accomplish. (to be perfectly honest-I don't even like IPAs that much!) However, this was AMAZING. I was a fan immediately by the fact that the nose was lovely and floral and the taste was the smoothest IPA with the most IPA flavor. It wasn't choking me with hoppy bitterness. Quite delicious, and it deserves every ""A"" on this site."
"I've enjoyed both tap and bottle, and having the privilege of local source, I am tasting a fresh and well-cared bottle for my notes, poured into a snifter."
"A little dissapointed after all the hype. Not a very complex beer. Will not bore everyone with the details of every sip. The bitter finish and after taste is what kinda left me thinking....""is that it"". Not a bad beer at all but not at the top Imperial IPA ever brewed. Now I must try PtY."
Finally....finally I have a bottle of this beer.
"this is it! this is the current standard bearer of West Coast IPA, if not all American IPA, as a distinct beer style. it's crisp and a little grassy, the flavors are amazingly clean and dry, and it seems deceptively simple -- a refined malty base provides the platform for flowery hop freshness."
Poured from a bottled dated 2/24/11 into a snifter
"I fell in love with Pliny the Elder. Great job Russian River, you have created one of the greatest brews of all time. Very smooth, aromatic and.... DELICIOUS! Best enjoyed nice and chilled. I was delighted to enjoy this beer at Stone Brewery on my 21st birthday. What an honor."
I've anxiously been awaiting a taste of this brew for a while. After receiving a package in the mail and waiting to assemble some friends - I finally cracked open the Pliny.
Finally able to pick up some Pliny on recent trip to Colorado as they don't distribute here. Thanks to Shane @ Davidson's Liquor for holding a couple for me!
A. Poured a clear light copper with a one and a half white frothy head. Great lacing on glass
Bottled 2/7/11
"Pliny the Elder finally makes it's way to Apple Valley, CA! At $10 per pint it's not cheap, but I can't pass up the opportunity to try one for the first time."
Was graciously served this at the Blue Dog bar in Chalfont the day before it was to go on tap. The Beer Gods were with me on the evening of 3/12/11.
"HUGE HUGE thank you to G311 who surprised me with two of these bad boys, thanks man!"
"A-Nice golden, amber. Less than a finger in head with pretty good lacing throughout. "
A- Frothy two-fingered white head on top of a slightly cloudy dark golden beer. Spotty lacing and great head retention.
Thanks to dsgolovin for this 
Bottled on 2-17-11
Served from a bottle (bottled 2/7/11)aquired in trade with HuskyinPDX(Thanks man). Paired with cave aged gruyer cheese.
"Pours clear amber gold with a steady, creamy whipped egg whites head that leaves speckled trailers from the first sip. Straight fresh hops on the nose: oil, grassy, citrus and skunk. Orange, pear and angel food cake malts get bullied from the start by branchy hops which blossom into a sine wave of hops flavors: orange, nettle, chalk, and resin, with the grapefruit and pineapple that others refer to in there as well. Sweet orange rind finish and a dry, bitter but not harsh linger. Round, creamy, sticky, with the 8% well hidden. "
I had a small taste of this about a year ago and loved it. Finally got a whole bottle for myself. Bottle on date was 2.24.11 putting this beer at 14 days old. Poured into a pint glass. 
"Clear shaded orange with bubbly white head. Fresh hops, grass, light citrus in the nose. Tastes of citrus, peels, hop resin and bitterness towards the finish and a dry ending. Medium bodied, booze hidden masterfully by fresh hop flavor. Light carbonation make it easy drinking. It's a legend of beer and it lives up to the hype."
Thank you augustgarage for the cali connection. Poured into a tulip. Bottle is dated 021711.
Been waiting for this one for quite some time so I am definitely a little stoked....
I poured this from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass. The label of the bottle assures me in ominous tones that something awful will happen if its contents are not consumed as soon as humanly possible.
I have finally had the opportunity to try this elusive beer. Bottle on date of 2/7/10.
Poured from a bottle into a snifter.
"A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a large off-white head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass."
"Appearance: deep golden color, good head retension, and a moderate amount of carbonation."
Appears slightly hazy orange/ yellow with a small off white head. 
Bottled on 1-3-11 poured into a tulip glass 
"Was at Whole Foods in Walnut Creek, CA checking out the beer selection today and noticed that they had pretty much every Russian River beer besides the Younger. Picked up a 500ml Pliny the Elder, bottled on 2-24-11, for $3.79. I have been wanting to try this beer for years and I was not disappointed. It deserves 6 stars. The best IPA I have ever had, and I have had many."
Color- A slightly hazy golden color. Head is good for an 8% beer. It laces nicely. 
"Reviewed blind. Sent to me by AleWatcher, the most generous Beer Advocate I know."
Group tasting notes from 2-18-11
"Purchased at Bobby's Liquors in Santa Clara, Ca. for $5.99. Poured out of a 500 ML bottle into my Duvel tulip."
"The pour from the bartender was pretty shoddy, with very little head. Even without the head to bring out the aromatics of the beer, the nose had a huge punch of hop character full of apricot, pine, and grapefruit. The flavor had all of the above in full force with almost no malt to speak of and a big bitterness. It finished dry with an appropriate carbonation and a slight bit of onion character from the Simcoe hops. It's quite drinkable, but the lasting bitterness limits my ability to drink other beers afterwards."
A - Nice bright golden orange with a creamy white head. Some lacing but nothing extraordinary. Plenty of bubbles stream from the bottom of the glass. 
"Bottled on Date - 2/07/2011 - (less than a month old) - never thought i could buy this beer i block from my house in Portland, i was wrong..."
"Honestly, what else can i say about this beer that has not been said? Everything i will type out has probably been said already. Just an amazing beer. Nice amberish pour, herry hoppy and citrus smell, the taste is just fantastic. Bitter, hoppy, citrusy, almost a but piney. Definitely a beer that can be drank all day, you cannot even tell its 8% untill you start to get a buzz going. "
Doing a side by side of Pliny and Hopslam tonight. The Pliny is dated 2/17/11.
"Reviewed on 2-28-11, bottled on 2-7-11. Poured into a snifter."

"Finally, the famed Pliny the Elder. Big thanks to domtronzero for sending me this one. Bottled on 01/12/11. Enjoyed on 02/27/11. Poured into a DFH pint glass."
Bottle dated 2/7. Out of my DFH tulip. First review of this classic.
"had this sucker at just a bit colder than room temperature. she's a pretty one. gold with a orange hue, white head. smells like grapefruit, pine, and how ipas smell when you imagine them. the citrus hops end strong in the nose. so this tastes great, i dig the shit out of it, but to me there's lots of other strong ipas that taste similar to this, (lagunitas's hop stoopid comes to mind), but that's not the point. why is this rated the best imperial ipa ever? whatever, i do enjoy this, a lot..."
"Let's first make this clear: I am an self proclaimed ""Hop Addict"""
Poured from a growler we picked up at the brewery into a tulip glass.
from the notebook
"One of the more agressive beers I have tasted. However, very well balanced. The aftertaste is suprisingly clean. I have not had this on tap but it was excellent from the bottle. I had high expectations for the beer from all of the hype and it surely did not disappoint. Though the IBU's are high this was not a beer that you can only drink one of and complimented the steak that I was having. I highly recommend this beer but obviously am not the only one to think this. Great job Russian River."
Drunk at Toronado SF yesterday.
Have had Pliny multiple times on tap now. Had a couple of pints today at the Toronado in San Diego for $5.50 each.
"Appearance: A clean a clear pouring beer. 1 finger of head, modest lacing. "
"On-tap at TapRoom SD, served in a pint glass. 2/21/11."
Poured from a bottle dated 1/24/11. Aquired in a trade from badboyrsl84! 
Big thanks to Johnny O for this gift!
Thanks you PlinyTheKid for bottles
500mL bottle poured roughly into an Ayinger gold-rimmed 0.5L glass (+ room for head); poured cold and warmed as tasted
Well so this is the first Pliny out of the bottle I have had. Bottled Jan 11th 2011 and we are good to go. Opened at 10:30 in the morning having rested my palate through the night with nothing to eat or drink for fourteen hours. Thanks to TKEAnimal for the bottle.
Bottle pours with a nice warm orange color. Lacing nice but head retention could be better.
Bottled 1/12/11
Had on tap at Toronados
Really excited to try this one. My first time ever. Bought it at a liquor store I found online in CA and had it shipped to me in FL. Just arrived about 6 hours ago. It cost $4.99 for the 22 oz. but a shitload more money in shipping!! Bottle showed bottled date of 2/7/11 **Fresh**
Bottled on 1/24/11 poured into a tulip.
Appearance: Bright golden Orange. Nice creamy head forms. It's retention isn't perfect but it does cover the side of the glass with some mild lacing. This beer doesn't need carbonation to jump out at the drinker because it just looks plain downright good to drink.
"Also had on tap at a local eatery that serves craft beers...when I tried to have some at the Stone Brewery they had just run out :( We were on a beer hunt for Pliny, once you taste it's deliciousness, you must have more! So piny in smell and taste-it's absolutely wonderful. Crisp fresh taste with a slight dry finish! If you can get your hands on this beer, it's a MUST!"
Oh the Pliny. Having heard so much could it live up to the hype.
Bottle dated January 24th:
"Much has been written about how this beer tastes after the bottle is more than even a few weeks past its bottling date, but after drinking easily over 100 bottles, I've made the following observations:"
Poured from 500ml into Portsmouth Brewery snifter. Bottled on 01/24/11.
"Finally got my hands on a bottle of this after having it a handful of times at beer festivals. Bottled on Jan 24, 2011 and reviewed on February 9, 2011. "
"As you can see, almost 2,00 people have eloquently described the qualities of this world class ale. Rather than adding another description, I will just say that this is a beer you must try if you love well-balanced, hoppy beers."
Appearance: Golden and a little hazy.
"What can I say about this ale that hasn't previously been mentioned? Let me start by stating that I am a Chef. For years I have been writing menus and creating dishes around a wine list...so I guess I sort of understand flavor pairings. When it comes to beer, I am still a novice. Pliny is a perfect shellfish pair along the lines of a great Sauvignon Blanc. Many citrus aftertones, especially those of Ruby grapefruit and yuzu.Would work well with sashimi, crudos and ceviche. Can't wait to get my hands on more elder and hopefully get to taste the younger"
This is truly one of the best double ipas on the planet. Might even be number 1. 
"A- Clear copper with a billowy off-white head that dissipates rather quickly, but sticks to the glass fairly well."
"I was extremely excited to try this beer, i had to bribe a co-worker to bring it back from CA for me. Drank it on 01/07/11, bottled on 12/17/10 so the hops were there in full force. For the build up to trying this, I was some what let down. The hops were bright and powerful, but I felt it lacked a malt backbone. I do enjoy west coast IPA's, but I just felt the beer wasn't balanced enough for all of the hype. I know that is sacrilege on here, but that's how I feel, personally I prefer a more malt balanced DIPA, like a DFH 90 min or Lagunitas Hop Stoopid. Overall it was a good beer, but not at the level I had been reading."
It is exceedingly rare that something lives up to the hype and expectations that spread like germs across the internets. So a bigtime bravo goes to Russian River (and its reviewers) for something that managed to exceed my own unreasonably high expectations. 
Special thanks to Owsley069 for this one.
Bottle from luck at Total Wine.
Many thanks to bay cat for hooking me up with a super-fresh bottle for my first Pliny
Bout time I review this beer...
FIRST THANK YOU Ktown67 for the threesome of Plinys!
poured into a chimay snifter on a recent trip to California. Lucky that bristol farms held me a few bottles out after I called before visiting. 
"Part of a tasting hosted by vapodge, many thanks my friend!"
"Very pleasant light orange golden color. My nose gets a good freak out as the cap pops out. Poured, it shouts out loud the fragrances of a typical west coast style DIPA. Mango,Pineapple, super fresh citrus and pine resin blend in with the light body of this, extremely smooth 8% masterpiece. "
What more can be added to the well-deserved impeccable reputation of Pliny? No beer has ever burned such a clear first impression in my mind.
Have been looking forward to this moment for a while...my first Pliny!
500ml Bottle into a Founders Balloon Tulip. Bottle dated 01/12/11. Consumed 02/01/11. 
"Finally got my hands on a few bottles from John's Marketplace in Portland. Upon opening, the smell of fruit wafted out. The hops hadn't quite opened yet. It poured a hazy, golden orange. Tons of sediment and carbonation present. Upon pouring, this really opened up the nose with lots of grapefruit and apricot. The first few sips were heavy with apricot and citrus, but the back end packs a good hop bite. As the beer warmed up, the hops were more prominent, and the beer kept good head retention. I was surprised at how fruity this beer was, but how it balanced out so beautifully with the hops. Will definitely reach for another if given the chance."
Got this beer about 2 weeks old so still fresh. Looking forward to drinking some. I plan on getting a few more soon. Was as good as promised...
"One of my big, hyped holdouts. Finally got my hands on some, so here we go... Bottled on 12/13/10. Pours a crystal clear orange gold with some bright golden highlights. The head is moderate in size and appears bubbly and soapy. A few sparse wisps and chunks of lace stick around behind. "

"Commencing my BA review career with the beer that kickstarted my craft beer obsession, and the first one that showed me that quality beer makes a statement. My bottle is dated 1/24/11 - the golden nectar has only been in the bottle for five days."
"Pours a clear orange with a lot of white head. Good lacing. Not as pretty as some but a good looking beer nonetheless. Sells hoppy pine, Somme light citrus. Tastes bitter and piney. Ha ha ... Too corny. But honestly, it's a bit too one dimensional for me. It's certainly a solid dipa but not as impressive as abrasive and hopslam. Overall, a solid beer but in the 3 or 4 times I've had it i haven't been all that impressed"
"Pours a translucent amber/copper with a white, two-finger head. Some sticky lace, but it doesn't coat the glass."
"On a night of some great IPA's, this one really stood out. A very good looking beer, clear with a decent head. Not overly hoppy or carbinated, and easy to drink. Recommended by the bartender, and I was glad I listened to him. The smell was very fruity for an IPA and that great smell transfered well to the taste. I will be seeking out more Russian River beers in the future."
On tap at Verdugo in LA.
"Served from bottle into glass. Bottled on 1/12/11 So 16 days old, I think I got it the day after it came into my local Total Wine."
"Had this on 2011-01-27 in Redondo Beach, CA. It was bottled 15 days ago. Had again in Torrance , CA on 2011-03-30 from a bottle that is 13 days old. Had this again on 2015-07-02 in Columbia, PA from a bottle I bought at the brewery. It is 6 days old. And again on tap on 2016-10-15 and 2017-02-04 in Wayne, PA at Teresa's. "
Finally the great one! Thanks to Hophead247 for making the dream come true! Poured into my Ithaca tulip
reviewed via notes taken on October 28th 2010.
Big thanks to Doops for the hook up. 
"This is a good beer, certainly overhyped though. Well, its hard not to be over hyped when its the most hyped beer in the world but what can you do. "

Have had this many times finally getting around to reviewing it.
The elusive Pliny! Much thanks to itsfreeasinbeer for bringing this baby back from California for me. 
New review:
"Little else needs to be said about this beer - it is the Ideal of DIPA, and frankly of IPA's period: crisp and clean, perfume level smell crafting, mind-bogglingly well expressed flavors, and dangerous drinkability. Only minor and mostly insignificant qualm is head, which can be weak."
Bottled on 12/17/10. Still would like to try one more fresh
finally! pliny the elder! one of my whales. thanks to RBassSFHopit2ME for the bottle.
"Enjoyed on tap at Toronado in San Diego, CA."
"I had high expectations about this beer, its reputation certainly preceded it because it seemed to appeal to most beer drinkers. This is a beautiful beer, it has good color and looks quite appealing, however I thought that the mismatch of its grapefruit aroma and it's highly tart smell and it's low citrus draw made it oddly unstable on the palate. The extreme hop flavor was overpowering and only on the back end did I get any of what I was expecting. The taste is, as an Imperial IPA should be, a kick in the face of flavor, but it left me confused and wondering what the brewers thought when they tasted this paradox of smell versus taste. There are other Imperial IPAs that are true to their aromatic profile and I think that this beer seems to be an ultra-hopped beer in disguise. A good beer, but not something that I would tout as an example of a perfect beer."
This is a very aromatic IPA that is a delight to drink. The only problem is that you will drink it too fast and its hard to refill. The beer pours a golden color and has just the right amount of head. the beers smells like fruits and has the right amount of hops. I just wished i had an elder to compare this too.
"Pliny the Elder, 500ml bottle, bottled 9/23/10, opened 10/14/10. "
Finally getting around to reviewing this - has been a regular beer in the fridge since RR started brewing and bottling this on a regular basis (as well as my local WF carrying it too). This was bottled on 1/12/11 so about a week and an half old.

Poured from a 500 ml bottle into my Great Divide Brussels glass.
Big thanks goes out to JRod1969 for the opportunity to try this.
Enjoyed the beer in a tulip glass. The beer had an opaque golden color. This beer did not smack you in the face with aroma or taste. the 2 were very well balanced. The beer accentuated an entire hop profile from citrus in the forefront to more herbal pine on the back end. The bitterness did not overwhelm. The beer finished dryer than I expected but the hop bouquet lingered on the palette. 
Poured into a Duvel Tulip
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. The appearance was amber red with a slight hop haze and beautiful white head that laced the glass. Aroma was thick with grapefruit, pine, grass and other tropical fruits. The taste follows suit. A thick hop flavor with a great balance between the hope and malts. Lighter body moderate carbonation. A treat for your senses."
"On-tap at Naja's Place, Redondo Beach, CA"

Thanks to Augustgarage for popping my Pliny cherry and introducing me to the kickass world of California IPAs!
Thanks to Mike (mrunseen) for the trade.
Bottled on 12-28-2010. Big thanks to Diomede for these Fresh bottles! Split with some people at the local liquor store:
"I poured Pliny the Elder into a Dogfish Head large snifter. With a dark orange hue, it looks exceptional. A cloudiness is present which makes the beer translucent. A light white colored head appears righr after the pour and lingers throughout the drink. A decent lacing also exists."
"S - fruity, flowey and citrusy, with a little scent of hop there too. "
"I understand that PTE is brewed with 40% more malt and over twice the amount of hops as compared to Russian River's already hoppy IPA beers. I was able to acquire a Pliny bottled on 12/13/10 from a contact in California. The beer poured a golden/copper light hue; remarkably clear. This beer gave off a bitter hoppy taste initally and then picked up heavy hints of pine. Admittedly, it lacks some ""oomph"" that some IPAs do. I can see why this is a popular beer among Imperial IPA purists, but I might think this is an overhyped beer as the #2 beer in the world via Beeradvocate. I am glad to have drank this highly sought-after beer which will serve as a nice benchmark against other Imperials. I very much look forward to trying Pliny the Younger on tap someday."
Bottled on 12/17. 
"A - Pours a bright, hazy orange-golden into my snifter with a one-finger thick milky white head and medium to good retention; moderate carbonation was visible amidst the liqui (4.5)"

Draft service into a pint nonic at Russian River.
"Poured on-tap at the San Diego Brewing Co brewpub. They had it on guest tap while we were visiting. The beer was poured into a pint glass, and it poured a cloudy, golden-copper color with a thin, foamy head. The beer has smells of hops and pine, with lemon-lime notes. The flavor ursts in mouth, with citrusy-sweet notes surrounded by the bitter-greens from the hops. Perfectly balanced and smooth in mouth, with a crisp finish. There is a light, sour balance to the bitter aftertaste, and no linger despite the strong flavors and characteristics. Wow! I think I just made a mess in my pants! I'm glad I got to try this on-tap for my first PtE. Now I am just looking forward to the next time I can find it!"
Got one of these thanks to Jenray.
Had this on tap at Monks.

Went to Burgers and Brew and enjoyed three pints on tap. My friend works there and told me about this being on tap and knew I had to try it.
On tap at the source. Russian River Brewing Company
Got this one off of a trade; big thanks to Mages64. Bottled on date of 11/30/10. 
"It's a rare sight to see a Pliny in Oklahoma. I'd only heard about the mythical beer in bed time stories and only seen it grainy photographs. Somehow though, thanks to a fellow Bartian and humanitarian, I scored an elusive bottle of Pliny the Elder. "
"Yep. Just about everything I heard is true. A wee bit thin in the body and carbonation, but perfectely balanced. It is so smooth and easy to drink that I would not know this was a DIPA with an ABV of 8% if I blind tasted this. "
Reviewing off of notes. Based off of several fresh consumptions. 
I should start by saying this is candy sitting in my snifter glass. 
Bought six bottles today at local store - six was the limit I could buy. 
Received as an extra from a generous trade sideswipe through a trade and drank within about one month of the bottle date.
"From marisatheyounger, thanks so much for getting it here in time for Christmas. "
Pours a dark lemon yellow with a huge soapy white head. As the head recedes it leaves crazy stupid resiny lacing.
"Definitely the gold standard of IPA's, but the beer did not live up to the hype at all IMHO. Dollar for dollar, there are a dozen other IPA's I would rather buy."
Poured from the bottle into a tulip on 1/2/11. Pliny was bottled 11/11/10 and I received the bottle from Oregone in a trade on 12/29/10.
Bottled on 11-12-10; consumed on 1-1-11. Thanks to MRMOJORISIN for the Christmas gift. . . .
"Poured into an indian wells brewing pint glass, a clear pale yellow body color topped with a creamy 2 fingers of white head. Very little carbonation rises through the brew."
Poured into a Duvel tulip 49 days after it was bottled.
"Saved a great one for number ten. Bottled 12/17, found this beauty at pizza port bottle shop after a long day at legoland. Poured hard into my new belgium glass with a straw yellow with nice head and lacing. Nothing out of the ordinary for the style. Smell was just ok not over the top. Taste was phenomenal. Drinks great. Cheers."
"Received in a trade with jmkratt. Thanks John. Pliny the Elder is currently the highest rated American beer on Beer Advocate. Let's see if it lives up to the hype. 500mL bottle (dated 11/22/10, reviewed 12/23/10) poured into an oversized wine glass. A creamy finger-tall head forms and slowly subsides, leaving some thick lacing down the glass. The brew is auburn tinted and somewhat hazy. It's what you'd expect an IPA to look like. "
"Just happen to find this at Collins Pub in Seattle and finally get taste what the rave is all about. Appearance has a light yellow amber with a nicley held head leaving nice lace. Smell of big malt, piney, citrus grapefruit with a big hop aroma. Taste was more mild in the hops than what came out in the aroma, but still foral and complex. A very clean honey malt sweetness that balance very well with the hops with no interference of alchohol. Mouthfeel is a nice medium with good carbonation. I was not to be dissapointed with this one, this is a very clean easy drinking ale that has to be one of the best I've tried."
A - A rich electric orange that's hazy. White sticky bubbly head that laces really well to the glass. This is electric looking. 
"Gift of good friend Paul B. Hop bomb. Poured with a small off white head that lasts and lots of lace. Color is a slightly hazy amber. Aroma is firstly and foremost hops, then some malt and butter. Flavor follows nose, just much more massive. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and long. Little overmuch for my taste."

"This was my first trip to California and I walked a long distance hoping to just get a bottle of the blind pig, when I stumbled upon several bottled of this. I picked it up at the OC Wine Mart in Irvine. I sampled this on 11/9, and it was bottled on 10/8. It poured gold with a thin white head and a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma wasn't as itense as I expected considering all I had heard about this beer. I started to wonder whether this had been way overrated, but that all changed once I had tasted it. It had a wonderful piney hop taste without very much booziness or carbonation. This is the first time I had to travel to seek out a hard to find beer (at least on the east coast) and while it may not be the best beer on the planet, it is definitely the best IPA on the planet. This is not a beer that I would consider overrated, it definitely lives up to its reputation."

Breaking my order a bit to review this beer as it says ASAP.
"Took me awhile to track one of these down, I hope it will be worth it. Freshness date stamped proudly on the label, along with a multitude of do not age warnings. Pours a beautiful light golden color with a two finger head, excellent retention, and the beer leaves rings around the glass is it slowly gets consumed. Aroma is an immaculate citric hops smell, with some grapefruit...smells heavenly. Taste is mostly hops, but it strikes a perfect balance with some very subtle malt, and some grapefruit and other citric flavors in the finish. This lives up to the hype. Great carbonation helps bring out the flavors, the beer feels very smooth,rich, and full bodied, and the aftertaste has the most well done bitterness of any beer I have yet to have. The drinkability is unparalleled, I could drink these alll day and pass out happily."
"Light golden with a white head that left lacing. Amazing aroma full of floral and citrus hops! If you don't like beer, you'd still enjoy smelling this beer. Flavors of grapefruit, tropical fruit, and piney hops. This is a hoppy beer and it does have a sharp bitterness (it is 100 IBUs), but it is nicely balanced with some caramel malts. Medium bodied and well-carbonated, it finishes with a nice hop bitterness. It's very drinkable and the 8.0% ABV isn't noticeable."
500ml bottle poured into a goblet. Bottled on 11/22/10.

This is my fourth time having this beer and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it. Bottled on 11-22-10 so it is still under a month old. Poured into my DFH signature glass. 
I had this Pliny the Elder again for the first time in awhile last night to celebrate a friend's birthday! 
I shipped two 12oz bottled to NY for my friend's birthday present and we enjoyed PtE tonight.
"Wow this a superb beer, just in every way. The citrusy piney hop aroma is so yummy. As far as ipas go this is a gold standard by which other beers should be measured. You can taste the craftmenship and pride that goes into this beer. I would like to thank my fellow BA Chincino for helping me celebrate my 35th birthday with one of my fave beers."
This is a well balance beer that wants to come out and play. Light yet full of hops and flavour. 8% ABV yet it feels well balanced. 
500ml bottle poured in a ordinary glass.
"This is the best beer I ever had. Words don't do it justice. If you like full flavor beer do yourself a favor and find a bar or pub that has this epic poem to the beers gods on tap. you will not be disappointed. I cannot wait to try piney the younger, I've heard that's even better."
500 ml bottle
Review notes from 12/7/10. 
"Pours with a medium sized sticky head, golden color, slightly hazy. Aroma is,uh, hoppy; nice pine and citrus with some cannabis notes. Taste is much like aroma, plus slight sweetness and alcohol. A little sticky on the tongue - a good thing for a DIPA. Mouthfeel is medium all around, dried out by alcohol but sweetened by fruity hop flavors. Bitterness is slightly harsh, a little out of balance with the hop flavor. I can't really say I'm disappointed with a beer this tasty but it doesn't quite live up to the legend. In fact, I preferred the Blind Pig we had just prior to Pliny. It might be an age thing - my bottle was bottled on 11/11 and drank on 12/11... I hope to someday have it fresh on draft."
"A: Golden orange with brilliant clarity and a clean white head. Retention is brief, but the tight cohesive foam suggests quality carbonation ahead. The lacing is moderate-good, but in no way unusual for the style. "
Thanks to forgetfu and THECPJ for bottles recently. 
"Pours a golden orange color with a Foamy white head. Aroma is a combination of Grapefruit and pine hops - I tasted lemon, grapefruit, and bits of other tropical fruits. There may be slight malt sweetness. Aroma, again, is an explosion of citrus with a wonderful pine hop finish at the end. Medium to Full body, Finish is surprisingly dry. Got this from my sister in Puyallup Washington. Some 2IPA's (Lake Erie Monster, 90 min.) have a lot of Malt Character, not this one"
Thanks jenray for the trade and the opportunity to try this!

"Had the chance to try this the first time from my wife's cousin Chris who was generous enough to share it with me (along with a Westy 12 the same day. Chris, you da' man!). Reviewed when I had it again after my buddy kyle brought it back from his honeymoon in Cali. straight from the brewery, born just 3 weeks ago. Thanks for thinking of me bro!"

Served on tap at the RR brewpub. 
"Served in a Stella chalice. Two fingers of creamy foam. A deep golden reddish hue is welcoming me to drink. Smells of rich hop goodness. In the mouth, a perfect balance of hoppiness and fine rich malt. Finishes dry and repeat. A customer gave me this and I thank him very much."
"Thanks to bombadil for the trade. 1 pint 9oz. bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip Style Glass. When I cracked it open the foam crept it's way to the top of the bottle and one big bubble came up and came over the top. I've had that happen a few times but usually the bottle in some way got shaken up a little bit, but not this time. The beer pours out a light golden/amber color, a little lighter than I expected, slightly lighter than most DIPA's I've had. There was initially a big, thick, orange, creamy colored frothy head. I thought there was going to be a fair amount of lacing, but there really wasn't, the lace trickles it's way down after each sip. A little disappointing, but still pretty good. "
Poured my first Pliny (props to Jolon for hooking it up) into a Duvel tulip with the aroma filling the air. 
A. Bright and golden in color with excellent clarity and absolutely no haze. Snow-white fluffy head that leaves behind thick lacing. As the foam settles the carbonation remains.
Want to give BleedsLakerP&G a big shout out for hooking me up with this -
Drinking in celebration of FSU beating UF for the first time in 6 years. Traded working that day for one of these bad boys.
On-tap at Capone's
Bottle dated 11/2
beer pours a clear amber with white head
"From notes (2010 Capone's Black Friday event). Hype doesn't become hype by mere coincidence, you know..."
"A: Very beautiful gold/amber color with faint white head. I poured it slowly so it didn't build much. It leaves a sticky lacing. When drinking, the tiny bubble carbonation moves in the glass like fireworks."
"What is there to say about this beer. It has been reviewed over and over again. It is a great beer, plain and simple so to speak. I received this beer from a friend and the appearance was a nice amber colouring that just glowed in the light. The smell had a great hoppey quality that you just had to smell before every sip. The taste was good not exceptional. The reason why I say this is due to the fact I believe that it would have tasted better fresh. The bottle I had seemed to not be as hoppey as I would have hoped. "
Finally my first Pliny. Poured into my favorite westmalle chalice. Beer is a darker shade of orange but still glowing. The smell is a perfect balance of sweet and acidity. The sweet is pineapple tanderine and the acidic is orange and a hint of lemon zest. Taste is off the wall! Ive always said that a perfect beer is well balanced. This one comes as close to percfection as it gets. The mouth feel is soft and inviting. I could drink this all day long.
"Had on tap at Capone's Restaurant in East Norriton, PA. Presented in a 12 oz. tulip glass by Matt Capone himself..."
"This brew pours a non see through honey hue with nice carbonation and lacing everywhere,the smell is beautiful with notes of floral bouquets,honeydew,honeysuckle and stonefruit,and with the taste it just gets better the mouthfeel is ever so smooth and exudes flavours of passionfruit,honeydew,lychees,some very light pale malts and finishes with a super smooth tiny tinge of stonefruit bitterness but to be honest this bitterness is not really bitter its just so right its not funny and overall this is one exceptional brew that im so glad ive tried and to be honest its right up there with the best beers i have sampled and the only other thing i can say is Russian River know how to brew beers."
Had this on tap at the Falling Rock Taphouse. It's nice to visit Denver...
"turns out I've been drinking this forever and never reviewed it... great IPA, second best to the younger. well its safe to say I love the pliny's. it is light yellow with little to no white head. smell is biiig hops, pine and citrus. its slightly floral, but not like roses, like citrus blooms. taste is amazing. massive hops with amazing balance. it fills my mouth with joy. also very drinksble"

Special thanks to my friend TBar for brining spinrsx and I back two bottles.
"This is the third or fourth time I've had Pliny, but the first from the bottle. This beer definitely lives up to expectations. The beer is pale amber color with a little rocky white head. However, as soon as you open up the bottle, the beer explodes with beautiful aroma. The smell is intoxicating, like super dank marijuana, just cut pine bows and freshly peeled grapefruit. The beer is overloaded with hops, it tastes just like it smells and the dank chronic flavor just envelopes my tongue, I think I'm about to getting high from this! There is just a hint of pineapple juiciness and grain sweetness that accompanies the long lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel has the perfect amount of carbonation, tannic and full-bodied. This is exceptionally drinkable and delicious. The 500 ml will not be enough."
Poured a golden straw color with a quarter inch of white bubbled head on it. Little sediment but nothing major.
From notes on 03/25/2010
"Poured a nice amber color, slightly darker than some IPA's."
Appearance: Shinny new copper color with a nice one and a-half finger head.

"First Pliny enjoyed at Spinnerstown with Jim and Brian. Had this beer along with Damnation, Consecration and Temptation so I will review again later when I am more focused. But I cant think of an IPA/DIPA or any beer that I've had that I would honestly drink before this one. So balance and frighteningly easy to drink for 8%. Took a growler for the fridge and will definitely seek out in the near future. Thanks again to John, Jim and Brian for the great company."
Poured into my Duvel tulip glass
I had this on tap at the Spinnerstown Hotel. I got there shortly after it was tapped. Been wanting to try the PTE for a long time and just walked into this. It was served in a tulip glass probably 12 oz. Amber in color with a thick white finger plus head. The smell was fantastic. The hops dominate with grapefruit up front by a small amount of lemon.
"Ahhh, one of the Holy Grails of the beer world. This pours a very clear and sparkling copper. The head laces the glass as the beer is consumed. The aroma is deliciously and divinely hoppy: citrus, grapefruit, cantaloupe, mango, tropical fruit, and a bit of clean and light pine. Every aroma is matched in the flavor. This is a hop head's delight. The finish is bitter. The aftertaste is clean, matching the flavors, all of which linger on the palate. This is the second time I have had Pliny and it is as good as I remember. If you like American hop forward IPA's, this is a classic, excellent and high benchmark example of the style. This beer is so exquisitely tasty, it is hard to believe it is 8% ABV. Bottled on 10-18-10."
Great deep orange color. Decent foamy white head. Dissipated into a ring which left lacing down the glass as I went.
Part 2 of a Russian River IPA tasting.
So I finally got a hold of the Holy Grail and I was not disappointed
"This is my first Pliny, received in trade from generous BA ClarkGriswald. Thanks again, Mark! Poured into a snifter."
"Enjoyed on one of a few BA/Rare Beer Night Tastings during the month of September 2010. I was not able to take deatiled notes on this one, but I did make some shorthand and took mental notes in order to prepare a small review. I plan to take more deatiled notes on my next opportunity to try this rare find."
"Another infamous beer is siting in front of my face. A few months ago I was able to enjoy the Westvleteren 12, the highest rated beer on the planet. Now I am about to enjoy a bottle of the Russian River Pliny the Elder; the second highest rated beer on the planet. I have learned quite a lot about drinking these so notoriously famed beers, most notably is not to concern yourself so much with its fame. This could be the most powerful influence on your perception of taste before you have even had the beer. So to best enjoy and evaluate the beer you must ignore it. So I will say no more of its rank. "
500ml Bottle
"I have now had several bottles of this, ranging from 8 days old to 6 weeks old and all of them were quite good."
Thanks to DJMichaelk for this! Bottled on 9/21/10
"I expected BIG things from this Ale. TOTALLY OVER RATED!!! One dimensional with no sophistication . Tasted like a pine cone or kitty litter, take your pick, Very short after taste that finished like balsa wood. Can't figure out all the hype??? I tasted this with 2 other Beer Drinkers, and we all felt the same."
"I was fortunate enough to have some Pliny shared with me. This particular beer had been bottled only 28 days before we opened it, so I feel confident it was a fairly accurate representation of how it should taste. This poured a deep golden or copper color with a decently sized white head. Head retention was good and it left a little lacing. Smell was of citrus and fruit in addition to the hoppy smell. I found it interesting that the smell highlighted the citrus but the beer has more of a pine flavor in the taste. Starts out with the citrus and a little bit of pine hop, then hits the little bit of malt in the middle and finishes off with a bitter pine hop. Mouthfeel is good, light/medium body with moderate carbonation. At first I didn't really appreciate Pliny, but I think I get it now. It's been a few months since I tried it last and now, as I sit outside a SoCal bar I appreciate Pliny. It still isn't my most favorite IPA or DIPA but it definitely makes the top 3. This is some dang good beer."
A - Pours gold/light amber with adequate slightly off-white head. Dissipates to a thin ring leaving plenty of laces on the glass.
Thanks to BigBlacke for helping me find this in Florida.
"I have had this beer on tap at the brewery, but this review is a bottle shipped to me from a beer buddy. "
"Pint on tap at the Hulmeville Inn, 10/29"
"500ml bottled on 10/8/10, enjoyed 11/3/10 in a pint glass."
Appearance: light color with a white head and lacing 
Thanks to bauermj for the trade! Poured a 9/23 PtE on 11/3 into a nonic. A solid one inch of glorious white head. Fell over 5 minutes and left a nice lace around the glass.
"A-Amber, finger and a half of head. "
"wow. i dont even think this is the freshest bottle ever, but wow this is one heck of beer. it pours well, with a little head, and has great lacing. it smells like the one of the best double ipas ever. thats really the best i can describe it. but there is definitely are piney smell, with a lot of citrus and some hops. the tast is awesome. just perfectly balanced with hops and citrus. the finish is really clean with just a little hops aftertaste. "
"Bottled 10/08, poured into a snifter at 52.8 degrees, warming slightly during the tasting."
500ml bottle shared with cgymatt oct19 2010
Bottled on 07/05/10
"A - Looks just like any other typical ipa, with a light oak tone."
"Appears a pale copper slightly hazed body with a nice sized off white orange tinted head. This stuff appears to be super fresh bottled on 10/08/10, poured from a 500 ml bottle that gives a message about not aging this beer, duh. Head retention is great lacing is chunky and left behind in uneven patterns on my imperial pint glass. I was digging the history lesson about Pliny on the label, nice touch all hail the man who dubbed the hop plant. "
10/8/2010 bottle date (It's 10/28) so as fresh as one might hope drinking it in Michigan.
"500ml bottle poured into an oversized snifter. Huge thanks to russwbeck for this bottle, Russ is good people. Bottled on 09/21/2010"
Bottled on 10/8/10 - so relatively fresh.
500 mL bottle received as an extra from womencantsail! Thank you so much man!
A - Burnt orange color. Decent size head.
Updated from 10/26/10 review ((S-.5) other notes still ok):
Has a finger length head that quickly fades into about half an inch. Kinda yellow/gold foam. The Smell is very fruity citrisy hops.
"You've undoubtedly seen and heard all the superlatives about this beer. Thanks to ""Mages64"" for sending this along. My bottle was dated as brewed 9/23/10. So at least I got to this within about a month. It truly is an excellent product. The 8% alcohol is very well hidden. I enjoyed my serving in a tulip glass. The beer changes character, for the better, as it warms slightly. It reveals not only piney citrus, but hints of caramel malt. And although the piney-ness is predominant, it's smoooth and silky in the mouth. A terrific compliment to spicy tacos. All I can say is: go get some. Whether you are a fan of IPAs, a ""hop head"" or not, you'll like this one."
500ml bottle poured into my Duvel tulip glass. 
"Appearance: Golden in color with white head. It has great color and clarity. This beer also sports a descent cap. However, the cap does not stay intact very long."
"Poured from the 20oz bottle into a Maudite tulip glass. Body is a slightly cloudy golden-orange color, topped by a swirling, creamy white head that gradually recedes to a thin coating, leaving some pretty lacing on the glass. Aroma of floral, grassy hops, with notes of grapefruit and pineapple, accented by just a touch of cereal-grain sweetness."
13th review on BA
"Appearance-Pours into glass a shimmering, golden-yellow with about two fingers of long lasting, persistent and lacy head. As I hold it up to the light the orange-ish highlights shine outward and and seemingly bathe this beer in shimmering gold. The lacing on this beast is so sticky it's downright nuts, it just won't drip down the rim, and the head refuses to go away; if this ain't a 5 I don't know what is."
Pours a hazy golden color with about two fingers of fluffy white head.
Naven hooked me up with a fresh 500ml bottle of Pliny. Bottled 9.23.2010
"A legendary beer, heres my two cents..."
"This beer is a clear gold with about a half inch foamy head and bubbles that just keep rising. The smell is very refreshing with apples and maybe pineapple. It makes me think of early summer fruit. The mouthfeel isn't quite what I expected. A bit salty at first. Quite bitter. The taste is overwhelming and takes a little bit to get used to. It's quite flowery and the hops are very noticeable. Not as clean and fruity as I was expecting from the smell. A very nice beer, but I don't think I would drink this regularly."
Found this on tap at a bar in Ft. Collins.
"I actually never planned on reviewing and will probably not do a ton of them. However, I feel like this beer deserved my time to do a review. Bottle Date: 9/23/10; Review: 10/16/20 "
On tap @ Russian River Brewpub
Poured from bottle into snifter. DOB 9/23/10. Thanks emagana for the hook up!
500 ml bottle into pint glass (bottled 9/29/10)
Served on tap into a 10.5 oz tulip.
Really gotta give a shout out to Mbpbugeye for sharing this with me. Who knows how long it would have been before I got to try this otherwise... thanks Seth!
500ml bottle pour into a hour glass shaped glass.
"I've had a few friends travel to the coast but never had a chance to grab any Pliny...tonight I finally get the opportunity. I'm a hop head at heart though I rarely trade for IPAs as who really knows when a beerwas bottled unless it says on the bottle. This one, bottled 9/24/10"
"Had this dozens of times from bottles and on tap, reviewing this one from a very fresh bottle. Pours a clear light orange gold with a soapy white head. Nose is very bright, loads of hops express white grapefruit rind, dank pine forest, and almost a candy-like quality. Balance of flavors is straight up deft here, walks a brilliant line between bright, bitter citrus and a chewy candy sweetness. Luscious and juicy in the mouth. Having this from a bottle at 3 weeks old or so is an awesome experience."
"500ml bottle, 9/07/2010 poured into a globe glass on 10/06/2010 in honor of the first day of the NHL's season. I figured this should do it justice."
500ml poured into cervoise. Bottled 82610. Reviewed 101010.
So I finally had a Pliny. I guess my conclusion is that it does live up to the hype.
I felt I needed to drink this beer a few more times before attempting to review it.
"Bottled 09-21-2010, consumed 10/10/2010."
"Appearance - orange/gold color as others have mentioned, nice white head."
Bottled 9-23-10 Consumed 10-9-10
"My first review here, after trying this double IPA I just had to write a review to express my love for it. Also, I'm just a noob of a beer drinker but I'm just lovin craft brews."
Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. Shout out to Azurescens for the hook-up.
Poured from 500mL bottle into 16oz Samuel Adamps Perfect Pint glass.
"What can I say about Pliny that hasn't been said? Not much, but I'll add my voice to the consensus that this is one of the very best American beers."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a orange-ish hint, and a white head. In the aroma, sweet citrus, grapefruit and orange rinds. In the taste, grapefruity to orange citrus hops and a sweet maltiness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry citrus hop aftertaste. Big west coast hops, hides the alcohol, easy drinking and great."
Bottled on 9/21/10; consumed on 10/4/10. Thanks to Murchmac for sending a super fresh one my way!
Bottled 09-23-2010. Poured into Stone IRS snifter.
"Hands down my favorite beer of all time. What else is there to say that everyone else has not put. If you ever have a chance, drink this at the bar and not at home from the bottle. The atmosphere @ the bar and this beer with a thing of drew bites is amazing"
"Quite simply one of the most complex, well-balanced, easiest drinking beers you'll ever enjoy. Its myriad flavors are somehow blended in a way that accessible to even the most novice beer drinker. It's a brew that completely lives up to the hype. If you're ever in NorCal, it's worth a stop in Santa Rosa."
A- Hazy copper. Light head that dissipates rapidly.
Thanks to ScreamForMe for getting these bottles to me in a trade. 
A= Golden Amber color very nice head and lacing.
"Bomber poured in a snifter. Bottled about four weeks ago and shipped to IL from CA, so fresh but not ideally fresh."
"Thanks to Eric and Doug for hooking me up with this as part of our trade. This is my last one so I figured I better review it before they're all gone. Cloudy orange-copper pour with decent head and great lacing. Lots of citrus in the big west coast nose. Huge tangerine and grapefruit aroma with a hint of pine and orange zest. A nice tangy hop bitterness is present and builds throughout, but is nicely offset by the sweet malts, making this a very well balanced beer. Nice crisp, dry finish, and the alcohol is almost non-existent for such a big beer. This is one of those scary drinkable beers and gets better as it warms. It reminds me a lot of Alesmith IPA, one of my favorite beers. I'd love to try this on tap. This beer lived up to the hype and I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. Thanks again Eric and Doug!"
"Pliny the Elder. The word legendary comes to mind. Russian River's famously hopped IPA has been out of reach for me, at least until now. A recent excursion to Denver for the GABF yielded a surprisingly bountiful harvest, including a fresh bottle of the Elder. To say I'm excited about finally getting the opportunity to sample this beer would be an understatement. In many respects, I feel like I've been waiting my whole life to try this brew. "
Reviewed from my tasting notes of a decent sized sample I consumed at an epic tasting event held with the members of the SMBDC. This bottle was opened on August 28th and had been bottled on August 15th.
"500ml bottle into a chalice. Love the history lesson on the bottle, and love the call to drinking IPAs fresh in the cellar-everything era. This bottle was bottled on: 09/07/10 (picked it up from Southern Colorado Liquors on 09/16/10) and consumed on 09/16/10. 3rd time I've had the pleasure ..."
this DIPA is 100% perfect in every way...not much else to really say...
"After many years of waiting, a friend brought me back a bottle while he was in Denver for GABF."
A- Medium glow light amber look.
"Reviewed from notes after having had this at Monks a few weeks ago. The color is a light amber/slightly orange with a nice sized head and some moderate lacing. Hoppy and sweet in the nose, the smell is powerful and inviting. the taste leans slight more toward malty with a hint of grapefruit. The taste is incredibly balanced. While the hop presence is strong, it's not as bitter as many hoppy beers are and just goes down smoothly. I love this beer. First time I had it I felt a little underwhelmed from the hype, but the more I drink it and compare it to other DIPAs, I realize it's beauty as the balance is what really makes this beer excellent. Cheers!"
"A thick, dense, white head atop a hazy, pale gold body with shades of orange."
here it is. the holy grail. bottled two weeks ago.

Review from BeerAdvocate magazine Vol. III Issue I:
Bottled 8/15/2010. Poured from bottle into a snifter on 9/19/2010. Received this beer through trade from domtronzero.
"On tap for the Hopfest event at The Drafting Room in Exton, PA. Served in 10 oz tapered cone glasses. First time having this bad boy."
Bottle date 08/25/10 Drank on 09/17/10. Not the freshest but the best I could get.
Had this on tap at Higgins Restaurant and Bar in Portland.
"Last year I had this on tap and it was the best thing I ever tried in my life. I literally took out my laptop at the bar and started looking for jobs in Seattle (where I was at the time) just so I could have this on a regular basis. So my friend was in Seattle last week on vacation and I told her she had to buy me a bottle of this. Bottle date Aug 16, 2010, so about a month old... hope it is fresh enough."
"I've now had PtE several times while out in CA visiting relatives. Each time, it has been in the standard pint bottles, but I did find it on tap once at Beachwood too. This is a review of the bottled version, although I should note the hops popped much more on tap."
"I have tasted a lot this many years, but this is the exceptional! And so far, I've only had a bottle!It has a fine finish, a lot more ipa, and is more than a bottle, that is, a full pint is FULL. A finer taste, 2 beers is all that can drink at a time.Eight percent is fine and can only handle 2 bottles a sitting."
August 11th bottling poured into a snifter
"Bottled on August 11, 2010"
Finally get to try this one thanks to djmichelk. 500 ml. bottle poured into my snifter. Bottled on 8-25-2010
"Came into this one with absurdly high expectations. So much hype surrounding this one, I actually felt like there was no way I could NOT be disappointed. It was with these expectations that I tried my first Pliny."
Poured from a 16.9oz bottle (bottled on 8/25/10) into a Duvel tulip glass. Have to give a big thanks to my buddy Beek out in Santa Rosa for sending me this 3 week old bottle.
"My unofficial 250th review. I waited a little bit before posting this review, it is copied directly from my notes. Pint bottle poured into a snifter glass. Bottle is dated 8/16/2010 (review written 9/9/10)."

"Bottled 8/16/10. Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass, leaving a one finger head, opening up wonderful aroma with citrus that involves grapefruit and orange. The aroma is an great pre-cursor."
A - nice golden straw color with a little bit of a pinkish-orange hue to it. Beautiful head with tons of cling
had on-tap at a Russian River event at a local bar. Finally get to see what all the hype is about. Served in a tulip glass. 
A - Slightly foggy light orange that is bordering on yellow. Finger and a half of foamy white head.
I have had this both in bottles and on tap more times than I can count. Bottles are nearly as good as the tap if they are within two weeks of bottling. Nice price too. This rating comes from my notes and the first time I had the beer about three years ago. 
Poured from a 500ml bottle into my glass. Bottled 8/16/10.

"Really what is there to say about this beer? So I'm reviewing it from Tap. but I've had the pleasure of having it out of bottles that were filled the day before, so that was beyond fresh. "
Holy canoli!! I finally get to review this beer! 
bomber served in an oversized wineglass. bottled 08-25-10. (big thanks to my wife for fetching the long awaited PtE from california.)
"I had the opportunity to visit the Russian River Brewery in Santa Rosa, CA and draw a fresh one off the tap. While not an expert by any stretch, this was one fine beer- I cannot say that it's one of the best in the world. Russian River is well worth the visit, if able. The food is very good and the price reasonable. There's always a bit of a wait and you'll have to deal with a few local beer snobs. The 20-tap sampler alone is worth the trip. Great beer in a very friendly place that may be worthy of some extra mileage."
"This one courtesy of chswimmer, cheers man!"
"Really great beer. Pretty much everything I look for in an IPA. It was really fresh and crisp, delicious and satisfying. A light amber in color with a nice inch of head. A fruity and vibrant nose that let me know I was in for the type of beer I really like. A really smooth, quenching flavor that has a nice bright grapefruit and pine taste. "
A. golden color with a 2 finger head 
Ordered this beer at Poppy's Pizza in Estes Park. It came to the table in the bottle with a stemmed glass.
Russian River Brewing Company--Pliny The Elder--2008 16.9 oz. Bottle. 8.00% ABV. 80 IBU's? (4.75+ / 5.0) IPA--Imperial. No sediment. Lacy foamy rich head. Cloudy bright lemon orange gold fizzy color. Huge floral grapefruit pine hop ester front. Crisp mild sweet hop oil pale malt grassy grapefruit body. Easy balanced hop spice pine citrus end. WOW!! Floral hop infused crisp IPA. Sampled 1/6/2009. 4 @ $4.99 Each.
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice white head with low carbonation. The aroma is of citrus and piney hops. The color is a deep golden with no haze. The taste is the piney hops up front and a sweet malty backbone. The body is a touch heavy, but not overpowering. It's a nice example of a west coast big IPA or DIPA."
Originally reviewed 4 days fresh 3 months ago with a rather dull review. After having more of this I have decided to make my first edit to a beer review.
Pours a clear golden/honey color with 2 fingers of head that recedes to froth on the surface and leaves lacing on the glass.
Bottled on 7/28/2010. My roommate picked this up while in Santa Rosa for a wedding. Very grateful for the opportunity!
"Pours a nice yellow gold into an Ommegang Belgian glass. Fine, perfect white head that sits on the top 1/2 inch of the glass. Aromas of pine and citrus, flavor is of fresh grapefruit, lemongrass, and biscuit malt. Fresh hop aroma and pleasant bitterness balance the refreshingly substantial yet masked malt backbone. Excellent balance, excellent hop profile, superb drinkability. "
"Received in a trade from Loki83. Bottled 8/10, drank 8/28."
"I've probably drank PTE over a 100 times, but I'm on this bend lately to stop being lazy and start reviewing all the beers I drink. So bear with me...."
"Alrighty, here we go again with Pliny the Elder! Considered by many to be the holy grail of IPA's, I've decided to re-review this beer since it's been a while since I've had it, and I've accustomed a bit more of a taste for hoppy beer since then :)"

"Visited Russian River's brewery and picked up a case. Bottled on August 16th, 2010"
Bottled 7-28-10. Enjoyed out of a New Belgium tulip.
"As a deep-rooted east coast treestump, I tried and failed to be cool when I saw PTE (for only $5!) in the first San Francisco bar I visited on a recent California beer pilgrimage. When the publican reached for the tap handle and I realized that this legendary brew would actually be mine, I quivered like a tweenybopper stricken with Bieber Fever. I accepted a cool pint glass of honey-colored ale, yellower than the average IPA, a little hazy with a stiff inch of foam on top. A deep whiff: stonefruit, flowers, something faintly pungent that isn't quite spice. Very complex. Huge intensity from the first sip. More of the peachy fruit character, lavender, pine needles, a peep of acidity on the midpalate. Strong taste of alcohol on the finish tangles the flavor tapestry just a little, but what else do you expect from a mega-brew like this? Lovely texture--I had downed three by the time I returned to ""Earth"". The hype is real, the volume is eleven. Truly the ""Back in Black"" of beers."
"Looks great on the pour, though others look as good: nice head, solid lacing as I went on."
Poured from a 500ml bottle into a Reidel Stemless Red Wine Glass.

"Got this beer in a pint glass at the Toronado. Nice to finally get a glass of what everyone is talking about, though I wish I had the opportunity to have this more readily available to me. It deserves more than a couple tastings."
"I had my first PtE thanks to a friend who just came back from a CA vacation and brought back a bottle for each of his homebrewing friends. It was bottled on 7-28-10, just 2 weeks old."

"Drink this one very often, so this is from a few days ago."
A - Golden Copper color with thin white head which fades quickly and leaves a good amount of lacing on the DFH signature glass.
"had at TND's this past weekend on a beer haul. pours a copper yellow transparent color with good off white head, good lacing, and soft carbonation. strong fruity piney smell whiched followed through into the taste. soft bitter piney taste with grapfruit hints, and some caramel malt hints as well. light grassy bitter finish. thin texture and long flavor duration. smooth and crisp. IMO this beer was very good but in no way lived up to the hype. i was expecting much better and was slightly let down. still a very good beer just a little over hyped."
"A two week old bottle of Pliny the Elder, poured into a tulip glass. Golden color with a persistent pale white head that laces beautifully as you drink from the glass. "
"I truly think this beer has become my favorite beer. Up until recently this beer has been a distant experience. Thanks the great beer shop in Orange, California, the accessibility is some what acceptable. "
"I had the opportunity to drink this on 8-7-10 with a friend of mine. What can I possibly say that has not already been said about this beer before. This truly is liquid pakalolo;) The smell and taste was bitter, hoppy, and had a piney resin taste that truly reminded me of the ""happy weed""! One of the best beers I have had and will be looking forward to drinking more of this!"
Poured from pint bottle
I can't expound anymore on this beer than what has been said already.
"Pours a clear golden color that explodes with a fluffy white head. The nose is an absolute burst of hops - never smelled a more intense fragrance of hops before. Resin, pine and citrus. Unfortunately, while still being good, I felt like the taste didn't quite measure up to the aroma. Tastes of resiny hops and pine primarily, with citrus/grapefruit under that. Body is great - medium bodied, good carbonation."
"Bottled 7/14/10. Smell has lots going on resin, pine caramel, orange and grapefruit are all present and intermingle with each other nicely. Taste has pine and grapefruit dominating with a very light almost charcoal character to it as the bitterness makes its presence known towards the end. It's almost too bitter for me at the end, which is really the only thing wrong with it. Mouthfeel is slighty sticky and oily but overall is light but viscous. Alcohol isn't really noticeable at all making this easy to drink."
"A: Light, golden, and so bubbly; the bubbles just float effortlessly to the top collecting among themselves into the frothy, white, billowing head"
Poured into a St. Bernardus glass.
"Pours a light orange with a pearl white head. Good retention and the lacing is unbelievable. Great looking DIPA. Strong floral and citrus hop aroma, very enjoyable. This one is for hop lovers. Floral, citrus (predominately grapefruit) strong hop flavor off the bat. Followed by a strong pine and spicy hop. All the hops are incredibly balanced and showcased. A bready, semi-sweet malt shines through near completion before finishing with another kick of strong pine hops. Awesome job balancing the big flavors."
Russian River Pliny the Elder 
My New Years resolution for 2010 was to drink as many different beers as I could possibly find. So Far so good. I have had 597 different beers from January 1st at noon until today July 30th and Pliny The Elder is by far my favorite. A friend in California has managed to get me not 1 but 2 of these to Massachusetts (thanks Sue!) and I can honestly say that this beer makes me want to move to California. The Aroma will hit your nose from two feet away as soon as you pop the cap. Grapefruity and inviting. If you have ever eaten something so delicious that you find yourself craving it weeks later...well....you know where I'm going. I have read reviews knocking this hoppy delight and reviews praising it. My opinion after almost 600 different beers in 7 months is...get one ...drink one....it really is an outstanding beer. There's Filet Mignon...There's Dom Perignon...and looking down on both of them is Pliny The Elder.
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a snifter. Bottled on 7/5/2010, split with airohead2001. I had this one time on tap in Portland, Oregon, but this review is strictly from the bottle"
"The DIPA of DIPAs - one I've had several times before, but have never taken the time to review. This one is fresh - bottled 07/05/10 - courtesy of glazeman."
Poured from a bottle into a Chimay goblet. Bottled on 6/30/10.
"Big big respect to Spdkilz (Carleton) for being such a great BA!! Pliny bottled on 07/05/10. I'd say this pours honey orange with a great poofy white head that sticks around for a while. After that head fades it leaves a fare amount of lacing around the sides of my Duvel tulip glass. The hop aroma coming off of this beer is something I've never experianced. It is like I am sticking my head in the hop fridge at my home brew supply store. 1st resinous piny hops, then citrus and grapefruit huge aroma. The taste is a hop assault. The malt profile is just so that it allows the hops to shine. Bitter, citrusy, fruity and sprucy/piny and oh so good. I think this is the 1st beer I've given 2 5.0 ratings too. The mouthfeel is what I would expect from an ipa. Yes folks pliny is great, but whether I could drink more then 2 of these guys is another story so a little lower score for drinkability. Man this is some great beer."
A: pours clear golden yellow with a bit of white head. The clarity is wonderful.
"Poured into my Duvel tulip, bottles on 6/8/10"
This is truly one of the greatest IPA's I have ever tasted!
Thanks to bierenutz for the great birthday gift.
"Yes, I'm reviewing this a third time, this time out of a growler. Why not?"
Stopped at Russian River Brewing Company because one of us was sure that they brewed Pliny the Elder. One of us was right.
"Appearance is a copper/amber color. I have seen some IPAs lighter but for a IIPA, this was about right. Good amount of head too."
My sixth bottle enjoyed starting 8 days after the bottled on date (May 12th) until now (July 20th). A combination of reviews.
"This is my favorite beer. Smell says ""drink me."" Hops are strong -- strong, strong, strong -- but without any harshness. This is a real trick and Russian River pulls it off. Flavors are complex and balanced. Carbonation is perfect. I only wish Russian River had better distribution so more people could taste this beer (and so it was more available to me.)"
"The best beer I've ever had. It lives up to the hype and keeps me begging for more. Now that I can get it in the SFV, i expect to spend many nights with my dear new friend Pliny. "
"Presented in a brown, 500 ML bottle with a bottled on date of: 06-30-10."
Appearance - A creamy head with medium carbonation and a golden amber color. Pretty standard looking for the IPA style. 4.0/5.0
"Poured into my SN XXX glass, this beer pours a sunburnt orange with about a one inch thick head. "
many thx to doodler for this beauty
thanks to enelson for this one! split with e11a627 and newk340
Poured into a chimay chalice and enjoyed with hu5om and newk340.
"After having this beer multiple times, it's finally time for me to sit and review this. The body is a seductive mandarin orange color that is slightly murky from hop resin. The appearance of the head reminds me of a still photograph of seafoam but with a creamy light tan color. "
sampled with hu5om and e11a627.
"This beer had a lot of hype to hold up to and it absolutely surpassed that. I went into this with an open mind and said mind was blown. absolutely incredible. best ipa i have ever had in my life. poured a dark copper...not a lot of head or apparent carbonation. Immediately I could smell hops, wheat and peaches and the taste matched just that.. very complex but not overdone. Tastes of peaches.. but not too sweet..nothing like a lambic or sour mash so do not get that impression. This beer had the perfect amount of hop-ness and bitterness to go with the fruit and earthy feel. Mouthfeel was great.. perfect amount of carbonation gave way to a very clean finish. If it wasnt at 8 percent..I could have quite a few of these.. but they do pac a punch."
"Bottled on 6.21.10, drank it last night. Really can't say anything that hasn't already been said a million times, except that it's quite simply unbelievable that an 8.0% is this easy to drink. The mouthfeel and smoothness is simply unparalleled; it's practically a pine-y, citrus soda. It's not a stretch to say you could easily put away three bottles in an hour were it not for the 8.0 ABV. Not sure how Vinny does it. "
"The much anticipated Pliny review, I was half expecting fireworks to start shooting out of the bottle and then it would offer to get me another and magically refill itself. Once I got by my expectations and began to focus on the beer, I began to realize how good it was."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass until the foam overtook the top of the glass (not to worry, no spill)."
"Growler from the brewery, into a perfect pint (many, many times...). Had this many times, finally sitting down to review it in the perfect environment -- home!"
A - Slightly more than a fingers worthy of big chunky batter-like slightly off white head... Modest retention fades to leave an uneven lacing that is veiled in sections and chunky in others with a full ring of faom around the edge of the glass... A dense medium golden orange color with a slight glow... Sparse small bubbled sluggish carbonation rises along the sides of the glass... Loads of lacing cling to the sides of the glass... 
"500 milliliters bottled on 5/26/2010, served into a 12 ounce brandy snifter, drank at 50 degrees and 55 degrees. Received via phone order from a California store. "
"Lots of thanks to realmpel for shipping this to me. As an IPA lover (in all forms - DIPA, IIPA included), this was THE one I have been waiting for. Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a tulip. Freshness date 6/21/10."
I was lucky enough to receive this bottle from a friend. I was super excited knowing the hype that surrounds this and many other Russian River beers. The bottle was dated 5/10/10. I poured the beer into a snifter.
"I finally snagged an ever-elusive bottle here in Southern California. I got the last four bottles of a 3 case shipment that just showed up a few hours ago. Man, this beer disappears fast."
"Received from Scottfrie in a trade, thank you very much! "
Reviewed from notes.
"Baby steps. The first time I had this one I wasn't prepared. Now I've revisited it after some ""seasoning""."
"A- golden color, slightest haze, lumpy creamy head if poured aggresively."
"Like so many other obsessed enthusiasts and alcoholics, this is one of my all-time favorite beers. Its heavy, strong, and sometimes overwhelming aroma is incredible and inspiring. The pungence of Pliney commands any pot smoker to drink beer and any beer drinker to pay attention. Pliny is the secret mistress of any IPA lover, its contact-high inducing aroma erecting senses and inducing appreciation. "
Served in a Dogfish Head snifter.
"A: Hazy, ice tea brown. Bubbles racing too the top. Quickly dissipating head."
"A - Pours a very nice golden color with a two finger white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Good lacing. Great heavy carbonation, same as most RR brews."
"500ml bottle courtesy my sister from Seattle. Bottled May 17, 2010, consumed a little over a month old. "
"Poured from a week old bottle. Appearence is light amber / golden color, with an off white head that hangs out a bit. Great lacing all the way down the glass. Flavors are a great balance of ever so slight bitter hops and sweet malt flavor. Tasted sweet honey, grapefruit, creamy butter, and slight tang of orange peel. On the palate it is medium bodied beer with a great balance of dry and refreshing finish. Overall one of the best beers I have had to date. Perfect beer for any morning, afternoon, or night!!!"
Have had Pliny the Elder a couple times at The Beveridge Place Pub in West Seattle. Great pub. Both times I had Pliny it was just about the perfect beer. I could not get enough. It was so well made with layers of flavor and hops from start to lingering finish.
"For several years I thought this beer was the be all end all IPA and it was. Recently, I've noticed the hop aroma and flavor has become less prominent. "
I finally tried my first Pliny the Elder this evening that I got in trade and was happy to try my first. As soon as I poured it into my glass you could smell the hoppyness and had a nice 2-3 finger head. It had a extremely pleasant citrousy and piny aroma. At the first sip there were strong citrus and grapefruit taste with the right amount of hops. 
Thanks Hygmod for driving this one out from California!
Served from a bottle. Shared from my buddy Kraig. 
"Served from bottle born on 06/21/10. Luckily Sacramento is close to Santa Rosa, this may be the freshest beer I've ever had."
Fresh bottle (6/8/10-2 weeks old) thanks to billinlafayette. Poured into tulip.
Extra from bmcclure trade. Thanks Ben!!
Poured from bottle into pint glass
Poured from a 500ml bottle into a DFH snifter glass. The fruity and floral aromas really stood out as soon as I opened this beer. IMO this is a very drinkable session beer. The alcohol is hidden extremely well. It tastes like it smells.
"Poured from the bottle, born on 5/12/10"
"I was fortunate enough to pick up some Pliny while on a trip to Colorado, and it was without a doubt worthy of all the hype. It pours a deep gold with a solid head that leaves plenty of sticky lacing on the glass. The nose is all beautiful citrusy hops. Upon taking a sip, I noticed that while there was a malt backbone somewhere in there, this beer's complexity is all in its hops: grapefruit and pineapple flavors abound with a wonderful hop bitterness that stays around after each drink. The alcohol content is heavily masked by the hop explosions, making this an incredibly drinkable brew."
"On Tap at Capones. Of course you follow up the Younger with the Elder. A very tasty brew. Has a lot of characteristics that you find in 90 minute. Complex double IPA but the sweet and bitter are very well balanced. Is less creamy than the younger, giving you that nice harsh hop bitterness that double IPA fans presumably enjoy. Elder has a nice clean dry finish. I would say this and 90 minute are my favorite double IPA's."
Exactly what I was expecting when got this beer.
Appearance: Pours a hazy amber with an orange hue. Nice big head on top that leaves plenty of lace.
okay i've had this a few times so now i'm finally ready to review it.. nothing new cuz my 2 cents is pretty much the same as what everyone says.. it lives up to the hype.. this beer is great!!
"Golden in color, with a thin, white head that remains. Good lacing."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass, bottled 5/12/2010. One month exactly."
"Clear light amber with orange tint and very aggressive tan foamy head. Aroma is a very compelling, super citrusy hop with a little pine and a sticky sweetness if you believe you could smell that. A big hop slap upfront is pine mostly but mellows (as much as this can possibly mellow) into orange and lemon and light sticky sweet background. But the sweetness seems to come from the hops, and not the malts. There is no malt flavors to speak of, in fact the feel is almost like a tea of hops in carbonated water. That being said, it does round out a bit as it warms. The hop bitterness in the finish is strong but isn't overblown and lingers for quite some time though not unpleasantly. "
"Consumed PtE many times, but thought my 100th review would be a good time to review it. Plus it's fresh, bottled 5/26, consumed 6/12."
Picked a few bottles of this up at Beaumont Market and split all three with the wife today in a pair of twelve ounce tulips I picked up at the Dollar store. The glasses are an awesome value and highly recommended. The Pliny's were bottled on 05/26/2010. I've reviewed this on tap once before but wanted to review the fresh bottle form now as well. On to the review!
"Bottled on 5/17, which is 3 weeks ago. "
"Glad to crack a beer of this caliber for my 50th review, and cheers to psiweaver for the May 12th 2010 bottle. The beer pours a burnt orange in my Duvel tulip, with a frothy, 3 finger off white head quickly forming and lingering. The lacing is decent, but just a bit short of earning a 5 for appearance. A pungent hop aroma is present even as I pour, and grapefruit, pineapple, and bitter orange peels are appreciable. Each sip leads off with the briefest of flashes of bready and caramel malt sweetness, before a shotgun blast of hop bitterness asserts itself. This fades into a more citrus hop flavor, largely pineapple and grapefruit. If the hop bitterness vs flavor balance was tipped a little bit more towards flavor Pliny would get a 5, but it's not quite there. Carbonation is high, but to good effect as it helps highlight all the juicy hop goodness, and I'm surprised at how creamy the mouthfeel is given the relative lack of malt presence. I wouldn't expect to notice much alcohol at 8%, but I don't find any at all as I sip on Pliny, and it's so damn tasty that it's a struggle to stop and savor this despite the bitterness. Truly world class, and the template against which all DIPAs should be measured."
"A- Hazy golden blood-tinged yellow, with a thin white sticky head that left some pretty traces of film and collar."
bottled 3/26/10
Bottled 5/12/2010 Courtesy of whitebricke
"This was bought at Capone's in Norristown, PA. I got this awesome IPA on tap and it filled my palette with a long-lasting, yet appealing hoppy-ness. I found the smell to be strong and it enhanced the taste as I enjoyed this beer. It is certainly one that I will enjoy again."
"A- Nice white frothy head with beautiful sticking lacing all over the glass. Orange hazy color, mouth is watering just from looking at it."
"12 oz tap pour into an American tumbler at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach, CA."

"Stoney73 sent me two bottles, the second one was an awesome surprise. Both bottled on 5/17/10. I finally get to try some PtE."
"I've had this beer on tap before, but this review is from a 500ML bottle with a Bottled On date of May 17, 2010, so just about two weeks ago. I poured this into a Duvel Tulip."
"Pour is light amber-copper with small white ringed hear around edge of glass. Aroma is spruce, resin, pine, citrus, orange rind, and green hops. Flavor has a sharp hop bite with forest green flavors and citrusy rinds. Pretty clean finish and dry on the palate. Drinkability is dangerously high and extremely food friendly. Dear Vinnie, please expand distribution to the great old Midwest."
A little bit fruit and some pine-yness - just your typical west coast IIPA nose. Bottled on 5/12 this is about as fresh as I could get. The hops hit you up front with freshness but the malt nicely balances out in the end. Just a really smooth drinking beer with incredible balance considering the hop bill on it.
"This beer is well spoken for here. I get floral grapefruits and oranges in both the smell and the taste and the balance of grapefruits and oranges tilts to the oranges as it warms up in the glass a little. The feel is perfectly viscous, the carbonation is perfectly carbonated, and the look is perfect looking. It's a bright orange sunset with bubbles."
"Appears golden and rich in color with a foamy head that stuck around for a couple of minutes. Smells like I'd expect with the bright hop dominance. Lots of grapefruit, a little pine with some baked bread in the background. Tantalizing. "
Received as a kick ass extra from an awesome trader- thanks millah! I've been wanting to try this for a long time now. This bottle is 2 weeks young!
5-25-10 - poured into a tulip glass - 500ml capped bottle - bottled on date is 3-22-10
"Picked up this gem at the super liquor mart in Littleton CO. Poured a golden yellowish sunburst orange hue with a fast diminishing two finger head with some lacing that lasted thru to the end. Aromas of piney hops, citrus, an a touch of honey. Had an grapefruit orange rind touch of sweet malt taste with a dry finish. Light medium body with the right amount of carbonation. Oh yeah! Will drink this little darlin again."
Served in a tulip glass at the Blue Dog.
I've had this beer so many times but I finally have the guts to review this gem.
A - somewhat of a hop haze? A midpoint between orange & yellow. Fantastic 2 finger sturdy head with loads of lacing.
Poured from a 500ml bottle into a pint.
"Glad I finally managed to get hooked up with another bottle of this as it's been almost a year since the first time I was able to try this beer, and it was well worth the wait. Poured from the bottle to a pint glass, the review is from notes taken on 5/22/2010."
"A - hazy, glowing orange, thick off-white head, pretty much leaves a sheet of lacing behind"
"poured into a dfh chalice, great looking golden orange. super nice fluffy white head and lacing. "
"Bottled four days ago. Poured a clear, rich gold with around a finger of bright white head that faded fairly quickly."
Deep golden color with a sticky off-white head that leaves nice lacings. 
"Slightly cloudy, pale almost apricot color. Generous foam that is reducing and clumping nicely. Looks delicious."
"Appearance: deep golden color, good head retention, good lacing."
"Bottled on April 23, 2010, enjoyed on May 18, 2010."
"Bottled on 4/29/10 - poured into Sam Adams pint glass, also had this on tap last week at the falling rock."
Thanks to a friendly beeradvocater I am getting to try this beer here on the east coast! Thanks so much! 
"Pours clear gold with a light cream head. Bottle dated 4/29/2010, consumed 5/14/2010."
"Pours to thick white head and lace, hazy orange-yellow color. Aroma is piney, citrusy and a little sweet malt thrown in. Flavor is piney, resiny and crisp with enough malt to balance. Mouthfeel is light-medium with alcohol warmth. Overall very good but not living up to its hype."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass. Beautiful deep golden color with a nice fluffy head. Delicious smells of grapefruit and orange and a little pine, which also came through in the taste. Has a nice malt balance and a pleasant aftertaste too, not too bitter, held on just the right amount of time. The most remarkable thing about it was the super creamy and smooth texture of the beer, unlike any IPA I've ever had. Very drinkable, had the whole bottle myself and could have had another."
Sharing a bottle with my wife courtesy of a trade with mobz24. Freshness date indicates bottled on 042310. Served in a large Belgian style tulip glass.
Tried 4 bottles and one draft in San Diego.
"Tasted from 500mL bottle, bottled on 3/26/10. Pours a beautiful amber orange with a long lasting white head. Nose is somewhat floral with honeysuckle, pine aroma, caramel malt, grapefruit hops. The flavors are very clean and balanced. There is nice grapefruit, pine resin, caramel malt, and a bitter hops finish. The palate is nearly perfect. Just enough coating with medium carbonation and a long, but very pleasant bitter finish. Overall, this is an excellent IIPA. Perhaps the best word to describe it is clean, and I will gladly drink this whenever I can get some fresh."
Received this one in a trade with Gabriel. Thanks again! Bottled on date of 4/05/10. Pretty fresh stuff!
i have had Pliny before on draft...and I never really was impressed by it all that much. So I decided I wanted to try it out of a fresh bottle.
"It's finally time for me to sample my first bottle of Pliny. Bottled 4/23, thanks to a very generous trader!"
Poured 16.9 oz. bottle into snifter. Bottled on 4/23/10.
"This may be my favorite beer of all time. I first had it at a brewfest years ago and nothing has really ever compared. I found a liquor store right down the street that carries the 16.9oz bottles and I couldn't be more excited. Russian River's distributors do a wonderful job of ensuring the freshest possible product makes it to their customers and in the case of Pliny the Elder is makes a world of difference. This bottle is dated at 4/5/10 and was poured into a tulip glass. The color is a cloudy golden amber, reminiscent of a Belgian tripel. A rich foamy head arises and it retained with fine lacing. The smell is gloriously fresh and floral hops with enough of a citrus-like honey sweetness to again remind me somewhat of a tripel. The wonderfully bitter hops on the palate are balanced with an interestingly subtle malt that gives the taste an orange peel quality to it. The fresh and resiny hops linger through the finish so much so that its almost like I've been chewing on a mouthful of them. The carbonation is spot on, giving it exceptional mouthfeel and allowing the full and glorious flavor of the beer to be spread broadly across the palate. Everything combines to make this a beer that beckons to be sipped deeply and savored. I really tried to think of a way this beer might be made better and the only thing I could come up with was if it was on tap fresh at the brewery. I may be somewhat biased because this is my favorite style but I have had enough regular and imperial IPAs to say this one clearly trumps them all."
Allright... FINALLY reviewing this one... sipping on a pour from a 4 day old growler hooked up from my new buddy baker (wavers1) out inn Cali (thanks again dude!!!)
Bottle dated 3.26.10 poured into a standard pint glass
"A- Golden orange, with some light amber tint. nice helf inch head that dicipated from the hop oil. "
G: 10 oz. goblet
Poured into my favorite tall glass I use to observe the beauty of whats to come...
"Pours a hazy, honey, golden, amber color. It glows in my 420 Hop-fest pint glass. There is a fat, fluffy head that falls to about 1/4"" with lots of thick loose lacing. Smells like powdered sugar and candied oranges. This really isn't that complex, but it is almost perfectly balanced! Might I say; a orange dream cycle or orange scone from Panera? There are faint hints of pine but the sweet citrus rules this treat. Flowery kindness; earthy and Funky it begs to be tasted! The candied orange-orange dream cycle thing dominate the flavors as well, but there are hints of tropical fruit, apricot, and black pepper. Hail the cannabaceae family!"
Poured into a tulip. A great orange and slight copper color. An easy two fingers of fluffy head. An awesome appearance. 
Thanks to B4L for this one.
"Big thank you to billinlafayette for the trade of FRESH, bottled 4/5/10, PTE!"
Piraat Tulip 
On tap in the alley behind hawthorns. Crazy right. 
"A - golden amber orange color, decently hazy, fingers worth of small bubble filled white head."
Thanks to mom and dad who brought this back from their trip to CA. Bottled on 4/5/10
A big thanks to beerwolf77 for this one.
Got this in a DLD trade. Decided to hit it to start my weekend on a good foot. Poured from a 17-oz. bottle marked 3-26-10 into a snifter.
Poured into my Spiegelau tulip. Thanks to pastradul for this one.
When I opened this hard to obtain I.P.A. I was expecting great things and I would not be disapointed. Big thanks to Vinnie at russian river for sending me A list of places to buy this fine beverage.

bottle into Duvel tulip
"500mL bottle poured into a Duvel tulip, bottle dated 020810 and drank with a little under two months of age"
"Bottle, Acquired in a DLD trade, worked out awesome"
"A big thanks to Drink1121 for this one. Poured the 500 mL bottle (dated March 22, 2010) into an oversized red wine glass to capture the aroma."
"Slightly hazy, brilliant orange in color. Head is about a half inch thick, with decent retention and fairly good, spotty lacing down the glass."
Huge thanks to route66pubs for this one!!
"Pours an amber color with a medium head that falls slowly and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is WOW. Hops then some hops. But there is an underlying sweetness that has a caramel character. Smells very nice. The flavor is surprisingly balanced. Lots of hop flavors, but also there is plenty of malt sweetness and caramel flavor. I'm the opposite of a hop head, but this beer tastes great to me. The flavor hops aren't over the top like most I2PA's. It just blends and adds the bitterness at the end. Very nice beer. The body is moderate and the drinkability is great for 8%."
"This is a nice straw yellow with a small head and lots of lacing. The scent is very hoppy right off the bat, then you get a great floral scent that has a slightly sweat citrus smell, like a ripe tangerine. "
"I've had this beer roughly a billion times now, and its aromas and flavors are pretty much ingrained in my psyche at this point. 500ml bottle with a ""bottled on"" date of 04/05/10 poured into a tall mug, this is much hazier than any draft pour of Elder I've had. It's peach-colored, moderately cloudy and topped by an exceptionally frothy cap that not only sustains well but leaves thick rings of lace around the glass."
Tnx to mrstevens for sharing. Poured into a snifter. This bottle is just a little over 3 weeks old.
1st review- had to be something great.
"On tap at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach, CA."
Thanks a million to Loki83 for this one!!!
Poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy golden color maybe a touch lighter.Tremendous thick white heading. That leaves nice lacing all around the glass.A little heavy looking.
"500ml bottle into Duvel tulip. Bottled on 3/26/10, so only 20 days old. Big thanks to BA mob2332 for giving this to me!"
"Well, here it is. My first Pliny the Elder, at 7 a.m., after work. Bottle date is 3-26-10, 20 days old. Pours a bright, fuzzy orange with great rocky, fluffy white head. Looks just like the Blind Pig from yesterday, although the head on Pliny retains better and leaves some more lacing. Very little sediment. Smell is lots of pine and earthy notes. Citrus hides in the background. Taste is the same, pine and earth and lots of it. Dry hops. A bit of a biscuity feel, I don't really pick up any fruit flavors at the start but towards the middle I start to pick up citrus, grapefruit, and lemon. Nice hop burps. The balance here is seriously excellent though, and the mouthfeel is probably the best I have encountered in an IPA, period. Truly a creamy elixir, perfect carbonation. Alcohol taste is nowhere to be found, I would never guess this is 8%. Drinkability is also pretty great because of this. Truthfully I am a little let down, the taste isn't quite what I expected, I actually preferred Blind Pig to this for sure. But the mouthfeel, overall balance of malt+hops, drinkability, and the masking of alcohol are huge highlights, and it succeeds maybe better than any other DIPA I've had in all those categories."
500ml bottle poured into my Southern Tier tulip...
"Naja's in the Redondo Beach, CA, marina. Superb beer and decent context. Pliny the Elder was recommended by their most experienced tender as the best double IPA on tap save Pliny the Younger when it is available. After 40 years of tasting ales internationally, this ranks as my all-time favorite."
On Tap. Fathers Office.
"In a DFH snifter, bottled just over a week ago."
What is there really to say...
"Thanks again B Rob. The distinction between Pliny and all other DIPA's is that people who generally don't care for the hop bitterness will still love this beer. It has all of the taste nuances of an ipa without that bitter bite at the end that tends to push away some people from this style. Its like Jay-Z but not ""Reasonable Doubt"", more like ""H to the Izzo."" At the end of the day, its awesome, but inviting enough for everyone. Also, the label is one of the better beer labels around."
"I love this beer, it is just such a shame that it is hard to come by. It pours a great golden amber with some orange highlights and bright white head. The nose is complex showing great hops, citrus, grapefruit, sugar cane and sweet malts. The palate is well layered with sharp hops up front, sweet malts in the middle and finishes with fresh bitter hops. I love how there is a small amount of sweetness that balances perfectly"
"Served on-tap @ Falling Rock Taphouse, Denver, CO, into a pint glass"
"Poured out a buff copper, bronze golden hue into the old Duvel tulip. Thick, slightly off-white head that faded eventually. Strong lacing. A good-looking brew."
Bottled on 3/22/10
"Sometimes you take for granted the things in your backyard, and Pliny is one of them. You start trading and trading to see whats out there, and your'e all, Hopslam is the best beer ever, then you have a Dreadnaught and your like..thats was awesome, but when it's all said and done, Pliny the Elder is and will always be the benchmark for the big west coast IPA. Worthy of all the hype, this is one of the best beers in the US, and in my opinion, top ten in the world."
"My friends picked this up in LA, drove it to me in Vegas and I took it back with me to SC. Really stoked to try this brew. Poured from a bottle into my Duvel Tulip"
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a soapy white head. The head leaves sheets of lace as it slowly disappears. Aroma is of full of citrus. Taste is more of the same, citrusy hop overload. Lots of fresh grapefruit and orange flavor along with some pine. Plenty of bitterness. A great beer. One of the best Ive had. After having a couple of Blind Pigs and PTE's, I think the PTE is just a notch above the Blind Pig, but both are beers by Russian River."
A- Golden straw color. Thin bright white head with beautiful lacing.
This one was bottled on 1/14/10. Obtained this 500 ml bottle from raoulduke37 (Art) in our trade. Thanks Art!
Got this from South Bay Drugs online. Thanks Geoi. Bottled 3/21/10.
"500 mL courtesy of my dad, who brought this back from a recent trip to Colorado - mad props for this one dad! Bottled on 020810. Pours a not-quite-clear golden color with a fluffy, off-white foam. Average retention and good lacing."
Thanks to knucks999 for this work of art.
"Pours from the bottle a beautiful golden color, with a rocky white head that quickly settles down. Smells incredible, with all kinds of hoppy goodness going on, especially citrus (orange, grapefruit, tangelo) and pine. A nice malt foundation does a great job of supporting the wonderfully fresh hop flavors here, especially all that citrus, along with a bit of pineapple. Dangerously drinkable, as the alcohol is not noticed until it is too light. A truly great IPA/IIPA."
A - Light Orange with a bright white head of about 2 fingers. Small amounts of lacing are present. There is the ever present hop haze from the all the hops in this beer.
Big thanks to jzeilinger for this treat. Enjoyed while watching Beer Wars.
"Poured from a bottle into a large snifter. Beautiful golden hue with a touch of amber. Thick, foamy head that lasts for a decent amount of time, excellent lacing. "
Bottling date: 1. February 2010 so let's open the bottle before the hops start to deteriorate.
"A: Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color. The tall, fluffy head has a similar tint and very good retention. Lacing is also quite nice. "
"Yay! I finally got to try Pliny the Elder! I was really hoping i wouldn't be let down because i had really high expectations. Well, i wasn't! "
"I'm not sure I can anymore than what's already been said about this beer, except I really do think it is better on tap at the RRBC or @ the Toronado SF (I'm, not sure if it's on tap anywhere else in SF)."
"On tap at Toronado, SF. "
Poured a medium copper hue with a one and a half finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing.
Thanks to Arbitrator for hooking me up!
"Bottle from Bottleworks. Hops...bang! The aroma hits with the force of a wrecking ball, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Pours an attractive gold, but with some yeast floaties. Nice white bubbly head with decent lacing.This is one incredibly hoppy beer that is balanced well with two incredibly unique tastes. First, you get a citrus sweetness on the tongue, but that quickly fades as the bitter hops linger on the palate. This has lived up to the hype and I'm glad I had the chance to try it. incredibly drinkable. Nice work, RR!"
"Russian river Pliney the Elder IMP IPA, Jakes, 20Mar10, narrow pint, ??%, 45deg"
"500ml Bottled on date of 3/4/2010, bought from a small bottle shop in Tacoma that kept it refrigerated. "
Bottled on 3/22/10 (very fortunate to find it very fresh)
"A- quickly dissapating head atop a luminescent orange body, hazy yet just clear enough to see the other side of the glass."
"20 day old bottle picked up and consumed while in San Diego. this is my first Pliny and I'm fighting hard not to let the hype and excitement overshadow the actual traits of the beer because this is one hell of a beer. The hops in this one are complex with a little bit of everything I'd want: dank cannabis, pine, citrus (weakest of the three). Nice malt sweetness to balance out the considerable bitterness. "
Shout out to daysofstatic for trading me the Pliny!
"I'm always thankful when i get pliny in a trade, my wife loves it too, and what makes my wife happy, makes me happy."
Poured from a growler (thanks to cbutova) into a dogfishhead snifter. Light pale golden with a minimal head. Lacing is amazing. 
"On-tap at TJ's in PA yesterday, reviewed from notes. Pours out a golden yellow with no head but a white ring and cloud. The ring actually leaves some light, spotty lacing around the glass. Smell is very good, reminds me of Sculpin but a bit less fruity and more pine up front. The hops lend pine, citrus, earthy and grapefruit notes. There is actually hints of malt which balance the nose for me. The taste is very similar. Very good hop profile balanced by a great malt backbone. The hops are citrus, piney, grapefruit and other fruity notes. The level of bitterness is perfect for an IIPA. Mouthfeel is also great. The medium body is very smooth with low-medium carbonation that suits the flavor perfectly. A bitter coat is left on the tongue. The beer has no alcohol presence, taste or MF, for me. Drinkability is killer. The taste and price ($5) were both amazing. The flavors stay very solid and the beer only gets more complex and enjoyable as I drink it very slowly. Could session this one for hours on end (not true of many IIPAs)."
"There are some beers for which quantitative ratings are really irrelevant; how do you really put a number on something as subjective as the citrus/pine aroma of a truly great IPA? Pliny the Elder is one such. Fortunately, business brought us to the area and no time was lost in making the pilgrimage to the fount. Beer is a pale amber slightly hazy with a not much head but a decent lingering lacing on the glass (for what that is worth). Major impact on the nose with an intense full-on grapefruit explosion mixed with grassy and pine overtones. One can scarce forbear to taste and it is not disappointing: predominant citrus, some butterscotch undertones, that give way to lingering dry bitter finish. Mouth coating quality lingers for an age."
Bottled on date of 2/11/10. Poured into a large wine glass.
"A: Deep gold color, lots of nice white head and lacing."
"When I first joined BA I heard about this beer and hoped someday I would have a chance to try it. Then I learned about trading, and here I am now. Thanks Jeff (PlinyTheYoungest) !"
Visited wine country and had to have this everyday of the trip. Refilled my growler at the Santa Rosa pub daily as it is the best DIPA I have experienced. Clean mouthfeel with the anticipated piney hops notes and of course the color and aroma of the best beer in the USA and/or the world!
Bottled 02/08/10
Many thanks to NewGeneric for my 1st PtE!
"Got a bottle in trade from 2ndloveofmylife, thanks Michael!!"
"Draught at the Bistro. I have long awaited the day to try Pliny the Eder. Maybe I was expecting too much. Hype is a horrible thing. Piney and grapefruit peel-bitter hops are done exquisitely, within a clear golden body topped by a sticky white head. Aromas of pine needles and flowers. Light and dry as the most drinkable IPA. Not like any IIPA that I've had. So dry and crisp. Bitter, endless finish. I love the dryness and drinkability; it's like a single IPA that manages double the hop load, but The hop profile still falls a bit short. I'm missing the tropical, fruity notes that I get out of some other west coast IPAs. Pliny does it's thing almost perfectly, but that might just not really be my thing in the absolute realm of the hop. Rerate: I get it now. Forgive me, Pliny, for not even a fiery death at Mount Vesuvius could quell your awesomeness. The dryness IS the beauty. I guess it depends whether I am in the mood for a thicker DIPA or a dryer, thinner DIPA, but the power of the hops in this one is outdone by none so far."
Poured from a bottle dated 2/8/2010 into my new Bruery tulip. Huge thanks to route66pubs for a chance to try this one!
16oz bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled on 2/8/10
500mL bottle poured into an imperial pint. Bottled on 02/08/10. Huge thanks to mb2696 for the bottle! 
I sought this beer out and received it in my first trade. Served from a bottle into my snifter.
Bottled on - 011410.
"Those that have already tried Pliny the Elder understand why there's a big A+ at the top of the page. Those that haven't, let me summarize all the reviews you will read: Pliny the Elder is very very good. Like hops? Try it. Now. Don't want a ""bitter"" beer that fills you up? Grow a pair, and then try it. You'd be short changing yourself if you didn't."
Originally reviewed 2/27/10. Consumed at Falling Rock Tap House.
"Back in SD briefly, trying to soak in the sun & beer goodness. Picked up a bottle at an unassuming yet well stocked Jimbo's Liquor in Clairemont."
Thanks to bricktop for including this in a recent trade. I've had PtE several times now and figured it is about time to toss up a ranking.
"Poured into a DFH glass. Perfect apricot color, thick creamy head. Decent retention, not much lacing though."
"Awesome, awesome, awesome..."
"On tap at Barbara's At The Brewery, Downtown Los Angeles"
"I didn't plan on reviewing this beer as it was bottled on 11/30/09 and knowing that this beer is supposed to be consumed much sooner than 4 months after bottling, but I actually really enjoyed it as is."
Bottled on 02-08-10. Thanks abrand!
Pours a very nice tangerine/copper color with well retained whitish head.
"C. Slightly Hazy, but pretty clear"
500mL bottle poured into a cervoise. Bottled on 02-08-10. Thanks to babanate for the bottle.
Ah my first ever PtE. Credit to JesseTheHutt for this amazing brew.
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with about a half an inch of head. Tons of lacing around the edge of the glass. The hop aroma is huge, flowery, and mouthwatering. The taste is very flowery without a hint of alcohol at all. There is a slight aftertaste, but not anything offensive or overwhelming. The mouthfeel is a litle thick which is unsurprising given the alcohol content and big taste. Amazingly drinkable, probably the best IPA/DIPA I've ever had. I had to think long and hard abou giving a 4.5 or a 5 on taste, I decided to give Pliny the benefit of the doubt."
Tried this at Belmont Station...
"It's very difficult to be objective about beer, especially about one that is as good as Pliny the Elder. "
Got this in a trade with Sideswipe. 
Pours a dark copper color with a small white head. Good retention and lacing. 
Pours forth a beautiful dark golden color. has a nice head to it with decent lacing left in the glass.
Poured from a bottle
Poured this guy from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on 1/14/10. Split the bottle three ways. 
"Had this on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, at their 3rd annual celebration of everything Russian River. Yellowish orange in color, decent white head that lasted a while. Smell was sweet up front and oily hops behind. taste was similar, some good malt body up fornt then grassy and oily hops behind. Mild carbonation. Fantastic double IPA, great beer for any hophead."
A: pale gold with dense 1-finger head and moderate lacing
a: This was a slightly hazy golden color. It was served to me with thin whisp of a head.
L: Pours a nice clear orange yellow with a medium sized and thick bodied white colored head that laces the glass very nicely on the way down. The look is actually a bit deceiving in this case as it looks lighter than it is going to be.
Thanks to krtman for sharing!
"A - Hazy golden orange with a good sized white, foamy head."
Flown in fresh from Cali via duffextracold.
Clear tangerine copper. Luscious near white creamy head with good retention. Fine etched laces between rings of thick lace.
"500ml bottle. Pours burnished bronze. Aroma is pineapple and grapefruit and fresh wet hops, not piney. Big, full flavor. TONS of hops, much less malt flavor. Has a bitterness that is not overpowering, not sharp, but lingers. It isn't overly sharp like a lot of ipa's or alcoholy like a lot of imperial ipa's. The balance is quite remarkable. Finish is tropical fruitiness. This beer was 6 weeks old when consumed and tastes really really fresh, not in a green way, but in a fresh home brewed way."
On tap at Father's Office in Culver City.
I've enjoyed this one several times on tap and now I'm tucking in with a bottle to review. Poured into an imperial pint glass.
Served in a snifter
NOTE: If you are drinking this beer about 2 months past its freshness date then you are not getting the full experience.
I finally decided to review this one after drinking God knows how many.
appearance---golden amber very clear mid size bubbles fades quick to a nice little island leaves some lacing
"Thanks, to skuter for this one!"
I drank several ounces of Pliny the Elder at the Extreme Beerfest. It's basically Pliny the Youngers little brother.
Bottle with a date of 1.6.10 poured into a Hennepin flute.
Poured from the 16.9oz bottle.
"this was a real treat, my buddy had this shipped from cali for my birthday, i told him i didn't think i'd ever get one. has a pretty clear color on it, compared to other IPA's also has a nice white head and laces nicely too. smell is just awesome, has a nice mixture of mostly floral hops but with a hint of citrus, just awesome.. taste is heavenly, i'm sad that i wont be able to get it again, but i'm ecstatic that i get to drink it, it really is a treat."
I got this bottle off the Pliny tree in my backyard. Finally realized I've somehow never sat down and reviewed old geezer Pliny. Poured into a tumbler at ~45 degrees.
Bottled on 1/6/10. Poured into a pint.
"Pours a wonderful golden orange color with a large white head. A lot of viscous white lacy head retention; just excellent. Smells of pine, orange zest, fresh flower bouquet, ripe fruits and grass. Taste is not a letdown, tastes as it smells. Large piney flavor with citrus and breadiness and an amazingly smooth bitterness throughout that leaves its lasting impression. Very well balanced and smooth, not an overbearing hop bomb - has a slight maltiness to keep it under control. Light carbonation dances gaily upon my tongue. Greatness. I must admit that I have had this fresher and that the hop does seem to fade slightly over the time. Still hands down the best DIPA I have ever had - a real treat to the taste buds."
"Bottled 01/06/10 .. I've had this many times before, but this is the first time I'm reviewing it. Thanks to stawn as an extra in a trade!"
Thanks for this one Will.
"Review taken from notes, just getting around to inputting some reviews:"
"A huge thanks to cloudskipper for hooking me up with this bad boy. I raise my glass to you, sir!"
"First review ever is a hophead's dream Pliny the Elder. In my book, the standard for DIPAs. This one was brought back to CT for me by a coworker on a San Diego area trip he went on for work. Poured a 500ML bottle dated 01/06/10 into a snifter."
Thanks VanillaMike for sharing a bottle!
My GF ordered 2 bottles online for me for my birthday...
bottled on 1/14/10 thanks to Doodler for the bottle **just noticed Doodler hooked up the guy below me too** way to spread that Pliny love Scott!

"Pours a clear copper colored body with a tall ivory head and really sticky lacing, very nice looking beer."
Had both in bottle and on tap multiple times. Review is based on the freshest bottle I had (4 days).
"Appearance - Beer pours a golden opaque color with a strong head. As it settles, there is long lacing on the glass."
"Fresh bottle, dated 01/06/10"

Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass and a snifter.
"Appearance: Golden/amber in color. Forms a thick, frothy white head, seems to last forever. "

Been waiting to try this one for a long time. Will it live up to the hype. I dont know???
On tap: Spinnerstown Hotel
"a - Poured a light amber color, had moderate carbonation, and about 1 finger of white head that lasted for a long time. Looks great."
Poured into a Duvel Tulip. Bottled on 1-6-2010.
from saulcharlesworth - secret santa '09
Had this out of a bottle that I acquired in a recent BIF.
Thanks to my sister for bringing this back for me from her trip to San Fransisco. 
"Had a few times before, but after not seeing this beer for a while where I live, I jumped at the chance to try it again. "
"Got a bottle as a wonderful bonus from olibeer22. Bottled 12/05/09, opened 1/09/10:"
"Pours a light amber,orange,golden color. Head is white a smaller thumb sized even with aggressive pour, it falls to clumps of bubbles that leaves some nice lacing on my glass. "
This is the beer that is a constant battle in my mind/mouth between itself and Sculpin. I love them both for different reasons.
"Poured into a Bruery snifter, bottle dated 1/6/10 so it must be the years first batch?!?!"
Review prepared from notes. Served in Pint Glass.
Poured into a Stone Ruination Pint glass from a bottle with a bottle date of 12/23/09. Less than a month old! Spectacular. Acquired in trade from htomsirveaux. Thanks!
"This beer is so unique in its flavor and aroma profile it almost deserves its own category. The aroma hits you immediately upon pouring, and it just reeks of fresh citrus, pine, and maybe a little fresh cut field greenery. The first sip of this makes your eyes bug out a bit as you are hit with mouth quenching hops, hints of malt, and great effervescence."
I've had PtE from the bottle many times since it hit Seattle on a regular basis. I didn't get a chance to have it on tap until recently. Fresh PtE is definitely a step up from the bottle.
bottled on date 12.23.09
Big thanks to youbrewidrink for this trade.
Picked up a few bottles at the pub on a holiday vacation. Bottle dated 12/23.
"Bottle dated 12/23/09 picked up on a business trip. I've had this beer a few times. Better review it, as it is hard to say when I'll have it again."
"Gotta throw a big cheers to alleykatking (Josh) for this one. What a treat of a brew. And, it was bottled on 1/6/10, so pretty much as fresh as you can get for this one around here!"
Poured into a snifter.%0A%0AGolden yellow%2Forange in color. A bit of haziness. A nice white head about a fingers worth. Fluffy and sticky. Sticks to the glass the entire way down.%0A%0AI picked out some light like citrus in the nose. But it was mostly dominated by a floral like grassy aroma and lots of pine. Very potent nose overall.%0A%0AAt first there is a white grapefruit%2F floral flavor followed by a touch of sweetness from the malts. After a second a piney resiny flavor kicks in and pine dominates. Almost like chewing on pine needles. (but in a good way)%0A%0AMouthfeel is fabulous. Lots of oily hoppy goodness in the mouth that then turns dry and clean on the swallow leaving you wanting another sip.%0A%0ADrinkability is perfect. I could sit down and drink this all day long no doubt about it. I can see why Pliny The Elder is held in such such a high regard. It is a wonderfully crafted beer that i'm lucky enough to have finally gotten my hands and tastebuds on.
"First off, I must admit that even though I once drank tons of hoppy beer, it is not really I enjoy anymore. So take my review for what it is worth based on that preface."
"Pours a hazy warm, almost golden amber colour with light carbonation and a big creamy white head. "
Bottled: 12-23-2009
"I have to admit, after trying to track this down for about the past year and a half, and reading all the hype, I thought I would end up being disappointed when I found this beer on tap at Teresa's Next Door in Wayne, PA . Luckily I was in for a pleasant surprise..."
"From the cool, mod labeled bottle with a bottled on date of 12.23.09 into a red wine glass and consumed on 1.8.10."
"A: Crystal clear, light gold, with a thin finger white head that quickly vanishes to a whispy pattern gracing the surface of the beer."
Poured into a wine glass.
"I recieved a few of the bottles in the mail after trying a bottle given by Steve at Kickbacks. Not available in my area, but Lord I really wish that it was. This is one of the best beers that I have ever had. The smell is what I wish that my house smelled like. The taste was hoppy but not so hoppy that it overpowered the malty backbone of it. I have a few bottles left and I am going to savor every drop of them until I can get my hands on more."
"Got this in a trade from beddacheeda, thanks again Evan! Bottled on 12-23-09 and poured into a pint glass."
Bottled on 11-30-09 
Bottled on 01/06/2010

"On tap at Horse Brass Pub, Portland."
Bottled on 10/21/09
Shared this bottle with pecorasc. Thanks to nickd717 for hooking me up with this treat from RR. 
"Gold pour with a slight pink tint and a big loose white head with lots of lacing. Lots of bright citrus and bubblegum ester aroma with notes of honey, toffee, and lemon grass. The hop profile is much more bitter and piny than the aroma. There's still a nice balance of honey and toffee malts. Medium body with soft carbonation."
Snatched up from City Beer Store! Bottled 12/23/09. Served in 22oz snifter. 
12.23.09 bottle at City Beer Store.
500ml bottle Thanks to colonelforbin for this bottle! 
"On tap at Craft Ale House in Limerick. Poured into a flute glass. Orange golden color, white head, solid layer of lacing."
Delicious beer. 
Finally got my hands on a few bottles of these through South Bay Drugs and Joey - thanks again.
"Pours a yellow gold. The aroma is mainly hops, fruity and piney. The taste is what shocked me most, there is a real apple sort of flavor. I don't know what that is but its interesting. I can't say I love it but I do find it intriguing. Enough bitterness to satisfy. Pretty drinkable for a larger IPA. Its obviously a well made beer and worth seeking out for the experience but the hype that seems to still be around it is maybe a bit much. I am glad though that much more of the country is seeing some distribution and hopefully one day we'll be getting it over here."
bottled on 10/08/09. poured into pint glass from bottle. bottle courtesy of jklinck.
Nose is very floral. Hops galore from the first sip all the way through. Finishes dry and thin. This one is fruity sweet with hops and slightly resiny. Maybe picking up some sugars here as well. great IPA from a master brewer...This one being 100+ ibu's a little too hoppy for me anything over 70 is considered a waste of hops but this is a hop monster..
Thanks to Mike for the legendary PTE.
Thanks to Kaiser81 for this bottle.
"Picked this up at Florian's in Truckee, CA."
"A: Light color of a hazy orange, spectacular display with tons of white foamy head and top notch lacing."
This is what beer is all about. And excuse me if the review doesn't conform to your Gestappo (sic) desires of conformity.
"Presentation: 16.9oz slimline, Euro-style brown pop top with awesome, minimalist label with really cool info and drinking instructions about the beer."
"Poured from a 500mL bottle into a tulip glass. Pretty excited about this one, and when I pour it, I can see the hype so far."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, some carbonation, nice small fizzy off-white head which lasted a little while, some islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is hoppy, piney, grapefruit, and some caramel. The taste is a little sweet and lots of hops, and grapefruit. Medium body. Very drinkable,"
"Bottle courtesy of 916tmcmanus916, a great trader! bottled two weeks ago on 11/30"
500ml bottle obtained via SS09 from vasdef42. Thanks for the opportunity. 
"Expertly poured into a 10 oz tulip glass at my favorite tavern by my favorite bartender. End of a rough week, and desparately in need of something good. Pliny did not disappoint."
Poured from tap at Henry's 12th Street Tavern in Portland:
Got this one in a trade...
"This was a recent gift from ipa247. I have had it a few times before, but I never actually made an attempt to review it."
500ml. bottle poured into our OPa-OPa pint glasses:
Nothing short of spectacular!
Served in a snifter. Finally.
Pours a hazy orange color with lighter hues. There is a very nice off-white head that is thick and rocky.
Bottled on 10/21/09 - Poured into a tulip
"500ml bottle sent my way from fishbowled, thanks man! Bottling date of Oct. 8th, 2009 - almost exactly 2 months from bottling."
Big thanks to ritzkiss for cracking this open. A beer I'd resigned myself to admiring from afar.
"Got via trade...pours a golden blond with bubbly white head that dissapates pretty quick and leaves mild lacing. Not too cloudy, but definitely not clear. Strong bitter IPA aroma, with a slight fruity scent...kind of like a watermelon."
"from a trade with largadeer, thanks Chris"
I FINALLY got some Russian River beers!
"On tap at the Horse Brass 12/9, fresh keg that won't last the night-lucky me!"
Tap to snifter.
"Finally got my hands on this thanks to the handsome and wonderful user boatshoes. Thanks boatshoes! I'm a double IPA fiend, so naturally, I'm very excited to crack this open."
"500ml bottle, bottled on 10/21/09, poured into a Brooklyn snifter."
"Let me follow suit. Aquired this is trade from Sideswipe. Poured into my Great Lakes Brewery pint glass. Poured a dark golden color with about a finger width of head. Great smell strong hop aroma. Taste was perfectly hopped not much malt presence but its not neeed. Mouthfeel is really good. I prefer a thicker mouthfeel but this was very good. High drinkability, smooth, alcohol flavor is very hidden. Summary: Great beer, great flavor, well constructed, and highly recommended."
Received this from a very generous california trader. Surly Furious for PtE = happy times all around.
Everything about this beer is fantastic.
When I heard the Hulmeville Inn had it on tap I stopped by first thing after work. 
I had been looking for this brew for quite a while. Was very interested to see if it lived up to the hype. 
"Review #100. Big thanks to sed777 for hauling this all the way from CA for my first in-person trade. First trade, first Pliny, top-ten beer, first morning review. I'm excited."
"A- Excellent Golden color, with an orange tinge"
Bottle (2009)
"Bottled 10/21/09, opened 11/29/09."
Appearance - 49er football helmet color with soapy spotty lacing. Implies a tempting density and mouthfeel.
Had on tap at Fathers Office II in LA.
Had it on tap lst week at the Falling Rocks Tap House in Denever while in Colorado for work. Really great beer bar.
a - golden color with a thick head
"Split a 500mL bottle 2 ways. Bottled on 9/10/2009, reviewed on 9/24/2009."
"Heard that this was on tap at Eulogy Belgian Tavern in Olde City. So last Friday,off I go to get a taste. Let me tell you, for me, it lives up to all the hype."
"pour is lighter than most. a golden color with a thick tight head that sure does linger. nose is a bit more citrus but well balanced. orange, lemon, and grapefruit. palate leads on first with sweet so the candy of pineapple comes out. followed by a moderate bitter citrus. good blend of bitter as the malt works well. bitter finish leads to a mild floral quality. somewhere in between honey pollen and lemongrass. very well balanced in that it doesn't go do too heavy at all... excellent feel. carbonation and crispness wise. quite drinkable whenever. "
Shared with speedwayjim. Bottle dated 10/08/09
"Edit 3/17/2011: I never get tired of this beer. I have enjoyed it amazingly fresh (bottled direct from the brewery 3 days after bottling) and many times as much as 2 months old. This has been amazingly consistent for a DIPA. Perhaps my favorite beer. Hands down, hands up, hands tied behind my back. No cliché is wasted on this magnificent brew. Absolutely delicious. My only regret is I can't get it on demand. Awesome beer, worthy of all its accolades."
"500 ml. Quite possibly the most balanced beer i've ever had. Aromas were fresh, and the mouthfeel was so smooth I couldn't believe it was 8%. Thank God I have more of this to enjoy for the next few months. This really is the base model for every IIPA to follow, so complex and balanced it makes me wonder why anyone else tries. The citrus and floral notes are so good it screams for me to buy more. AHHH."
"This is the second time I've gotten to enjoy Pliny now, but the first time I have the opportunity to review it. I got this bottle in a shipment from South Bay Drugs, bottle date is 10/21."
Huge thank you to Bardwashrind for this super extra. Honestly my friend and I have been talking about this beer since forever. To have it shipped as an extra is... I love this place. Shared with capra12. Poured from a 16oz. bottle dated 10/08/09 into a Brooklyn Brewery pint glass. 
"My favorite beer of all time! Once I took a whiff of this beer, I was hooked. Floral hints along with tangerine and grapefruit reach my pallet immediately. It's very smooth from start to finish, and doesn't fill you up too much. I could drink this beer every day!"
Thanks to Mauerhan for this one. 
Thanks to Benjiehorn for this.
"A: Pale gold, slight copper hints, nice head, no real noticeable carb bubbles."
Served from a 16.9oz. bottle (bottled on 10/08/09) (thanks to davidsk for the trade) into my new Russian River goblet at around 45 degrees (11/17/09).
"Pliny The Elder is a cloudy golden ale with a thin, dense, white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a huge, fresh, floral, grassy aroma. It smells like... stepping outdoors. It's medium bodied, minerally and crisp. The finish is clean. It's nice and bitter with a full hop flavor. There are notes of flowers, grass, herbs and fresh ground black pepper. This is how a double IPA should taste. It was very much a pleasure to enjoy this at the Trappist in Oakland."
"Poured into Unibroue tulip from 16.9 ounce bottle (thanks to Edmund Wilson for sending this across the country) Bottled on 10/08/09. Aroma is of pine and grapefruit, straight-up. Crazy, silly, wicked, spider webby head and lacing. Beautiful. Can't really move on past the aroma. Satisfied right now. No need to drink the beer. Everything else at this point forward is a bonus. Ok, I'll drink it. This beer has been described at great lengths before me so at this point it is redundant to add to the pile. All I can say is that one day I hope that Pliny makes it to Florida because this beer is magical, mystical, delicious and breathtaking."
Poured from a standard 16.9 oz into a pint glass. Bottled date on beer is 10-08-09.
appearance: amberish with a solid head retention
A: This beer has such a strong his of Hops aroma I wish I could harness it in an air freshener so I can constantly smell this aroma.
Tried on tap at Tria on Tuesday evening (reviewed from notes):
"Recently consumed on tap at the brewpub, but my review is from home: 500 ml bottle with bottled on date."
I had this with a pretzel at Stone's RIS Vertical last week and surprisingly they went well together. My favorite IPA's have a pine tar aroma to them and this one was close to the top.
"First let me say, I love IPA's and I have had few amazing, most average and some terrible. This beer is so amazing, its one of the best IPA's Ive ever had. It is remarkably balanced and delicious, it has a beautiful grapefruit and citrus hop flavor. Very nice golden color, and a bit cloudy. It doesnt leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth like some IPA's do. As far as IPA's go, there are few, if any, which are better.--- I have finally been able to track down some bottles to give it a proper review, as opposed to the 4 or 5 sips the last time, review to follow 1/2010"
A: Nice cloudy golden pour like an early sunrise out of a bottle. A frothy head with off-white lacy bubbles creates a nice silhouette against the glass.
Received this in a recent trade from Arbitrator. Thanks a ton man for hooking me up with my first Plinys!
"Beer poured a bottle dated 10/08/09, so its a month old. Pretty good for a trade (THANKS!). Beer served in a goblet. Beer is yellow and hazy, carbonation is mild to moderate. A white head of medium sized bubbles formed but the head collapsed. There is some lacing left on the glass, even after the head collapses. Head gravitates toward the walls of the glass."
"One Duvel glass, one chilled slope-shouldered brown bottle courtesy of Murchmac, my 1964 Schlitz can punch and bottle opener, and it's on..."
I found this at Whole Foods.
Received in a trade with bret27. This will be my first RR experience. Thanks Bret!
"Pint bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled on 11.04.08, drank 1.14.09 at 53°f. Super clear golden with a giant fluffy white white, which settles down to a solid 1/4"" that hangs around. Tons of sticky lace. Aroma is sweet hops coming forward as pineapple and other vaguely tropical smells. The flavor is super juicy, hops, sugary lemons and pineapple, despite initially sweet, it finishes dry, tangy and lightly acidic along the sides of my tongue. The ABV leaves a light tingle. This thing finishes super clean, no coating, with just a light warming sensation in the back of the throat. I could bathe in this stuff."
Tasted alongside Coronado IPA for comparison
"Can't believe I haven't yet reviewed this beer. One of my first great IPAs I ever had. While I've had it on tap and prefer it slightly over its bottled brethren, I'm reviewing Pliny poured from a 500mL bottle chilled. Bottled 10-21-09."
Nice pale orange pour with a island mass of fluffy clouds that sits atop the surface.
I bought this beer in San Fransisco and poured it into an Anchor Steam pint glass.
"Finally, my favorite beer in growler form!"
"As a lover of the american IPA, this is superb. Thanks to the kind heart of Rick at Big Z beverage in Huntington, I was able to try this beer. It had a wonderful piney hop aroma. It was probably the best smelling beer hopwise that I have ever experienced. The color was a cloudy orange with a nice head. The flavor was extremely balanced. The flavor of the hops was not overpowering nor was it too bitter. The malt flavor was hidden by the hops which was ok for me because the hop flavor was so explosive. This is a must try for any IPA fan. I could drink this IPA all day. Russian River is amazing."
500 mL bottle poured into a Goose Island snifter.
"This is my very first beer review. This is my second IPA beer to try ever. First IPA I ever tried was Stone's Ruination. After first glass I had it enough, couldn't finish it. After reading so many favorable reviews for the Elder I couldn't wait to find it and give it a try. This morning I made a special 20mi trip to WholeFoods in Cupertino to get my hand on this iconic beer. I got two 500ml bottles. Rest of the day i was running around and had Round Table Veggie Gourmet pizza for lunch. I didn't drink anything afterwards sparing my thirst for the Elder. "
"Was on the west coast last week on business and finally had a chance to try this very sought after D-IPA. Had on tap and also in the bottle, I much prefer the tap version, for this review, it's a bottle version."
"Thanks a Fuk-ton to my Cali connect for this gem!! Bryanbrick, you sir are my hero."
"This is my review for PLiny the lder on tap, in which form it is simply an incredible beer, by far the greatest double IPA I have ever had. I'm not just saying this because it's from my hometown, either, for this beer amazingly combines assertive hop character with firm maltiness, yet restraint, incredible balance, and a perfect feel that is neither to heavy nor too thin. "
"A: Poured with a large, white, frothy head that hung around for a bit before easing down to 1/2-finger or so. Body is a really nice-looking golden orange color, and hazy."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow/orange color with golden ripe banana hues when held to a light source and a two finger frothy white head with excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Soapy rings of lacing coat the glass."
I have little reason than karma to review this guy since its reputation is well set and I won't everforget the flavor of this delightful creation. That being said...
Apperearance: Pours brilliant orange-gold. Tight tall head that you could shave with.
"Clear golden/straw color, very sticky white lace."
"Appearance: gold in color, 1/4 inch head, clear, moderate carbonation"
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into the mighty Duvel tulip. Had this once before on tap at Pizza Port a few weeks ago while I was visiting SD. That was our last stop of the night and I dont remember much of it. Needed to try this again with a clear head, friend was nice enough to ship a fresh bottle out to me."
"Pours a clear, orange-ish color, with a good amount of carbonation cascading up the side of the glass. Forms a pretty thick, white colored head, that recedes to a dense layer of bubbles, leaving a very intricate lace pattern on the glass."
"Tried this beer after much anticipation, and I must say, it did not disappoint. Light transparent orange poured into a pint glass, with a finger of white head leaving a nice lace throughout most of the glass. Pine and grapefruit notes are prevalent, with some added bitter citrus and well-balanced hoppiness. Taste was lighter than I had anticipated, but was plenty complex and had great hop presence and citrus chracteristics, balanced by a subtle maltiness that becomes more apparent as it warms up. Not as sharp and destructive feel as some other DIPA's, and just the right amount of carbonation to compliment the bite. The 8% abv is barely noticeable, and this is an extremely drinkable beer. I could go through several in an outing if unstopped. This is always in high demand throughout local beer stores, and is truly one of the greater DIPA's on the market. I will definitely pick up some more when it is available."
Week old bottle.
Bottle shared by alexsdad06.
Poured from a 500ml bottle into 32oz giant Pinot Noir glass. 
"500 ml bottle- pours a deep yellow straw with excellent clarity and frothy white head. Nose- intense hop nose of fresh hops- pine, tropical fruit, you name it. Just a blast of hop goodness. Its a hop head's dream. They should make a cologne that smells like this. Taste- sweet tropical fruit followed by cookie dough and caramel. The hop bitterness shines through in the finish with no trace of astringentness. Body is quite light for the strength of the beer, carbonation is spot on. A true gem"
22 oz bomber served in an oversized wineglass. 
"First and foremost, a big thank you is in line to SpdKilz. A great beer from a great BA."
Color is bronze with good lacing ; very appealing herbal-citrus-hoppy smell ; taste of hops strong but the solid malt balances it ; strong bitterness but a nice sweet note comes in too. For 8.00 abv this beer is amazingly drinkable. Its world class status is well-deserved. I wish it were easier to find here in N.Y.
I about pooped myself when my friend Don was gifted one of these.
"taste- bitter hop bomb, strong malt backbone"
"I am not usually a fan of the exceptionally hoppy IPAs, but I heard good things about RR brewing company, so I figured I'd give this bad boy a go."
"A - When held up to the light the beer is a clear golden yellow. No cloudiness. When shaded a bit it takes on a more orange/very light copper hue. The white head settles to a very minute thickness, but leaves itself sticking to the side of the glass, leaving a temporary coat before slowly ebbing back downward creating a nice spiderweb on the sides of my glass."
Have heard of this DIPA but never gazed my eyes on it until today. I have to say that I'm extremely happy that my local bar carriers this for only $4/pint during Happy Hour 2pm-8pm.
"A: Bronze with a white head, thin ring of retention, good lacing."
Thank you to my college roommate for picking this up for me in LA. This is my first PtE so obviously I was going to chug it and call it a day but I changed my mind at the last minute. 
The excitement is building like a huge wave as I await the opening of this bottle. Thankfully the time has come for the meeting of this epic beer and my tastebuds. 
Thanks to BevmoIan for sending me two very fresh bottles of this! Thanks Ian!
"From notes. Clear, copper, active, thick foamy head lasts and lasts, patchy lacing. SMELL is piny, citrus, floral and sweet. Complex, and with long legs and a hint of heat. TASTE floral and citrusy hops first, malty sweetness emerges and balances, followed by sharp citrusy hops and bitterness, which fades into the finish and then lingers a bit. FEEL pleasant medium bodied texture, slight lingering bitterness. OVERALL very flavorful, not too filling, well hidden alc. But still a sipper."
Sampled from a 500ml bottle. Bottled on date was 9/22/09 so it's nice and fresh.
A masterpiece of a beer. It poured a tawny copper color with a nice fluffy white head. Hopalicious aroma. A distinct pine and grapefruit aroma. The taste has a decidedly balanced flavor for such a hop monster. Nice breadiness compliments the grapefruit flavor from the hops. A nice medium body with average carbonation. The absoulte most drinkable IIPA in existence and one of the ONLY beers that ever has lived up to the hype.
A- Fantastic. Perfect golden colorings. Extremely appetizing. A frothy white head radiating hop aroma.
wow...i get to live 20 mins away from sitting at the russian river bar. cant take that for granted
500mL bottle received from saulcharlesworth. Bottled date is 8/31/2009 so decently fresh considering we're in Kansas...
"Bottle from a trade with GilGarp. Thanks!! I've been fortunate enough to have this awesome beer several times, the freshest being a 7 day old bottle I had in Seattle. This beer is best when experienced in the first 3 weeks and goes SIGNIFICANTLY downhill at week 5+. Keep that in mind if you're trading for it!!"
"Poured it from a bottle, dated on 9/22/09, so that is hella fresh. I just had a Sculpin before this, so not only will I be able to review a beer I have loved for over a year, I can also compare the two. "
Served to me on tap in a 10oz snifter at the Craft Ale House in Limerick soon after their Grand Opening. What a line-up they had this day!
"A-- Appearance is orange and clear, pouring with a nice sized head of soapy foam, which dissipates leaving nice lace along the glass."
"Pliny the Elder is mildly hazy and copper in color. It's topped by a creamy, off-white head that retains well and leaves fluffy lace clinging to the glass. The aroma can be summed up in two words ""intensly hoppy"". The hops are herbal, piney and strongly resiny. Swirling the beer brings out even more resiny hops. There are fruity notes of apricots and oranges, malty sweetness, and toastiness that comes out on swirling. It's like sticking your nose into a bag of hops."
"Appearance is copper-orange and spectacularly clear, pouring with a nice sized head of soapy foam, which dissipates leaving nice lace along the glass."
"500ml bottle, hand-delivered from San Francisco to Chicago by my cousin. The beer I'm reviewing is the last one of the 10 he brought."
Dated 9/10/09 only 15 days old. Poured into a 22 oz snifter.
Thanks to Tyler for bringing this one back from California. 
"I will be aborting the standard format for this review. If you want specifics, there are no shortage of reviews on this very site. Suffice it to say, this beer has made my Top 5 list and I feel blessed for having been able to imbibe such a nectar."
500 ml bottle poured into an oversized wine glass
"Had my first bottle of this stuff about a year ago at Stone Brewery. That day changed my life, I like to think. Not quite sure why I've been holding off on reviewing this one. I suppose I never thought I could do it any justice. "
500 ml bottle poured into an oversized wine glass
"On tap at Teresas next door in wayne, $6.50 for a 10oz pour."
"I doubt I have anything to say about this amazing beer that hasn't already been said on here, but I liked it so much I can't resist. I had this on tap and in a bottle this past week while out in oregon and california. I found the (very recently) bottled version to be slightly more enjoyable (thanks to bier one in newport, or). Amazing hop/citrus aroma out of the bottle, more so than any dipa i've ever had. Color and complexion are pleasant but nothing out of the ordinary. "
"First off, a big thanks to my cousin for bringing this beer with him to OH on a x-country trip from CA."
"Cheers to a certain mail order beer company who sticks it to the man & will ship to PA! 8/19/09 batch. Pours with a big head which settles slowly. Color is a bit light for a DIPA. Smells & tastes of citrus & pine hops and not much else. Mouthfeel is smooth considering the hoppiness. An 8% ABV helps make this very drinkable for the style. A huge DIPA which is worth seeking if you are a hop head. I have had this on draft many times & it is just as good in a bottle. One of my favorite beers, period."
I'm not a big fan of IPAs but I've tasted quite a few and Pliny the Elder is arguably the definitive IPA. The hop aroma is incredible - like my nose was buried in a double handful of fresh hops. 
"I'll be the guy who says that for me-this beer didn't live up to the hype. Great IPA but I was expecting something legendary like the Pliny to be phenomenal and it wasn't. It was simply as good as other great IPA's. Which lucky for the Pliny's score, I happen to love great IPA's."
Clear amber color with sizeable creamy white head. Absolutely delicious and citrusy whiff of hops with the faintest toasted notes behind it. Hops fills the mouth with zesty and tangy hoppiness which is well balanced between aroma and bitterness. The grapefruity citrus notes linger on the tongue until fading late into smooth bitterness and nice alcohol warmth. Body is deceptively light. Lots of beautiful lacing. 
A: Pours a hazy reddish/orange color. A large beige head forms and gently recedes to leave some nice lace.
"Thank you to redbrewer83 for this. Received in a trade only last Wednesday, drinking this while it is still nice and fresh. Bottled 070909. I had this on tap once and apparently never reviewed it...so here goes."
"According to the beeradvocate reviewers, one of the best beers on this planet. After months of waiting, I finally managed to buy two bottles in a beershop. Does it live up the hype...? This beer should potentially the best one of my second beer tasting evening with PapaEugene. Poured into a Rochefort glass. The beer pours hazy-dark yellow (had to think about morning urine immediately), with a beautiful snow-white head that disappeared fast into a somewhat messy lacing. "
"A friend of mine bought be seven bottles of this. What a good friend. This review is from the last bottle I have left. Poured the bottle of into a Duvel tulip glass. Leaves a nice foamy white head that lingers for quite a while. Lots of lacing on the glass. The color is a light orange shade and very cloudy. Tiny bubbles work their way up the glass. I could smell this beer when I opened the bottle. Wonderfully strong in the nose. Lots of hoppy aroma. Noticeable citrus and pine presence in the aroma. The taste is much the same. Absolutely delicious. Big hoppy bite, followed by a strong grapefruit taste...almost tastes like a grapefruit rind was dropped in. A fair amount of bitterness but not overpowering. A real lip smacker. Very strong taste and nicely balanced. Medium body and not a lot of mouth stick. It's got an almost ""oily"" mouthfeel to it and it makes me want to chatter my teeth. This is real easy to drink, but I need to sip this and savor it. Who knows when I'll get more Pliny. I had high expectations and those were certainly met. Pliny is a fantastic beer."
"Reviewed today, 9/12/09, freshness date 8/23/09. Poured from 500ml bottle to a small ""pint"" style glass at City Beer in San Francisco. "
Should be the most promising beer from the second beertasting session with rvdoorn. We split a 500 ml bottle.
Poured In: Tulip Glass
I picked up an extremely fresh batch for the recent holiday weekend and enjoyed it so much I decided to re-review. Just getting around to typing up notes now. Bottled 08/31/09 consumed 09/05/09. 
"I've had this at Toranado in San Francisco and I was fortunate enough for a friend of mine to bring me back two bottles from his recent visit to Sonoma. According to the label, it was bottled on 8/19/09. It also implores me not to lay bottle #2 and drink it fresh. Not sure if I'll heed that one..."
"My beer buddy and I had been dying to try Pliny the Elder after reading all the rave reviews and high marks, but because Russian River doesn't distribute to the right coast, we had to reach out to a left coast contact to have it sent east. It is a great beer and worth the wait."
On tap at Russian River.
"Consumed on 9/7/2009 and poured into a tulip. I'm ashamed to admit that I take this beer for granted. Fresh bottles are always on the shelf at my local store and it's always on tap at a nearby bar, yet I rarely drink it. I realized the other day that I hadn't even reviewed this staple, so I picked up a bottle today. This is dated 8/31/2009 so it's just a week old. The beer appears golden orange with a silky and frothy two finger white head. The head lingers for a few minutes and as it recedes it leaves a thick coating of lacing clinging to the glass."
"Got this awesome-o surprise as an extra from Solomon420, thanks again Damian! I've been holding this beast in anticipation for a short while, and today was my son's first birthday so I decided to crack it. Imagine a kid getting locked in a candy store but also have the unfortunate disadvantage of diabetes or something, that's what it was like not just destroying this beer immediately."
"I am happy and consider myself very fortunate to be reviewing this warhorse of the craft beer industry. I wish it was available in my area, but the absence and relative difficulty of getting it makes it that much more gratifying to try. "
"Ahh, my first pliny, bottled on 07-20-09, so its not that old and should give me a representation of what it truly is."
"A - Two fingers of white foam on top of a clear, golden orange body. The head settles slowly and leaves thick lace."
"First time on a PtE from the bottle. First review here at BA. Purchased today from Bottleworks in Seattle. ($5 a bottle, not bad) says it was bottled 08/19/2009, so this is about as fresh as a Washingtonian can get from the bottle."
Poured from a 16.9oz bottle.
First off have to thank my future mother-in-law for picking this beer up for me in California. Hands down best beer i've ever had so far. 500ml bottle poured into snifter
"On tap at O'Briens pup in San Diego, 16oz glass"
Big thanks goes to AgentZero who hooked me up with this in a trade. Poured into a few tasting glasses to enjoy with friends.
Got this growler from ipa247. Thanks go to Jeff for hooking me up with this bottle of magic.
"Because I love this beer, I will review it in the voice of Emperor Vespasian, close personal friend to Pliny the Elder."
"Had it on tap in a local beer bar in Folsom CA, it's was a wonderful experience. First glance, pour very cloudy with murky yellow. The smell was very extremely present, it went down quite nicely and it was very smooth. The Elder is a well balanced beer, world class beer."
"Pours a deep gold with peach highlights. A finger of head displays thick bubbles. The aroma is bursting with hop goodness--tons of grapefuit and pine. First taste is all grapefruit, and then that west coast bittterness, drying pine, fruity sweetness, some alcohol, melon. It definitely coats the tongue and finishes long and dry. Not sure that I would want to drink more than one 500ml bottle in one sitting, as it is so satisfying and flavorful, but it would be a regular treat if I had the access. No wonder Russian River can't keep up with demand!"
"For my second bottle of Pliny, I decided to do a head to head taste test with another of my favorites to get a really good feel for this brew. I chose a Two Hearted Ale. I did a blind taste test. The Pliny was much cloudier in appearance, and the smell was far more dramatic. The hop fragrance lept out of the glass. It had more depth and body, and was the smoother beer overall. I love the Two Hearted, but it was a bit thin in comparison (I guessed the beers after a short time with the blind test). I also tried a bit of a HopSlam in comparison, but it is past it's prime now - too much honey, not enough hops. The Pliny is an extremely well balanced IPA, as good as any I've had. I would love to try it against an Alesmith IPA."
"First timer for Pliny the Elder, and I must say the anticipation was intense. Thanks to saulcharlseworth for the trade!! We can't get it here on the East Coast. Respect hops, consume fresh! First impression: golden nectar color, crystal clear with bright white, medium head and pleasing piney hop aroma that doesn't overpower. First sip: mmm, nice but I think it's a bit too cold - it's masking the flavor. Swirl, let it sit for a few minutes. Mmm better, more aroma and flavor coming through. Nicely balanced, medium body, about 7.5-out-of-10 on the hop-richter scale. Halfway through, smooth, balanced, simple pleasing hop profile, that's not trying too hard. Final: well made, very well balanced, 8% sneaks up on you. Wait, I don't think I tasted everything, can I have another? Nutshell: fabulous as an IPA, but only great as a DIPA/Imperial."
"Poured from a bottle dated 7/06/09, a vigorous pour resulted in about two and a half fingers of thin white head above a dark golden brew... In my opinion, this is what a IPA/double IPA should look like. Not too heavy on the dark malt to let the excellent hop character be the center of attention. Smell is of canned pineapple and grapefruit, with a little grassiness thrown in for good measure. A truly amazing smelling beer. Taste is similar to the smell, with pineapple coming in a slight bit less then the smell would have led me on to think. Lots of citrus and grassy flavor with just enough malt. As it warms the alcohol starts to lend itself to the flavor a little more. Mouthfeel is light yet not watery, with the hops being the dominant player here rather then having a sweet sticky mouthfeel from too much malt. Drinkability is good but not amazing. I really like this beer overall, but usually after 500ml I am ready to move on to something else. Overall this is an exceptional beer with only a few serious rivals in the best DIPA category."
"Received in trade from nomomentwasted, 2 weeks old not bad at all, especially since 5 of those days were spent in transit."
Bottle pours a clear golden color with a nice frothy white head. Has a real nice aroma to it. It reminds me of pine and citrus right away. The mouthfeel is medium and leads into a great upfront citrus blast. That leads to a great caramel malt flavor that finishes with a pine flavor. Overall this is a really nice brew. I am not sure how they managed to avoid hop haze with this one. It was so clear. Good stuff.
"Hoppy birthday to me, hoppy birthday to me. This is an excellent double IPA, super hoppy in aroma and flavor. Pours a bright yellow with 1/4 inch head. Bright carbonation brings the pine and hop aromas to the nose. The taste is nice and bitter with the unmistakable taste of fresh hops. "
bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. pours a rich golden color with two fingers of pillowy white head. solid lacings and great retention.
500ml bottle poured in a snifter. Thanks to theghost3 for thowing this in as an extra!
Reviewing my first bottle after having Pliny on tap a couple weeks ago. This is good but not as great as on tap. 
"Growler filled at the Craft Ale House, tulip glass"
Just an exceptional brew in every way. Been rated and praised so much I'll keep it brief.
"Half-pint poured at Falling Rock tap house in Denver, CO"
Really looking forward to this one. Poured from 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 7/6/2009.
Thanks nkerston for this beer. Bottled on 072009. Pours a hazy dark amber color with one inch of white head. The head slowly settles to a thick cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass.
Pours a hazy orange color with creamy head and a complete layer of lacing which sticks to the sides of the glass.
Poured into a Snifter
Poured into a tulip with a one finger rocky head that sticks heavily to the glass. 
Everytime I drink a Pliny it's like i'm opening one for the first time and each time I can't believe how incredible it is.
Acquired through a trade with bkrefetz.
"Huge thanks to the sommelier at my local grocery, Bruce, for pulling me aside and letting me know he got his hands on some of these. I've been wanting to try this for some time but it is hard to find in Washington state."
I drank this beer from the bottle into a chalice.
Had this beer in a 2oz sample glass at the brewery as part of a sampler.
"Thanks to iconoklaztor for giving us this one at DLD. Been waiting for this one, probably shouldn't have waited so long."
Fresh Growler
500 mL bottle poured into St. Bernardus chalice
500mL brown glass pry-top bottle. Dated 07-09-09.
"500ml, bottled on 05.26.09, served into leffe snifter. bought on ebay from lakerfan858."
Ordered today on tap with a great hamburger at Father's Office in Santa Monica. Great lunch!
Received this beer from steadydose in a trade. HUGE thank you Russell! Immediately put it in the fridge to chill for tonight. 
Bottled version (bottled on 6/10/09) poured into a pint glass and consumed on 6/30/09. Freshest Pliny I've ever had out of a bottle to date.
"This beer looks really great. A beautiful golden hue with a dense, fluffy off white head. Just great."
"A - Beautiful golden hue, huge head on this beer, a good 3+ fingers deep. Quick fade on the head, leaving some impressive lacing."
"Pours out bright yellow and sits a gleaming gold in the glass with a large frothy white head, lending good lacings all around."
Thanks to vasdef42 for the trade!
"Had on-tap at Naja's in Redondo Beach, CA."
"Had this as part of a tasting session with a buddy a while back. Finally had this wonderful brew! Wanted so badly to review it poorly, but it really does live up to it's hype. Poured golden in color with frothy white head that left good lacing. Smelled very hoppy, with caramel malts and citrus fruit. Tasted the same. Incredibly smooth. Definitely one of my favorite IPAs now."
Appearance 
My first perfect rated beer and this hophead found his brew. 
"Deep golden, but poured with no head. Clear with some carbonation. Aroma of citrus and pine which was also present in the in the first taste. Medium mouthfeel with some bite from the carbonation which was maintained through the finish. Not as over-the-top as some DIPAs. Well balanced."
"Review 1,000 of this amazing beer."
a: pours a golden color with strong amber hues. theres about a quarter inch of head that dissapears slowly leaving a very thick ring of lacing around the edge of the glass
Got the chance thanks to a trade from Alen. You rock dude!
"A: Clear golden copper, nice head, nice lacing"
My first Pliny the Elder. The bottle tells me that this beer is about 3 weeks old. Pretty good considering it was brewed a couple thousand miles away.
"Bottle from My Secret Santa, thx santa. Pours a hazy orange gold with a good lasting off white head. The head is foamy and laces well. Has a good hoppy aroma of citrus, and musty pine. Has a good carbonation and a wonderful mouthfeel. The taste is great. More thin than thick but a great mix. Has a super bitterness too it but is so well balanced it works great. Alcohol is hidden very well. The texture is thin as I said earlier. Has a great finish and the perfect aftertaste. This is just one awesome beer. Has a medium body. I would drink this anytime anywhere I love this beer."
What can I say that hasn't been said? Nothing.
Thanks to route66pubs for this one.
"A- Thick head, excellent lacing, golden brown in color."
"Pliny the Elder would be proud to have this beer named for him. The pour was coppery and clear with a nice white head. The hop aroma was distinct and pleasant. The first taste was all I had hoped it would be after reading so much about this brew. Hops, hops and more hops. A good clean finish with just enough lingering to please a true hop head."
Had this beer 12 days after it was bottled.
"I write this as someone who is *not* a hophead, so bear that in mind. Despite my less than manly palate, I thought this was really pretty good. Pours a rich golden color with a two-finger, rocky head that shrinks, but lingers. The smell (to me) was like a pine tree, but not nearly as pungent as I've had in regular IPA's, let alone DIPA's. The taste is hoppy, to be sure; but there's some malt there to keep it in check. The hops linger on the tongue quite a while after swallowing. Mouthfeel is nice -- light, with good carbonation."
"Amber pour with a very thin white head. Pine and citrus hops as well as a bit of honey in the aroma. Flavor is pine hops, herb, caramel, toffee. The malt backbone is just barely hinted at in this one. Finised very bitter, dry. Good carbonation on the newer samples that I've had."
500ml bottle purchased for me by my friend when he was on a trip to San Francisco. According to the label it was bottled on 6/10/09. Hard to expect it any fresher than that in GA. Poured it into a Sierra Nevada Hop Tulip glass.
"Another one from my trip to Seattle, an hour off the plane and shared the first bottle, and by nights end had popped second, with a third bottle opened a couple of days later."
"Poured from bottle to a snifter, THANKS TO womencantsail!!!!"
a - poured a three-fingers billowy tan head into a snifter that left a dense head and thick lacing throughout. the body was a hazy light amber color.
"500 ml bottle (as pictured), brought back from California."
"Light brown, like a lightly dusted pine cone, the head caps a prototypical beer. Even to the commoner, the non-drinker even, this looks like a beer should look. Undoubtedly, I'm influenced and affected by the hoopla surrounding this beer. The bottle's unique, the label's informative, and the forthright marketing that encourages immediate consumption are all great. The beer offers a light, even straw-colored glow. It some ways it looks ordinary, but as it sits, the foam retracts ever-so-slowly, shedding its thick residue as it settles with liquid. It looks extraordinary."
Poured from 500ml bottle into two white wine glasses. Thanks to HeatherAnn for the assist!
Edited review due to having a fresh bottle from cali. Also had on tap in cali. Bottle dated 12/23/09
"Okay, so I did not understand why this was such a high rating brew until I actually started reviewing it, then I realized that giving it anything low would just be so supremely unfair. "
"A- transparent, with a slight haze, amber-gold body with a beautiful pillowy white head that has great retention. looks like a west coast ipa through and through."
"A very good and well-made beer but... (there is always a ""but"") this did not live up to the hype for me. Don't get me wrong. This was a darn fine double IPA. Definitely in the top-tier of double IPAs."
Served in a small snifter. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 
"Acquired thanks to a trade with goodbyeohio. Pours a thinly veiled gold with two fingers of fluffy white head that creates some nice lacing as it dissipates. The relatively plain appearance does little to signal what lies ahead (call it the Clark Kent of DIPAs). The smell is mango and pineapple with some light pine and vanilla underneath. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a DIPA with lively carbonation that helps convey a variety of hop flavors without ever feeling too heavy. Not as much malt balance as some may like: a pleasant but brief vanilla/mango sweetness at the beginning is quickly dispensed with as the hop show begins. However, Pliny is not a blindly flailing hop jambouree either; there is some subtlety underneath the brawn. When the sweetness fades, the grapefruit hop flavors come in, providing a delicate transition before the stronger pine notes treat your tonsils like a boxer's speed-bag. The finish gives a delayed dry smack to the back of the throat and then a prolonged hop aftertaste that contains only a hint of the 8% alcohol. Very drinkable for a beer this flavorful: despite its complexity and intensity, the mouthfeel keeps Pliny a lively elder. Pairs nicely with sweet & spicy BBQ."
Poured with a huge fluffy head that disappeared shortly.
Well I finally know what all the fuss is about. This was definetely worth the trip. 
Voted the best beer in 2009 Zymurgy Magazine poll!
Tremendous thanks to BigEBeer for trading with me.
"Basically everything I said about the bottled version, but even moreso. On tap, this beer is just something really special. The flavors are all there just as expected, but the mouthfeel is really improved - silky smooth with a bit more carbonation and perfect body. Truly a joy to sip and enjoy."
"500ml bottle. Bottled on 4/7/09. Served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear pale gold with two fingers of white head. Big piney hop aroma. For some reason I got a little cat piss, but hey I've got cats. It went away quickly. It wasn't as bitter as the nose would suggest. Medium bodied with a decent malt base. Long dry finish with the mouth pucker you would expect from a DIPA. Maybe could have been a bit fresher. Good beer, but I think I expected more."
"on-tap at deep ellum, in allston, ma, on april 23, 2009, during the week of the craft brewers conference. vinnie cilurzo was in attendance. served in a stemmed teardrop glass."
"I got this beer for a birthday present yesterday, and enjoyed it. The beer was freshly shipped from Cali. It poured a yellowed copper color with a lasting head and decent lacing. The smell is mostly citrus hops with a light herbal hops in the background. The taste was amazing. Not much malts, but they're not a feature of this style--just enough to get a nice balance. Pliny the Elder was very smooth (probably the smoothest beer I've had) and had great carbonation. The only knock in drinkability is the ABV, but even that is low for the style. Excellent beer."
"500ml bottle that is two weeks old today. Pours a hazy copper with a large, substantial white head that lasts. Copious hops on the nose, with heavy citrus/grapefruit, floral, herbal, and even slightly cannabis-like notes. Very hop-forward taste as well, again with a lot of citrus and herbal qualities; really complex hop profile. Quite bitter, but still very palatable. Very light biscuity malt in the background. Medium-full body with high carbonation, which suit it well. By nature it's not something that lends itself to easy drinking, though for the style it's quite decent."
"My sister brought this back from a recent trip to the West coast. It pours a slightly hazy gold with a this head. Filtering a beer like Pliny has to be a sin so the haze is fine with me. The aroma is powerful citrusy American hops. Tons of grapefruit, and resiny pine with other citrus as well. There is some sweet pale malt in there, I can smell it if I really try, but the huge hop aroma overwhelms. Hop flavor and bitterness hit up front and alternate across my tongue. The same citrusy and resiny hops dominate as well as some pine and a bitter herbal flavor. The bitterness is so pronounced that I can feel it in my throat a bit, but the beer is still totally drinkable. Some fruity esters pop up in the finish, pairing well with the hops. This one lives up to the hype, and I would buy it regularly if it ever makes it to the East Coast."
"so im at my local liquor store loking for a new beer to try. I see my buddy, how works there and he tells me he just got in a case of the best beer he ever had. He even kept it in the back where customers couldn't see it, ha! curious, so I had to buy it."
Oh what a beer. 
On tap at Falling Rock Tap House (Denver)
"Seeing as Pliny has such an incredibly high rating, it has quite a bit to live up to, it has never disappointed me."
"Pours slightly hazy, darker yellow in color (maybe a touch amber). Wonderful hoppy aroma - grapefruit and sticky pine notes. They should bottle just the smell alone. Taste is of course about hops as well; however, there is just enough base for the hops not to be overwhelming. There is some sweetness at the tip of the tongue and then hop bitterness fills your mouth and sticks with you for some time. Although this beer is very bitter it is not too over the top (I don't feel that it's all just about hops). The body is light to medium. Very pleasant mouthfeel. And for the style it is very drinkable. "
Enjoyed on 06.20.09 from a 500ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 05.26.09.
Poured into a snifter and took care not to carry any sediment.
I personally think all good beers these days cost way to much. But this one despite how expensive it is for a 20 Oz bottle takes the cake. It is hands down the best brew I have had ever. Great for special occasions.
"Love it, love, love it. Like everyone said. The perfect balance of hops and malt that isn't too much of anything. Not too hot, not too hoppy, nothing. Just perfection. I've had it on tap and in bottles. The best part is that it also travels well. I've had this shipped to me in new york from the west coast several times and never had a problem."
Maybe I need this one on-tap. Appearance is very good nice head- looks very oily and fun. Smell is nice with some decent fruitiness.Good firm blast of hops with decent amount of bitternes detected. The tasted is a bit weaker- seems like this has lost a bit of hoppiness- I want it on tap. Mouthfeel is very good. Lots of oily and maltiness. Drinkability is very good.
"I got this brew in a trade with danielcurtis81, Thanks Dan!"
thanks to ScreamForMe for this one
"bottled on 6-10-09, obtained in a trade. thanks again to Chris. i poured this into a tulip glass it is a very clear burnt orange color with a nice creamy head that fades slightly into a creamy ring. great sticky rorschach lacing."
"bottled on 4.29.09. golden orange, slight haze, nice creamy white head and lacing. incredible floral notes dominate the nose with some honey, citrus, grassy and tropical fruit notes underneath. lemony, sharp but not harsh bitterness overpowers the very light sweetness of the biscuity malts. seems almost completely dry/attenuated. body is on the light side of medium, nicely carbonated, with a spritzy/prickly mouthfeel. long hoppy bitter finish with some aspirin-like astringency. thanks to natasharai for this one."
"WoW, thank you RichBeer for this tasty treat! Being in MN trading or traveling is my only way of accessing this beer."
"Served on tap at the Green Frog Cafe in Bellingham, WA from the only keg to make it north of Seattle. After years of hype and expectation, could this beer live up to it's reputation?"
Had this on tap at Falling Rock
"I've had this beer a few times, both out of a pint-size bottle and on tap at Stone Brewing Co. most recently. The on-tap is better if you have the chance, the flavors really come out a bit better."
Been waiting to get my hands on this one for a while. Bottled 05-13-09. Thanks to Joey.
"Had this on tap at the Bier Stein a few times as well as in a bottle. It tends to taste differently each time I have it on tap which is weird. Served nice and chilly with a white bubbly, foamy head. Great smell of floral and fruity hops. Clear and deep golden with an amber color. The taste is great, but can change depending on when/where you have it. The best I've had was actually from the bottle - a great refreshing taste of strong floral hops up front, then the fruity hops hit your palate, followed by just the slightest hint of well-covered, crisp alcohol. Very refreshing and drinkable for a double IPA."
Everytime I drink this one I enjoyed it more than the previous. The fresher the better!
Glass- Tripel Karmeliet Tulip
Bottled 5/13/09
"I had this on-tap at the Drafting room for brunch, leftover the west coast brewery night."
"Wow very good, cool looking bottle ,great tasting beer."
"500 ml bottle courtesy of ironlung via trade, bottled 4-29-09."
"Pours a moderate one finger head of off-white, mixed bubble size foam, some stickiness to the lacing whereas the head mostly gone in about a minute or so. Light golden-yellow in color with a metallic orange tinge which brightens more than darkens, comes extremely close to transparency. There's a certain bluntness to the nose, like it kicks there door open and then just stands there unmoving in the door way, thick pink to white grapefruit, tangerine citrus notes resonant yet not juicy nor zesty per se, in turn the floral notes more citrus blossom than well-rounded ""musk"" and the peach, nectarine, pineapple, papaya fruit scents present more thrust than expansiveness, not insanely hoppy nor grassy but sufficient enough to put any malty scents way in the background. Medium-bodied, too tightly wound as well as aggressively carbonated to really get full-bodied. Peppery mouth entry, quite spicy, forestalls the grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus component for a tick or two. Pine resin clearer here, florality a little more hidden. Doesn't come off as that dry, hence more juice in the peach, nectarine, mango fruit and less tropical bite. Sweet tea leaf oils accrue with time and at the very end you can tease out some cocoa powder. Can't say it's not balanced but when you don't risk many agile dance moves, hard not to be. (Bottled 04/07/09)"
"Bottled 5-26-09, thanks to FMetzger for bringing this one back from the brewery fresh. Hazy appearance, color is halfway between copper and gold. Half-inch, off-white foam holds steadily, leaving a sudsy lace. The hop dominant aroma leads with pine notes, as citrus fruit stays more in the background. "
On tap at Falling Rock.
I've been waiting a while for this one. Special thanks to my wife who brought this home from her trip to Washington. 
"WOW, what a great beer! Poured into a La Fin Du Monde tulip, it was a really nice golden color with a short tight head. Two weeks old and it was very fresh, hoppy, citrusy, piney & crisp. Very easy to drink. Carbonation was the perfect amount. This is easily my new favorite IIPA/DIPA. Great job RR. Now I need to get more shipped to NJ!"
Thanks so much to beerman207 and his wonderful wife who brought this back from a trip to Washington State. Split last night with them and bamadog. 
"Poured a golden color with a thin white head. The aroma is amazing, floral, citrus, piney, it is like walking through a hop farm, exquisite."
Thanks so much to bkrefetz for this one!
"This is my first BA review. Went on a trip to CA bay area and found this in the cooler in a wine shop in Napa, and had to have it based on all the BA reviews I had read previously."
Big thanks to mlaroche for bringing this over from California for an in-person trade.
"Luckily, found this still available at Capone's this afternoon - 2 days for one keg of Pliny? ... Must be getting blasé "
"Appearance - beautiful hazy, golden orange with a creamy white head... nice lacing"
"Okay, what a fantastic surprise to see this bottle sitting right in front of me for all to share last night at our beer festival meeting. It took all the power in the world to pay attention and not crack this one open right away. An hour into, however . . . it was very good, but honestly, not the best Imperial IPA I've tried. Yes, loads of citrus hops that were fantastic to the nose and tastebuds, but this beer's reputation was a little higher than what got. Still would love to get my hands on more, however."
"My first RR brew. Highly anticipated, highly legendary, and I'm highly thirsty for some of that addictive bitter elixer called the double IPA. Thanks to jwelsh for the hookup."
poured from a 500ml bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on 4/29/09.
WoW. This is one incredible brew. It has taken me way too long to try one of these.
"Had on tap at the RR Brewpub in Santa Rosa. While not quite up to the standard of its Younger nephew, a damn fine beer. Like the Younger, poured to a light orange-amber color, with thin white head and good lacing. The nose and taste, while a little subdues than PTY, were still strongly citrus hops with a hint of floral, as well as alcohol kicking in at mid-glass. Mouthfeel was dry and bitter, all rounding to a long, somewhat bittersweet finish."
"A huge thanks to Fetus for this one...once again, I will reiterate my not being a huge fan of DIPAs which kind of made me nervous about this brew. I didn't want to fall into that category of people who hate on the Elder."
This beer is somewhat hard to find in my area but I was finally able to get a bottle and see if it lives up to the hype.
"500mL bottle at refrigerator temperature poured into a snifter. Bottle reads: ""Bottled On: 040709."" Acquired in a trade with twelvsies!"
Served on-tap at TND in a tulip glass
"Bottled ""040709."" "
bottle says 08/25/08
"Appearance: Golden almost amber, Clear. Thick frothy head, most dissipated after first few sips, some remains. "
"Appearance- Very clear, deep amber body. Nice, foamy, 1 finger head with lots of staying power and lace. No effervescence at all once it settles down. Very nice looking tho."
Appearance: Deep golden color. Thick head that dissapates relatively quickly.
"Excellent. Piny, citrusy, flowery, but with a slight, sweet malt backbone - though not too sweet. Perfectly balanced. Smells of flowers and oranges and puppy dogs and other lovely things. Not too strong, which means it's extremely drinkable (though hard to find and kind of expensive). My new favorite IPA."
"A- deep gold, crystal clear, creamy head disappears, leaving beautiful white lacing"
Super Fresh dated 042909 - I'm really gled to try this as fresh as possible.
"golden, light orange....very little carbonation....one finger head that becomes a thin layer leaving very sticky lacing"
"Somewhat hazy, pale orange color. Small tight head on top and a great deal of lacing as it goes on down the glass. Huge flowery aroma-just screams hops. Resiny grapefruit smell. Big blast of hops up front-bitter and flowery at the same time. Sweet malt to go along with the hop blast. Great lingering bitterness. Quite the tongue blast. Good mouthfeel. A great beer flavor wise-I could do this for hours on end and not get bored. Well balanced for the IBUs that are obviuosly going on. Nice treat-I have wanted to try this for this for ages."
"Poured from the bottle with a surprisingly long lasting creamy white head layered on top a slightly hazy rich amber liquid. The nose seems to be remarkably stable given it seems as intense from the bottle I bought in Washington as it was when I drank it from the tap at Russian River. The ""C"" hops are holding nothing back from the nose to the mouth as the piny citrus notes dominate everything. Given its status as a double IPA it is surprisingly uncloying with a clean lasting finish. However, the lasting impact of the hops on the tongue and roof of my mouth gets it a slight ding for drinkability. As well, this is one I will only drink one of at a time and have my hop needs met, no need for seconds tonight. Overrall the best double IPA I have ever had and will regularly revisit as long as I can find it at my local store."
Poured from bottle into New Belgium Globe Glass.
A- Clear yellow with a moderate head that dissipates quickly and no lacing.
bottle sent by the very generous Ghengis22 poured into la chouffe tulip bottled on 04-07-09
"Huge thanks to Scream4me for the second shipment of PtE, great trader. Poured from a bottle into a snifter."
"Finally, I have the privilege to review this one, acquired in a trade with Chaseabeer. Poured into my Duvel tulip from the distinctive 500 ml bottle with the humorous and minimalist label. Bottled on March 9th of this year."
"overrated. have been waiting to find this beer for a while now, and when i got it, wasn't special. boring color, no head, the hops caused an imbalance of taste. had alot better balanced ipas in vancouver. hopefully plindy the younger tastes better when I come around to actually find it, but this time i won't be so hyped to try it."
"500ml bottle (bottled on 4/7/09) poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Received in a trade from Arbitrator - thank you, thank you, thank you."
"This is an exceptional beer. I only wish that it was a little cheaper (I can't find it below $5 a bottle down here in So Cal), and available more places."
"Appearance- Golden amber in color with a thick head that slowly dissipates. Good carbonation, looks tasty. "
"This Famed Double IPA really deserves all the hype. This beer is truly one in a million! Now on to the review. 500ml bottle poured into my trusty Duvel Tulip.(bottled on 4/07/09) As soon as I opened the bottle the citrus and pine smells were apparent. Tastes were grapefruit up front, followed by more citrus notes and pine of course. Very, very smooth for a double IPA. I could live with just this beer for the rest of my life. Simply incredible!!! Double IPA is my favorite style and this is at the very top of my list! I would love to try the younger when it gets to the Philly area again. The 2 hour drive would be well worth it. If ever there was a beer I would praise as perfect, this would be it! Cheers and go Find Pliny!!!"
This is one beautiful beer..all the way around.
Look- orange/gold some head that fades quickly.
"Had this beer on tap at Russian River Brewery the day after it was kegged. Perhaps the best IPA ever made (though I haven't had PTY yet). Hops were so fresh it was like eating them. This is a must-have if you're fortunate enough to be in the greater Santa Rosa area. Poured a golden yellow, great mouthfeel (like you'd want to keep it in there forever, and skip breathing)."
What a fabulous DIPA. The Pliny The Elder pours a light golden orange with a small soft off white head. The lacing that is left behind once that head resides is very nice leaving behind fine bubbles like you just washed your glass with soap. The hop aroma hits you before you even bring the glass to your nose. Citrus and pine come through so wonderfully. The taste is what you would expect from the aroma and it being a DIPA. Lots of great bite from the hops with a slight sweetness to wash it all away. It is light with a ton of complex flavors... just makes you smile. This is the nectar of the gods. I could drink this all night and still want more.
500ml bottle (3/23/09) poured into pint glass 5/5/09
Very seductive DIPA. Pours a peachy amber to golden color with white head that starts thick and dissipates to a thin layer that lasts well. Lace is present.
500ml bottle of Pliney the Elder from a local liquor store that has a decent selection of craft brews (Farr Better Spirits). Poured it into a typical pint at room temp.
Poured from a 500mL bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. Opened and consumed 10 days after it was bottled.
The bottle I am reviewing I got in a trade with bkrefetz...thanks Brett you made my day!
"A - Poured out a somewhat cloudy, orange color with golden highlights. It had a small, thick, foamy head that left soapy trails of lace."
Received this in trade from jadamski1 (thanks josh)
"Unimpressed by Blind Pig on tap I gave it a chance from the bottle. It failed but I thought I'd do the same for the Elder. Decent on tap but not overwhelming, I've found a sample bottled all of 7 days ago. Fresh is best they say, doesn't get much fresher."
"Requested this at the Co-Op in Moscow, Idaho and was very pleased when it came in due to its reputation. Was a little sad to see it priced at over $6. Whatever, picked 2 up and brought them home to find myself very happy with the beer."
Thanks to Jerk44 for this one.
Thanks to supermanjace for trading me this 500ML bottle with a bottled on date that is 3 weeks old. Umm fresh Pliny.
"A: Pours a clear, clean copper with a thin layer of foam on top. It fades quickly leaving slight rings of lace. "
"Appearance: Like Russian River's other IPA, Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder pours a bit lighter than one would expect of an IPA. This one is a slightly cloudy pale orange color with a very nice amount of lacing that coats the glass. There is not a severe amount of head, but enough to really help carry the aromas and open the beer up in the mouth. "
"A - Has a golden/orange hue with a strong off white head. There is a constant flow of carbonation bubbles flowing to the top. Film left on the glass follows the beer as it lowers, the head does dissipate after a while."
My 150th review:
A: Ive been fortunate to have had Plenty before and I would definetly have to say not as excited due to the last batch. This one had a light amber ale appearance. The previous one was a much lighter color close to yellow. Still all and all I thought it good representation. 
Bottled 04/07/09
500ml into a pint
Served from bottle. Bottled on 4/7/09 - drinking as I type.
"Poured from a bottle (bottled about a month ago, 03/23/09) into a large red wine glass."
Served in a snifter. It should be noted that the bottle was about 6 months old.
"I bought this bottle yesterday at SouthBay Drugs and Liquor. I first reviewed this beer from the tap during the Stone 11th Anniversary Event, back in the summer of 07. Just recently I noticed that I haven't reviewed this beer from the bottle and that tap review doesn't do this beer justice so now I'm reviewing this beer from the bottle. Bottled on: 040709...How is that for fresh!"
Not a 100% fresh bottle but I won't get to drink this again anytime soon so I'll review it anyway. It's about 3 months old. 
"Beer has a bottled on date of 030909. Poured into my Piraat tulip, the cloudy apple juice colored beer looks more like an unfiltered hefeweiss than an IPA. 3 cm head fades quickly but leaves some nice lacing. Nose is pure floral hops and it smells great, nothing else there that I can detect though. Taste is very smooth and perfectly balanced. Hops linger from the start to finish but are never over pronounced. Malt balances the beer throughout. Beer is light bodied and it's tough to detect the alcohol, hard to believe we're looking at 8% on this one. I feel like I could session this beer but I'm sure it would catch up to me quickly."
Russian River has clout in my eyes now.
"Bottle brewed 3/23/09. Pours a brilliant amber with frothy white head. Smell is wonderful sticky pine. Very strong smell. Taste is crisp and clean with a good amount of carbonation. It starts with a slight pepper that quickly fades to a bitter pine with some tangy grapefruit. It's the perfect hop balance, light on the peppery centenials or cascades and a hearty dose of floral varieties. There's a caramel plateau with a nice toffee crispness. The taste fades to a mellow hoppiness and leaves a very pleasent aftertaste that leaves your mouth begging for more! Extremely drinkable- an incredible IPA!!!!"
"Bottled 3/23/09. Poured into tulip glass cloudy gold with a thick white head. Very good lacing. Smell is very hoppy with good amount of floral hints. Taste isn't as hopped as I thought it would be. I've got to say I'm a little disappointed, but it's still a great taste. Mouthfeel is exceptional, alcohol content is absent which is great because it doesn't take away from the flavor the way most IIPA's do. Over all, this is a great brew, but just not the nock me off my seat great like I expected."
APPEARANCE: 
"Appearance: pours a hazy orange color with a 1"" head that lasts a bit before breaking into a surface foam. Spotty lacing develops."
A - orange honey with a foamy head that keeps to a ring afloat the beer nice lacing
Poured from a bottle into a tulip. Consumed at a tasting with a handful of fellow BA's. Review is from tasting notes.
Do my eyes deceive me? Is it true? Do I really have a bottle of Pliny in my house? 
"Brash clear golden orange. Nice thick head dissapates to a nice firm sheet of lace. Rings of stickage all the way down. Immense aroma of sappy pine needles, grapefruit, papaya, and faint sweet malts hiding in the background. Entry is much like the nose, with strong oily pine and citrus hops coating the tongue in a most pleasing manner, sticky to a degeree. Malts although present, playing a meek second fiddle. Finish is semisweet malt with orange marmalade and grapefruit fade. I would like to drink this for the remainder of the afternoon into evening, but you just can't. With the some of all it's parts, one would think this would be cloying or over the top after a while, but it's not. The alcohol is extremely well integrated here, to the point where trouble could and would come very easily if one hasn't planned out a safe way home already. Beleve the hype on this puppy. Fantastic stuff. Hate to see this last bottle go."
"I've been hanging onto this bottle of Pliny since late February, so I figured I'd better drink it before it gets any less fresh. I've had it fresher before, and I'm sorry I didn't just drink it the day I got it, but it ended up being awesome anyway. I poured it into a pint glass, and it was very bubbly and a bright kind of yellow/orange. It had a pretty one inch head, and it kind of sparkles when it's sitting there. Really a nice looking beer."
Bottled on 030909. Poured from a 500ml bottle into a Pilsner Glass. 
"Pours a beautiful golden orange, with a fully bubbbly head, and small bubbles that move slowly up the glass, often overtaken by racing bubbles that seem to surround everything. The lacing is good, not overly sugary, but still shows where you've pulled."
"16.9 oz. bottle into a Brooklyn tulip. Bottled 03.03.09, so it's still pretty fresh. "
I've been looking forward to drinking this beer for a long time. Thanks to raoulduke37 for hooking me up with this and so many other great brews!
Thank you to Ktown67 for bringing me this bottle during an in person trade from Wisconsin! Most generous guy I've yet to meet off of BA. I didn't even ask for this he just brought it.
"Bottled on 3/23, consumed on 4/12."
I have nothing to add that hasn't already been said in other reviews; I can only uphold the numerical reviews. Amazing.
Poured from a bottle (2/29/09) into my Duvel Tulip. Color is dark orange/gold with a very big and fluffy off-white head. Smell is outrageously awesome...pine/citrus/grapefruit all over the place...holy cow. I just want to live in it (you'll know what I'm talking about if you've seen Pineapple Express)! Taste is wonderful! So well-balanced and not overly bitter like other huge hoppy beers. Perfect amount of carbonation and so smooth it glides around in your mouth. This is a VERY drinkable beer and I could drink this beer all the time although I savor these because of my location. What an amazing beer!
Huge thanks to tzanio for sending me out 3 bottles of this splendid beer! This was the very same tzanio that hooked me up with a growler of the Younger a couple months back. Great trader!!
"This review is long overdue - had this beer on-tap, bottled, etc. numerous times, but this is my first try out of a growler, and hot damn it makes me glad I live in CA. What a beer."
this was my 1st pliny 
"Thanks to nanoslug for sending me numerous bottles of Pliny of the past six months. This one was bottled February 24th, '09. Served in my Kuhnhenn tulip."
500ml bottle into a large snifter.
500ml bottle traded in person from mba3243. thanks again! bottled 3/9/09. very nice. into an over sized snifter.
Poured out of a bottle with a medium white head. It has a somewhat cloudy orange appearance. 
Finally had a chance to try the Pliny and it didn't disappoint.
From a bottle purchased at Lone Hill Liquors:
"For starters, bottled on 2/3/2009"
Poured a sunshine yellow with nice sticky lacing and a pillowy head.
At many times but first time with notes.
Bottle dated 2/24/09 thanks to a trade from Docer. Poured into pint glass. 
"Bottle into Sam Adams Lager glass. Bottled 3/23/09, Drank 4/3/09. 12 days old is fresh in my book - Huge thanks to henry (Bankhead) for landing this one in Brooklyn."
"500ml bottle, dated 3-9-09"
Had one of these last night that was brought back from CA by a friend.
"500ml bottle, 1/23/09 bottling date (just before my birthday, kind of cool). "
"Poured a liquid goldenrod color. Decent head retention that laced down the glass for the entire experience. Smells of grapefruit, pine, and peach. Tastes just as good as it smells. Mouthfeel is excellent, perfect amount of carbonation. Drinkability is through the roof."
"On tap at O'Briens (San Diego, CA) on 3/20/09. Part of a full day of Russian River beers here. Served in a pint glass. "
"Appearance - Light gold color with a chalk white head that bubbles up similar to dish soap. Bubbles do lay down to rest on top for quite some time to give it a nice crown. Very soft looking, as it's very very clear and easy to see through. Almost looks a little too light, like it might be laking in body and a bit in flavor. I hope not."
I've had this a few times but I'm drinking the one davod23 sent me so I'll credit him with the shoutout and thank you!
"Finally got my hands on a few bottles of this. I've heard the hype for so long, and it didn't disappoint."
"On tap at Capone's. Pours orange with no real head. Aroma of citrus, grapefruit, and hops oils (similar to Younger). Flavor lacks the grassy hops I got in the bottled version. More malty and not as fruity as I remember (although more citrus comes out as the beer warms). Nice hop oils. Quite tasty, probably a tie between the tap version and super fresh bottled version. Ironically, the fresher this is, the more malt I get from it, not sure why. Obviously, still a delight."
Had to try this one as I found a few bottles for sale in Napa Calif and had read the reviews.
500mL bottle from a great trader Dajtai007!
On tap at Capone's on 3/29/09. Served in a shaker pint.
"Poured from 500ml bottle into new belgium tulip. Bottled on March 9, 2009 - reviewed 20 days later. Huge thanks to my friend Scott for lugging this back from California. "
Bought at Beverage Warehouse in Los Angeles.
Scored a bottle from Malt and Vine there in Redmond. Great bottle shop by the way.
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into my Lazy Magnolia glass (no snifter for this one, I'm becoming more of a fan of ""back to basics"" beer drinking, and that mentality dictates a pint glass for an IPA, double or not)."
"This poured a hazy gold with a bit of off-white head. I'm surprised it wasn't darker or have any more head. It smelled more subdued than expected, like apricot and mango, with some lemon and honey. It tasted very tropical and sweet, but also very cleanly bitter. Main flavors were apricot, mango, and pineapple, supported by some resin (not really pine) and plenty of honey malt for very balanced flavor. A bit of alcohol was noticeable. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean and surprisingly sweet and balanced beer. Fantastic flavors with the different hops and malt playing perfectly together. Only a touch of alcohol taste made this very easy to drink. Could this have been better? Maybe a bit stronger scent and slightly fuller body. But those aren't really complaints, as this was a delight to drink."
A--Beautiful crystal clear golden color. Head was fluffy white that never completely went away. Left a very thick lacing down the glass
A: Light orange color. Hazy and almost a dark yellowish hue if held up directly to the light. Very little carbonation or head. 
"A: Dark peach color, cloudy. Clumpy crème-colored head."
"I approached this review with a little trepidation as the bottles I managed to score where 4 months old. It's my understanding that PtE is a lot like a more familar beer to me, HopSlam, in that it ages quickly and loses that luster. Still, I wanted something special for review 50, so I pushed on regardless. I should not have been all that worried, it lived up to the hype, maybe being stored in a cold beer cave at the store I got it at helped."
Had on tap while winery hopping in the Russian River Valley. Had at Korbel of all places:
"Ok, yeah it's that good. Had literally countless pints on draught at Falling Rock in Denver as an introduction and then plenty in bottles from various stores. Brought some back and just cracked 'em last night with friends so I am reviewing the bottled version. A sharp looking beer. Super crisp and clear and light orange amber with a head that just don't quit. This beer has all aspects of hoppyness covered. Fruity, yes. Lots of citrus zest, orange, lime, and big plump pineapple juicyness. But the main flavor is pungent pine, bitter all the way through. Totally numbs my entire mouth, makes me all tingly, I like. Lingering long after the swallow too. You could take a sip of this beer and probably still taste it a minute later. I like that this IPA isn't just full of fruity hops like a lot of beers from the west coast, which can be nice, but it has that wrenching bitterness to it that really completes the bold character of the beer. Dry, yet quenching. Somehow crispy on the palate but plenty of body and just a pure pleasure to drink. I hiked a mountain in Colorado with a coupe of these in the back-pack and drank them at the top with me Lady, right outta the bottle too. That was nice."
"Man, I love this beer. "
"serving: 500ml bottle, received from a trade, thanks Jesse."
Thanks to jason for this great california beer.
"A - Pours a nice amber color, with a light frothy head, about a finger thick. Good retention, and I wouldn't say it looks like ""lacing"", but it does stick to the side of the glass."
Big thanks to sirpsycho for this. I just got this today in a trade. I'm so excited to finally try this beer. This was bottled on 7/30/08 so I'm sure that some of the hop presence has faded some so I'll try to take that into consideration.
"On tap 3/19 @ Toranado. Pours cloudy amber with a a minimal white head. Medium stong aroma of pine, grapefruit, and caramelized malts. Very well balanced. Fast is similar. Extraordinarlly well balanced. One of the smoothest DIPA's I've ever had. Extremely drinkable. Medium mouthfeel with relatively low carbonation. Bitter finish with some cereal grain. Pretty f'n delicious!"
"A - Gold in color. Fine, white, foamy head. Dimples of air open in the head like you see in a pancake that is being cooked. Head leaves way to gorgeous lace left on the glass. Head retention is ridiculous. As you look at the glass and agitate, you can see minuscule specks that float like sand would through the middle of a wave in the ocean."
"I have been looking forward to finally writing my review of Pliny the Elder for some time. It is one of my favorite beers... I think it would be safe to say that if I was ""stranded on a desert island and could only have one beer with me for the rest of my days..."" it would probably be the Elder. Now on to the review..."
"I originally tried this beer in October 08 at the grand re-opening of Bella Vista in Philly, but held off on reviewing it because i feared my tastes were shot after a day of amazing beer. I finally got a chance to try it again during Philly beer week at Local 44."
"A. A beautiful honey colored nectar with copper tones and gold subtlties. Clear as a bell with oily/sticky head of 1/8"". A nice looking beer to say the least. "
Thanks to Torchednoodle for the trade
"Was able to do a vertical with the Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder, and Pliny the Younger. Yay!"
"I just had this in Philly, it was a rather long drive just to try some beers, but was worth the effort."
"aforbes10 sent me a bottle of Pliny the Elder from California to Georgia via FedEx Ground. It arrived on a Thursday, and was promptly put in the fridge. Then I stabbed him in the back and flew to Denver that night and was having Pliny on tap at Falling Rock Tap House by 2PM the next day. Sorry aforbes10. Luckily he send me a home-brewed saison too."
"By far my favorite IPA so far. Pours a golden yellow color with a 1 1/2 finger white head, good amounts of lacing on the glass. Smells very citrusy, I even got a whiff of bannana's on the first one I drank. Taste like of grapefruit but not sour, just the sweetness of it. Thin to med bodied. This is the perfect IPA. Very drinkable. I could get into trouble with this one."
Finished of my Cali trip with a sweet bottle of Pliny the Elder. I've had enough hops this past week to last me quite a while.
WOW..
Got a chance to visit the brewery and enjoy this beer on tap. It proved to be quite different than my previously reviewed experience with the bottled version. Below I've made some notes about the bottled version in parentheses for comparison.
Poured from a bottle into my Westvleteren glass.
16.9 oz bottle
I was expecting to be wowed with this...
On-tap at The South Philly Tap Room
A- Pours a light hazed golden orange in color with a multi textured off white head. There are lots of small bubbles in the middle of the head with a great silky foam in a thick ring around the edges. The head retention was okay and it had minimal lacing. 
"I was very excited when the Belmont Station got ahold of some Russian River Bottles. Double IPAs are my favorite style, so getting my hands on what many consider one of the best has been on my mind for a while."
Pours deep copper color with huge bubly white head. Very good retention.
Appearance: Pours a great golden orange color with a cloud like head about three quarters of an inch thick. Some very nice lacing going on as well.
"This is a post cold update. One of the two best hop fixes one can get, IMHO."
Acquired from Dakotah13 on a Hopslam trade
Served in a 10 oz. pilsner glass
this pliny.. bottled on 012309... drink it fresh as it says on the label... it pours a medium orange color with a white head and good lacing... then wow what a smell it fills the room and the palete with outstanding aromas its fresh pine first then citrus grass and floral aromas... maybe juniper its fantastic.. the taste is better then the smell its all fresh pines first then light floral citrus hops with perfect malt support the mouthfeel is the same as the smell and the taste i dont need to repeat.. this is a perfect DIPA because it has superior balance betwen hops and malt alcohol and water.. ive never had a perfect DIPA but this is.... it fiils the mouth and nose.... it is perfection ..you just want another sip.. this is world class ..its nirvana for a DIPA. im going to buy more of this one
"I've dreamed of getting my hands on this beer for so long, now I finally have it. My buddy Mike made a trip to San Diego and brought back 5 bottles of Pliny. When he went to the liquor store he brought up 2, one for me and one for him. The guy at the counter said ""have you had this before."" Mike replied ""no, is it good?"" The gentleman countered, ""Dude, this is the best f#$%ing thing you will ever have."" On that note, here is my review for the Pliny the Elder. "
"500 ml bottle, bottled 8/25/08. Thanks to deliriumfest for this one. Poured into my Chimay goblet."
500ml 1/23/9 RR style bottle with green label and red circle with PTE written in the middle.
"Thanks to raoulduke37 in Ventura, California for this brew. This is my first Russian River brew. For us East-Coasters, Russian River and the Plinys are a mystical thing. They'll probably never be distributed over here so we have to rely on you folks in the Pacific Time Zone to get them to us, bottle by bottle."
"On tap or in a bottle, hands down there is no better DIPA. I travel the west in such a beer that can beat won of Vinnies masterpeices. Keep on pleasing the masses. "
"Poured from bottle into trusty pint glass while watching the season finale of my favorite show (Dexter if you're interested). What a great moment! Pours crystal clear and golden, fitting for such a famous beer. Creamy, two-finger, white head with great retention and lacing. Smell is great. A nice blend of hops. Some citrus/grapefruit but not overpowering, like some other west coast IPA's. A strong floral presence as well, some sweet malt too. Taste is boderline perfect. At first the hops seem somewhat mellow and controlled, but it hits you with a strong, bitter aftertaste that you dont want to go away. Detected both some piney and citrus hops and well as a distinct, but not overpowering, sweetness as it warms. Mouthfeel was medium, but still somewhat light. Very smooth and silky. Overall this is a great, well balanced beer. I guess I never noticed, until I did this review, that it is a Double IPA. The mastery of the balance is amazing and it does not come off as a Double and the ABV is undetectable. A truely great beer."
Thanks to Gilgarp for the chance to try this BA legend. Bottled on 1-23-09. Poured into my trusty DFH snifter. I dont ever remember cracking a beer and it immediately filling the room with the aroma of hops before.
"Finally got my hands on some of this. After trying to trade, trying to get ""friends"" in CA to buy some and ship it, fellow BA bought some online and brought it over for beer night. Thanks Roop40!"
Thanks to fellow BAer timmush for this one. 
"Picked this up at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA. "
After hearing so much about this beer from this site I was really excited to see it on the shelf of the local specialty beer store. I grabbed a 500 mL bottle and poured it into a glass. It pours a deep golden color with a very slightly orange hue. It has a white foamy head a lil more than a finger thick and although most of it disapates rather quickly some of it remained to the very end.
Big thanks to mashmaster for this one!
Since this isn't distributed in OH I bought this from an online retailer.
"Rather average looking hazy peach color with a smaller head than I was expecting (even after a hard pour), however there was good lacing left behind."
"On vacation in Colorado I just about crapped my pants when I saw this on the shelf at the beer store. I knew I was going to get to try some beers I can't get back in Michigan while I was out here, however I did not expect Pliny to be one of them. "
This beer is a hard to come by currently in the Northeast. I had the luxury of my brother doing a 5 week stint at the brewery as part of completing the American Brewers Guild. He came back on Xmas day and there was a bottle of PTE under the tree for me.
"Got 3 bottles from thewinecountry.com, tried 'em over the last couple weeks. Poured into a pint a hazy but brite golden orange with an average head and sticky lace. A faint nose of citrus and pine. First taste is of pine and spice but it's backbone is citrus and some floral aspects. There is just enough sweetness & breadiness to balance the hops. I was afraid any review of this beer would be based on the reviews past, I tried to review only on it's own merits. This is an extremely good DIPA, with more balance than is usually seen in this type. It hewed to a leaner style than I generally prefer, but pulls it off quite well. Satisfyingly thick on the tongue, this is an easily drinkable big beer."
"Ah, the famed Pliny the Elder. Bottled on 1-23-09.Thanks to an amazing trader (bring) for the bottle. 500ml bottle poured into a huge Riedel wine glass and a Sam Adams Boston lager glass--for full analysis. "
MASPuros proved to be amazing for this beauty of a beer. I could not be happier to get to try this. Hopefully it lives up to my expectations.
Bottle courtesy of antilogic (thanks again!).
A: Poured a hazy orange with a small white head
"A weak yellow color with a fair white head and good lacing. The aroma is a very solid grapefruit citrus hops with sweet lemon grass. The flavor is a beautiful bittersweet grapefruit malt blend. I occasionally think of piney hops here too. One of the better IPA's I've had! Very dangerously drinkable. There is an earthy potatoe-like underlining. A perfect feel for the style, smooth and just a hair resinous. Very, very nice."
"Oh man, been waiting to get my hands on one of these. If this little hop monster is as good as everyone claims, than my night is going to get a lot better"
500 ml bottle purchased at Ledger's poured into a Guinness pint glass. Bottle is dated 1/5/09. Comes in at 8%.
500mL bottle poured into a stemless large red wine glass
"Memorable Quality: The time I had on tap super fresh it was one of the best beers I have ever had. Super dry finish, mouthwatering boquet of hops in the nose, perfectly creamy mouthfeel. I never wanted to stop drinking it, the bottles are a half step below this."
In a snifter:
500 mL bottle poured into a mug.
"Appearance- Pours a bright white sudsy head with nicer retention and sheets of sticky white brussels lace, beer us a clear golden orange. "
This is a very drinkable DIPA.
"This is one review that is long overdue. The Elder was among my first memorable IIPAs, and the one I've returned to most frequently. This review will be from a bottled example, as I imagine that is how many BAs will get to experience it. I'll follow with an on-draft review next time I encounter it."
"Reviewed on 02/19/09, bottled 01/05/09"
"Talk about a god damn hop bomb!!! This sucker kicks you right in the teeth, winks at you then ask's you what's good? Finally I get my hands on Pliny."
PLINEY THE ELDER IS A HOPHEAD DREAM. THE RIPE PINE AROMA RISES OUT OF THE BEER AS SOON AS IT OPENED. IT HAS A LIGHT FRUITINESS FOLLOWED BY A SHARP CITRIC ACID BITE IS AWESOME. THE FINISH STAYS WITH YOU. IN ALL I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BEER WORTHY OF THE TOP TEN. THE ONLY WAY IT COULD GET BETTER IS BE EASIER TO GET.
For a beer that tastes so Hoppy it has a very light golden yellow tint to it. The head and lace start to go away pretty quickly.
"Found this in Seattle, 500ml bottle for 4.99. Had to get it just because these are hard to find in Colorado where I live."
I have had a lot of very good beers the past few days and I feel like I am writing a lot of positive reviews. But even with all of these great beers and great reviews this beer may be my favorite of all time. 
Thanks heaps to Joecast for this bottle.
"Thanks to mhewes for sending this in trade this week. Have been very excited to get my hands on this. Pours a light golden color with with a solid 1"" frothy white head. Leaves nice lacing on the pint as the head recedes. Maybe it is the DIPAs I have had, but this one looks lighter than most. A far more earthy/pine aroma to the hops, versus the citrusy hops that many IPAs have. The taste is exceptional, a strong hops punch, but surprisingly balanced. There is an interesting sweet taste, faintly, in the background that adds to aids in that balance. The ABV is well hidden, as this goes down smooth and easy. Definitely deserving of the hype, I only wish I could stock my fridge with them, as a self proclaimed hop head."
"The initial aroma is incredibly piny, like a deep, fresh breathe of forest. Upon swirling the glass and opening it up, slight aromas of creamy vanilla come through, with a big head that forms but diminishes rapidly upon settling. Tastes of bold hops, slightly bitter but very smooth. Pine all the way through. Complements the Mediterranean-style lamb dish I am having very well. "
Poured into a pint glass and came up with a nice half inch head. Produced a cloudy gold color. Good lacing left on my glass.
"Grabbed this one after trying the Younger. It was a pretty good night, I have to say. "
Got this beaut in a trade from davexisxrabid. Thanks dave. been waiting a long time for my first rr. bottled 11/26/08.
"realized I hadn't jotted down a review yet, so here' goes..."
"Beer received in a recent trade with Olibeer22, opened the day I received it (couldn't wait). The bottle is exactly 1 month old. "
"Yes, this is a good beer. Yes, you should try it. If you like hoppy beers, you will almost certainly enjoy it. Very nice."
I have had this beer a few times now on tap and in the bottle but this time I am reviewing the bottle.
Holly Hops!!!
Reviewed from notes taken in Los Angeles:
Thanks to pwoods for the opportunity to try this beer
Bottle date is 11.26.08
Thanks to my fellow BA speakorspasm for hooking me up with this beer via convincing our fellow co-worker Alice who was in CA to pick up some bottles.
Had it on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philly
"Pours a bright golden hue with a two-finger creamy white head and a steady stream of carbonation. The head fades slowly to a thin cap, leaving some sparse, but thick lacing."
Poured into a Duvel chalice. Seemed fitting.
This beer had a lot of self-inflicted hype from myself. Well it lives up to it. It's a hopheads dream. 
"Been hearin' about this brew and finally got a taste and was very pleased. Rolled over to Toronado in San Diego and was excited to see this on draft. It definitely lived up to the hype. A beautiful golden brew with a nice white head. Citrus and floral scents up the nose and a filled and coasted the mouth as smooth as it can get. A gentle, nice pine flavor accompanied every sip and I turned to my bro and said, ""this could be one of the best beers I have had in a year"". It might of been that I was achin' for a beer Saturday afternoon, but I believe that Pliny is an exceptional Double IPA without the harsh alcohol flavor and it was so tasty and I NEED MORE!"
Thanks must go to Med who managed to not drink the growler himself and bring it by for me to have some.
Review number 150: I wanted something special for this one. Ordered from Southbay Drugs in San Diego and picked it up from Fedex today.
500 mL bottle tried 8 Oct 2008. Bottled on 13 Aug 2008.
"Bottled 12/30/08, consumed 1/30/09."
"Had this beer on tapa few months ago at the swinging arm in black diamond only because it was highly recommended from another patron, I was enjoying delerium tremmens at the time."
"Cask at O'Briens's SD, it didn't last long. 30 minutes or so. Cask Conditioned Pliny Elder, a very rare treat. Great nose, even better texture and an explosive mid. Maybe less on the pine, but the main difference is the mid palate. Though it was huge and dominating. Maybe a bit more amber? and I thought a tad more sweet though others didn't. Really excited to try and felt it was different and maybe a tad better than regular kegs. Some felt recent bottles are the best Pliny Elders because the freshness. Would not pass up on another opportunity to try a cask of Pliny."
Since recently discovering my liking to IPA's and DIPA's I was really looking forward to trying this. Here is my take.
I was attracted to this world of craft beers by IPA/DIPAs but I have never had anything like Pliny the Elder. I had a blind pig the night before and really enjoyed it and never imagined this would be so much better.
A - clean light yellow/orang with a strong off white head
Thanks to BrewerB for the amazing beer trade. This is one fine individual.
a: Golden orange hazy.. Nice 2 finger head.. Good lacing..
"Reviewed this awhile ago on tap, just had it out of the bottle recently. "
"Avon Liquors in Avon, CO had a great selection of beers including two from Russian River (Blind Pig was the other.) I was pleasantly surprised to find these there. "
"pours a rich, inviting cloudy copper orange with lacy white head"
I hunted down this beer a few times this past Fall when it finally came to Philly. I thank this website plus its users for all the inside scoops!
A - Medium amber. Some carbonation. An attractive beer.
"A: Pours a translucent golden yellow with single finger, ginger-colored, tight creamy and bubbly off-white head. Nice sticky lacing all over the glass. "
"A - Pours 2 fingers of creamy white head. It's retention is good and leaves some nice some spider lacing and thick ring when it settles. The beer is a slightly hazy, dark, golden-orange."
Revisited this one thanks to the bottle thethrone sent me. This bottle is much better than the growler I received. Clear hazy copper body some small sediment floating in it. Big white head much lace ensues after it goes 
Many thanks to JWD for this bottle.
"ahh, my first Pliny! Enormous thanks to djeucalyptus for hooking me up! Ever since I joined the site, I've been dying to try this. I just knew I would love this, and I was...right!"
Had this many times and finally getting around to reviewing this gem. 15oz pour into a stemmed glass at Union Jacks Pub. 
"Exceptional beer. Very citrus hoppy aroma. Citrus piny hop flavor with a well ballanced malt sweetness. After hearing afterl the hype, the flavor caught me off guard on the first sip. Way more low cohum. hops. Not a strong bitter after bite. As the sipping went on, the last swallow begged for more. Absolutely exceptional."
A- Very clear orange color with minimal head. Lacing is very splotchy on the sides of my tulip. 
Head retention could be much better.
"Appearance is very clear, not cloudy at all. I'd say its a pale copper color, nice layer of white head when I poured the half liter bottle in to my half liter Mousel Luxembourg beer stein."
Bottled 11/4/08. Purchased online from South Bay Drugs.
"I had this on-tap at Gullifty's Restaurant in Rosemont, PA and it came in a Tulip glass."
"a - light amber, a little on the golden side"
My wife brought 10 bottles of this back to DC from Colorado while she was there. They were waiting for me when I got back from the Middle East. :)
"this is an incredible beer which i've had a few times before, but never had the chance to review."
"I made a special trip down to Brooklyn to try this legendary beer. As of 1/17, they have this (and Blind Pig) available at Pacific Standard, which is a good bar. "
"I've had Pliny dozens of time, but this is my first chance to sit down and review it. Bottle dated 11/26/08."
"Cool simple-looking label with warnings against aging and a bottled-on date of 7/30/08. So, this is getting a little old at 5.5 months, but I enjoyed it nonetheless, and I only bought it a few weeks ago. I will look for a younger bottle next time."
Served cool from a pint bottle at about 36F into a Boston Lager glass.
Believe the Hype. Had the privilege of consuming this brew on a few occasions- most recently thanks to the generosity of great traders like MiScusi and swnicholson. 
From a 0.5L bottle purchased at Hi Times Cellars in Costa Mesa. 
Thank you skourtis for the opportunity to try this!
Bottle: Poured a deep orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of medium bitter hops notes with some well crafted citrus notes also dominating. I thought the taste of malt was somewhat subtle and overshadowed by some citrusy and bitter hops. Full body with great carbonation. Although this is a very well crafted IIPA is still think it is lacking some of the grapefruit notes that can elevated the style to another level.
16.9oz poured into my unmarked 16oz pint class. Bottle design is very mellow and straight forward with plenty of history as well as warnings not to age Pliny.
"Bottle received from mwompus from Secret Santa '08, bottled on 10/15/08"
"Got a bottle of this courtesy of CPFerris.. Thanks Chad, you're awesome!"
A hazy light gold liquid that delivers a good head with nice retention. Better is the abundant lacing. Goes all the way down. Mild carbonation keeps the glass covered in light sea foam.
"Bottled on 090208. Yellow to light orange. Soft soap bubble white head. The aroma is and flavor are full of pine and citrusy goodness, but to be honest, I feel Blind Pig really have a better aroma and more hop flavor. This was very easy to drink and pretty enjoyable, but I'd never think of it as Imperial or Double. I guess that is a good thing. If I were to compare this to Dreadnaught, it would lose badly."
"review taken from notes, bottled on 9/22/08 and drank in earley november. poured into my duvel tulip glass, poured a light golden yellow with a slight wite head. the smell was flowers and lawn clipings. the first sip put me off a bit as it was pungent bitter with no body to it, after a few sips i changed my toon. the bitter tastes VERRY piney all the way through, with hints of yard trimings, flowers a tuch of bread then my tastebuds had to surender as the bitter aftertaste holds them hostage. this is the first beer that i hated at first sip but was craving more by the end, russian river has a master pice on ther hands"
"This is just one hell of an epic beer. The head wasn't too great, but plenty of lacing, good carbonation, and pale amber in color. The smell. My god. Best smelling beer I have had the pleasure of smelling, like a beautiful bouquet of fresh flowers with some pine and citrus notes. The taste was exceptional. Whatever hops they used, its just perfect and we'll leave it at that. Awesome mouthfeel, and the finish is a lovely bitterness that lingers in your lymph nodes that makes you just want more, and more, and more. Drinkability is outstanding; for 8%, the alcohol is WELL hidden, I could drink this all night every night. I may be fluffing this beer a bit much, but it is my absolute favorite beer as of now, and im just glad that Russian River decided to start distributing in CO. I might have to order a case because its so hard to find and in such high demand. Simply Outstanding."
A: Hazy deep gold with mild carbonation from tiny bubbles. Puffy cream head has good retention and leaves substantial lace.
500 mL of Pliny in bottle form from The Wine Country in Signal Hill. Bottled 11/26/08.
Friend bought at the source
500 ML bottle into a tulip; freshness date of 11-10-08
"Thanks to Bring for throwing this one in our big boxes of trade. Have heard so much about this beer, and I was really excited to finally get to try it. "
got this today and decided for some odd reason not to age it in the cellar.. hmmm
Pliny the Elder is a refreshingly hoppy beer that doesn't disappoint when it comes to a bitter nose and relatively smooth finish. This beer is a Russian River favorite and always aims to please. Named after the supposed discoverer of hops this beer would do Pliny proud.
"My first review of 2009! After suffering through a post-Christmas cold, I decided to start the year off the best way I could think of and finally enjoy the beer that has been calling to me from my fridge ever since I received it in a BIF last fall. I'm not feeling quite 100% yet, but I'm awfully close, and I'd hate to let this sit any longer. Reading the label I feel guilty holding on to it as long as I have already!"
"The beer is poured with a good fluffy one inch head with a orangish copper colour. Great retention and lacing. Looks great, but could be slightly darker. The nose has a huge hoppy aroma. Some citrus hints, but it primarily dominated by piny/resiny hops, and a little bit of caramel sweetness comes through at the end. This should be a cologne. The beer is incredibly bitter, which is to be expected. The hop flavour is definitely quite grassy/piny/resiny. The beer has a lot of flavours that are hard to put my finger on, but once you've had a few sips the bitterness goes away and the caramel malts comes through. The mouthfeel is good, fair amount of carbonation and slightly creamy. The beer is fairly drinkable."
Got this one from South Bay Drugs. What can I add to a description of a top 10 beer ? Pours a cloudy dark gold color with a nice size white head and clumps of lacing. Head retention is pretty good.
"You know, it's really hard to come in and review a beer like this that has received so much universal praise, and feel like you have anything new to contribute. The truth is, I really don't. So let me just say this:"
appearance- poured a hazed amber with a thick white head. good sticky lace 
"I poured from a 500 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The aroma was noticed before the appearance. Intense pine notes are released when the bottle is opened. After I poured the first bottle, my brother in law could smell the pine 10 feet away. The beer pours a deep yellow, when held up to a light it is very clear. The head is impressive and leaves a respectable amount of lacing. The taste follows the nose. The pine flavors are up front and intense. The aftertaste lingers well after the beer is sipped. The beer is a medium bodied sipper. An excellent brew! The finest DIPA I have had the pleasure of drinking."
"This is a beer with a unique flavor. Its high rating is well deserved. Pliny is a beer one could pleasantly get loaded on. Don't get me wrong its not a hot summer beer but one that is extremely enjoyable and makes you want to have more. An excellent story is presented on the label, which adds mystique."
The aroma is exquisite with lots of citrus and pine hops (cascade). There is also a fair amount of sweet malt. The appearance is pale gold with a light haze. The flavor is like the aroma and quite bitter but without much alcohol punch. The palate is a bit thin and not as carbonated as I would have liked. Overall a GREAT example of a double IPA!
Scored this thanks to the kind brother of a fellow BA and consumed it on Christmas day. 500 ml bottle poured into a tumbler.
Appearance: Pours a beautiful straw-golden yellow with a nice head and great lacing. A tad more hazy than the younger
Bottled on 11-10-08 
"Massive grapefruit taste throughout the entire beer. Loving grapefruit, this is an awesome beer with a so-so label. I had passed by this beer a number of times because of the non-descript label. My mistake."
"Pour is a shiny golden shade and the bouquet and mouthfeel are both heavily imbued with pine needles. This is about as good looking, smelling and tasting as a beer can get, and I'm happy we finally got distribution of this and Blind Pig up here, hopefully we'll get more of their brews soon!"
I finally had the chance to have a glass of this beer last night at a cool little bar called Toronado. 
"Bottle thanks to Secret Santa.Pours a clear, shining golden orange color with a foamy white head leaving soapy, spotty lacing behind. The aroma simply explodes from the glass with striking notes of juicy, fresh-picked oranges, grapefruits, and lemons. A lightly sweet, pale malt background sets the perfect background for the massive hop profile to do .The flavor is deliciously juicy, with bitter, resinous citrus and lemongrass hops,lightly toasted toffee and caramel malts,with a hint of honey. There's nothing overly complex going on, but it is so well blended it is incredible. Medium-full, smooth, slightly sticky body. This is so incredibly drinkable. A delicious IIPA that ranks right up there with the best of them. Thank you to the beer gods for giving me the chance to try this."
This is my first review of any beer on the internet but felt compelled to write one after drinking this! I recieved one on Christmas morning from my grandma of all people. Having not heard of it yet I was somewhat reluctent to try.
"Pours an orangey amber colour with a thin, pockled off-white head. Not much carbonation, bit of a lacing cradle but slides quite steadily down the glass. A bit dull and lifeless-looking, really. Disappointing."
could not wait to finally try this brew. 
"Everybody wants to talk about hype. But open a bottle of this within a few miles of the conversations, and it's like...you were saying?"
Thanks to 011x0110 for this wonderful beer via SS08.
"I stopped by Alison's Two, a newer place by my office and saw they had PtE on tap, wow. "
"This exquisite elixir honors the great philosopher who perished in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. From this tragedy comes this delicious brew from Russian River. Well ... there really isn't a direct connection, is there?"
"Pulled the 500ml bottle out of the fridge, let it warm up 15min, then poured the first glass."
"Had this on tap several time and bottle a few as well. Draft rating. Pour is cloudy orange with a big creamy head that disappears rather quickly, but leaves a bit behind. Nice lacing. Aroma is piney and citrus hops with malt sweetness. Flavor is hoppy, but not overwhelming. Like chewing fresh, wet hops...but with a good malt balance. Finishes very clean. One of my favorites."
"This beer pours a very cloudy amber with a light white head and a decent amount of lacing. The nose is of grapefruit, oranges and pine.... big hops :) The taste is very strong, especially the grapefruit hops flavor, and this beer does pocess a large malt base to be able counteract the massive ammount of hops. The mouthfeel is nice, a little undercarbonated in my opinion, but for such a huge DIPA the dry feeling afterwards is minimal. A very drinkable brew, I just wish I could get more of it :)"
"On tap at the Falling Rock. Pours hazy orangish with thick off white head that lasts and laces fairly strongly. Reeked of hops and citrus. Tastes like a hoppy dream explosion, full of citrus and pine notes. Noticed tastes in bottles is about the same, just a little less intense and definitely mellows in time (definitely a better beer fresh). One brew I'm glad makes it to Colorado."
"Wow, Happy Holidays to me. I got my hands on a bottle of Pliny the Elder this afternoon and decided today would be the day to review this exceptional brew."
A - Pours clear and light gold/orange with some nice lacing that sticks around for the entire ride.

"This, is, good, beer!"
Shipped back from Denver during my trip. Poured from a 500ml bottle (bottled on date on label) into a pint glass. It was a hazy golden yellow color with a ton of yeast floaters. Almost no carbonation but great lacing. It had a finger of white head that slowly settled into a foam and collar. 
"Had it on tap at Rosie & Joe's. Solid Imperial IPA. Pours a clear golden with a huge frothy white head that cannot be beaten back. Strong citrus aroma. First taste is massive hops, but then immediately dissipates. Finish is uncharacteristically dry. They compare it to Stone, so I will: this is a great Imperial IPA, but the Ruination has the edge."
"Poured into a glass and the smell of hoppiness was instant. The color is a light orange/tan when light passes through (I usually prefer a slightly darker color for a double-IPA). The taste is amazing, hops are perfectly balanced and the malts are very present despite its lighter color. Its hard to tell if there is a dominant hop flavor (citrus, pine, melon...), but overall the hoppiness is very pleasant. The alcohol is not noticeable on the palate but after awhile the stomach begins to warm up. The beer has a good amount of carbonation. The drinkability is high if you are a hop-head otherwise it may be difficult to drink. Overall, this beer was very enjoyable and it is as good or possibly better then the numerous hoppy beers that flood the San Diego market."
"When poured, the color was a medium light hazy golden yellow with some foam and a load of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of flavorful hops, hops and more hops filled the nose with a pleasant soft aroma, of hops. The taste of the hops was very noticeable from mouth to palate. Probably the Best IPA I've drank ever. Some others were close, but not lick this one. No big bite, or over bitterness or sour tasting. Just a soft pleasant taste of hops, with hints of some candied citrus."
"Had on tap at Beachwood BBQ. Pours a wonderful burnt orange. Smells of strong citrus, grapefruit and hoppy goodness. Tastes like it smells, but better. Nice oily finish that coats your mouth with flavor that lasts a while. The most drinkable double IPA I've had to date. "
I got extremely lucky that I found this; I love my beer geek friends and their ability to start a phone chain. Served on tap at Mad Mex in West Philadelphia.
"Pliny the Elder, an especially great honor for my 300th review."
Appearance: Pours golden with light cloudy sediment that clears quickly. White head recedes quickly into large bubbles floating on top of the golden sea. There actually was some lacing submerged in the liquid - never seen that before! I love how the head dances around as you swirl the beer in the cup.
1 of 2 bottles picked up in a badass trade with AndrewK.. HUGE Thanks!! Shared with Steven.. mine poured into my Chimay goblet. Bottled on 11/10/08... UberFresh!!
Pours a wonderful orangish-yellow with a thick head which is retained for quite some time. Pillowy off-white head which leaves foamy rings as the beer is enjoyed.
A - This one pours a darker color of gold with some orange highlights. The white head topped out at just under half inch and ends up a white / orange cap after a minute or two. Lacing remains very nice for the duration of the brew. 
"So... here we go with the Lafite Rothschild of the DIPA style (according the fanfare surrounding this beer). Purchased 2 bottles from Hi Time in OC. Both were bottled on 10/2/08 making each 64 days old when consumed. The bottles not only contain a freshness date but also encouragemnet to drink the beer before it turns: ""respect your elder: keep cold, drink fresh, do not age! Pliny the Elder is a historical figure, don't make the beer inside this bottle one!"" and so on... "
GLASS: Over-sized Wine Glass
"This is like a religious experience. It's one of those beers that you drink and you get thrown back in your chair in awe and say ""Holy shit!"" because you didn't know you could still be impressed this much by a beer. It only happens every-so-often, and it is no doubt what I equate into a ""leveling-up"" in your beer enlightenment...the way you just thought about beer just changed (hopefully again), and it hit you HARD! I live for moments like these with beer. "
Half liter bottle dated 2-25-08. 
I received bottles from 2 different trades w/ JamesCrames and Bbothen and was blown away. This is one of the few beers to truly live up to all of the hype. The appearence is a light golden yellow with a very nice thin lacing. The aroama hits you as soon as you open a bottle. Citrus hops can be smelled from a few feet away. The first sip is truly amazing. With so much hop aroama you would think the beer would be way to bitter. It is the total opposite. This beer is extremely balanced with just the right amount of bitterness. Overall I think this is one of the best beers I have ever had the chance to drink and would recommend it to anyone even people who wouldnt consider themselves hopheads.
It poured a light gold color with a slight tint of red. It was not the color of IPAs and other typically hoppy beers. The head was not especially thick and was characterized by big bubbles. Despite the thin head it was very active in the glass and it retained its head nicely. It had great lacing.
"I've had this many times, from a bottle, growler, and on tap."
"500 ml bottle from La Bodega in Riverside, CA., $5.99 a bottle (I think)."
3 servings now--3 different meals. Pliny: You nail it on the nose. I've been on a mission to taste as many IPA's as possible to find out what it is about you that everyone loves so much. Are you a good DIPA? sure
"pours a semi-clear golden yellow with a small off-white head, very nice lacing."
"I had this at a friends place, lets just say I was a little excited to try it. The nose on this beer was very sweet and hinted with hops and wheat notes. It is obvious both in taste and smell that hops are the main flavoring but there's a complexity to the hops that you don't find in many IPAs. The tast is very hoppy but mostly sweet and citrus flavors integrated. It has some bittering notes but just during the swallow, not at the end where IPAs usually get bitter. The mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing. Easily one of the best Double IPAs I've had, I highly recommend it."
"tryed this one because the menu promised it ""is easily the best double IPA in the world"""
drank on 11.28 at home with bro in law Jason. 
"This is it, my first review, and i picked a hell of a beer to start with..."
"Upon first pour, it unleashes an aroma of floral perfection, and may prove to be the last word on double IPAs."
"Drank at Falling Rock Tap House in Denver, poured into a 16oz tumbler..."
"Having heard all the raves for this beer, and never had tried it, I was expecting a let down, since it would be hard for this beer to live up to all the hype. To my pleasant surprise, it did."
"500ml bottle from Beverages 4 less in Santee. Pours copper with a big white sudsy head that has good retention and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is relatively strong with loads of citrus (mostly grapefruit and some orange) and a big dose of sweet cotton candy. The taste is more of the same with accent on the citrus, plus biter hops followed by cotton candy on the side and back of the tounge. The mouthfeel is medium malty with a crisp note and the carbonation is lively. The finish is long with biter-sweet hops. This is one of the great IPA's, I'm glad I can get it locally. I absolutely love this stuff, but Blind Pig is my go-to everyday IPA now that Sculpin is impossible to find. Rock on RR."
"Appearance - pours a clear, bright amber with two solid fingers of cream-colored head, after a bit the head dissipates to a whisper thin layer in the center and around the edge of the glass leaving inconsistent gobs down the side"
I finally got a chance to try this IIPA. The offering was a pint on tap. The beer was a nice golden color with a nice silky taste. It had nice hop aroma and a good bitter bite but not enough of a bite for my liking. It's a highly drnkable brew and obviously deserves the rating it has and a few more localities selling it.
"Enjoyed on-tap at Falling Rocks Taphouse Denver, CO."
"Finally, bottled Pliny! I've sucked back many of these at the fabled Toronado on the Haight, but cracked my first bottle of Pliny tonight. Nothing special to look at, but just wait until the citrusy aroma starts to waft over your nostrils. Pliny is piney, with a nice lingering bitterness. No way this is an 8% ABV! Nice, nice, nice..."
"Pours a brilliantly clear golden yellow with a thick fluffy white head, moderate head retention with fluffy lacing. This beer calls for you to drink it."
Color was good with a golden amber. Tried pouring an aggressive head but it wouldn't keep for long.
Okay so I had had this beer recommended to me many times....and I finally got some! Glad e I did!!!!
Finally....
"A- Dark gold, with a decent lacing. Slight bubbles rise to the surface with a nice mat of head covering the entire surface. "
Bottle courtasy of stubbone.
Appearance - pours a lightly churning straw yellow with some mild haze. A thin soapy head of white doesn't really amount to much but does leave some solid filmy walls of lace around most of the pint glass.
Got this in a trade with BgThang. Great brew.
This was tasted at Feces Fest '08 with Onslow and my girl Melani.
"born on 25SEP08, poured from a bottle into my Brooklyn Imperial pint glass"
"Thanks for the trade, MasterSki."
A: Lightly clouded gold color. Poured a 2 finger off-white head with good retention. Ample lacing. Lightly decanted.
Thanks to gford217 for the Nascar LIF and the trade!
Thanks to tprokop for sending this growler awhile back. Review and score taken from notes a couple months ago.
"Bottle generously shared by footbalm, thanks man! Pours a clear golden hue with a tall and thick white head. The aroma is great; tons of sweet citrus hops, a full grapefruit, some sweet fruits, and a background of pine. The flavor was so easygoing and yet so awesome; dominated by a citrus hop flavor, some bitterness getting through but the sweet ripe citrus hop flavors rule the day here. Not overly complex, but very quaffable and excellent. I could drink 20 of these. A nice full body too."
You can imagine how excited I was to see Pliny on the tap list at Falling Rock Tap House last night. I almost jumped out of my skin.
"Appearance - Light golden. Very little head, but nice lacing down the side of the glass."
"A- This beer looked like a thinner version of Grade A honey, with maybe a little bit of head. I'm sure the growler pour didn't do much for the head, but whatever. I'm too excited to care about head."
"Appearance - Medium-hued golden color with a smallish head that never fully disappeares. Intersting color, almost like a lager (not quite though)."
Pours amber with a sizable head and very good lacings.
Thanks to Julian for this one.
"Consumed 11/07/08. Bottle labeled, ""Bottled on 092208""."
"A: Pours a nice golden color, decent head leaves lacing all the way down, it's a beautiful thing"
Thanks to jctribe25 for the chance to try this.
"Generous extra received in a recent trade with Mauerhan (thanks Topher). Served in my DT tulip. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a half inch frothy, off-white cap embedded with copious tiny ringlets; some tiny bubbles also present in solution. Head dissipated into a soapy skim in the center with a band of ringlets that coalesced around the edges; some spatters of lacing present during the tasting. Nose off the cap was sweet grapefruit and a little bit of piney hops. Flavors were much more balanced; not overly sweet not overly bitter; a residual aftertaste lightly lingered between quaffs. Mouthfeel fell between light and medium with a mild effervescence consistent throughout. Easy drinking with a well-hidden abv. I'm not really an IPA fan, but I'm really starting to dig DIPAs. I can certainly appreciate the qualities of this brew, but I prefer them a little sweeter."
Awesome BEER!!! I was stoked to try this in their brewpub in santa rosa. Awesome piney (pliny?) but not too bitter hop finish...great depth all over the mouth. It tastes like a good mix between normal super strong imperial IPAs and a solid normal one. This was a terrific beer that i savoured for about an hour.
Enjoyed on draft at Falling Rock in Denver
Bottled on: 08/13/08
"Thanks to BgThang for the trade. Love this on tap and growler, needed to try the bottle."
"On tap at the Drafting room in Exton, PA. P"
500 ml bottle (9/22/08 bottling) into a pint glass.
"Many thanks, again, to brother BA mikesgroove for spotting me this gem... Consumed on 11/02/08..."
"I've had this a few times before on tap, but always after drinking something else...so not sure if those tastings really did it justice. But today I had a plan to find some at Beverage Warehouse...and they actually had it! And to celebrate my fortuitous find...I am going to drink it. Sweet. Poured into my nonic which was just the right size for the whole pint and a bit."
Thanks to FrancisWeizen for this extra in a recent trade.
A - Golden with copper orangish highlights and a soap scum white head with sticky lacing.
"Pop the top and the smell of hops springs forth. Smells delicious with the sharp, biting bitterness of citrus, pine. Oh so aromatic."
"Been drinking, appreciating, discussing beer for a while now... but I have never properly put my thoughts on paper. I figured no better beer to start with than good old pliney. As the bottle feverishly recommended, I opened as soon as it arrived at my doorstep. Thanks to Joey from Southbay for shipping it over!"
Got from a trade with beerbeagle...
"Other beer info: 500ML bottle poured into pint glass. 8% abv. Bottled on Sept. 22, 2008"
I got a couple of bottles of this along with a ton of other Russian River stuff from a recent trade with Jhenry04. Thanks for the beers!
Sharply citrusy and bone dry- Russian River knows that these halmarks are the only ones that matter in this simple and strong style.
"Had this one on tap at O'Brien's in San Diego this weekend. Poured a deep, dark orange color with an extremely creamy, thick head. Lacing lasted until I was just about done with it. "
Pours orange with white soap-scum like foam.
"Thanks to bring for shunting a few bottles of Pliny across the continent to land on my doorstep a few days ago. The bottle said something about drinking this fresh, I forget what, so I thought I better get on it. Split the first bottle with the wife, who'd already had fresh Pliny on tap in California. "
"After first sip i muttered under my breath (while alone): ""oh, wow"""
Thanks Strelnikov for the bottle
Picked up a single at Wilbur's in Ft. Collins. 
"To be something that I would enjoy drinking it would need... More color, head that lasts longer, less harsh bitterness and more body."
"A: pours an opaque orange with some bright yellow hues. Nice frothy slightly off-white head. Outstanding head retention, seriously outstanding. Which leads to some of the most gorgeous lacing I have seen with a beer."
Thanks to mcallister for sharing this bottle. This is getting to be a habit.
Served from a 12oz bottle from Mondo Vino 32nd and Lowell Denver CO.
"Pours golden yellow with a thick, creamy, white 1 finger head that dissipates quickly into a thin lacing. Piney initial aroma recedes into grapefruit and a touch of wet green grass. Surprisingly sweet, sharp fruit flavor of pineapples and mango balance out the bitterness of the hops which are almost an afterthought until the alcohol kicks in. The flavors linger and mingle on the palate held together by the incredible creamy malts. The sweet start is punctuated by a long, dry, finish. Like it's namesake, this beer is complex, worldly and iconic."
Thanks to Midaszero for the bottle.
Thanks to atsprings for a pour of this wonderful beer.
"500 ml bottle, bottled 9-2-08"
Just received a bottle of this from TexasWayne today. I've been wanting to try this for quite some time and I can't wait (despite my slight hangover). Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale flute. Bottled on 07/30/08.
"A: A finger of foam on a straight pour, the head stuck around for 5 minutes and as it settled it left some sticky spots on the side of the glass, crystal clear, golden straw - 4.50, S: Pliny packs a powerful punch of pine and grapefruit - a hop lover's heaven, some faint signs of tropical fruit and cantelope, the aroma is thick and pungent and utterly delectable - 5.00, T: As I take the first sip and try to figure out the palate the bitter hops on the tail jump out, having done a homebrew based on Pliny the Elder I'm familiar with the hop build (Vinnie posted his recipe online) and the hop that stands out is the earthy Columbus hops, also lots of resiny flavors, malt as you might expect is present to balance out the beer but it truly plays second fiddle to the hops - 5.00, M: More body than I'd expect, mildly sticky and syrupy - 4.75, D: Given the difficulties in acquiring this beer, I savor it for those reasons alone, but this is top notch, hands down one of the best Double IPAs I've had - 5.00"
"Number 100 had to be a special beer, maybe something not readily available in Connecticut. I'd had Pliny the Elder at Toronado in San Francisco before and now it was time to ship some home during my recent business trip to San Diego (thanks Holiday Wine Cellar, Escondido) and evaluate it. I was not dissapointed."
A very faint haze to the light golden yellow color. Half an inch of pure white head shrank halfway before holding a few minutes. Just a single stream of carbonation rising from the center of the brew. Sitcky rings of lace. 
A big thanks goes to ducksfan for this one. 
"Thanks again to Christina for getting me this gem. Pours a decent enough clear gold, with a small white head show. Head quickly becomes a white ring of lace, with some staying power. Smell is of earthy hops, reminiscent of onions or cabbage. Some bits of grass and citrus can be smelled in the background. Taste starts off with some sweet honey comb and citrus, and follows through with the onion like hops. Mouthfeel is slightly lighter than was expected, but full of flavor. Alcohol warmth can be felt after the first few pulls on this brew, but I could see myself going through another bottle of this without a problem. An impressive DIPA from Russian River. Reminds me a lot of Stone's 10th Anniversary DIPA, which also showcased that same onion like hop profile. Worthy of the hype? Not really in my opinion, but still a damn good beer, and one to seek out. Cheers"
"Thanks, Chris"
Pours a nice orange color with little head that dissapears quickly. lt has a wonderful pine/citrusy smell. This one has just the right amount of bitter to not be too overpowering. This is a perfect blend of hoppiness for a very drinkable beer.
"Received in trade from RickSawyer, Thanks for the opportunity."
"Well, it took me several years to finally track down Pliny the Elder, but I found him at the Argonaut liquor store in Denver, CO. He's mine! All mine!"
What a nice surprise it was to see this on tap at my visit to Monks. 
"Wow! As a Cleveland native, tonight could not be more perfect...celebrating a Cleveland Browns victory on Monday Night Football by cracking open a bottle of Pliny the Elder."
"Thanks to skourtis for the trade, been meaning to try this for a while."
"Snifter. Pours a clear, burnished gold with a one finger pure white foamy head which is only ever so slowly receding. Fat sheets of lace crusting the walls of my Terrapin snifter all the way to the bottom of the glass when finished. Beauterrific!"
"Paid $3.99 for a 16.9 oz bottle from Monument Liquor in Concord, CA. Poured into a pint glass."
Light golden body with great clarity. Some slightly smooth cascading action out of the bottle. Head is a perfect small-bubbled crest of white foam. Excellent lacing. Looks very good.
Thanks to Beerzebub for a fresh bottle via trade.
I poured this one from a 16.9oz (500ml) brown bottle into an Imperial pint glass.
This review will be similar to my Blind Pig review because these two beers are very similar.
Bottled 02/01/10 
"How do I love thee Russian River seasonal IPAs? Let me count the ways. Blind Pig. Pliny the Elder. Pliny the Younger. Actually, I haven't had the pleasure of trying the Younger, if I'm being completely honest, but I can only imagine the heights of perfection that beer reaches. If I had to choose between the Blind Pig and the Elder, I would take the Elder by a hair, but I'm taking nothing away from Blind Pig with that statement. Both beers are masterpieces of super hopped, fresh IPAs (well, I guess DIPA for Elder but that's semantics)."
Thanks to BradLikesBrew for this one!
Thanks to bitterbill for this one!
I enjoyed a few of these on tap at Gulifty's in Rosemont tonight and gave myself the opportunity to review this bad boy.
A-Golden colored...perfect little creamy head on top.
"Bottle is dated Aug. 25, 2008... best to drink it up before age starts to settle in and I find myself in gross misconduct for not following the strict instructions on the bottle. ;)"
Bottle dated 8/25/2008.
Well this just arrived this morning (thanks to Joey at SouthBay) and I just finished doing some painting so I think it's time for a reward. I just can't wait any longer. 
"Bottled 8/13/08. Gifted to me by msubulldog25, who I cannot thank enough."
"poured this 16.9 oz brown bottle into a Tripel Karmeliet glass. Bottled on 090208 (less than a month from brewery to little ol' Kentucky). The body was clear and bright. The rich golden/apricot color glowed. The 1""+ of frothy, creamy, off-white head lingered- leaving splotchy lace. the film of foam never evaporated."
"OK, after being disappointed in the on-tap version in SD, I've got a couple of bottles to try. Appearance is a hazy yellow with a quarter-inch of head. Smells strongly of pine and herbs. Fantastic aroma. Taste is another matter--very bitter, with a medium citrus flavor and a decent malt component. Just a two-dimensional flavor, though, not much complexity. Could have used some more varied hop flavors in there. Very drinkable, but just not the world-class IPA I was expecting."
A - A light yellow color with tints of amber and orange throughout. Light sediment floats about. A nice off white head the diminishes quickly and leaves a weblike lace all the way down.
"Right from the bottle, pliny pours an awesome orange/amber color with a thick enduring head. The smell is almost better than the taste...almost. Very rich citrus, floral notes that make your mouth water in anticipation. This beer is hard to put down as it's loaded with super delicious hops that don't kick your tongue's ass. Velvety smooth with every drink. Most double IPAs leave that unpleasant tongue scraping taste on the back of your tongue long after drinking but Pliny leaves your mouth, stomach, and soul wanting more. Truly an inspiring brew. The bar has been set high with this ale."
This beer is in a league of its own.
"Had some on tap at the First Street Alehouse in Livermore on my last trip to CA, but didn't take any notes, just knew it was great. Managed to score a bottle to bring back with me. Should have filled my suitcase with more of it and less of some of the others I brought back."
"Pours a hazy amber colour with a thick white head. Great retention and lace. The smell is very powerfull. It hits you the minute you crack the bottle. Piney (or is that Pliny), grapefuity and floral. No malt detected in the aroma at all. Flavour mirrors the aroma with the addition of a slight grassy taste and an enormous, but not tragically agressive, bitterness. The malt flavour is very nuetral, its sole purpose to cut the hops so they dont burn your face off. Very, very dry finish. Has a lighter body (for a IIPA), which makes this a very drinkable beer. Wow, I could drink this all night, or at least try to. I dont believe its 8%. Good Stuff!"
Shared this bottle during game 1 of the Brewers/Phillies Wild Card game at Pacific Standard BROOKLYN NYC.
"Poured a surprisingly pale amber color with a huge foamy white head that leaves tons of Belgian lacing with every mouthful. I've been conditioned to expect a certain 'level' of color is required to achieve world class levels of mouth and flavor. This one convincingly shattering that myth, but i'd prefer a meatier color. The smell is aggressive, intense with floral piny resin and grapefruit. Hugely tangy with hops, the mouth feel is full bodied and compliments the flavor during and after taste. Full flavored the piny resin and grapefruit flavors explode and linger as anticipated. Interesting to taste RR IPA, Blind Pig and Pliny side by side. The fundamental elements flavor being the common thread...the difference really being the intensity in both the mouth and depth of flavor. Drinkability is a 4.75...i'm having a really hard time believing that this one is only 8% ABV. The intensity of the mouth and flavor textures hide the kick-in-the-as* that is inevitable. One of the best ales i've had the opportunity to experience...clearly topping off my venture to mecca. The real amazing thing about a Russian River sampler is the scope and breathe of their products. AMAZING!!!! and a worthy 500th review."
"Thought I'd give this another review now that it is readily available in Colorado. Picked up a bottle, plus its on tap at several different locations (woohoo!). Great hop aroma, slightly cloudy gold color with just a bit of red. Nice head retention. Amazing combination of a solid malt backbone with tons of hops. This one is an awesome addition to the great beer selection in Colorado, and I'm sure I'll be consuming quite a bit of it."
"A: Nice bubbly amber, not much head due to soft pour. Bottle is a riot "" sit on eggs not on pliny"" humm wonder if i should age this one? LOL"
Bottled On: 090208 (18 days old when consumed)
16.9 oz bottle that I am indebted to Wetpaperbag for quite a while Poured into a tulip. Bottled on 8-13-08.
A: Bottle date: 09/22/08. Pours a crisp yellow with honey gold hues. Tight thumb size head after fast aggressive pour. The head is a rich creamy sauteed butter and olive oil coloring. Lacing drapes across the glass.
"A- Pours a clear, dark golden color with a thin cap of head which sticks around for almost the whole beer."
Thank you to brdc for sharing this great beer.
Golden body with a reddish tinge. Head is thick and creamy. A vision in my Stone RIS tulip.
P. Golden color with a nice hazy to it and excellent lacing
now THIS is what i was expecting out of the mighty pliny. 
"Purchased from the Belmont Station in Portland OR. on my first visit. The beer looks good with about one finger of head in a pint glass. Nose is about par for this style but I was expecting just a bit more from such a highly decorated brew. Taste is good and meets expectations. I do like my imperials to boast more hops and bitterness with some malty background and this just fell a wea bit short. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is good. Overall this is a really good IIPA, but not super great."
MANY thanks to mymrnngjckt for this treat. I beat his ass in fantasy baseball and he included this in a mixed 6er prize. Thanks man.
"Had on tap at Monks in Philly. No notes, just from recall."
"Thanks, Daniel, for sending this one"
"Pours a clear light copper/amber body with a frothy off white head and medium carbonation. Aroma is medium sweet with grapefruit, pine, bread and caramel sweetness. Flavor is grapefruit, pine and caramel. Very simple yet a wonderful blend. Medium to full body, thick texture. Sweet bitter/caramel flavor lingers nicely. Great beer!"
I was lucky enough to have a friend graciously send me two bottles of this and the pig...
"Another Russian River offering that lives up to the hype. A well balanced, well crafted double IPA."
Bottle from City Beer in San Francisco.
A - Clear golden yellow with a bigh white head. 
A - beautiful hazy light amber with a pillowy white head and excellent lacing
"Poured clear orange/gold into a snifter. Sticky white head, lots of lacing. A good looking beer."
Thanks to Dlucky for this one. My first Russian River experience. Poured into my snifter.
Pours a cloudy amber orange color with a small head and nice lacing.
"A : Pours a nice clear golden color with a good head, not much lacing"
"Pours a murky golden amber, light becomes diffuse as the glass widens. Just a ring of head, eggshell white in color, lacing is nonexistent. Not surprising for a beer with this much hop juice, but not exceptional."
"Pours a four finger yellowed head over a mildly hazed golden. Gorgeous frothy head clings and caves. Smells pink greapfruit pith, piney, grassy, and garlic."
Bought a bottle of this at my local bottle shop after reading all the rave reviews about this beer.
"I've been waiting over 3 years to try this beer, finally found some distributed to Seattle. I was ready for a letdown because of the hype I gave it internally but it put me in my place quickly. Like John Stewart on Karl Rove. This is the kind of beer that gets me excited as hell about beer. Not since the Stone 10th have I tasted a beer this good. "
Thanks to imacoug for sharing this fine beer with me. I served this brew into a 12 ounce mug.
Poured from a bottle in to my Sam Adams glass.
Bottle purchased from City Beer Store.
"16.9oz bottle received from largadeer. Thanks, dogg. Bottled on 30th July, decanted into my Duvel tulip at 2137h on the 9th of September"
Received a couple of bottles through a trade with Slayer3604
"Growler courtesy of stewdawg, showed up a day after he filled the growler, so i decided i needed to open it as soon as i got it, so it would be nice and fresh."
My pint appeared to be a gold orangey color. The head dissapated fairly quickly but I knew it was fresh because of the lovely aromas. 
First off amazing.
"Got this one from tpd975, Cheers Greg!"
"A- no double IPA ever looks better than this. Clear rich Golden in color, generous white head. It can also look very pale yellow or orangish depending on the lighting."
"Pours a brilliant amber red with golden highlights. A pillowy head rises and falls to a finger thick disk. Lacing leaves draping patterns across the glass. Smells wonderful. Piney, resinous, buscuity malt, spearmint, hints of citrus. Beautifully balanced! First taste is very solid! Carmel sweetness, bready malts give way to piney, slightly spicy / peppery hops. Not incredibly complex but something amazingly simple about it strikes my fancy. Just the slightest bit of alcohol on the finish. Soapy, solid mouthfeel. A highly drinkable DIPA from the guys who helped pave the road."
"Pours from a 500ml bottle into the Sam Adams glass. Lots of warnings all over the bottle telling me to enjoy it now, not later. The dude abides..."
"With Russian River just starting to appear in the area, I was excited to get a chance to try Pliny, but I was a bit worried about whether the beer would live up tot he hype that had been generated."
"500mL bottle, purchased locally...whoo Hoo to that! 081308 bottling. It's a really nice beer. The hops blend into the malt so beautifully. Nicely sweet with an awesomely hoppy bitterness. Great balance, there is a reason this beer is one of those ""must have, everyone talks about it, no really will you trade me some, ISO, etc. etc. etc."" beers."
"This will not be my typical A,S,T, M, D review. I respect and love this beer too much for that."
"Bottled on date of 8.25.08, imbibed 09.03.08"
"Pours dark amber brown with very nice white head. Aroma is sweet citrus and pine with a background of hops. Flavor begins with a great and unique palate of roasted nuts, almost like creamy peanut butter. Nice finish of hops and citrus. Great medium body, very easy to drink. Unique and amazing double IPA."
Let me start out by saying I was super stoked to try this one. Had it on tap at Russian River in Santa Rosa. Pours a deep golden/amber and has a nice chunky white head that leaves good lacing. 
"I've had this a few times at the yearly GABF, but it's always hard to tell how great something may or may not be based on samples."
"Pours a short-lived coarse foam; some lingering fizz on the glass, and a very unusual orange color, with more red than most pales."
"ah yes, Pliny the Elder"
"Now that Russian River distributes to Oregon, I get the chance to try this popular brew. Pours a beautiful copper color, thick white head with heavy lacing. Nice grapefruity aroma is just right. Taste is lots of citrusy bitter hops up front but seems to get piney as I drink more, low alcohol presence, and a healthy bit of malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is very sticky as a good DIPA should be. A very, very, very good beer. Well done Vinnie."
I was lucky enough to find this beauty at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver. F%&$ing fantastic. 
"A - Cloudy and orange. I poured slowly since this beer is so turbid, so not much head. Still a gorgeous beer."
"Appearance- Nice golden copper color with a descent size white, fluffy head. Lacing was present and stayed throughout the life of the beer."
thanks swnicholson. Thanks.
"A - Medium Dark honey, somewhat murky. Nice spongy 1/2 inch head, stays for some time. Pretty prevalent lacing."
Appearance - Bronze-gold in color with a creamy white head.
This beer has a wonderful aroma and beautifuly complex hop characteristics. The complex hop characteristics is its most notable characteristic having filled your mouth with everything you want from a big IPA. If I was desserted on a dessert island... you get the point!
"500ml, bottled on 7/30/08"
"I was saving this for #300 since I'm only a couple away, but after some prodding on LNBA's I decided I'd go ahead and do it. I've got other things that can mark #300! Here goes!"
Went back to Libations to get a few more bottles of Blind Pig and had to try Elder.
500 ml bottle. Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a smallish frothy white head that quickly goes to a thin film that leaves a little lacing.
"A beautifull brew, pours a rich copper brown with a silky tan head. Excellent lace. The nose has a great balance between the hops and sweet malts. The taste is very well balanced as well. Nice fruity citrus hops followed by sweet candy malt. Medium to full body compliments this IPA very nicely. Really a fantastic beer from Russian River. Can't wait to try the younger."
I was only able to snag one bottle for myself; I'm sure it'll be easier to find in CO in the future.
Now listening to: Brian Jonestown Massacre - Talk-Action=Shit
i am thoroughly amazed at this beer. i had the pleasure of having this on tap today.
Big big thanks to BrewerB for hooking me up with not one but two of these bottles.
"Finally, the illustrious Elder sits in the glass in front of me..."
Review #1. Hopefully they will get better in time.
Appearance is a translucent golden amber with a thin white head with 6 or 7 fingers of lacing.
Big thanks to jtrockchalk for sharing this at a tasting at the Foundry in Westport.
"After years of waiting, a Russian River brew is finally in my glass."
Got this in a trade with Georgiabeer!!
"Had this kid at my friend's house, we had a 10 hour, two beer brew day and he had some plinys at his house WOOT!"
I was lucky enough to go to the release dinner for Denver and taste some fantastic beers. This is a must have for any hop head.
Poured from a 500mL bottle (dated 7-30-08) into a pint glass.
"First off, this beer looks great. Clear orange, nice. It smells seriously hoppy and tastes very hoppy, bitter and piney but is not overdone. It is super hoppy without being tacky about it. It has a slight dryness to it but doesn't seem astringent. The label is entertaining and I have to agree with the sentiment..."
Appearance: Pours a clear honey color with a rocky ecru head that sticks well and throws a few shards of lace around the pint glass
Bottle date 7/10/08
Finally after waiting to try this for some time it hits home in SEATTLE!
"500ml bottle poured into glass a golden-amber with a massive frothy white head that doesn't quit. Thick, sticky lacing throughout."
Thanks to Jw347 for this tasty brew
"Huge THANKS to OlieIPA who, instead of hording this treasure all to himself like any sane man, decided to share with a brother in need."
Tried it on tap at The Hop Yard in Pleasanton.
"Oh, Pliny... how I've longed to try thee."
500ml bottle poored into a pilsner glass. Thanks to Rick for sending this one my way.
A - Dark orange-brown color with a thick foamy off-white head. Excellent retention and lacing.
"A - Pours up an amber yellow with a thick, dense head that lasts forever."
"I picked up and tasted this beer at Hollingshead's Delicatessen...which I might add...is an awesome place to visit for all those who get all giddy when it comes to the sight of quality beer. Anyways, let me get to the review..."
"Thanks ricand for this one. Bottled 07/29/08; so again, as fresh as I will ever get; shipped overnight. Medium sized capped bottle, poured into a tulip."
"I was holding out on ole review #300 for something special, and I suppose this'll have to do. Poured from a new 500ml bottle hauled back from Cali."
"I can't feel my tongue after drinking this one, you know its GOOD! This is my first time with this brew... oh i am a luck one."
"Pours much the same as blind pig, with soapy head, slightly lacking clarity, and a light orange color. Moderate spotty lacing and a half-collar remain, with soapy wisps after every swirl."
"poured from a bottle into a snifter. huge hops out of the bottle and in the glass. this bottle must be quite fresh. taste is all hops, strong citrus (mostly red grapefruit), light bitterness, but full flavor. bitter but very balanced. smooth in the mouth, lightly carbonated. little head when poured. if this was available, i would drink often, very often. i now understand the hype."
Purchased at Hollingshead's. Bottled on 7/30/08 and consumed on 8/14/08.
16.9oz bottle
Thanks to Joey from South Bay Drugs for keeping this in stock concurrent with our Coronado family trip-poured into Coronado Brewing pint glass...
Thanks Thimbledrome for this one. Bottled on 7/10/2008 poured into a tulip glass. 
"This beer pours a very hazy orange color with a decent sized solid white head. The head died down a bit, but it left patchy lacing on my tulip glass. The nose on this beer is very fresh and vibrant. The citrus scent is the most dominant with plenty of earthiness and pine scents nipping at the heels of the citrus scent, but no malt to really speak of in the nose. The flavor profile starts out with loads of hop bitterness leaning towards pine bitterness with the citrus fruit and tropical fruits flavors really coming in about mid-drink. The flavors are very pronounced, but they do not overpower you in anyway, but rather combine for a very pleasant flavor profile. The initial rush of hop bitterness if huge, but somehow the finish is soft and clean. I am very surprised as well at how low the malt flavor is, but still supports the hops brilliantly. The drinkability is really amazing for a DIPA with the alcohol well hidden, and I would have gladly had another bottle of this beer."
"Huge thanks to swnicholson for this baby! What a day!- Blind pig and supplication in the afternoon, great dinner, then Pliny before bed!"
"I gotta admit, i am a bit intimadated by this beer. heard so much about it, its hard not to buy into the hype. ok here goes. pured into my favorite imperial pint glass. about 2 fingers of offwhite head from a gentle pour. says for a bit, the recedes leaving mounds of lacing, and a thin film on top. some bubbles coming to the top, slowly. beer is a light amber. "
"Fresh (bottled 7/1/08, drank 8/6/08) 500mL bottle (care of swnicholson- thanks!) poured into my trusty Sam Adams glass. "
Thanks to Murchmac for sending this exceptional brew.

500 ml bottle.
500 ml bottle. Poured into snifter.
Tried at the Brewer's Fest in Portland.
Clear shiny orange amber with a big ole frothy mass of foam. 
"Deep golden amber in color, steady carbonation with a medium creamy head that actually has some good retention and lacing. Huge smell of hop juice. Resinous and stinky green, just how I like it. Sugared citrus and pine. Peppered grapefruit. Taste is a bitter, hoppy explosion. Grapefruit, pine, with a biscuity malt for some balance. Again, it's got a lightly sugared citrus flavor with a definite spicy, peppery character as well. Good assertive bitterness with a near medium body. Nice drying finish and a tingle on the tongue. Drinkablity is up there. Reminds me of a less vibrant White Knuckle. Very similar in many regards to that, so it's hard to put it too close because it truly doesn't get there in my mind. Still, that aside, it's one of the better brews within the style that I've had the chance to try. Almost closer to an IPA when you compare it to Younger, though. When will they bottle Younger?!"
Serving type- Bottle poured into a regular pint bottle.
500ml bottle
"I have been enjoying this beer for a while at local alehouses, but just now do I review it as I have my first sips from one of their newly released 500ml bottles poured into a pint glass."
"Many, many thanks to hoppymeal for this very nice surprise."
"Bottle picked up at City Beer Store in San Francisco bottled on 071008, poured into a snifter."
"Pours from a 500 ml, bottled on 7/10 (14 freakin days ago!), somewhere between straw and amber, fairly clear and with a proper two finger head. Lightly colored entry in the style. Smells absolutely fantastic - like grapefruit perfume. Some biscuity bread and honey. Much milder taste than I'd anticipated. Pretty heavily hopped, but its all the citrus and floral elements and virtually none of the bitterness, or at least very muted in the IBU dept. Orange, grapefruit, herbal. The malt is also fairly under the radar, no more prevalent than in a crisp lighter lager. Slight, warm, peppery esters let you know this is a ""double."" Mouthfeel is silky, with some predictably resinous stickiness lingering on the tongue. Very very well balanced - terribly drinkable."
Bottle on 7-10-08.
Bottle courtesy of thequeue poured into a snifter.
"Bottled On Date July 10, 2008; Sampled July 17, 2008"
Split this growler with fiveo2270.
a: beautiful golden amber with nice movement provided by columns of bubbles flowing up toward a frothy white head; leaves what i like to call staircase lace
Found this on tap at Pizza Port. The bartender really didn't know how to pour beer so maybe the head could of been better? The lacing was fair.
"I first noticed pineapple hops, rather intense. Pine needles are also very present. Slight floralness appearing later on. Light hints of breaded malt. Clean. Citrusy hop character remained present longest."
"Bottled on 7/10/08, which is only 2 days ago! Doesn't get much fresher than this. It pours a nice light amber-blonde with a decent white head to it that takes a couple minutes to recede and leaves some lacing. There appears to be the right amount of carbonation rising up. The aroma opened with some big grass notes that really gave way to some strong pine and lighter citrus with a hint of grapefruit as the head receded. Very nice hop profile."
"On tap at Liars Club. Bright gold with a creamy white head. Very floral with lots of orange and grapefruit. Flavor is very bitter and hoppy with bready malts and some sweetness to keep everything well balanced. This beer starts to get very good about halfway through the pint as it warms up. Sticky resin, pine and tropical fruit. Dry bitterness in the finish. This beer is always the first one to kick at the Oregon Brewers Fest."
Many thanks to ricand for sending me an extremely fresh growler. 
"Poured from a fresh flip top Russian River growler gotten via trade with ricand (of which I can never thank him enough for). Great trader, great beer, props to him. Poured from the growler into my nonic pint glass."
HUGE thanks to ricand for a growler of one of the tastiest brews I have ever had!
"On-tap at Hollingshead's, on to the beer:"
Had this one on-ap at Stone Brewing. Served in an 8oz pint glass.
"Just a ridiculously great IPA. The aroma is incredibly inviting, like no IPA smell I've ever had. Fruity smell, in bed with incredibly piney, walk-in-the-forest type smells."
"One hell of a birthday gift sent from a friend. Thanks! &lt;br&gt; Poured from a 10 day old growler. I was worried about it holding up and wanted to get to this promptly and was momentarily worried, when I got no PSSSTTT sound when opening the growler. Poured into a tulip and the head vigorously formed, regardless. Poured a clear, golden amber color with a rich, incredibly long lasting offwhite head that left huge chunks of frothy lacing. Smell was huge piney, fruity, grapefruity, citrusy hoppy deliciousness. Taste is incredibly smooth and clean. Citrusy fresh hops and a hint of a slighly syrupy body, but still just barely medium to full bodied. The drinkability on this was phenomenal and the alcohol was hidden perfectly. Flavor was a touch milder than expected but was still divine and went down like water. Great double IPA."
"Russian River, why are you so far away?"
Got to share this one with pimpp! Thanks a TON!!! This was from a freshly shipped growler from CA and we cracked it at our Texas Hold 'Em/IPA party.
"I've had this on tap at the Russian River brewpub numerous times, and always bring a growler home. If I had to pick a single favorite beer this would probably be it. Rich gold in color, with reddish tints. The nose is astounding: pineapple, pleasantly musty grass- and pine-sap aromas, grapefruit, some of the kind of vanilla-ey aromas that you find in oaky chardonnay, along with funky tropical fruit scents---passionfruit, or even durian, though not overwhelming. With wines or beers, I'm a sucker for an interesting aroma, and this is definitely a beer worth swirling again and again to reactivate the olfactory blast. Flavors of passionfruit and grapefruit, with piney hops. All of Vinnie's high-hop offerings remind you that a simple IBU number doesn't really tell the story---this has got to be at 90 or more, but it's so well structured and balanced that you really don't taste ""bitterness"" or ""hoppiness"" per se. Instead the hops and malts create a structure that allows an amazing range of flavors to play across the palate with crystalline definition (this general point goes for the Younger, and RR's other hopped-up offerings as well). The mouthfeel is crisp and not at all cloying, but does have a noticeable tongue-coating quality. It's worth noting that while this beer is classed as an IIPA, it's far less heavy in body than most of the others of the type, and while the intensity of flavors definitely puts it in that category, it has a clean medium-bodied profile that drinks more like a regular, if mind-blowing, IPA. The finish is clean, bitter-grapefruit-rindy, and lingering. Two comments: 1. Thanks! 2. Never stop making this stuff!"
"Thanks to urwatuh8 for LIF'ing this beer. I had it on the night of my college graduation and as per his instructions, shared it with my beer loving friends and family who were in for the occasion."
Thanks to Talisker for this wonderful trade! Cheers!
"Acquired from Slatetank so a big ""Thank You"" goes out to him. Poured from a hand-bottled 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass."
A- Poured on tap at Toronado. Poured a bright amber with a thin head. 
"From growler shipped to me (6 days old when opened): Golden in color with a touch of amber. This still poured a great 3/4"" head that dissipated slowly. Strong scents of pure hops, pine and grapeftuit. The palate shows the hops more than the ""Blind Pig"" and is drier but not necessarily any more bitter. Again, this is a very well balanced beer that has a bit more of everything than the ""Blind Pig""."
On-tap at Ortino's Northside.
I was able to get this Russian River on-tap at Drafting Room's Hopfest on 4/12/2008. It was served to me in a 10 oz. Pilsner glass.
"This is the second or third time I've sampled this gem, and i like it more and more each time."
On tap at Russian River. Pours rich copper-hued amber with two fingers of thick carbonation and heavy spider webs of lacing all over the glass. 
"Pliny the Elder was a Roman naturalist, scholar, historian, traveler, officer, and writer. Although not considered his most important work, Pliny and his contemporaries created the botanical name for hops, ""Lupus salictarius"", meaning ""wolf among scrubs."" Hops at that time grew wild among willows, much like a wolf in the forest. Later the current botanical name, Humulus lupulus, was adopted. Pliny died in 79 AD while observing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. He was immortalized by his nephew, Pliny the Younger, who continued his uncle's legacy by documenting much of what he observed during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Pliny the Elder... the beer, is brewed with 40% more malt and over twice the amount of hops as compared to our already hoppy IPA. "
"I've been sitting here for a wee bit, trying to describe what Pliny tastes and feels like, and I'm genuinely having a hard time. The closest I can come to is that it's like a field of hops mated with an alpine forest, and the resulting child smacked you in the mouth."
"Thanks to Beertracker for the taste. Poured out of a less than one month old growler. Really nice head with somewhat low carbonation. Golden straw color. Smells of BIG multi-dimensional hops, focusing mostly on pine. Some sweet maltiness in there too. Smell is so strong as it could give the faint of heart a nose bleed. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Tingles the tongue as is swirls around. Some malt sweetness discernable. Slightly viscous. Hops all through out and leaves the tongue feeling vibrant and alive. Not totally unbalanced but definitely destroys the taste buds in a good way. Really mellows as it warms, becomes almost winelike. An exceptionally great beer that I look forward to having again."
Served on tap in a snifter at Stone Brewing World Bistro and Gardens during a trip there in November 2007. I just came across my notes (finally!).
"Its a good beer, I used to drink it all the time, then stopped for a year or so, when I came back to it because of all the chitter chatter on this site, I was let down. It was a better beer in my head. I go to the toronado often, and order it once or twice a year only. That being said, if you want to try a big california IPA, this wouldnt be a bad one to start with."
"Lovely stuff. Didn't produce much of a head and has a nice fragrance, though not overpowering. Big hops so that you find yourself clicking your tongue against your pallet for a few seconds after a nice big gulp. You like a big Left Coast IPA? Then you will like this."
Tasted on tap at the brewpub during a quick trip to the bay area
"My first Russian River experience. I've heard alot of hub-bub about this beer, and finally had the chance to try it. Not bad. Had a pint on tap at Ben n' Nick's in Rockridge. "
Thanks to Slatetank for the trade! 
"On draft at the Toronado. Golden color, great clarity. Off-white head with moderate retention and good lacing. Strong aroma of hops (resin, pine, citrus, ammonia). Initial flavors are hops: resin, citrus, pine. Noticable ammonia notes as well. Strong alcohol flavor kicks in after a few seconds. Toasty malt notes also apparent. Nice bitter finish. Medium body, Moderate carbonation. Nice long, smooth finish for an 8% beer. Some alcohol warmth and dry finish from abundant hops. A strong beer, but very drinkable considering the high hopping level and fairly high alcohol level. Most excellent."
"A phenomenal DIPA. One of my favorite beers of all time. Pours a pretty standard red/copper color, with a white head. Reaks of floral hops. Has a strong floral hop taste, with a nice malt backbone sweetness that is always present but is cotnrolled by the hops. The beer coates your mouth with a sticky hop feel. While drinking many of these can be dangerous, I often find myself putting back quite a few, and so I would say it is very drinkable."
Thanks to sprinkle for this huge favor(trade).
"had it at Toronado today. Seems like everybody was ordering Pliny's or Reality Czech's. Just wanted to get my rating in for this near-perfect drinking experience. after reading the hop schedule for this beer, I am amazed at how wonderfully balanced it is. I never got the feeling I was merely chewing grapefruit pith. Truly deserving its status as a top world beer. Exquisite."
"On tap at Stone, Pizzaport Carlsbad and San Clemente."
"I received this one in a growler in a trade. When i opened the package it looked liek it had leaked, so i had to dive in quickly. After tasting it, it was obvious it did not leak"
"Appearance&gt; golden yellow, clear, lively with a medium head and lots of lacing."
"This was a dream come true... a trip across the country to visit my girlfriend, and a trip up to Russian River. And their tremendous beer sampler for only $9.00!!!"
On draft at O'Brien's
"I got to try this last night at a tasting. Thank you Sid for the opportunity to try this brew, and thank you Zack for hosting the tasting."
"This beers all about the hops. It is an awesome showcase of all the modern hop strains descendent from Cascade. Delicious amounts of Simcoe, Columbus & Centennial. No strong esters; nice clean alcohol flavors from the White Labs California Ale yeast. Strong, Hoppy, Dry finish. Let it warm up a bit before you drink it and youll taste the complexity. Everything I want in an IPA."
I was so siked to try this beer finally.I had a pint and brought a growler home with me.
Wanted to try this one for awhile now--got an email from Capones saying they had it on tap and i just had to jump at the chance. Got a growler filled by Matt yesterday. I think the CO2 was turned up too high or something because while he was filling it up it was mostly head and took FOREVER to go down (so much head retention).
"On tap at Capone's today in Norristown, PA...right next to Founder BReakfast Stout and Bell's Expedition. Awesome. Pours orange, slightly hazy. Nice compact foamy head. Smells like citrus, fresh cut gras, huge hops, summit? Simcoe? whatever they are they smell fantastic. Taste is tremendously flavorful. Massice punch of grapfruit and hops. Malt body is substantial and creamy. hops linger and bitterness is unrelenting. delicious. Creamy and full bodied. Melds well with the bitterness...an amazing beer that lives up to the hype and that is absolutely made to be freshly poured from a tap."
Pliny the Elder
This beer is the stuff dreams are made of. This beer represents the only time that a beer has been so good that I dreamt of it that night.
A: Hazy orange-amber in appearance .. minimal head (note.. these were in small sampler glasses)
On-tap at Hollinshead this week (an ill-advised diversion during my lunch break).
A - Clear golden amber with a slight head
"Served in a Pint Glass at The Drafting Room in Exton, Pa. Ate a little chicken gumbo along side."
Super extra thanks to weeare138 for this extra!!
Poured into pint glass from tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad 09-30-07. 
"Pours an orange brownish color with a frothy and creamy white head that builds up several inches in the glass. Lacing is left along the side of the glass as this one is consumed. Smell is of herbs, perfume, earthy, and pine, with some citrus notes. Taste is at first hoppy and citrus, but finishes with a moderate bitter finish. Mouthfeeling is a bit oily and maybe syrupy as well."
"Pours a surprisingly golden color for a DIPA with lively carbonation and a sizable head that laces throughout the entire pint. Smells like bready sweet malt and fresh juicy hops. Taste is as it smells, big juicy hops with a huge rush of balancing malt. Medium at most in the mouth with good carbonation. Rediculously drinkable for a DIPA!! No abv apparant, just some hop juice to brighten my day."
A- Poured on tap at the brewpub. It is a beautiful deep golden color with a small head which sticks around until the bottom of the glass.
"Pours a crystal clear honey-orange, topped with a two finger frothy white head that lasts. Nice lacing left behind along the sides of the glass. "
This is the classic Double IPA or Imperial IPA if you prefer. The hop aroma is so strong you will smell it before you raise the glass to taste it. While the aroma is overpowering it balances the intensly strong hop flavor present in the beer. The malt and bitterness balance in nearly perfect. Be careful of the excessivly (but to style) alcohol in the beer! If you like double IPAs this is a great beer to try.
Special thanks to flexabull for giving me the opportunity to sample this wonderful beer. 
"Exceptional IPA. Exploded with bitter, grapefruit/floral hops. Drinkable despite the strong flavor and high alcohol content. Some sweetness in the form of pink/white grapefruit and citrus, but also a great balancing array of bittering flavors. All of the various tastes are superbly blended."
"Originally reviewed a couple months ago, but had to do another because it is by far my favorite beer"
"Last of three beers I had at Russian River, perfect beer to end my trip there. Poured into a nonic pint glass, ah yes, Happy Hour all day on Sunday :) "
"Lovingly consumed at Father's Office. A fair color for an IPA, coppery, and with abundant head. Retention was respectable, but not enviable. Smell was grassy, and alive with sweet malt and sticky hops. Taste was nectary, caramel with a fine blend of hops, with center stage shared beautifully between pine and citrus characters. Mouthfeel was rich and malty, but very clean. Unarguably, this is one hell of an IPA."
On tap at OBrians in San Diego
"A: Poured an attractive bright orange with an average head, somewhat persistent retention left sticky and spotty lacing."
"On tap at Toronado, SF, CA."
Sampled at the great Naja's Place in Redondo Beach.
"Pint on-tap at Hollingshead,"
"After all the wait finally a 750 ml naked, unmarked, and capped bottle received in trade with Risser09. Chilled and poured into a Duvel tulip glass foamy off white (sort of cream) colored head rose to one finger and now lingers a centimeter above the surface, lacing is already apparent. The body is a robust orange with warmer lighter highlights."
"Woohoo, I finally got to try this, and boy was it fantastic! Had 2 full pints at the Oregon Brewers Festival, in the plastic mug. Pliny is pale orange with a modest, olive tinged eggshell colored head that left nice lace."
"Just tried this one, on-draught at OBF 2007. I've had this at least one other time (a 4 oz. taste), but this is a full mug pour (pint)."
"I had this one on tap at Capone's. Nice deep amber/orange color. A complex fruit smell to the hops in this one. I smelled a lot of different fruit but still got the hop smell. It simply tasted great. Next to DFH 90, this was my favorite Double IPA so far. A bit less alcoholic than the DFH and you can tell in the taste. Good carbonation gave it a deep mouthfeel."
"On tap at Toronado in SF, this fine ale only bolstered my East Coast awe at the very name of Russian River. The bartender told me that it was an IPA, so I was surprised to read that it was 8% ABV, as it went down so easily. The beer's real strength is in its masterful hop bouquet (pine, mango, grapefruit) which fills one's nostrils to the brim, yet relents when hitting the tongue. Extraordinarily well balanced, these mighty hop flavors part, allowing the sweet bready malts to emerge. The only hop flavor to make it to the finish line is the resinous pine, which (in the humble opinion of this reviewer), keeps this beer from perfection. Aside from that bitterness, the mouthfeel manages to be creamy & crisp, a remarkable feat, and this ale goes down incredibly easy. Bravo!"
A HUGE thanks to ClockworkOrange for a bottle of this exceptional Gem.
"Drank on-tap at Toronado, San Francisco, CA"
Enjoyed on-tap at the brewery in Santa Rosa and before that once or twice at the Toronado.
On tap at Toronado.
Acquired this from a trade with Bradford
On tap at Pizza Port Solana Beach.
"After a lengthy drive up to UJ's Glenside from Baltimore, relaxed over a couple of glasses of this delicious hop nectar. I've had this beer on several occasions at the brewpub in Santa Rosa, and was very pleased to see that the nearly 3000 mile trip from California did not do this beer a bit of harm."
Hand-filled bottle from a gracious Californian.
Hand filled. Poured into a flute glass. 
Well...here's the Double IPA from the man that pretty much invented the style. Here goes..
Thanks to RedwoodGeorge for giving this Chicago Heights DIPA lover a chance to try this!
"Thanks Talisker, much appreciated for sure."
"Thanks to Talisker for the growler! Poured a crisp amber with a decent head that was mostly lasting and left spotty lacing. The aroma was of extremely fragrant earthy hops with some sweet malts. The taste was one of the most well-balanced beers I've ever had. An abundance of citrus hop flavor with just enough sweet malt for it not to overpower like many DIPAs do. The beer is medium bodied and the alcohol is well hidden, just enough to provide some warmth. This is one of the best beers I've ever had. If only they'd expand their distribution some, since I love the Wild Ales as well."
"Very clear and light colored, orangey amber honey hue. Long strings of tiny bubbles stream quickly from bottom to top. A half inch of pure white tightly bubbled foam sits atop and hangs around."
Served on-tap at the Wine Exchange of Sonoma.
Poured from a growler filled about a week ago. I showed great restaint by waiting a whole week to consume this. 
"I was lucky enough to be invited to a private tasting at the local Austrian joint of some growlers picked up by the too kind hosts some few days back on a rather long road-trip. The couple of days' time in the growlers did hurt carbonation levels, rendering the beers somewhat flat. Not prime condition for certain, but far better than never being able to sample. "
Mad Beer Karma to Clockworkorange for sending me this growler. The beer was served in an Imperial Nonic.
Sampled on 4/24/07
"Sampled on-tap at Capone's in Norristown, PA on 4-18-07 as part of a side by side comparison with Pliny the Younger. This review is from notes taken that night."
Many thanks go out to Redwoodgeorge and mntlover for the chance to have this brew. 
"On tap at Toronado, Ben n Nicks, Liars Club, OBriens and too many times to count, so its about time I review my boy, Pliny. Pours golden and slightly amber-ish with a nice, rock steady head. Sticking your nose in the glass in one of the true pleasures in craft beer - lots of sweet, fruity hops and caramel malt in a near perfect symphony. Tastes like it smells, only better. Resinous, sweet citrus hop candy with just the right balance of caramel and biscuity malts. It glides across your tongue and finishes super clean, a bit dry and with no alcohol burn. For me, this beer defines everything a IIPA should be. Extremely drinkable, sessionable - a brewing masterpiece. My favorite/#1/ if stuck on a deserted island beer of choice."
A- Thick just off white head on a clear copper body.

"his was on-draft in a 16 oz glass from the Russian River Brewpub in Santa Rosa. I have heard a lot about this, so was looking forward to seeing if it lived up to its reputation. The brews were all listed in various color chalks on a board behind the bar, and according to it this one checked in at 92 BUs and 8% ABV. When it was set in front of me I could smell the hops from two feet away. This one is potent! The odor just leaps out of the glass with piney and floral hops. You dont need to take a big sniff to get what is going on here. Besides the hops, there are also some wonderful rich malts, nuts toffee, caramel, and fruit. I cannot imagine a beer smelling any better than this. As a pub pour it came without any head, but after drinking off the first inch, and almost swooning in the process, I swirled it and got a nice fat off-white head that left lots of fat chunks of lacing on the sides of the glass. A beautiful light orange, this is a feast for the eyes and as the head slowly settles down you are so taken by its overall beauty you almost hate to disturb it. The flavor is similar to the nose, and while the malts and the hops dominate, there is a serious bitter finish worthy of a DIPA. The mouthfeel was excellent, very rich and creamy and simply glides across the teeth and tongue. It tastes just as good going down the pipe as it did at first sip. The brew is simply incredible. It has that wonderful bitterness that all great DIPAs should have, and hides the alcohol very well. It is too bad this is only available on tap, because I would love to share this with my friends so they can appreciate it also. I have been saving a score this high for just a brew like this. Ranks with the best beer I have every had the pleasure of drinking. Maybe Pliny the Younger will be that perfect 5.0 if I ever get to taste it"
Thanks to RedwoodGeorge!!! You are the man!!! Also thanks to mtnlover for helping with the hook-up.
"growler into a pint glass. orange-gold with an inch of frothy, foamy white head, which was great to see, as the growler had made a cross-country trip. tons of thick rings of lace and a few rising bubbles."
thanks to fartingdog for this growler straight from the brewery!
Handbottled 22oz bottle from the PtE handbottling project in PA. Received in a trade from BeerBeing.
750mL Bottle From The PtE Bottling Project - 2006 Vintage - Served At 45 Degrees Into a Snifter
A great beer. More mild than pliny the younger with less of an in your face smell. The taste is more balanced with a great hoppiness with some caramel malting to balance without getting in the way of my hop fix. The mouth feel is crisp yet malty and hop oily. I could drink this all day and the 8 percent alcohol doesn't bother me at all. Go try this beer. NOW!
8% ? Where do they hide it?
"12oz. bottle from PtE project. Huge thanks to Akorsak, Phatz and anyone else out there involved."
"on tap @ O'Brien's in San Diego, CA"
"Poured from a 750ml bottle from the PtE bottling project. I've had this beer on tap and from growlers many times and I must say this sample from the bottle is virtually indistinguishable from the tapped version. Much, much better than what you would get from a growler. Appears a clear golden amber color with two fingers of off white head. A fair amount of lacing clings to the glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells of fresh, piney hops, sweet malts, grapefruit, apricot and a pleasant grassy note. Tastes of piney, citrusy, and lemony hops. Finish is peppery, bitter, and dry. Medium bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Dangerously drinkable. Believe the hype."
poured into a flared tulip glass from a bottle that Phatz bottled from a keg at the Pliny Bottling Project.
"Had this on tap at RR on Saturday. This is a great brewery that Ive been wanting to visit now for quite a while. There's nothing supernatural about these beers, most of the appeal is how hard they are to find, but they are pretty damn good and you can tell the brewery as a whole ascribes to a level of quality and dedication that is surprisingly rare in this business. For some reason this brewery attracts a lot of sketchy-looking patrons, and the staff aren't exactly brain surgeons either, but I felt right at home anyway."
poured from a growler into a snifter glass
Pouring this beer produces a generous inch of foamy and creamy white head that holds and clings to the glass indefinitely. The body is slightly hazy and a pale amber color. 
"Once more, I was able to have some on-tap, this time at The Grey Lodge on my way to the Stillers/Iggles pre-season game at the Linc on 25 August 2006."
"Growler courtesy of mac300, very much appreciated."
"Big thanks to mcallister and pixel for inviting my wife and I over to sample this growler. Bright gold in color, with a thick white foamy head. The head disappeared quickly, however there were some great patches of lace clinging to the glass. Great aroma of pine, citrus (namely tangerine), and grass. Solid sweet malt background, followed by a good amount of piney, citrusy hops. A lot of peach and tangerine flavors. Very well balanced. Medium body. Very nicely done."
Deep golden nearing copper. Thick white and fluffy head with some lacing great retention.
Enormous thansk goes out to zrrbrrt for the growler!!
"Dark amber pour with sticky lace and a powerful aroma. Hop profile is all over the place- citrus, floral etc. with some sugary malt in the background. Taste is much more subdued than expected- hops play with the tongue and become one with the malt backbone. Excellent finish, as the dryness of the hops play against the thick and slick DIPA body. One of the smoothest out there; cant wait to try the Younger."
The always (too) generous Dr.Jay brought Christmas a little early this year with a growler of Pliny the Elder all the way from Capone's. Huge thanks Jay!
WOW. I finally had the opportunity try this beer I have been seeking months. I have to admit it was a bit anticlimactic. My expectations were set so high I wanted a holy experience and this only *exceptional* and that was it. I guess with all the excellent DIPAs we have access to the competition is tough. I had this on tap at Capone's Russian River night and there were a lot of distractions. I brought home a growler so I will make more comments from that and the keg later. From notes:
A HUGE thanks to kmudrick for this treat from Capone's outside of Philly. Growler that got to me about 2 days after pouring.
"Pours a coppery burnt orange and clear with an off white head that slowly recedes. Aroma is big on the citrusy hops, a nice sweet red grapefruit, orange rind, and a nice light cotton candy malt sweetness. Taste is a very nice sweet florida orange, just that right amount of citrusy sweetness balanced by the bitterness of the rind and membrane. Creamy and soft malty body shows a nice spicy pepperiness and just a hint of alcohol. There is a nice lingering mild dryness to the finish. A very well balanced beer, nothing is out of control or over the top, mouthfeel is very nice, soft malts and bitterness blend together very well. Taste is like eating fresh citrus fruit, yum. Thank you Beerbeing for the opportunity."
New Review (11-3-08): 
"my most anticipated beer to date, at a most anticipated bar, toronado in sf."
"A: Immediatetly I notice the vibrant copper color, with a very nice anitque white head of fluffy, small bubbles. Nice lace is already forming on the sides, yet this head should last awhile. "
On-tap at Hollingshead.
Thanks to the ever-so generous zrrbrrt for a growler fill of this gem...in PA nonetheless.
I'll hit 1000 karma with some style. Big thanks to DrJay for bringing this up from Philly! Can't believe you blessed us with Pliny's presence.
"Light orange body and good white head that lasts. Lace in glass. Very fresh, brought by Dr.Jay from Capone's near Philly on Russian River night. Bitter bias but also well malted. Perfect soft carbonation. Smooth orange and grapefruit taste.Bitter, sweet, then bitter aftertaste."
"pre-holiday tasting at my place attended by me, DrJay, Viggo, biegaman, and northyorksammy. DrJay contributed this amazing growler. thanks jay!"
"I have had this before, but I finally got to have another one this afternoon at the brewery and properly review the Great Pliney The Elder. And boy, did I forget how great this one is."
"Poured a clear, light amber, gold and orange color with a fluffy, slightly off-white head. Tons of pillowy lace on the pint glass. "
Sampled on-tap into a pint glass; let it sit for about 15-20 minutes before I took my first sip.
On tap at Russian River Brewing in Santa Rosa.
"On tap at Bierria Paradiso in D.C. Bright orange color with a touch of copper. Foamy cream white head. Tons of sheets of lacing. Smell is very citrusy with some floral freshness. Lots of sweeter fruity malt flavors as well. Taste is similar. Orange dominated but there's more of a resin piney flavor that what I smelled. Underlying tropical sweetness the whole way through but it's quite bitter. Hops hit their high point about midway through but the finish is a bit weak. Sweetness comes through a bit more at the end. Body is a touch lighter than I might have hoped. This beer really has a nice balance of malts and hops and alcohol for a DIPA. Very drinkable. The mouthfeel and finish could have been a touch better. But overall, very enjoyable."
On tap at O Briens. 
"A - Clear golden color with a russet hue, small head, fair amount of lacing clings to the glass."
A light amber color body and nice fluffy head. Good lacing. 
"Pours a hazy golden amber with a slightly orange tint and a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of sticky lace behind as it slowly recedes. Nose is quite aromatic with strong scents of piney hops along with some fresh grapefruit. Taste is big-time hoppiness, but there is a fair amount of sweet malt to help keeps things somewhat in balance. Really deliciousthis ones a winner."
I think this beer is very drinkable considering the higher ABV
"Poured from growler into Sierra Nevada ""tulip"" glass, there is a slight haze, but the color is just what I want to see from a pale ale. Lovely lacy head that sticks. Smell is awesome, citrus/grapefruit, piney, resiny, slightly floral hops. I didn't speak for a few minutes after first taste. Wow. This beer is so well put together. All the flavors from the scent are here, the hop flavor is so juicy! The yeast works with the malt really well here too, the interplay is so beautiful. Only question is whether this is a 4.5 or a 5 in taste, tough call. Mouthfeel is good, slightly dry. Drinkability is exceptional for a beer this strong in taste and alcohol. My notes from last night say ""I could drink nothing but this all week."""
"Had this on tap at OBF06. Twice. Was going back for a full glass when the ""All out for today"" sign got put up. Noooo!"
"In the last month, I've experienced a lot of double IPA's, and to this date, the only one that stands out in my mind is Pliny The Elder. While most of the style seems one dimensional in its hopping, This Pliny had it all."
"Tried/enjoyed this over the course of 10 days in the Sierra and San Diego about 5 times.sheesh, I wish this was on tap in just about every craft beer stop in my neck of the woods! Anyway what can be added to the other reviews? Golden,glowing,shimmering olive oil amber. Light tan head, intense fine lacing. Grainy hop sniff. This is a beautifully crafted beer, hops are front, middle and rear. Grapefruit, pine tar, oily. I love this heady, artisinal creation! C'mon RR start shipping kegs of this to the east coast on a regular basis....Please?"
"What can I say that hasn't already been said. This beer is pure heaven. I've been fortunate enough to have this beer on many occasions. I don't care where I'm at, or what's on tap, if they have Pliny on tapI'm drinking it and drinking it first. This is the only beer to date that I've felt worthy of giving all 5's to and waited a while to finally review it. Beatification was a close second. Russian River has quickly became my favorite brewery due to consistently amazing beers. I look forward to many more years of drinking Vinnie's trend setting beers."
"I had the good fortune of having a pint of Pliny the Elder at the Grey Lodge in Northeast Philadelphia, far from it's land of origin. Despite the distance the beer tasted great."
This is based on notes from The Drafting Room and The Grey Lodge.
"Hazed gold with a faint orange hue. My pint arrived with a short cap of long lasting, cream coloured foam. Lacing was solid and rings formed at each sip. Very nice. The aroma was intense with sweet fruity, floral hops - very distinctive, kind of like fruity candies. Pine and grapefruit were also prominent and there was a light chalkiness or powderiness as well. Wow, this is quite a balanced monster. The bitterness is strong, but is kept in check by the malt until the finish where it lingers along with pine and grapefruit. It starts on the sweet side with a toasty maltiness. The hops (pine and grapefruit) really kick in after this, but stay balanced. There's also a pleasant fruit and floral quality to the hops that show up towards the end. Medium/full bodied, nearly chewy, with a luxurious, creamy texture. Alcohol wasn't apparent. It's scary how easy this goes down. Definitely a world class beer, highly recommended."
"The Elder has a perfectly clear, pale amber body with a thin white lid of foam. The aroma is green; somehow... oh, I know how, it's entirely composed of hops! Piney, resinous, citric, delicious hop aroma. The first sip is likewise a hop attack, very very strong with pine needle and somewhat grassy overtones (but in a good way, I'm not exactly sure how to describe it). It's supported by a crisp maltiness, very dry. Not full bodied; thin if anything, which only accentuates the hop character. Great, great beer. Consistently blocks my attempts to try other IPAs wherever it's on the menu."
Pours a perfect dark golden with just a wisp of a white head present. Decent lacing.
Poured super lacey to glass. Appeared dark gold with a great fresh hop nose. The taste on my palate just said ' damn it get a keg'
"Light golden color with a thick white head that left almost solid lacing down 3/4 of the glass. Very hoppy nose. Pine and grass come out strong. Flavor is heavy on the piney hops, also, and quite bitter. One heck of a hop bomb. Slick mouthfeel from all the hop oil. Bitter finish lasts and lasts. I had to drink two glasses of water just to taste my next beer. I wish I could get this more often."
On tap
"Fresh from brewery's taps, 3 weeks old but still fresh! Opens with a bang!"
"Not so tiny Pliny the Elder. Poured a mostly hazy orange hue with a good head and lacing to match. Superb nose with all the hops you can take. True to the California IPA aroma. A mostly piney aroma, but some grapefruit notes are in there too."
"This beer is usually on tap at O'Brien's, so I drink it quite a bit. I am a little surprised that I have not reviewed it yet. This beer is great."
"Wow, I love this brew!!! I first had it down Pizza Port way, in Carlsbad. Hard to find on tap in socal. Well blessed me...thay had it had Brewfest in Portland!!! Good nose, lightly sweet with a hint of the hops to come. The hint of pine and citrus meeting malt graces my mouth, good feel, not too heavy or full, and the swallow...now I get that slightly dry, crisp finish with...hmmm a bit of pine again. Wow, I love this beer!!!"
Tried on tap at the Oregon Brewers' Festival. Started with a 4 oz taster but went back for the full mug.
"Aquired from my sister Kristen in Cali. Made the trip 2 weeks after purchase, and was delivered in perfect condition. "
"What a treat! I was surprised to see this on tap. I've read about this, and was wondering if i would get a chance to taste this. Wonderful Hollinghead Deli in Orange apparaenlty has this or one of his nephews on tap regularly. Nice amber color, with good creamy head. Very hoppy/grassy, slightly flower aroma. Very sticky lace all the way down. Very balanced malt and hop flavor, but that could be the hop-head talking. Would love to have a 90 minute, ruination, Buzz Saw, and Pliny the elder taste off. But would need to take a nap afterwards. Love this beer"
"I strolled from Crown City Brewing down Pasadena's Raymond Avenue to Lucky Baldwin's. The bar in this place quickly revealed why it's so famous. Amongst the MANY taps, I saw 3 brews I had heard so much about, the most famous: Pliny the Elder. ""Make sure you try this one,"" the bar man said, ""when we get in a keg, it's gone in a day or two."""
Served on tap at Russian River Brewery in Santa Rosa.
"On tap at Toronado. Bright amber orange with a full white head. Head lasts well for an IPA. Body is medium to full with intermittent carbonation attacks. Aroma comes on complexly featuring an appealing amount of pineapple on top of a subtle pine/juniper base. By far, however, the pine is overshadowed by citrus juice, peaches, and grapefruit. The aroma could be described as candy like if it didnt trigger receptors in your brain that say: Warning Hop Blast Acomin! Feels tangy and acidic with a citrus medley blast of lime, lemon, grapefruit, and nectarine. Perfectly balanced (for the style) with a sweet malt base and only residual pine oils in the flavor. More delicate then expected. My tongue is not destroyed after two glasses. I guess that makes this one a drinker."
"Many thanks to Redwoodgeorge for this one. This review is of his unauthorized bottling earlier in 2006. Chill hazed, apricot body is topped by a sturdy, offwhite, one finger head that has exceptional retention and deposits a massive amount of patch lacing on the English pint glass. "
"On-tap at my local pub, this poured a deep gold with a 1/2inch of white head in a pint glass. The head dwindled and left some nice lace behind."
"On tap from a pint glass at Toronado, the Elder looks very elegant with a thick white blanket of head covering a glowing golden orange. Each drink leaves another level of lace clinging to the glass. The smell is pine, citrus, and loads of malty goodness. The taste is even better, walking a perfect tightrope between the strong malt flavor and the hop bitterness. With every drink, new flavors come out. At times it seems to have almost a candy sweentess, with some drinks caramel, and with other sips a doughy quality. It's almost chewy, with a tremendous mouthfeel. The drinkability is amazing. With an incredible selection at Toronado, I went back for a second Elder. This is one of the best beers I've ever tasted."
"I previously reviewd Pliny the Elder in December when I had it on tap at the Toronado on an earlier vacation. I am reviewing it again as I was lucky enough to get a growler of this fine brew from my local, The Flying Pig in Malvern, PA. "
Received from RedwoodGeorge as part of his recent Home Bottling Project. Thanks again George.
"Hello, my name is Kelsey and I am a hophead."
"Never thought a simple Indiana boy would get the chance to give this legend a sip, but here I am. Visiting friends in Santa Monica, enjoying the people, the culture, and the view, and drinking some great beer from the West coast."
"on tap at the source. santa rosa, baby"
"Appearance - This came out a hazy, beautiful orange in color with a big, hefty white head."
"As far as DIPAs go, this is second only to Pure Hoppiness in my book. Consumed at O'Briens on tap, but also had at the Liar's Club previously. This is one of the top DIPAs imo, most everything Russian River puts out is delicious and this is no exception. I won't waste your time with taste desciptions, just know that the scent is wonderful, taste is wonderful, everything is wonderful about this brew. Drink this early and often!"
"This is quite simply one of my favorite beers, regardless of if you call it Pline-E or PlynnE, it is definitely HopE. After tasting numerous times over the past year or so I recently was lucky enough to grab two more fresh pints at UJ's on the Manatawny (which seems to get a bunch of Pliny for some reason)."
"Draught tonight at Toronado in San Francisco, California. Light orange in color with attractive lacing, and I rarely say that anymore. Extremely hoppy with hints of dry, burned pine, juicy grapefruit along with big tangerine and orange flavors. I don't really like the strong dry hopped character. It seems like it needs more middle hops or something. The malt character could be more substancial as well."
"crystalline light amber. bubbles skip effortlessly through. hazy, barely existent foam touched surface. thick collection of chunky orbs hug the edges. lacing looks like flames erupting from the fierce elder brew. smells of fresh strawberry-infused grassy hops. fresh greens accompanied surprisingly by a candy-crisp roasted malt lathered with butter. expected the hop explosion of the century and was granted something far tamer. balance is key, grasshopper... just unexpected. overall, this beer has that 'sweaty armpit' ipa smell."
This is a good brew.
"Until recently I was never able to enjoy hops the way the typical BA hop-head does, but I have finally moved over to the.... light side. But even when I did not love the hops, I could easily see the brilliance that is Pliny the Elder. It pours out to a beautiful golden color with a normal amount of head and intricate lacing, and the smell is that of pure, unadulterated hops (among other herbal aromas I've heard mentioned). The taste, however, is what has always blown me away: intense hop flavor that rivals few and makes Russian River's super-hot pepperonis seem bland and tasteless. This is a beer to be enjoyed by smell, taste, sight, and really any sense that you can muster up."
"George's uauthorized home bottleing project Brewed Jan 14, 06 Bottled Jan 20, 06 Thanks George :)"
"I finally tasted Pliny. It's all true folks. This beer is a masterpiece of brewing. Clear glowing honey colored pour with a densely layeres eggshell white head that remains as a tight cap, leaving gentle rings of crusty lace."
"Pliny the Elder pours into my tulip glass a lovely crystal peachy orange color with a nice half inch of creamy white head that leaves spotty lacing all the way around the glass. Great clarity! As the glass reaches my nose an instant smile graces my face. Explosive, enchanting hop nose with notes of citrus, tropical fruit, pine resin and grapefruit. A ribbon of sweet caramelly malt stands guard behind the wall of hops. As I sniff I imagine picking a fresh, bright green hop cone and rubbing it between my fingers as I inhale deeply. Quite simply an amazing hoppy nectar rivaling any I have had before. "
"Bottle hand filled off a 5 gallon keg using counter pressure filler into a 22 oz bottle; this is a 11 oz sample. Highest care was taken in getting this brew out for folks to try. It pours a light golden color with a finger of white head that falls to a healthy coat over top that form a solid barrier to the liquid. Clarity is very good, but not pristine. Good looker. Nose is great. Candied grapefruit and oranges in a very sweet caramel glaze. Balance is fantastic. The hops are juicy and fruity and the malts are sweet, but not cloying. Nice. Flavor is nice as well. Very sweet in both hop and malt. Its right on with the aroma having candied orange and grapefruit and even sweet apircot flavors. After swallowing, there is a light peppery spice from the hop that moves right into a moderate bitterness that hangs on, letting me know its there, but its very smooth and not biting. Feel is thick with a light to moderate carbonation. The carbonation breaks up the fullness, making it more than highly drinkable. This beer is everthing I hoped it would be. No hint of the alcohol at all, very clean bitter on the finish, very juicy flavors, very nice mouthfeel. This beer is a keeper. If this is any indication to what it is like to have this one off tap, then fly me to California because I'm sold on Russian River. Fantastic."
"Pours an amber color with a medium head that falls slowly and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is WOW. Hops then some hops. But there is an underlying sweetness that has a caramel character. Smells very nice. The flavor is surprisingly balanced. Lots of hop flavors, but also there is plenty of malt sweetness and caramel flavor. I'm the opposite of a hop head, but this beer tastes great to me. The flavor hops aren't over the top like most I2PA's. It just blends and adds the bitterness at the end. Very nice beer. The body is moderate and the drinkability is great for 8%."
Sampled thanks to RedwoodGeorge and his most Excellent trade!
"Sampled from the unofficially bottled from a 5 gallon keg into 22 oz. bombers by BA RedwoodGeorge, the beer came out well carbonated, and free of oxidation, thanks to the counterpressure filler used during bottling. The body was clear pale in color, and the head was frothy and stable. The aroma was a milder version of the grapefruit and pine hops than the nephew beer. The hop flavor leaped off the taste buds with a citric and salty vigor. The malt was primarily a supporting player here, with a clean unobtrusive semi-sweet character. This was more of a spicy rather than bitter hop profile, which suited me just fine. The mouthfeel was medium and slick, with hops fading off rather than sticking around as a teeth coating film. This beer was very easy to drink, with no hint whatsoever of the 8% ABV. Different than Pliny the Younger in several ways (not quite as sweet, nor as aromatic), but I can still see the family resemblance."
"Had this on-tap at Pizza Port San Clemente. Appearance was the usual golden IPA color, with a touch of brown. 1/2"" head or so. Smell was of some refreshing, citrusy hops. Not much else, but this is an IPA - great smell for the style. Taste was amazing. One of the most perfectly balanced Double IPAs in my opinion. Nice touch of hops in the beginning, followed immediately by a lighter-bodied maltiness. This malt is not heavy at all (perfect for an IPA), but gives a nice balance and contrast to the hops that are to come. The malt here seems to be used more as a way to anchor the hops. The hops then take over at the end, and are very refreshing and citrusy. They linger a nice long while, perfect with the pizza being consumed at the same time. All in all, a perfect balance of hops and malt - something not found in many double IPAs. Mouthfeel is exceptional on this, exactly how I think IPAs should be - lighter-bodied (medium-bodied for an IPA) but full of flavor. Drinkability is perfect on this. So much flavor, and so tasty, but not too filling. I could drink way too many of these. Maybe it's good they don't bottle this one..."
"It is about time that I review Pliny the Elder, having had it on tap a number of times in the last six months. It is one of my favorite beers. It pours a beautiful hazy golden color with a nice head with plenty of head retention. The overwhelming aroma is of hops as is the taste. There is also a balancing sweet smoothness that really comes out at the end. This is a full-bodied brew with a satisfyingly thick mouthfeel. It is a beer that I seek out, and I'm always left wanting more."
Had on tap at Flannigans Boathouse in Conshahocken(sp?) PA.
"I had this on tap at Firewaters in Glen Mills, it had a small white head and a deep amber with orange hues. The smell was amazing; it had all of the hop flavors, piney, grapefruit, and some floral scents. I can almost feel the oils coating my nose. "
"Ive had the good fortune of having this several times - most recently, on-tap at the Toronado, San Francisco."
I had this on tap at O Brien's in San Diego.
I was able to try this recently when a friend from work was able to acquire a 1/2 barrel for his homebrewing Christmas party. He was able to bottle a sample for me to try. I was weary as I couldn't imagine it could live up to the hype. I was wrong. It poured light amber/gold with a pleasant white head. Aroma of pine and citrus. The body of the beer was hard to find since it was hiding behind the hops. All I could think of as I drank it was how much I like hops. Crisp clean finish. Drinkability was limited by the volume I had. If could see drinking more than one of these in a sitting but not much more than 3.
"A beautiful, golden gold. This is a color that looks great in your glass. Not a yellow gold but one going a bit toward amber. The head was smaller than I would have liked but I'll attribute that more to the pourer at the Hopyard in San Ramon (a great place to get a beer, especially when you find Pliny the Elder on tap). But the white foam was thick and glittery with small bubbles. No lacing."
"First of all, what a cool lookin' growler, no? "
"Pint for $4 smackers at the Grey Lodge Pub. Pours a rich cloudy bright orange glowing hue topped off with a 1/2"" thick spumescent craggy khaki head cap leaving drippy lace in the glass."
It came to me an orangey amber with a floating haze about it. A finger a very dense white head soon dropped to a frothy film. Lacing curlicued amply around the inside of the glass.
Super cool wedding gift from Watermelonman! THANKS BRO!
"Clear light gold pour, the head is white and big. Astonishing woody flavours cover the leafy and herbal hops that feel like a perfume. The malt base is potently biscuity and grainy/bready. The aromatic hops seem underwhelmed by the bitterness ones that hide one of the biggest punch Ive yet to feel, but fool is the one who thinks the malt is not there to support it as this has plenty of toasted and cereal maltiness, medium bodied, yet with airy and foamy carbonation."
"This beer has a soft orange-color to it with an off-white head that has incredible lasting ability. The lacing left behind on my pint glass looked like a painting, it was that intricate. The smell is mostly of citrus, hops, and dried fruit. The taste is typical for the style...a complex merging of malt, hop induced bitterness, followed by a dry, almost astringent taste. Overall, I think this is an excellent ale with distinct character and texture. I had to deduct points for the aftertaste because the bready texture didn't sit well in the back of my throat. The aftertaste does not really dissipates, it simply changes over time."
"Had this on-tap at Toronado's in San Francisco. Presented in a pint glass, orange color with large sticky white head."
Got a pint at OB's
"Whoa. This is one of those beers that smacks - no, whips- you in the face with a hop vine! I received a growler of this lovely beer from TheLongBeachBum, and was quite excited to have a Real West Coast Hop Bomb while on the East Coast. It almost doesn't feel right, but I think I can deal with it.. "
"On draft at RFD in Washington, DC. Served in a shaker-style pint glass."
"Another offering I enjoyed at Russian River Brewing Co in Santa Rosa. This beer pored a bright copper to amber with a thick white head, that left a beautiful lace on the side of the glass. Overwhelming citrus grapefruit aroma. It has grapefruit rind, a little orange, grass and a bit of pine. Just a hint of caramel in the aroma on the finish. The flavor has loads of hop. Grapefruit, orange, pine, grass, hay, and every other descriptive term you can have for hops. There is a bit of caramel sweetness on the finish. The bitterness is ever-present, but not dominating. It has a nice, rich mouth feel, and is surprisingly drinkable. Awesome beer."
"Beautiful rich golden orange color and a solid white head, smells like thistle and fresh-cut grass, and kept smelling that way all the way down the bottle. And my nose doesn't work."
"I tried this double IPA on tap at the Russian River Brewery, and it was a focal point of my trip out to California. Needless to say I was not disappointed! The serving was in a standard pint glass, which sort of surprised me; I was expecting a 10 oz. pour. The nose of the beer was incredibly floral, which gave a good indication of the hefty hop presence. [Being a hop-head I was very happy with the level of hops included in this beer] The mouthfeel was somewhat standard compared to other double IPAs I've tried, but the taste lasted just long enough to entice another sip. I would definitely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and would recommend it highly to anyone who can find it. My only problem with this beer is that it is very difficult to get on the west coast. Russian River if you are reading this, please bottle the Pliny series, and distribute to the East Coast."
"Appearance: Served in a standard pint glass at O'Brien's in San Diego. The beer is a golden orange color with a ringed white head, lively carbonation, and good sticky lacing."
I can't believe I still haven't reviewed this masterpiece - it must be that I'm always so distracted by the experience that I forget to record it...
"Straw to amber colour with much less of head than the same brewer's IPA. It has a much more potent citrus smell (think grapefruit mixed with sour apple candy). Very sweet as the candy flavour dominates....this one should definitely be kept away from small children! Rather flatter than the IPA, but disturbingly drinkable given its strength."
Stopped by the Russian River Brewery a couple of times during my most recent sojourn back home to Northern California.
whoaaa ....even a hophead would be proud and in awwee of this baby!! Not sure what type of hops they use but they are of the utmost quality. Fruity taste in the middle but quickly squashed by the hop bitter aftertaste. finely crafted brew for sure. dry but not annoying. Had this served in a pounder glass at Naja's (redondo beach) from the hand pump as a starter....not the best choice for a starter but this beer would compliment a meal better than as the first beer of the day. 
I had this on tap at Union Jack's on the Manatawny. This was served in a snifter. (Concentrates the smells better)
"I have savored this impeccable brew many times in the past, most notably being at the Korbel RR tap room, it's birthplace, and at the new RRBC site in Santa Rosa CA, with Vinnie Cilurzo himself serving it up. But most recently it was IMO 'best-of-show' at the 10th Annual Mammoth Bluespalooza at Mammoth Mountain CA. Up against 49 other outstanding, worthy competitors, Pliny once again showed how it has raised the bar for all other DIPA's to try and reach. Rich gold in color, clear yet translucent, almost looks like it would pour like honey. The rich smell of pine sap and grapefruit permeates from the glass immediately. Its almost like a wicked citrus fruit juice, except its 8.0%ABV is inescapable. It was the only tap that the other pourers were routinely sneaking off too to sneak a taste. A truly magical representation of the DIPA breed with a drinkability unequaled by any other. Now, dont get me started on Pliny the Younger . . ."
From notes:
"Poured a hazy golden color with a small, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. arma of floral hops, sweet tangerine, and caramel malts. Taste of sweet, chewy caramel, toffee malts, grapefruit, with a very bitter hop finish, and alcohol as well."
"Easily the best beer of my entire trip. Pours a bright golden orange body with a thick white head. Wonderful aroma of pine, citrus, fruit and malt. Very earthy and leafy. I was expecting to be blown away by the hop profile, but I was pleasantly surprised at the balance that this beer has. Great malt backbone, but the hops really define this beer. This is truly bliss in a glass. I will be back for more."
"I'm always skeptical of these seemingly ""trendy"" brews. CAH had this on-tap this past week (probably gone by now). Hoo-Yah!"
"Had this beer at ABF, one of the most amazing beers ever had. Very smooth and full of flavor. They really out did themselves this time. Usually a heavier beer man but this beer was undescribable. Waiting for Piny the Younger. Hopefully soon to be available in Massachusetts."
"Had on tap at Mugs in Brooklyn, $5/pint...unbeatable! And it was tapped only an hour or two before we got to the bar. On to the beer: Burnished gold in color, I thought the aroma was very nice, it came across as nicely blended and balanced. Tastewise, I appreciated the fact that the alcohol kept itself hidden. I also enjoyed the grassy hop taste of this one. Very smooth and easy to drink, I kept the drinkability at 4 due to the alcohol."
Sweet Jesus this is good beer.
"On tap at the American Beer Festival, Boston, MA, 2005..."
"I was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap in PA. My pint had a smooth orangeyellow color with a neat white head of tiny foam displaying excellent retention. The smell is of the hops, by the hops, and for the hops. It's an amazingly pungent green smell, absolutely piney, with strong bursts of grapefruit and lemon jucie made into a smoothie with spruce boughs. Wow. Hophead's dream. The taste is wonderful as well. The sharp hoppiness recedes on first sip and a light to medium malt base gives a slight sweetness before a rush of bitterness pours out in the finish. Sharp, nearly painful hop-bite in the aftertaste, but the blend is so floral, so raw and green and so sassy that it begs for more. I really enjoyed this beer. Drinkability might finally die when saplings start to grow from your palette, but I can't knock it too much on that fact. The most refined DIPA I've had, but if you strip something down this much and leave only the best, where else can you go from there? I'm sold on Rusian River and can't wait to try more from them."
"Piny delivers a clear, golden-orange body beneath a massive head of white froth that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace at the outset of the pint. "
Tasted at Father's Office in Santa Monica.
Appears a light orange yellow with a small white head and scattered lacing.
quite simply this is the best ipa i've ever had. This beer lives up the hype and more. Had this on tap last night on my first visit to the toronado (great place) 
Pours a clear apple juice color with a three inch head and lacing also some carb action.
"I return from an extended absence older, mayber wiser, but definitely enriched by my crossing of this beer path. A sophisticated IPA- very strong, floral, with a bitter edge but not enough to put you over. Color a gold sunset amber- wonderful head with an aroma of wild windswept flowered prairies. I wax a bit here but this beer will wake your a-- up! I had no expectations and the pints opened my eyes to a beer that can hold a candle to my San Diego stonewarts- not as balanced as my masalade mama- but still very enjoyable,especially paired with the panfried trout supper. Aroma faintly of spring hynacith- but has the staying power of strong praire grass. Flavor grabs you in a hops vice, more a hops shroud. Enough of a balance to warm and season the palate through and beyond the initial sips. A great beer that deserves its elder designation. Try to capture some if you can and savor-Ok"
"Dark golden with a nice 1/4"" head of pure white foam. Aromas are intense. Floral, citrus, spice, and more. HOPS! and some biscuity malts and some weed-like aromas as well. The taste is hoppy and bitter with a very deep flavor complexity within the confines of the citrus, flower, and other hop induced flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, drinkability is up there. A killer DIPA. I like this brewery very much."
Served on tap in a pint glass at RFD's
"Not quite as over the top as I was expecting, but this one did not dissapoint. The beer was a golden color with a great head that was very thick and fluffy. The smell was very floral and full of citrus. The taste was extremly balanced and went down very smoothe. Flavors of sweet malt and spicey hops mixed perfectly to create a true joy to drink. One of the best DIPA's I've had."
"Oh damn, this was good. Had on draft at the Toronado in SF during Big Beer Month. A creamy head topped this golden beer. Aroma is sweet, and almost fruity. This is a hop monster, but totally drinkable and well balanced. I need more Russian River beer!"
"Straight from the keg, this baby arrives with a medium copper body topped off with a single finger of dirty white, dense, and rocky foam. Clarity is excellent for a Double IPA with superb lacing on a beer-clean liter mug. "
"This will be a bare bones review, based on brief jottings made in the noisy environs of O'Brien's pub, in the company of others, but tingling with the excitement of tasting this much anticipated ale, trying my best to capture the experience. When they bottle this nectar, I'll attempt again to encapsulate it's wonder."
Tasted at the Strong Beer Festival at Pizza Port in Oceanside/Carlsbad. One of the most memorable beers from a litst of many.
"Light gold body, rich looks cash in. Heavy, synthetic, snowwhite head sets in. Thick lacing. Nose reeks of tropical fruits -- mango -- grows a hop edge and some alcohol steps in eventually. "
"11/12/04- Sampled at the Toronado in San Francisco, CA"
Presentation: Sampled on draft at Najas in Redondo Beach during a recent trip here on a hot and sunny Saturday afternoon.
"Tap, Toronado, San Fransisco. Full on Americn hops in both aroma and flavour. Massive grapefruit pine, and heavy bittrness. Despite being massively hopped this manages to maintain some balance and softness around the edges. A good beer. Lots of flavour."
"This is my first review in months, but I need to rave about this near perfect double IPA. I tried it for the first time at O'Brien's Pub last winter, but I was able to visit the Russian River Brewery in Santa Rosa this summer. Pliny is silk smooth with a great hop finish (25% simcoe hops). It reminded me a bit of Alpine's Exponential Hoppiness, which is one of my favorites. In leaving the brewery, I purchased a growler and kept it refrigerated for three days before catching a plane back to Southern California. It held up nicely on the plane trip and was a big hit back home (Gone in minutes!)."
Sampled on tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad.
Sampled at O'Briens in a pint glass.
Draught @ OBriens San Diego
"When I saw this on-tap at the Carlsbad, CA Pizza Port I had to do a quick double-take and get a pint, fast. In light of my relatively recent love of IPA's and Double IPA's, I felt I shouldn't squander the opportunity."
"I was expecting a much hoppier taste and aroma. Maybe the keg was near the bottom, I don't really know. Despite this ""surprise"" I found this a very drinkable beer. At over 9% abv it really went down easy. The beer was a light amber, head was full and left nice lace. At least my sample lacked the hop aroma, taste was very smooth and and did not feel like 100 IBU's. A very interesting beer that garnered a nice rating despite my surprise and questioning of it's being in top form. I tried this again at the pub and I will say wow! A much better sample, hops hops and more palate grabbing hops. Loved it."
"This sat as a bright orange and gold color without much head, and it didn't leave too much lace either. It looks pretty good."
I had this on draught at Stone's 7th anniversary party. 
"12oz can from the brewery. Pours a murky dirty brown color with sediment floating around and a thin layer of head. No lacing. Sweet aroma of pineapple, pink grapefruit, lemon, pine, orange and starbursts. The taste is pineapple and grapefruit followed by some floral hops and some slightly sweet fruits near the end. Piney, herbal finish with a bit more grapefruit and some dark bread and honey. Tastes about as boozey as expected. Medium to heavy body with low carbonation and an oily mouthfeel. Worth seeking out."
Well craft and easy drinking for the strong abv. Prefer Double.
A-Pours a very nice orange amber color with a slight head and lacing
Murky orange with two fingers of antique white head that has decent retention and leaves thick webbed lacing.
"The beer pours a some what hazy yellow with a big white fluffy head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of citrus, lemon, dank herbs, and orange peel. It tastes of lemon, citrus, orange peel, dank herbs, with a bitter bite. The feel is full. A great IPA from Lawson’s."
Opaque orange appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a nice citrus with little hoppyness. Taste is a mild citrus with a little hops and smooth.
Poured from a 12 oz can into a tulip glass.
"01/2017 - this is a superb triple IPA, but it's not Notorious level. It's surprisingly clean and refreshing for what it is. There's barely any heat present throughout the ale. So much citrus, but it's full of pineapple, guava, & a wee bit of coconut; its juicy like its NE counterparts, but significantly more hoppy; bitter, dry finish."
"2018 release. On tap at Meridian Pint for pre-SAVOR. The anniversary party was about a month ago, so I’m guessing the keg is about a month old."
"this is as good as they say it is. i have been seeking it out for years, and finally i got lucky enough to have my boy back east ship one out fresh, and it travelled just fine, what a beer this is! there is a definite cloudiness to this, pale and muted in luster, no visible chunks or anything, but its east coast before that was cool. good head and creamy lace as i drink it down. the aroma is next level, you would swear there is navel oranges or tangerines in here, such a sunny citrus profile to these hops, i dont know which varietals are in here, but if its something thats been around awhile like citra i will be even more impressed because nobody else can get this kind of smell and taste from it. subtle white grape, vanilla bean, new oak, lots of nuance for an ipa type, its unreal and i salivate over it for awhile before i start sipping. first thing that hits me is a huge burst of citrus right in the middle of it, oranges and cream, serious melted creamsicle in the glass, almost sweet for a moment but its oily hops, why can more breweries not do with hops what this beer does? it hits me so hard, like its superiority to what just about everyone else is doing in the style is so obvious after just one sip. i also cant believe how well hidden the alcohol is, this drinks not boozy at all, and while its substantial and complex for sure, its not slow or heavy. juicy like few others, starchy on the malt side but dry, and with enough carbonation to keep this feeling fresh and active. as good as it gets in the style for me, lucky to have well connected friends! what a treat this is!"
On tap into a snifter. A very hazy golden color with a thick white head. Nice lacing. Dank pineapple and citrus on the nose. The taste was close with a resinous pineapple and citrus quality and a dry bready malt presence. Soft bitterness that built to the finish and was prominent. ABV well hidden. Overall a fantastic beer.
"Opaque dark orange, almost brown, with a large beige foam that settles to a central souffle-like lump leaving tons of coral like lace all over the glass."
Perfect NEIPA with a few knocks:
"L - sunset orange color, murky body, a finger of white head"
So good it makes me want to stop trying to brew
"Tasted from bottle. Pours an awesome cloudy orange with thick bright white head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is citrus and tropical fruit. Incredibly complex and well balanced flavor for an IPA. Flavors of mango, orange, papaya, passion fruit, caramel, slight pine and resin. Hides ABV very well and quite crushable. Incredible imperial IPA."
"Lawsons will always be third fiddle to Alchemist and HF for me when it comes to the Vermont breweries, but that doesn't keep this from being outstanding. It lacks the hop bite that Vermont IPA hunters are used to, but it's gorgeously bottled and looks lovely when poured (rusty color with thick head and beautiful lacing)."
This was my first ever triple IPA. This one took a while to get and I remember not being disappointed
"Gentle pour into a Lawson's snifter produced a clear apricot beer with a half finger of rocky white head and several bubble streams. The head slowly disappated and left chunky lacing. The aroma is juicy tropical fruits, pine needles, bready malts, and a slight booziness. Taste is tropical fruit juice, caramel, bready malts, and faint booze on the backend. It's incredibly balanced! Mouthfeel is heavy and juicy. Overall this is more than worthy of a 100 rating, and it's worth triple the festival release fee. One of the best beers I've ever had regardless of style."
"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a hazy almost burnt orange color with a one finger white head that dissipated immediately. Lacing spider webbed and became spotty. The smell started off with sweet onion, subtle sweet grassy, sticky citrus leads into a light grapefruit portion blending wonderfully. Light mango and resinous pine slides in underneath. The taste was more bitter than sweet, but the sweetness does come out in the warming of the beer. Dry floral quality adds to the quality of this beer. Light citrus smooth aftertaste runs into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with more of a sipping quality to it. Carbonation runs at a nice pace along my tongue allowing the bitterness to hit just all around really spectacular. Overall, if this is a DIPA, well, you know damn right it is! Wow, just plain wow!"
"Triple IPAs can be too much of a good thing. Too dank, too rich, too boozey...too much. This is not like that. I found this to be a big beer with big aromas and flavor. Pours a orangey-gold and as you pour...the aromas hit you. Mango, pineapple, tropical for sure. These smells carry over in the taste, but like all great beers its not overwhelming in any one sense. The taste finishes with a hoppy bitterness that you would expect in an any good IPA. The flavors last and our memorable. Served cold, you don't notice the booze (or least I didn't). For Hop Heads, this will not disappoint. Cheers!"
"22 oz. bottle from Lawson's 9th Anniversary Sale 4/8/17 poured into Lawson's tulip glass, but of course."
I have been looking for this beer for months now.
A: Glowing orange with a white foam
Boozy and citrusy. More tropical notes as it warms or as it coats the tongue. Really enjoy this. Beautiful color. Iconic bottle. Truly steps beyond Sip. Love it.
"Best beer I've ever had. It's that simple. Smooth and full like a double, but drinks like a single. A hint of a bitter finish that finishes with a warm, slow touch."
5
Dec 22 release. Had on Dec 29th. Reviewing from my notes.
As good as advertised
Fresh batch drank on 1/7/2017
22oz bottle poured into a Teku.
Anticipation is real here as ive been waiting quite some time to try this highly regarded IPA.
Eh wasn't to impressed
OMG!!!!!
"wow, very awesome beer. Tasted great, Lawson's does the best with their IPA's. This one was a pleasure to have tasted strong but for a triple it was really good."
Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Lawson's tulip glass. Acquired in a trade. Most recent batch.
"Pours a darker orange color with a thick whit head that retains beautifully. Thick lacing on the glass. Smells of pine, tropical fruit. Tastes reflect the same, great mix of pine and tropical flavor. Some of the booze comes through but not overwhelming, really solid job hiding it at 10.5%. Mouthfeel is consistent with the other Lawson's big guns - smooth, resiny, some stickiness. Finally got to see what all the hype was about and I enjoyed it immensely"
"From bottle. Man what a head. Amazing staying power also. Great pacing. Slightly cloudy orange. Just based on head for the abv would go 5.25 if I could. Much more pine on the nose than I expected. A nice balance of malt and some fruit. Taste is fruitier. Sweet, a little dank, juicy very good. Only knock is the clear booze in the back. Not overwhelming by any means, but clearly there. Even for a triple I like this to be hidden more. Great feel. Good carbonation, some tang, some sticky sweet. Very good beer."
"A slightly hazy orange color, but clear compare to most NE IPAs. The nose is a resin-y, mango-y bitter punch. The taste is very consistent with the nose, with more if the hops bitterness and some earthiness on the back end. The feel is very full and lasting. Overall and wonderfully made beer with tons of complexity that is full and consistent, but not quite my flavor profile."
Received in a trade from an awesome BA ryanlefebvre93
"The Triple Sunshine by Lawson's is definitely one the best beers I've ever tasted. Although it has similar features to the regular Sip of Sunshine, the overall taste just blows you away! Best way to describe it is a tropical vacation in your mouth. Seek this one out for sure, cheers!"
L - now in cans! Never thought I'd get a chance to try this outside of a beer fest. Pours an amber haze reminiscent of dying embers. Bone white head with legs for days. 
"Kind of harsh in taste and smell at first, but other than that it is a much more intense and flavorful version of Sip of Sunshine."
"Tasty for a lawsons with a big flavor , great in a tulip glass . Great on draft"
Like Double Sunshine but even better.
"This beer is very similar to Sip of Sunshine, but a more robust version. Hops are even more pronounced. Alcohol is well hidden which could make this dangerous in quantity. Excellent beer. As far as high octane IPAs go, In my opinion, you cannot get much better than this. Great job Lawson's. I wish you would sell this in Massachusetts."
Thanks to fellow BA'er brentlepping for the share. I had a decent buzz but this one still SHINED though.
"Appearance - Triple Sunshine comes in along the darker end of the color spectrum, and somewhat fittingly, has the starburst color akin to a sunset. A disjointed, rocky head fights to cling to the sides of the glass but easily pulls away without much struggle. It still lasts a while, though. The body is mostly clear, with small amounts of carbonation in the glass."
Tasting at the ACBF.
On tap at The American Craft Beer Fest Yesterday. 
Nowhere near as good as Double Sunshine.
Really great but I have had better...including Double sunshine
Simply amazing. Super creamy. So much fruit. Aroma is like nothing I've ever experienced
"A yellowlab friend offered this one night and WOW it was good. Be careful when consuming this one, it will sneak up on you but is worth it."
"What a treat this one was. Mango, oranges and peaches fill the flavor. Super smooth and ultra creamy with just the right does of bitterness. So easy to drink, i could have drank this all night. Do everything you can to get a bottle of this."
Bottle shared by Barry.
I usually don't go this in depth but for the triple I feel I need to. Like most I went into drinking this beer with expectations out of this world. I drank it from the bottle as I do most bombers unless im sharing. . . which I wasn't! 
"Probably the best triple IPA I've had. Thick, sticky, sweet malt backbone with a good chunk of resinous and tropical fruity hops. The booze is nicely balanced for a triple. Has a weighty, syrupy feel and a lingering finish. As good as it was, I think I can safely say that I prefer IPA/DIPA style-wise."
"Triple Sunshine is a boozier, maltier, sweeter version of Double Sunshine. Top tier batches of this brew will make you rethink the concept of what a TIPA can offer to the palate."
Just about as good of an IPA as any of the greats out there. Very well balanced for a 10.5%-er.
"L: pale amber, big fluffy head that sticks to the glass and dissipates into a thin layer"
This was one of the top 5 IPAs I have had. Wonderful juicy looking beer with wonderful head retention. Smells of a tropical fruit cornucopia and the taste did not disappoint. It has a nice malt backbone but the juicy taste of the beer blends wonderfully with the malt flavor. Awesome freakin beer. I can find nothing wrong with it.
"Top notch TIPA. Mild sweetness. Nice balance of pine, citrus, and tropical flavors. Dangerously drinkable."
"The aroma bursts of pungent mango, papaya, peach, oranges, along with a slight green leafiness and bready sweetness."
bomber into goblet glass. no packaged on date.
Best dipa/tripa I've ever had. Like magica in a glass. Thank you @ilovelampandbeer for the generosity. 
Best beer ive had in a week or so...
Tops out on all categories for me
"While my favorite Lawson's product remains Double Sunshine, this one is right up there. Great hop aromas and perfect mouthfeel. Not too thin and not too heavy. Had it at the 7th Anniversary bottle sale."
"Had a couple of full draws at the Beer Lovers Ball, but this review is for the bottled version."
"Bottle, pour is yellow with medium head. Aroma is dank, grass, and citrus. Taste is intense, lots of bitter and fruit, a bit too much for me though.."
"Holy crap. Obtained at Lawson's 7th Anniversary market. Poured into a Lawson's tulip, HUGE tropical aromas as soon as I opened the bottle. "
"Not quite as dry as pliny nor as citrusy as heady. However, still a great IPA"
One of the best beers I ever had. Anywhere and anytime. I hope it's made again. 
"the nose was like capri sun!!!!!! hides the alchohol content very well, amazing mouth feel with great smoothness"
"Ok, so this beer is special to me, another top 10 beer for me... I was one of the first humans on the planet to sample this beer and it did NOT disappoint... This is other worldly and a must try if Lawson's ever bottles it again."
"Like sinking your teeth into the perfect blend of tropical and citrus fruit is what Lawson's Finest Triple Sunshine delivers. Its seamless medley has crawled straight out of a can of Hawaiian Punch, wrapped itself around a ten-plus percent core and seeps deeply into the tastebuds for an unabashed assault upon the palate."
"When, in the course of human events, your favorite brewer makes a beer that is just stupid-good—and historically important, in the context of an already rich and well-documented history—and, by chance, you have volunteered to session an entire 22oz bottle of this magical blend of barley, hops and yeast... well, sometimes the best thing you can do is just shut up about it."
Triple Sunshine
"Tried 3 oz sampler at the 2014 VT brewers festival. As you would expect from a lawsons IPA the beer is bright and hazy. Aroma is super intense with mountains of hop funk. Very dank and citrusy. The mouthfeel is comparable to the thickest of oatmeal stouts, yet it drinks incredibly easy. The 10.5% abv is almost invisible. Hops linger long, long after the sip is gone. Based on conversations with others at the 'fest, a variety of fruit flavors come through depending on your taste buds. I got lots of pineapple, mango, orange and lime. This beer is worth the hype, now if I could only try more than 3 ounces..."
"For this particular style, Lawson’s left a dent/gap: "
I'm going back and reviewing some of my favorite beers I've had since my previous ratings now mean nothing. Double Sunshine is top 3 beer I've ever had in my life.
Tasted this at brewfest 2014. A nice beer that I wouldnt mind trying again as beerfest only gives you 4 oz glasses na the lines are kind of long at the Lawsons section. Still happy to have tried it early as the keg got kicked rather fast and the 4oz. I tasted was the only 4 oz. available to me. Very nice kick. Fruity but not overpowering. Very different from the Sip of Sunshine by Lawsons.
A- Murky golden honey with minimal cloud white lacing. Medium legs on the lacing when swirled around. 
"A-Pours a cloudy, dark orange juice hue. Head is pretty thick. He head keeps growing and settles into about an inch and a half of thick, white fluff. Rather light on the lace."
"Reviewing the Triple Sunshine from Lawson's Finest Liquids out of Warren, Vermont. "
650 mL bottle poured into a snifter.
650ml bottle poured into a Lawson's snifter 6/8/2014.
Poured into 2 scholarly tasting glasses and split with my brother
"WOW! I can smell this from across the room and it smells amazing. Yup, instant smile inducing. I really don't know how you can get this much flavor into an IPA without it becoming too heavy. This is light and crisp with a ton of tropical fruit flavors and almost no bitterness. Basically hop juice. The malt base is nothing like it should be for a 10.5% beer. It's hard to describe, but it has that typical VT malt base that is light and airy. It tasted very similar to Ephraim from Hill but ramped up in the flavor department. Insane."
"2014- It was unreal. Hadn't had many IPAs at this time, but I knew this was special."
1 of 900 bottles produced for the May 2014 Farmers Market.
"I LOVE Double Sunshine, lets get that out of the way now. "
Bottle shared by Lunch. Thanks Paul!
My Man LarsonStyle coming through big hooking it up with this bottle. 
I really didn't expect any less than perfect from Lawson's Triple Sunshine.
"Aroma- Big and sweet tropical fruit smell, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, mango, peaches. Slightly boozy smell. Very Nice"
Bottle to Lawson's Willie Belcher
"This is an amazing beer. Hazy orange with a slowly dissipating white head and nice lace. The aroma is out of this world...tons of tropical and citrus fruit - pineapple, mango, orange, tangerine. The taste is creamy tropical fruit backed by a perfectly balanced soft bitterness. A full body, silky mouth with no hint of the high ABV. This is as good as a beer can be."
"Poured from the cask, tapped by Sean Lawson at 8:00 AM at Mad Taco."
"L: Bright, hazy gold with a nice white head and some good lacing. Great head retention for the style"
22 oz bottle served in a Lawson's Willi.
"Had a pint of this poured from the draft tap at Agava on East Hill, Ithaca, NY. Holy smokes! What a delicious brew! Lovely slightly turbid lupulin particulate opacity, good head retention, superior mouthfeel. Bittered enough though featuring floral, fruity, complex hop aromatics. Bartender made sure to note that this great ale was not included in the Happy Hour discounts, but who could complain as long as it still poured for us? Definitely a great IPA! And brewed just 265 miles from here!"
Can dated 10/5:
This is significantly overrated in my opinion. It smells nice and all but is not as pleasurable to drink as similar beers this highly ranked. The first sip is nice but flavors get muddled and it can't decide if it's going to end crisp or fruity hazy lingering and that holds it back. 
"Second attempt at trying to understand all the attention and praise being paid to this beer... and it has underwhelmed me yet again. It smells better than it tastes, very true to fresh lupulin like when u crack open a hop bud... but not that strongly. Its more bitter than i remembered but there isnt the fruitiness others rave about. Its light for an 8% but its light in flavor too! My Cans are fresh... I dont know, folks, to me this is perhaps the most overrated beer in existence today. I. Dont. Get. It. And the price point?!! This is the product of pure hype."
Best beer I have had. Would love suggestions for similar beers.
"This is a super solid DIPA. The smell is bursting with dank sticky hops, over ripe fruits, and a hint of honey sweetness. The taste is balanced leaning towards hoppy with firm bitterness. This is what a DIPA should really be. yb"
"Fresh batch arrived at work. I cannot read the canning date, but I know this can is pretty fresh. "
Not understanding the hype around this one. Not much flavor to me. Just hoppy and lots of alcohol taste.
"06/2014 - superb pine, floral, pineapple aromas; potent, sweet, kind of cloying, more pine on the palate; a touch bitter, fruity, clean finish. Not to be confused with a NEIPA, this is different than what's popular here."
"Look - poured from a 16 oz can into an IPA glass. Packaged on 8/23/18. Beer is a beautiful golden color and mostly transparent. Two finger head, with nice lacing, though it does dissipate after a few minutes."
"So far SOS is the cream of the crop for me. Hoppy and citrus. Clean, somewhat dry finish without the tannic finish of some others."
A good IPA abut doesn’t win in a blind taste test. Bought based on an in-store recommendation. Found it to be a little too over the top on the malt side of things. Worth the try. 4 pack canned from Total in Norwalk CT.
"Lawson's Finest Liquids ""Sip Of Sunshine"""
"Overall solid IPA, but frankly wasn't impressed post all the hype. This beer has become pretty widely available, and I would hold out for Treehouse which I think offers much more complexity."
This is a delicious beer.
Canned on 8/8/18
"Poured into a pint glass from a 16 oz. can. This brew has a golden hue with a hazy look, with a short lived fluffy white head. Nose is a bright orange-citrus with a resiny tone and a touch of booze. An incredibly fresh and smooth hoppy-malty taste, with lemon, orange, and tropical fruit and a tiny bit of pine and honey, with a clean ever-so-slightly tinny aftertaste. Mouthfeel is dreamy, light, clean, with just a tiny tacky feel to remind you it has booze. Just a superb NE DIPA. Heaven in a can. Way way up there."
"Nice nose, but the taste was just one dimensional bitterness. Canning date was about a month ago, and it had been refrigerated. Won't revisit."
Wow! When you look up IPA in the dictionary. There should be a picture of this beer. Crisp. Refreshing. Just a perfect balance of hops. Make sure to always keep this one cold!
Poured into a tulip. Cloudy amber with a fluffy 2 finger head.
Well executed IPA. Has all of the qualities of a more traditional west coast IPA with a bit more citrus. Amazing balance and great hop flavour without kicking you in the teath.
Super! A pleasure. Just easy drinking with a perfect balanced taste. An enjoyment to drink.
A quality go to craft beer.
"This is one of the best NEIPA's out there can't go wrong with it as its always consistent. Great mouthfeel, smell, and taste where each sip makes you wanting more. Make sure to drink it cold as it is extremely refreshing, just a fantastic beer."
Great IPA. The balance of hops and maltiness was great. Refreshing!
"Expensive but a godddamn great drink, drinkable at any time or season, had after a long stretch of lighter NE iPas and was still very nice and light on the tongue and delivering the kick the former lacked"
"L- looks of golden straw, slightly hazy with a thin, creamy white head."
"The most quintessential double ipa. Not hazy or New Englandy, but definitely a true representation of traditional double IPAs."
"Thanks to leftpaw for bringing this out to Oregon for our vacation week this summer. Pours mostly a golden yellow color. Good clarity to it. 1/2"" white head on the top. Passes the looks test. Aroma was pretty standard, a little bit of grapefruit and tree to it. Didn't pop anything tropical for me. There was nothing wrong with it, but I guess underwhelming might be appropriate here given the amount of commercial tug job hype for the tropical notes. "
"Such a disappointment. FYI do not drink after treehouse doppelgänger. It may have stood out better if I had this before, but that was not the case. Piss poor beer for the hype. Will not buy again."
"Finally was able to try this one fresh. Overall, very good in every way. I'm not sure if this beer has come down in quality over time, as I couldn't really understand the 4.5+ score here, but it was a very good beer. Well rounded with a full nose and a mix of citrus and tropical in the flavor. However, as local fresh IPA quality has improved, I couldn't say this was better than many other very good beers. Price was also very high for what it is. Would love to try on tap at the brewery to see if there is more to it."
Canning date:7/03. Poured into 18OZ IPA Glass on 7/22 and 24.
Poured from the tap into a pint glass. The appearance is a yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is pine and citrus hops with some pineapple. The taste is pineapple and a great hop finish.
Canned 6/2/18 (33 days ago)
"A classic. Easy drinking, smells incredible, 8% disappears under a light and fruity taste."
16oz can purchased at the beverage warehouse in Burlington VT. 
Been trying to get a hold of this for awhile. Had on tap in a tulip. Pours a dark Orange/gold with a little haze. Aroma is citrusy with some good floral. Big floral taste with more malt than i was expecting. Fantastic hoppy finish. I was expecting a more tropical fruity taste being from the northeast but not disappointed at all. A fantastic beer and glad i was able to get a hold of it.
Almost a perfect IPA. Well balanced.
"Pours a five+ finger white head that fades slowly leaving no lace. Slight hazy, amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Tart citric nose and flavor is grapefruit. Not cloying, faint hints of caramel malt. Higher ABV (8.0%) is hidden. $13.99 for a 4-pak 16oz yellow cans from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
I love this beer. Nice fruity with lots of hops. Golden in color. Aroma is citrusy with hints of the hops. The head quickly dissipated. 
"Nice, balanced IPA. Light but flavorful, not in your face with hops. A bit floral."
"Shared a couple of cans with my dad purchased at Avon Wine & Spirits. Poured into a nonic pint, a slightly hazy golden color. The nose was fruity and floral, and a little funky as expected with a NE double. Juicy and hoppy, but in really nice balance with a little pop at the end. This lived up to the hype."
Terrific terrific beer..
"From a 9-day-old can, pours a moderately hazy orange-gold. A couple of fingers of white foam leaves dense sheets of lacing. Smell has tropical fruits, sweet citrus, floral notes and some spicy herbs. Taste follows. Feel has good body, with a ton of sticky resin and a bit of drying bitterness. Just a great, great beer."
Poured from 16 ounce can into a pint glass
One of my favorite IPAs. Perfect balance.
"Little hazy untypical amber look, intriguing tropical summer smell, several layers of hops makes refreshing rich taste. Easy feeling despite 8 ABV, that might be deceiving. Overall excellent IPA. Nearly perfect."
"Package date 2/7/18, received today courtesy of my brother-in-law. Poured into a snifter glass. "
This is one of my favorite beers. Sip of sunshine is exactly that. The beer may be one of the finest beers I've ever had. The beer has a strong citrus smell and taste. I will definitely be purchasing this beer again.
"Has that weed smell and taste. Why? I won't get it again. 13oz draft @ The Fix in Worcester, MA. "
"Classic gold, soapy head. Soft peach nectar on the nose, some floral hops, delicate but maybe too light. Not a hop bomb by any stretch, you do get a fair amount of lupulin, herbal hops, melon rind. Not bursting with flavor, nice but a bit of a let down."
"Fives all across the board for me. Every swig is an avalanche of staggering freshness and balance. Tough enough as it is for most IPAs to hit the perfect level of bitterness or sweetness, this does both."
"Pours a copper/amber like semi hazy/chill haze like. Bright offwhite head on heavy pour that drops fairly quick. Nose is of mango skin and guava with equal parts earthy grass like notes. First the malt! Having been drinking several trub cans, unbalanced to a point and hop forward prior to this one it caught me off guard. The first thing I notice is Sips sizable malt character. Sweet breed like malt. Mellow juicy tropical fruit melds in to the malty base seemlessly. Mangos, pineapple and melon with sweet and bitter grapefruit notes. Notes of grass and floral are laced throughout each sip but more of a afterthought. Medium body, fat at times. Gets a bit hot as it warms so if you’re not about that it is best to drink quickly."
Canned 4/9/18. Thanks to a convergence of out-of-state breweries and distributors to Nashville for the Craft Brewers Conference -- and them nicely bringing all kind of goodies with them for a multitude of around-town events and even some bottleshop hookups -- I was able to pickup at 4-pack and try this beauty for the first time. (Thanks Maryland Farms Wine & Liquors.)
This was a pretty rough IPA and should not be on the top 250. Perhaps it was brewed better in the past but the one I had was not well balanced and I may even have dumped some of it.
"This is a well named beer. It's bright, cheery and warming like drinking in a sunny day. Nice frothy head of a couple of fingers that fade a little quickly and leaves some nice lacing. The liquid itself is a hazy golden orange that seems to glow as I hold it up. "
Amazing brew. Crisp and snappy. Easy drinking but full of flavor
Great Taste!
Dark amber look.
Pretty darn good
Golden color with an earthy citrus taste. Just the right amount of malt and hops to make this 8% IPA very drinkable!
"Very nice, similiar to Hip 2 the Hops from Upper Pass vermont. Definitely worth a try not too bitter with a smooth balance."
I tried this at Mews Tavern in Rhode Island. It poured a slightly hazy orangish with white head that left a spotty lace. The scent had great hop hints that included citrus peel and pine. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with some citrus and pine presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall its a fantastic beer.
A - Pours a lightly hazed amber with a one finger creamy whit head. Heavy amount of soapy lacing.
"16oz can courtesy of beerloserLI and his mostly aluminum assault upon my porch (and my liver). Canned on March 7, 2018, per the stamp on the can's bottom. Apparently contract brewed by Two Roads Brewing in Stratford, Connecticut."
Brew date 3/26. It’s 4/5. Fresh. 
"Just started seeing this one locally, although not regularly, so picked up a 4-pack of 16-oz cans. Popping the tab brings a very noticeable citrus / pine aroma. Poured slowly, it makes a finger-high bubbly head that doesn't stay long. No carbonation afterward. Amber color, which should have been expected for the style, though I was half expecting it to be the vibrant yellow color of the can. First sips are pink grapefruit forward, with some pine following. Bitter hops, think pink grapefruit rind, show up after the sip, but balanced by a sweeter malt backend. Alcohol hides very well, but does catch up. Mouthfeel is heavier, syrupier than expected. I think marketing and some prior review bias tainted my expectations for an airy, light, sunshiney drink that would float down my throat. Some carbonation would have made it more crushable, but overall a very tasty and balanced beer. Similar IMO to HopSlam, but with less of that honey vibe."
"Top rated, conceived in Vermont, made at Two Roads in Ct. "
Another great example of balance with kick.I love a full flavor ipa and this is in my top ten.
"Canned December 19, 2017, enjoyed 3/24/18"
Absolutely the best new beer I've tried all year! I love high resin IPA so I thought I'd be let down by this fruit forward New England style IPA but I wasn't. It was crisp and refreshing and went down so smooth it is dangerous given the high ABV.
Freaking delicious all around. Highly recommend!
As soon as you crack the can you a hit with a wonderful floral aroma. This is a JUICY tasting beer. There is almost no alcohol taste as it is buried by the citrus tones of the hops. One of my favorites!!!
"This is THE JUICE! Just great and juicy goodness, and what I think the perfect NEIPA is. Opening it releases the aroma of waling into a VT. brewery, the flavor is full of citrus notes, the drinkability is off the charts."
Liked it.... But not a fav.
Dated 1/30/17. 12 days old.
Wanted more from this IPA but it lacked just a little something for me. First sip was better than the last.
"Always liked Sip of Sunshine, but my rating has dropped a bit in the past year, possibly because it is no longer ""hard to find"" — Picked up a 4 Pack today at Trader Joe's"
Nice but not all that it's oversold as.
hazy amberish
This is one of my favorite brews. We look for it every time we hit VT.
"As California rays simply beam down on me during this winter delight, Raul sips this Sunshine without any spite! Tropical citrus in the aroma and on the palate for days, Raul is hella stoked like a cow eating hay. So if you can, I suggest you take a sip, and tell your mama you love her, even when she’s sick."
"refreshing strong IPA, light for an IPA"
"16oz can dated 28 Dec. 17 purchased at Moonshine Liquors in Hyannis. After several dead ends trying to find it this summer and fall, Moonshine came through. Citrusy nose and clear amber color. Flavors include Mango, Pineapple and Grapefruit. Relatively easy drinking with a touch of Grapefruit bitterness on the finish. We're glad we had the chance to try it."
Must admit that this is the best can has the best art ever and when I see it on the shelves of my favorite beer spot; I buy a four pack without fail.
"L: Good looking beer, pretty good head retention, lots of lace, nice golden orange color"
Really good
L - Semi-Hazy copper pour with one finger foamy white head. Nice lacing throughout.
My first Lawson's ever - an excellent way to start the New Year!
"This is the first beer I have had from Lawson's Finest, a 16 oz. can served in a Brooklyn Brewing pint glass. Definitely a good start with a creamy off white head and a hazy copper body. Nose is hazy and citrus drenched herbal hops and balanced malt sweetness."
Poured from can to mini tulip.
"Pours a translucent, golden amber with a nice frothy white head. The clarity of the beer is astounding, given the prevalence of hazy/turbid IPAs these days. Lacing is strong, lasts down the side of my Cowboys glass. Here's to a better season next year. "
Poured from can dated Dec 2017
"Grapfruit, smooth, can't taste 8% ABV. Really nice! There's a bunch of bitters from the grapefruit."
"What an IPA should be, all the time!"
Something has changed since they started brewing in CT.
On tap at Hudson 303 Sport Cafe. Pours a golden effervescent hue with moderate frothing. Assertive aroma replete with hints of pine and grapefruit. Similar overall flavor profile.
"Pours nearly translucent golden amber with a thick head of white foam. Little aroma of fresh mango and star fruit. Tastes of those same tropical fruits up front with layers of sweet malt and bitter hop enveloping and unfolding, ending with a bitter pine. The mouthfeel is excellent, lacing the palate. Overall, great beer. Sweet and bitter. I could get used to drinking this often."
"Real nice. Not quite heady , darker , less citrus. But good"
"I've had this a few times, but this one comes courtesy of Smanson56. 16oz can poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a clean, clear gold color with about an inch of white head that had very good retention and lacing."
"A deliciously juicy IPA. Fruity, tropical flavors and aromas and a full, creamy mouthfeel come together to create a very enjoyable beer. A little bitter for my taste, so it's not perfect, but I can appreciate it for what it is and will likely looking for it in the future."
From the tall boy can in a Leffe snifter via a brew trade---Thanks Zid!
"one of my all time favorites, a true heavy hop ipa"
Got this can from Zid. Thanks Chris!!
"Really excellent DIPA. Somewhat pale orange color with moderate head and moderate retention. Complex aromas of pink grapefruit, lemon rind, and papaya. The palate is absolutely outstanding – very flavorful and complex. A distinct note of dried apricot leads to a ridiculously long and perfectly dry finish. Highly recommended. [10 oz. on tap]"
"More lemony than fruity. Not bitter, yet hoppy. Although 8%, it didn't taste like a high alcohol content beer."
"Wow, love this beer.just happened to be at Cambridge wine and spirits (one of my favorite stores) when I found this. I have had it and loved it before. It was served in a frozen glass. Perfect. Such a nice head, though short lived, nice color. The aroma was very pleasing. It hits with nice citrus and hoppy flavor on the tip of your tongue and and then you get a light hops flavor on the back of your tongue. Nice pleasing lingering light hoppy flavor. Just a big ‘yum’ explains it all."
Crisp and refreshing. Has that good bitter IPA flavor VT is known for.
"Definitely a top choice for the beer snobs, with that said New England has so many great full flavored beers that this has become overrated. If you haven't tried it, try it, but good luck finding it, most local stores hide it in the back or put it on social media and all the cases are sold in an hour. Once again great beer but way overrated, try something new!!!"
Into a 20oz becher glass. 
Good beer but does not live up to the hype.
"Malt. Was expecting something different. What I got was a west coast style, tongue-dragging ipa. Not easy to drink. This beer is highly overrated. I’m honestly extremely disappointed."
"Comes in a mostly clear, slightly hazy copper with a fluffy white head that dies down after a few minutes into a thin ring that leaves splotchy lacing."
down right great beer
A pretty overrated beer in my opinion. It's overpriced and a shadow of its former self since it has become more mass produced.
Have yet to find something better...
"One of the better beers I have tasted. Great hop aromaand taste. not too bitter, very crisp and flavorful."
"Rich clear, amber color with white, one finger head. Full bodied and creamy texture. Pine, peach and hops on the nose with sweet nectar, vanilla, bread, and pine flavors. Nice, long lasting hoppy bitterness at the end. So smooth and balanced."
"Had this beer a couple times: first, on tap at the Blind Tiger Ale House in NY, then on tap at a pizza joint in VT and finally in a can from Beer Shop in NY. I want to love this beer. It's always exciting when the beer world baptizes its new classics. I hate to say it, but I was disappointed. That's not to say that Sip of Sunshine isn't good. Its an exceptionally well balanced, dry and clean finishing IPA with enough citrus and pine to satisfy any hophead. That being said, on tap, the beer has a distinct grapefruit character I found obtrusive – more rind than fruit – which, while it doesn't predominate the initial sip, lingers in the finish. Canned, I felt the beer was maltier than when I had previously tried it on draft. The cleanness and dryness which had initially impressed me seemed to have been dialed back while a sticky, pine tar like maltiness dominated."
"It is not easy to find on a regular basis, but once discovered, I try to get as many 4-packs as possible. After you crack open the can, the floral aroma of hop goodness fills the air. On to the tasting and you'll find that it's packed with tropical fruit notes and delicious layers of hop flavor. To enjoy, inhale deeply, sip slowly and relax while basking in Lawson's Sunshine."
"A: Not hazy...which is awesome. Bright orange and crystal clear with a stark white head. The head is about a finger and a half tall with mostly tiny bubbles that support a few, random, rouge, large bubbles. Scattered streams of bubbles run up the side of the glass while the head slowly subsides into a nice, coaster-thick cap, which rests in place. Lacing..."
Had the last one out of my stash tonight. An excellent beer! This was of the Vermont variety. Time to get more.
"From a 16 oz can (packaged September 21, 2017) into a nonic glass."
"Fantastic all around IPA, one of the greats. Its nice to be able to get something so good without too much of a hassel. One queation though, since it is currently brewed in Stratford, CT, should it be considered a CT brew over a VT brew?"
"16 oz can, packaged 9/21/17. Pours slightly hazy orange gold with a medium bubbly white head that retains fairly well and leaves a little lacing."
"Bright, fresh, orange pineapple notes while still being floral and piney. Excellent IPA. Nice balance of hops with a moderate malt backbone to finish."
One of the best IPAs out there. Nice hazy look. Smells like sunshine. Good mouthfeel with moderate carbonization. It's hard to find so if you see it snag it
"Pours a hazy orange yellow with a thick head that recedes slowly and leaves lacing after each sip. The aroma is wonderful tropical fruits. The flavor is tropical with only a slight bitterness. The feel is equally wonderful, this goes down so nice. Overall a great beer that I would buy if Lawson's distributed in Minnesota."
"Poured from a 16oz can with a packaged on date of 9/21/17; 10oz into a tulip, the rest from the can."
"Smooth, light fruit flavor comes through. Best New England style IPA I've tasted."
A: About 1.5 fingers' worth of head. Body is a murky orange color. Not much lacing going on but the head stays around while drinking. 
Love this stuff. Great nose. Easy drinking hop forwardness.
This beer has lost some of its powerful rays over the past year. Not sure what's going on. Was there an eclipse perhaps?
A near perfectly clear yellow golden to light amber hue completely blanketed by a foamy white head. Excellent retention and lacing.
16 oz can poured into a snifter. Canned just over a month ago.
Canned 31 Aug 17. Poured into tulip. 
"Pours deep golden-orange with a small fluffy off-white head which dissipates fairly quickly. Almost no cloudiness. Nice aroma; I think I can smell my favourite hop? Mosaic. That said, the can says this IPA is lupulin laden & the can does not say which hops are used. Did they use any whole hops? I do not know. Smell and taste are as desribed on can - forward tropical hops with some floral & grassiness; just hinting at dankness. Smooth somewhat juicy mouthfeel with any bitterness being very quick to be overshadowed by the citrus from the hops. An excellent IPA; I can see why this is highly rated, but it doesn't quite live up to my very favourites from the NE region."
"On tap at The Bench in Stowe, VT. Would like to try again. Seemed meh. Surprisingly not hazy after many recent NEIPAS haha. Pizza sauce was amazing."
Not a big fan - overrated like Heady. I would like to try a small batch actually brewed by Lawson's. 
12 oz on tap at Hella Good in Portland.
A most excellent Double IPA
"Best looking beer I've ever seen, literally glows in the glass."
"Bought a 4-pack at Ryan and Casey Liquors. Can stated it was canned on August 17th. The beer has a slightly murky, burnt orange appearance, relatively thick lacing, and a medium sized head that dissipated relatively quickly. Aromas include a sharp grassy hops smell with a lot of grapefruit and mango fruit flavors as well. Taste followed the nose well with a punch of citrus bittersweet flavors at the end of each sip of orange, grapefruit, and malt. Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy with a decent carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer across all characteristics."
One of our favorites.
One word:amazing
"Hands down one of the best IPA I have ever had. Smelled of bright citrus fruits of lime and grapefruit mixed with pineapple and pine. The taste followed the nose but the pine resin was a little more noticeable but not obnoxious. The fruit are up front and on display in this beer with a mild malt base, fantastic. This is a beer that I never tire of drinking when I visit family. It is worth seeking out."
"16 oz can at a brew pub in Stowe, VT. Poured into a pint tulip glass. Nice golden color with one inch head an lots of lacing as it was consumed. Very strong citris smell/ grapefruit, pineapple etc. Nice hop finish and very drinkable for the 8.00% ABV. I will definitely buy a four pack of this on my way through Warren,VT."
"Tasted from can. Pours a murky gold with nice thick white head. Aroma is grapefruit, pineapple, caramel, pine. Taste is quite bitter with a nice mild sweet malt backbone. Crisp bitterness throughout. Flavors of citrus fruit especially grapefruit with some pine resin and caramel. Very well done. Definite a top tier IPA."
Had it the can and from the tap. I prefer the can. Great beer .
"Amazing and juicy, I would go into a detailed review, but everyone already knows what is great about this beer!"
"Canned few weeks ago, Fresh!"
"Thin layer of dense head with a muted nose from cold pour. As the beer warms, tropical notes begin to pour through. Great structure and stability throughout the drink. Stays focused and tasty."
"Oh, man, the hype around this beer, where I live, is huge. You can't get it in the local packy...unless, you spend lots of money at a craft beer oriented store, know the owner, and get on the ""list."" For the most part, it's unattainable, as the stores get a weekly(ish) delivery of about 1-2 cases, which never even get displayed. "
On tap at York River Landing.
"On-tap @ American Beauty in New York, NY."
L: Gorgeous dark yellow with a nice frothy head - poured from a bottle. Matches the can!
A: Pours a golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap
"Hey, my first review ever! I've been wanting to try this for 2 years, and we've finally got it in Maine, and it doesn't disappoint. Not as cloudy and juicy as the new wave of ""New England IPA's"" , and that's ok by me. Absolutely no hint of a bad flavor in this. It was worth the wait."
This beer is truly amazing. Tropical notes abound from start to finish. Delicious IPA... 5 out of 5 for sure.
"I avoided this for the last few months while Lawson sorted out their non juicy hop issue. Since I missed out on my weekly Treehouse alottment last week due to the new brewery drawing huge crowds, I figured I'd try Sip again. Wow am I glad I did! They are back and better than ever. If you are seeking a true New England IPA and your standards are very high this one's for you. It is a juicy hop bomb from the 1st sip to the last. I poured into a tulip so I could enjoy that beautiful tropical smell. There isn't one hint of the 8% abv. In summary, it's perfect, the smell and taste are incredible...and this is from a guy who compares everything now to Treehouse"
Poured into a Tulip glass. Served at 55 degrees.
Exceptional all around
Ah finally. Sip of Sunshine. This review is for my all of fans who have been liking my reviews and liking my posts. You make me feel extra special and extremely helpful in the beer community. Knowledge is power!
"This is pretty much as close to a perfect beer as you can get. The hype was not overrated at all, which was nice for a change. "
Honestly I've had this beer a few times. Each and every time it gets better and better. I even feel this is better than TH Julius personally even though it's listed high on my list as well. Liquid gold. Aroma is very hoppy and taste is tropical fruit. Very nicely done Lawson's!
"Best beer I've had all summer, and that includes some really choice Trillium, Tree House, Alchemist selections I've been able to get my hands on. Smooth drinking IPA with notes of tropical fruits, pine etc... very, very good."
"Tropical fruits on the aftertaste. Hoppy smell, great golden colour and mouthfeel with enough effervescence that you go back to get more of the fruit burst."
"Can splitted 2-ways. Hazy golden/orange-ish liquid with a decent white head. Nose of tropical fruits, peach, pineapple, mango, awesome! Well balanced fruity taste, grapefruit bitterness is quite nice as well, it’s not too much, slight caramel malt. Awesome IPA, I’m glad I could finally taste it!"
"Slightly hazy golden With massively sticky top of bone white. (4.5) Aromas of pine, mango, peach and slight malt (4.25). Flavor follows similarly with a bite of hop bitter throughout, and a bit of booze showing in the finish (4.0). Finishes somewhat dry with lingering bitter (3.75) Overall not worthy of the hype (4.0)."
"I got sip of sunshine via a beer trade, and I loved it. It was tasty, juicy, and thirst quenching. I admit it was a while since I had it, but I took notes and photos for writing a brief review later."
"Don't get me wrong, this is a great IPA. Juicy-tropical-wellbalanced IPA, but not AS amazing as the hype makes it appear. Definitely not the shining star of its style, but highly recommended nonetheless."
"Glowing clear golden sunlight beer pours into the glass with a high rising bubbly eggshell white foam. Well filtered, head fizzles down the side but webbed lacing covers the glass. "
L - Pours into chalice clear gold with one inch cream colored head.
"Pours a hazy, particle-laden peach with a robust, big-bubbled, bone-colored head."
Just picked up 3 cases and poured one into a pint glass. Poured a bright orange with a modest creamy head that dissipated to less than an eighth of an inch quickly. The smell is an awesome tropical pine. The taste is a well balanced tropical hop bomb with hints of tropical sweetness and bitter pine that could not be any better balanced. The taste carries through to a delicious finish with intense mouth retention. The brew is not too thin and almost feels sticky on the lips. A wonderful IPA.
Brighten up your day!
"What can I say about this one that hasn't been said? Poured a golden orange color with just over a fingers worth of foamy white head. The smell was full of tropical fruits, pine and grass. The flavor profile follows he nose, great balance of fruit and pine! The feel is medium with good carbonation. Overall I can see why everyone rates this beer so highly. I have been waiting a long time to try it so when I saw it on tap in New York I had to jump on it. You should too if you see it anywhere."
Finally got my hands on this one. 16oz. can into a Surly teku. 
"How does one segue seamlessly from The Eradication/Reduction of The Bottle Backlog at Chez Woody back into what really matters, namely, The CANQuest (tm)? Well, first, you have to jump into Mr. Peabody & Sherman's W.A.B.A.C. Machine, going back to the early-to-mid-1970's. There, a youthful Bro. Woody spent a LOT of time on his maternal grandparents' property, abutting a working farm. A young neighbor girl traded comic books & played tetherball with me. She grew up, married a fellow local beer aficionado & during a recent road trip to VT, they knew to bring me CANs! Viva The CANQuest (tm)! It pays to advertise. "
"I can still remember my first pint before they turned over the brewing to Two Roads, and God it was perfect. I hate to be That Guy but I feel a little something has been lost, mostly in the aroma and mouthfeel categories. But let's face it: at $14.99 a 4-pack for such a complex, flavorful IPA, it's still head and shoulders above the grand majority of canned brews. Great mix of lupulin and biscuit crispness. IMO best served cold; I think it suffers a bit as it warms."
"Excellent clean, fresh IPA! Wonderful mo!uth feel - crisp, enjoyed in a pint glass - hard to stop at one pint!"
"From the 16 oz can...golden, slightly hazy color with off white head; Well balanced sweetness with hoppy, citrusy tones (grapefruit, orange, pineapple). Some floral and piney hints; slightly bitter. Full bodied mouth feel and oh so smooth."
Thanks to Ian (and Will by proxy) for the trade.
"DATE: June 16, 2017... OCCASION: the boys are out of school... time for a beer that suggests sunshine and summer... GLASSWARE: Victory Hop Devil nonick... lively light amber body that densely shields any vision through the glass... the white head laces beautifully above the beer line... mango, tangerine, and other tropical fruits combine with lemon and hay to draft a suggestion of an island summer... dangerously medium-bodied, subtle like low-eighties heat, and highly drinkable, belying its 8% ABV... a creamy body dissolves at the finish, with teeth tickled and slight bitterness rolling in... the feeling lingers, but as the label suggests, the lupulin eases you towards the next sip... the flavor profile is decidedly fruity, with passion fruit, mango, and grapefruit ripely on the tongue... slight balance is provided by malts that do not inhibit the experience... provides as clean a high as one can get from an IPA... this would be a dangerous one to have in case, as the ABV makes nowhere near the imprint it should... in fact, I love that Lawson's calls it an IPA, while the net IDs it as a DIPA--they just made their flagship stronger than the usual... big shout-out to Jeff for delivering this one as part of a four-pack treasure trove... having heard a lot of Lawson's, I can now say the introduction's pleasure was all mine..."
Best normal IPA I have had. Really easy to drink. So good! East/West Coast mixed style.
Look is a near hazy amber with off white head. 
Dark straw appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Very strong hoppy aroma. Taste is a very smooth hoppy with a fruity accent. Very refreshing.
"Pillow of thick, tight white foam sits upon pale amber (9) liquid; long lasting cap; moderately heavy lacing; excellent clarity. Aromas of grapefruit, mango, passion fruit, and green hops. Grapefruit juice, lemon rind, bitter green hops, mango, passion fruit, peaches; lite caramel malt base; fruit/bitter hop finish. Medium light body, moderate carbonation with a light stickiness from the hops. Overall a perfect balance of malt, hop bitterness and fruit flavors."
"The appearance had a hazy glossy orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds leaving some light speckled to semi-spider web lacing. The smell had a full bittersweet citrus hops with a light underscore of piney hops, graced by a big sweet sticky freshly cut grass and as it opens up, the citrus opens up to lean towards the grapefruit. The taste balanced extremely nicely between the bitter citrus and piney hops to the sweet freshly cut grass. Sticky sweet grapefruit to grassy aftertaste leads to a wet citrus finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability about it. I’d want to pound this on a hot Summer’s day. Overall, I say this was an exceptionally wonderful DIPA that I would love to have again."
"I never thought something would ever challenge Heady Topper for the top spot in my IPA list but here we are. It pours a deep, cloudy amber and the aroma hits you right away. The taste is complex all the way through the back and is smoother in texture than Topper. Perfect amount of carbonation. This is truly a top-class beer!"
This beer is just beautiful. Freaking nectar. Sip of Sunshine is hands down the only name this beer could ever have.
"P- Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City pint glass.Packaged on 15MAY2017."
The gold standard for New England IPA in my opinion. I brew with a lot of citra hops and this beer smells like when I open a fresh package of that hops!
In my humble opinion this beer is very average and way overated.A 100 rating? No way
"Sip is a ""must buy"" any time i see that the beer stores near me have it in stock. The nose, the taste, the mouthfeel; everything about this beer is everything I enjoy in a great, tropical IPA. I wanted to give full 5.0 across the board but figured I should leave room in case I miraculously find something out there that I enjoy more."
"Thanks to my brother in law who got this and a handful of other gems for me on his latest northeast excursion.Pours a clear rich golden with a half finger white head that leaves 'blotches' of broken lace behind as it settles.Pineapple sweetness and mango fruitiness stand out most in the nose,maybe a little sweet onion as well,fruit on top of fruit.Pineapple and orange flavors with a sticky, sugary element to it with a great smoothness.Although there is a decent amount of sweetness there isn't a big malt bill to the beer,it's just sweet hop juice.Just awesome."
poured from can into oversized DFH snifter
16oz can dated 413/17.
"Weirdo thing to say - but sometimes there is almost this celery-like finish to crisp, hoppy, but balanced dipas. This kind of taste is best described as slightly sweet, slightly minty, slightly grassy, and all the way smooth. The body is what defines this beer though - leaves what could be a train wreck dancing across the palette. Well done, really unique beer. Don't rope this in with the others. Restraints is its best trait."
"While it might not be on the same field as Heady Topper, it is pretty darn close! My local store in DC managed to get a pallet of these in due to a beer conference. I managed to pick up quite a few and I look forward to drinking them. This was definitely a Sip of Sunshine!"
"16 oz. can 3/22/17 (thanks Rick!!!) poured into a tulip. A semi cloudy bright orange with a two finger creamy white head that recedes slowly. The aroma is mainly floral/pine, with some tropical and dank notes. The taste is more rounded, with some biscuit and orange/mango notes, and a bitter twang finish. The feel is smooth, carbonation is medium low, and the heft is medium. My new favorite IPA/IIPA?, perfectly balanced, and eminently tasty."
Amber/orange with white foam lace.
Look is dark gold with a solid white head that lasted. 
I'm going against the grain here; this is one of the most over-hyped beers I've had.
Lives up to the hype. A damn great IPA.
"This is a very nice and well-balanced beer. A genuinely solid and well-crafted representation of the style. But based upon my one draft sampling, I found absolutely nothing to really distinguish it from the many outstanding IIPAs being brewed in my neck of the woods. And yet they don't have scores like this... "
"Appearance: pours a hazy orange color with a 1"" head that slowly falls to a thin surface covering."
"When I stand before an iconic beer in our little corner of the interwebz, I proceed slowly to savor the moments: the burst of hop aromas when you open the bottle or can, the intensity of the aromas as you raise your glass for the first taste, the feel and taste of the beer as you take that first sip."
Can't think of an IPA I've ever enjoyed more.
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass. Pours a deep orange with a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly, leaving significant lacing. Tastes nice and hoppy, with a sweet malt on the back end. Has a medium body with medium carbonatio. Very easy drinking IPA for 8%."
16oz can (3/22/17 canned date) into snifter with an agrressive pour yielded a fluffy 3 finger white head and a golden / orange hue colored beer.
16 oz tallboy dated 3/21
Thanks goes out to larryi86 for this brew.
"Grass and Mellon nose, nice medium full mouth feel and hoppy grapefruit with nice balanced sweet malt balance. Very nice middle ground between hope bomb West Coast and juicy New England IPA."
"I've had this beer now on two separate occasions, both after high praise from friends. Definitely lives up to the expectations. Golden colored with a strong taste of hops and tropical fruits. It's very enjoyable and worth every penny."
16 oz. Can bottled on 7 March 2017
Well at this point we all know this is one of the best IPA concoctions on the planet. Please drink this it's just simply amazing.
"Poured into a Teku glass. A hazy golden-amber color with a frothy white head. Nice lacing and great retention. Fruity flavors on the nose with grapefruit, pineapple, mango, blueberry, and a subtle resinous note. The taste followed closely. Great tropical fruit that seemed to burst on the later palate. The bitterness is definitely there but melds in the background. The malt is also there but not noticeable. Silky smooth feel. Dry, crisp finish. World-class beer."
"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 2/7/2017. Pours slightly hazy medium golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, honey, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, honey, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/citrus peel/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is great. Touch of rind near the end of the glass. Alcohol is well hidden with a mild warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the balanced bitterness. Super dank/juicy hops with balanced malt sweetness; with just enough dryness to not be overly sweet or astringent on hops. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Got the word from a friend that the Brattleboro, VT Co-op had this. Sure enough! Opened/sampled and reviewed on 3/23 Canned date on bottom: 3/7/17"
Big thanks to my buddy Robo for this one.
"In 30 years of drinking beer, this beer is by far my favorite. It's balance, flavor, low notes, high notes, and presentation make this beer an excellent starter, main, and finisher type of beer. While I have favorites in other categories of beer, Sip O Sunshine stands as the bench mark all other beers are compared. "
"Pours a beautiful gold/tangerine juice color with 1 finger of head.... The aroma is amazing, so much peach, pine Apple, tangerine and a little onion.... The taste follows the nose with peach, tangerine, pineapple,passion fruit, with a onion flavor and a pine/grapefruit bitterness..... so damn good."
this is an amazing IPA ... in my honest opinion. it has a nice haze and the aroma is full of hops and citrus. i find it to be an incredibly easy beer to drink.
"Super juicy tropical IPA, it's got tons of mango, papaya, grapefruit, and some floral hops. It's a very good beer, but I feel it's pretty standard, there isn't a shortage of great tropical IPAs anymore and I won't trade for it again. I still did love it, but it isn't any better than what's available locally."
"I have been trying to get this beer for awhile and all of a Sudden it popped up ""everywhere""in CT. It looks like they have teamed up with two roads to do some of there brewing down there. "
"I would consider this brew akin to the hot chick / dude that you always wanted to date, but who was always out of reach. I have had about 15 of these suckers since it was distrubuted in MA, & they are all prom queen / king."
"The alcohol level does not match the otherwise goodness of this beer. It is 8.0 but would be better served at 6.5. This beer is overly hyped and artificially limited. This is a great craft beer, but I turn my back on the craftiness of their marketing aspirations. Unfortunately, they are copying Heady Topper's lead."

Best Beer I have ever had... Yet!
"Hmmm, $16.69 for a 4 pack, must be really special, unfortunately, I didn't find that to be the case. I don't know what kind of hops were used, but I really don't care much for the hop profile. By no means is it a bad beer, but at $4+ a can, I don't think it's worth the cost of entry. Pours with a decent head, aroma of dank hops. Taste follows suit, dank hops, a lot of mango. Since I'm not a big fan of mangoes, this is a negative attribute for me. Glad I tried it but I absolutely do not get the hype and wouldn't buy it again at this price. If I should be expecting my beer to taste like tropical fruits, should I be expecting tropical fruits to taste like my beer?"
On tap at City Tap in Boston.
A pint can dated 02/06/17 received in a generous box of beer sent by BA jhavs. I'm pouring it in a 13oz. tulip for the review. 
"Beautiful clear pour, moderate white head with retention"
New England DIPA. 8% ABV.
Canned 8 days ago.
Oustanding tropical IPA.
"Absolutely fantastic beer! I have been drinking so many hazy beers lately that when this first poured I wondered if I forgot to roll the can. Don't get me wrong, it isn't crystal clear...but much less haze than a lot of IPA's coming out right now. Lots of citrus, maybe caramel/vanilla, but also that hop forward bitterness that hooked me on IPA's all those years ago. World class!"
"Aroma is so bright with big resinous hop flowers with pineapple, mango and apricots. Palate is full of flavour and beautifully balanced. A hop flower fruitiness drives the palate with a nice dry bitter finish. Some very light malty sweetness is there but leaves the hops at the forefront. A really good balance between the more extreme haze juice bombs and the west coast style."
"Canned 1/23, poured into my DFH spiegelbrau..."
"Canned 9 days ago, poured into a Berkompas Tavern shaker glass. Finally available (in very limited quantities) in Massachusetts, I was tickled to get some. 4/16oz/ $15. Not cheap! But one of the finest ales I've tasted. The canned goods I understand are gypsy-brewed at Two Roads in Connecticut. Says so on the can. HVS like honesty."
"Cloudy golden pour with a slightly off-white creamy one-finger head. Big citrus and tropical fruit aroma. Strong bitter taste with tropical fruit flavors upfront. Can also taste some resin, pine and orange rind. Big, bold and bitter."
"I'm just going to give this all fives. I can't really find fault in anything about this beer unless I wanted to be super picky. Nice golden beer with a sticky, fluffy white head that may leave more lacing than any beer I've seen. The aroma is a heavenly blend of floral scents, citrus, pine and malty sweetness. The taste is sweet citrus that is washed away with pine and pith in a magical dance on your tongue with a nice bitter finish. This beer is amazing."
"Man, just love this one. Thanks to my VT buddy for bringing it down to Boston. "
Canned on 1/28/17
Amber/gold hue. good froth
Very smooth and tasty
"Picked up some 4 packs at an awesome homebrew/bottle shop in Woodstock, Vermont last Monday. Beer canned on date of 1/20/17. Pours a slightly hazy yellow with good carbonation. Some suspended particles are evident when held to the light, but really, who cares. Up until now I've been drinking right from the 16-oz can. Smells of juicy tropical fruit...I suspect mostly Mosaic & Citra hops. Notes of strong pineapple & melon & orange. Tastes similar to the nose with a great light bodied, easy drinkability as the alcohol is well hidden for 8% abv. Just a touch of bitterness which lends this beer to being very approachable. Overall, a very well crafted NEIPA. This is what I would consider a classic example. Don't be a hater of the style until you try this one. Very excellent and worth seeking out."
"Orange, light amber color. Cloudy. Spotty lace from a moderate head. "
Type: 16-oz. can
"I get why this was groundbreaking stuff several years ago, but it just doesn't hold up to the best NE style IPAs now. Too bitter and mouthfeel is lacking. Still a solid IPA just not top notch any more. Blind taste this with the best of NE, and it really falls short..."
Really good stuff
Poured from a 16 oz can (canned 12/16/2016) into a Veil Brewing house glass. 
"Pours a fiery shade of orange with just enough frosty haze to it to keep anything on the other side of the glass muddled from view. Head forms two fingers in height and stark white in color. Head retention is great, with a strong ring of white foam staying around the top of the beer for a long while. Lacing is scattered about randomly, but modestly. Aroma is dripping full of hops, with notes of citrus, pine, and resin. Additional notes of strawberries, and biscuit malts. Hop notes really open up in the flavor profile, with notes of citrus, orange zest, pine, and a little sticky resin in the back. Biscuit malts support the otherwise hop-strong flavor profile. Despite a large presence of hops, the beer remains grounded and modest, with an approachable aurora. Mouth feel is smooth, with just enough graininess to give this beer a wonderfully filling, and medium-thick consistency. Overall, it's a sublime IPA with plenty of wonderful qualities going for it. The hops are solid in the aroma, but really shine through in the flavor profile. It's hoppy, and yet smooth. Considering it hits at 8%, but drinks like it's 4%, this is an incredible IPA. "
This was my !first tasty IPA and probably what I compare everything else to. Very enjoyable beer!
"As much as it looks and smells delicious, it never satisfies my expectations of pure taste. Still a great DIPA but there are a lot others I have before this one......Had this on tap recently and my opinion has changed almost a total 180...Delicious fruity and juicy IPA that you can drink all day."
"Will always be one of my favorite NE IPAs. Tropical, juicy, citrusy, touch of pine, very clean finish. Light malt backbone is hidden, but there. The alcohol is almost unnoticeable."
Excellent dry hoppy IPA that hides its alcohol content well. I really enjoyed its clean finish and complex taste. Easy to enjoy multiple brews as this lacks the heaviness of other IPAs.
"A favorite among favorites, and I can get it weekly."
About as perfect a NE-style IPA there is!
"Very foamy, thick head with a slight orange/brown tinge. The top looks like cream. Top bubbles are very fine, but lower are bigger; dissipates quickly. Lacing is excellent. "
"This beer is a guilty pleasure and one of the best Double IPAs that can be found. A rich and complete flavor with a smooth finish, especially for a double. If you haven't had one, you need to."
"The beer that got me into the DIPA's. Good look but not the best, Tree House and Swish come to mind with a better look. Smell is awesome fresh citrus with a little pine. Taste is what you want in this type of beer fresh, smooth and pleasing. No faults can't say too much bite or too fruity just right! Good feel carbonation is there not overpowering. The balance to this beer is what makes it what it is. It is right on every level. Other beers may have a better look and feel but at the end of the day you want the beer to taste good and this beer delivers that."
L- Proper NE ipa but not overly hazy
My favorite
Acquired from marino13412 so a big “Thank You” goes out to him. Poured from a 16oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.
Canned 11/29. Drank out of a TEKU.
Fantastic beer! Had this right after a Heady and thought it was a rival. Almost like Pliny meets Heady Topper - Best of both worlds.
"Good beer, but not what I expected. Pliny meets Heady."
"The great debate seems to be Sip of Sunshine or Heady Topper, I don't think it's fair to claim one over the other as beer tastes are so personal (if you don't like IPA's you won't like this beer, not matter how good it is) but my votes for Sip of Sunshine. It's balances bright notes with a full body wonderfully. If I could I would drink this beer every day."
"Golden beer with an explosive sticky head. Earthy, sweet, floral hops with a butter scotch malt profile. Body is a little flat, might be from a vigorous pour. Overall a really tastey beer."
American IPAs are nice!
First had 5/1/15 at Eric F.'s house courtesy of Nate S. It's ultra juicy and is probably the best single IPA I've had. It's one of those buy as many as you can find and drink immediately beers!
"I'm going with 5's across the board, so far this is my favorite VT IPA. I think it's the smoothest and still has the 8% kick. It has almost a sweeter taste instead of the heavy hops taste of most IPA's. I don't believe it's very difficult to get a hold of, I would highly suggest picking up a 4 pack if in the area."
"A clear pour, with wonderfully subtle tropical fruit hop notes. Taste is bold, even for a DIPA. Hops throughout, tropical as well. Lingering taste with appropriate bitterness. Medium bodied, smooth then bitter. Overall one of the best DIPAs I have ever tried."
On tap in a Vermont restaurant. 
Pours a hazy slightly orange color.
It brought a smile to my face. it is aptly named a Sip of Sunshine. To put that into an IPA is tough. Easy to drink. Fruity in character smell and taste. I had it on draft and look forward to my next glass.
10/28/16 canning date
16 oz. can dated 10/28/16
"From a can dated 10/28. F: Plenty of carbonation L: slight hazy S: citrus hops T: slight booze, smooth bitterness, mango, apricot O: solid IPA, smooth yet a bit boozy, more carb than I'd like. I'll be having this again."
"Another one of my favorites. Not too boozy, not too fruity. Perfect balance and pretty much all around perfect beer. Great color, nose, and taste."
"Somehow available at Tip Tap Room on a Tuesday night, shout out my plug. First sip made me forget about the thought of a Trump presidency for a second. Soft, bright, floral, just enough malt character. I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said. Seek it out."
5-31
"16oz can poured into a teku glass. Pours a mostly clear peach hue, with minimal off-white head. Minimal, rapidly receding lacing. Nose is pine sap (almost Crusher-like), with a faint hint of honey. Floral notes on the nose are accompanied by lemon and orange peel. Dank, resinous, with a thick, honey-like character that makes it (once again) reminiscent of The Crusher. The density of the pine flavor here is what sets this IPA's palate apart - a strong pine note that plays harmoniously with a prominent, dank, lupulin component. Mouthfeel is medium - thicker than most IPAs, without being smoothie-like. This is an artful, traditional take on the DIPA style. World-class."
Love it on draft.
Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter. Canned 9/16/16.
Can Date: 9/30/16
Had this on draft in Burlington. 
"16oz can from the batch that hit Denver for GABF. Dark orange color, super hazy with particulate floating throughout. Aroma is sticky oranges. Flavor is heavy citrus, oranges, good malt backing. Alcohol is pretty well hidden too. Overall, a good DIPA but not something I would seek out again."
16 oz can packaged 9/16/2016.
Amazing
"Probably my favorite IPA. All-around excellent flavor, aromas, feel. Yes yes yes!"
Pounder canned 8/22/16.
"Golden and slightly cloudy, with a little carbonation. A little white foam of a head."
Thank you jhavs for this
"Best beer I've ever had, and I've had Heady, Treehouse, Fiddlehead, and a whole bunch of others."
SOS is fantastic - simple as that.
"Picked up in VT, was canned almost exactly two weeks prior to purchase given date on bottom, enjoyed same day."
Great flavored enjoyable IPA
L: semi transparent orange hue. Large rocky white head that dissipates rather quickly 
Can dated 08/05/16.
Can dated 08/22/2016. Consumed 09/09/2016.
"Hazy somewhat murky orange with a 1 inch off-white head. Aroma is the best part of this beer. Floral and tropical and jumps out of the glass. Flavor is definitely still very tropical hop character but also malty, somewhat sweet, and assertively bitter. Nice and full with medium carbonation. Great beer overall. Not sure worth the hype but I am not sure this is my style of IIPA in the first place."
Pours a very hazy orange with an almost white foam.
"I am an IPA troller. I just stop in at a beer retailer on my way home and see what they have. For me IPAs are like crack. Once you start you can't stop. I was just about to check out with some 90 Minute when the guy in front of me has this 4 pack of pint yellow cans. I had not seen it on the shelf but I was mesmerized. ""What is that?"" I asked. He said get some because it's hard to find. I ran back to the case and found it. There was no price so I was a bit concerned but you know how it is to be on a quest for the best IPA. I said f$%^ it and took a chance. I was unaware of the brewer but now I know. It was the cousin of Heady Topper. I am from CT and I have been to Vermont and know how hard Heady is to get. SOS is very good but I think our group gets a bit star struck with the celebrity brewers. Because of my lack of education in the nuances of the flavors of IPAs I am always skeptical of the reviews. Sip Of Sunshine is very good and I am glad I had the opportunity to try it. I may even get it again if I have a chance but at $15 for a 4 pack even when it is this good is a bit excessive. I would love to try it on draft. Maybe its time to get back to Vermont."
"Yes, it is great, but the finish is sharper and more metallic than its evil older bro Heady Topper, which I believe is slightly better. Brewed in StratfordCT at Two Roads, so some can be found in CT stores, but you have to ask for it and will get one 4 pack for $16 if lucky. Store owners are peeved that people are flipping the beer on Craigslist."
"Enjoyed chilled. Poured with a perpetual think white head. Colorado was soft orange with some haze. Aroma was fresh squeezed citrus. Taste was similar. Tangerine, orange and grapefruit. Moderate bitterness. Great mouth feel. Rich and silky. Overall a great beer. Wish I could get my hands on it more."
"light orange and resinous. fluffy head, and a full bouquet of citrus when inhaled"
Pours somewhat Amber In color. Has a bit of cloudiness but is not really hazy. It does not glow like many beers of this style. Still looks good though. Smell is juicy. Papaya mango and a touch of tangerine. Taste is sweet on the front end with only a light bitterness on the back end. Feels rather carbonated at first but it mellows out over the course of the glass. Feels a tad heavy as well. Overall a great beer that lives up the NE IPA hipe.
"Clear golden color with off-white head. Aroma is somehow sweet with oranges and tangerines. Taste has canned pineapple juice, mango and lots of pineapple fruit. Quite bitter on the finish. Awesome taste, I think the best tasting IPA I every had, if it was more aromatic it would be stellar."
"Maybe it was the order of beers I had previously, this felt a little weak comparatively. However, it was still a fine beer. I'd like to try it first or by itself to know for sure"
"Have had many times and each 4pk of cans tastes different. So not really sure how to rate it. Always good, on occasion unbelievable, but always seems to taste and feel different. Not a connoisseur and can't break it down like some but its just good,man. Just good. Raining outside, bad day at work, cat got your tongue- Grab a Sip of Sunshine- ""Cuz you'll feel better"". Luckily readily available in CT and always a good go to. Sipping it now... Aahh there's me tongue."
"one of the best doubles taste wise ive had. extremely refreshing, especially on a hot day. Has a subtle fruity flavor but its very crisp and smooth going down. Not much of a strong smell to it in my opinion, but my sense of smell may be a little off."
"From a 16oz can, dated 07/12/16. Served in an imperial pint/nonic. How have I never rated this before now? But I haven't."
"Probably my favorite IPA. Just edging out Heady Topper and Focal Banger. Like all of them, I wish they were easier (possible) to find in NY, but gives us a reason to visit VT."
great balance
"Vibrant bright orange body with a bit of haze and a huge, fluffy cream-colored head. Aroma is big tropical fruits, tons of citrus zest and hints of grass. Flavor is huge and juicy, tons of tropical fruity hops, a dash of grass and the slightest hint of toast. Feel is juicy, medium bodied, slightly sticky, but easy to drink. Really awesome beer with an enormous amount of juicy hop punch."
"A little backstory: I recently reconnected online with an old friend who lives just outside of Burlington, VT. Naturally I begged him to send me some Heady Topper. ""No,"" he replied. ""If you want some you'll need to come for a visit,"" adding, ""Heady's great, but there are even better beers up here."" So I broke down and flew up there this past weekend. He greeted me with Sip Of Sunshine, which I'd never heard of. Absolutely fabulous! Following it up with my first Heady was almost anticlimactic. The latter was undoubtedly delicious, but I preferred the Sip."
"Don't normally do the full-blown ASTM-style beer reviews because I find them a bit pedantic, but I'm prepared to do a special review for a special beer. I'll go full-blown beer reviewer for my first of the major New England IPAs (and I got some Alchemist goodies on the way to review too!). Here we go."
"I've never understood this beer. I describe Sip as being like coffee: it smells sooooo good. And then when you taste it . . . well it's OK but it never lives up to the smell. Obviously, many coffee lovers will disagree with me on that statement. But the point is that I'm always disappointed by this brew. I've left it for months and then come back to it, made sure the cans were fresh etc. But always I end up not even wanting to finish a single can. "
"One of my all time favorite brews. Although I still prefer the bottled version brewed in Vermont, the canned version brewed at Two Roads in Connecticut is still a world class brew. "
"I had the pleasure of tasting my first Sip of Sunshine AKA ""Sip"" just last week. I was on line at a Market in VT waiting for the Heady Topper truck The proprietor of the market addressed the people waiting and announced that he had Sip Of Sunshine available, a knowledgeable gentleman who had traveled 75 miles from New Hampshire told me it was an excellent brew and he highly recommended it. After scoring both Heady and Sip I drove to the nearest waterfalls to enjoy my score. I enjoyed my first Sip of Sunshine directly from the can after drinking a Heady Topper. The Sip of Sunshine had a pleasant hop fragrance, The taste starts out hoppy but quickly morphs to a refreshing citrus grapefruit bitterness which slowly dissipates. The balanced carbonation results in a satisfying and mouth feel."
tall boy from lee
Surprisingly clear for the flavors involved. Has nice fruit on the nose but taste is more crisp pine than fruit. Very nicely balanced but more traditional than the newer New England juice bombs. Excellent beer as long as you are expecting more Heady than Treehouse.
Can. Great taste and smell. Strong. Bitter. A bit too syrupy and frothy mouth feel.
Great flavor. Good orange color. The feel is great and it's smooth. Good ipa.
"Good but not as amazing as I was expecting... easy drink, looks gorgeous, nose is lacking but the citrus notes come through on the palate"
The aroma is so amazing
"Searching for Heady and found this incredible NE IPA, rivals Alchemist creation, bit more fruit and tiny bit less hopped but great tan/orange color and perfect ABV, top 10 on my list easily"
Hard to get and when you do SHARE it with friends!!! I've lugged some to Florida for friends who have never had it before and it's a rush to watch them drink some and then get feedback!!! it's worth the ratings it's been given.
"Remarkably clear for a NE IPA, with a slightly darker honey color as well. Pure white, frothy, creamy head."
"It just doesn't live up to the hype for me. Tries to be balanced between hoppy and citrus, but the flavors don't blend. Love the orange/honey color, which is obviously the inspiration for the name. Would much rather have Maine's Dinner or NEBCO's G Bot. This isn't in the same class as either."
Loved this beer! Good stuff coming out of VT
"This is a top tier beer for sure, upper liner. So fruity and robust. Delicious and dank. Drink after drink after drink. Yumm!"
"Split a tallboy with a friend 6-19-2016. Had this after a Pliny and a Lights On - this was comparatively a little more tropical, and I thought the finishing/aromatic hops on this were more than Pliny and less than Lights, relatively speaking. Was a deep orange in color with nice thick, smooth mouthfeel and subtle warming during drinking. Very likeable - my 8oz taste lasted about 4 mins before I destroyed it."
"Super juicy on the nose. Pours a nice thick head (bout an inch). Look is golden orange. Flavor is mostly fruit, slight malt, slight bitter finish. Great beer."
"Definitely world class IPA here. NE style through and through but definitely more bitter than Heady for instance. Feel isn't quite as juicy either. It's a great IPA, no question, worthy of the hype and seeking out to try. But I do prefer Heady and some other NE IPAs in general. Damn glad I could try it though!"
Canned 7/21. Consumed 8/6.
My Favorite this far! Smooth with a variety of fruits and hops.
"A friend was able to acquire some of this fantastic beer. The taste was excellent, very smooth and not too bitter with wonderful citrus flavors. The feel was outstanding and finish refreshing. Everyone wanted another!"
A 1 pint can canned on 1st April 2016 and poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
"I love this beer (most of the time), but truly hate how inconsistent it is from batch to batch. One batch is absurdly smooth and hazy, while the next is clear and bitter. Ugh."
Revisited 10/30/18
A good beer but I don't know how it got this high of a score; too much malt for me.
Poured into a snifter/tulip/wine hybrid glass from a 16.9 oz can
Smell: tropical fruits orange grapefruit 
My All time favorite!
Hands down the best IPA I've ever had. Probably the only IPA I've had that has successfully included tropical flavors that actually benefit the beer instead of overwhelming it. If you're ever in Vermont be sure to give this one a try.
One of my favorite beers ever in my opinion. The citrus really comes through nicely in the IPA.
"Juicy, Fruity, Sweet. Says to enjoy a tropical vacation in a glass, that statement is spot on with this beer. "
"Tasted from a 16 oz can on May 29, 2016."
Had on tap at Prohibition Pig... one of the better IPAs I've had. Definitely would search this out again. Looks like another Northeast US trip is needed.
Expected much more from this beer! Good ipa but didn't live up to the hype! Lacked much of the description from the can. Less than a month from can date. Overhyped! Really...had much better!
Finally got my hands on some of this - it lived up to it's reputation - great tasting!
"Dull orange in color with a yellow hue and deep, unfiltered haze. Poured with a creamy, dense, sticky, bright white foam with good retention. A plethora of tropical hop aromas: grapefruit, orange rind, over-ripe pineapple and mango with light spicy notes at the end. Malt aromas were light. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation and an incredible smooth creamy feel. Pleasant warming sensation through the middle to the end without the boozy burn. Medium high, juicy hop flavors of pineapple, mango, and grapefruit followed by medium hop bitterness and spicy hop notes near the end with pleasant boozy warmth. Finished semi-dryly with pleasant hop flavors and a medium light bitterness that did not linger. Dangerously drinkable for a DIPA. Incredibly smooth and bursting with flavor."
16 oz can poured into a stemmed tulip.
"Muddy dark orange color with finger of lush white head that rises in a large dome above the rim of the glass and lasts a while before leaving behind heavy lacing. Strong orange, pineapple and pine aroma, which carries over to the taste, where it's coupled with a sweet malt backbone and decent bitterness. Medium bodied with a prickliness and slight creaminess to the mouthfeel. Very solid."
Two sixers just off the truck and driven to NC
5/16 churchville
"Average DIPA. Smell was weak. I want a DIPA to have a heavy hop smell. This lacked smell. Taste and look were average. Not bad, but not world class either. Really"
Yellow-orange pour with a slight haze. 1.5 cm of foam disapates to a thin swirl. Aroma is a mango bang-me-over-the head plus other tropicals. Tropical flavors including pineapple are noted. There is some pine too. The malt-hop combo is superb. I had one (from can) on three consecutive nights and my impression is consistent. This exceeded expectations and I appreciate this true treat
"Love this beer, one of the top 3 for me in Vermont. Always tastes good even if the date is more than a few weeks old on the can. Great smell and a great smooth taste. Definitely try this"
Lawson's Finest Liquids Sip of Sunshine
Poured from tap at TJs in Paoli PA into a snifter glass. 
Super clean and crisp. Very bright citrus taste and awesome bitterness. Drinks like a regular IPA. Really awesome beer!
Nice beer easy drink IPA. Nice bite of from the hops but smooth sweeter finish.
Time for a proper review. 
"It's all about the mouthfeel for me with this one. Very soft, bitter , loaded with flavor and excellent balance. Perfect ? The only real negative about it for me was the nose I did get the tropical aroma in which other's have described and nothing to the affect of ""packed"" and ""bursting"". Very impressive though."
"I don't get the hype on this one. It's a decent double ipa, maybe the ones I had went shipped property? It as 3 weeks old but shouldn't have fallen off that fast."
Shared a can with a friend of a friend
"Poured 16oz can into snifter. Canned on 3/5/16 so just over 2 months old. Golden orange and very hazy with a big 3 finger white head. Great retention and loads of foamy lacing cling to the glass. The hops are dominant at first crack of the can. Piney, bitter citrus, a some tropical notes showcase this beer. The nose is quite pungent. Waves and waves of hops hit my palate. Pine hops, bitter citrus hops, and even slight notes of tropical hops. A subtle sweetness peeks in every now and then, but the hops push it back. Full bodied and sticky with awesome carbonation. Goes down easy even at 8% ABV. I really enjoyed this and believe the can helped preserve the hoppiness."
"If they have it, get it."
Poured at 49°F from a 1 pint can (canned on 21Mar16) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Consumed on 03May16.
"Pours wth a nice head. Great hoppy aroma. Nice hoppy start citrus, pine apple,hoppy very light pepper tones. It truly is an amazing pale ale. From first sip you know why it's so hard to get your hands on it."
"16oz. can served in a tulip nonic. Pours a burnt orange hue with a hazy clarity and a creamy, half inch, bright white head. Head eventually disperses into a band around the shoulders leaving a soapy slick across the surface. Some swaths and slashes of lacing are present during the tasting. Nose expresses citrus, melon, rind, guava and a light earthy/herbal quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, earthy/herbal character hits more upfront in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of crisp that leaves a residual prickle at the back of the throat between quaffs. There's also just a kiss of acidity. Its n'o the first time I've had SoS (surprised I hadn't rated it) - that said, it's a very good DIPA and a great example of what's coming out of VT (even though this one is brewed in CT)."
"It's a good thing this beer is difficult to come by. If it was easily obtainable, I'd be an alcoholic. zzzzz [only added so I got to 150 characters]"
"Damn near perfection in a can. I will buy this beer every time I see it. Incredible hop aroma, delicious hop taste, and 8% abv. What more could you want from a double IPA?"
"Poured into a tulip glass a couple weeks after purchase. Overall the hype around this beer is legit; however, not sure if the difficulty in obtaining the beer is worth the effort. The trick of late addition hops creates a lot of bright flavor without the rosiny bitterness. However, some back end bitterness is apparent in this beer, unlike some other beers in this category (New England DIPA)"
Best beer I've ever had.
Stupendous. Can't say enough about this beer. It's the platonic form of DIPA...perfect smorgasbord of hop flavors: pine up front with tropical fruit basket abounding and a nice lingering bitterness (a quality lacking in lesser IPAs) that makes you wanna keep sipping to quench the plate with that incredible juiciness.
"Fantastic beer, don't need to go into all the little details just know if you haven't had it, you must. Just wish they produced more or made it easier to get... It's ok to be the ""cool"" hard to get beer but it does get frustrating when you want to enjoy some sip and can't get it.. I live in ct, I'm sure it's more available in VT but tough to get here."
16oz tallboy can poured into a snifter glass.
In my opinion this is the best DIPA I've tasted so far. There are a lot of good ones out there but this is the standard buy which all the others are held to.
Sampling a cool pounder can poured into a snifter. The beer pours a slightly hazed gold to copper color. A fluffy bleached white head foams up 2 cm even with a gentle pour. The head slowly recedes to a sturdy surface layer that leaves some clingy lattice on the glass after each sip.
"Can dated 3/3/16. Pours a light orange color with a one half inch head that leaves excellent lacing. Smells of tropical fruits, citrus fruits, pine and hops. Taste follows the nose. Absolutely amazing flavors--mango, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon and hops. Starts out a little sweet and finishes slightly bitter. Very complex and well balanced, moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Incredible beer, I wish it were easier to find, but well worth the hunt."
"Long time want, maybe my palate has passed this by as far as it being able to ""wow"" me. Either way this one is still a fantastic beer. Beautiful amber color, nice perky head. Aroma is very piney and soapy, very much a prototypical west coast IIPA. Smooth flavor brings out the true nature of the hops here. Finishes clean and dry."
Got some of these goodies sent to me in Chicago. Fresh and cold! Without a doubt the absolute best beer I have ever enjoyed in my life!
My favorite so far..... Great drinkability
Sips! Canned 3/03. Poured into a snifter.
Astonishing.
"I think Sip of Sunshine is a rather complex beer. Definitely has more hop forward bitterness. There is nice deep orange / amber transparent look with foamy lacing. Reminds me of Abrasive that is first sweet and then bitter with different waves of intensity. Very strong beer, but I do believe that is a tad overhyped."
current fav.
This is by the far the best out of all of the Vermont Double IPA's. Amazing nose with a taste to match it. Good full bodied mouthfeel with supreme drinkability. Doesn't look like complete crap when you pour it out either. This is top notch.
"Finally got to try this beer, thanks to my buddy for bringing me a few back from Vermont!"
S.O.S.
"Pours a light orange, yellow gold with small white head. Excellent lacing. Smell is very nice with strong tropical notes, mango, papaya, pineapple, lemon zest and orange peel. Taste matches the nose, very tropical. Not much of a malt backbone in my opinion. Strong mango, melon, puckering zest and very slight dank. Nothing overpowering just a perfect balance. A very sweet tropical IPA."
"This is a fantastic beer, and is very hard to come by if you're looking for retail. If you see it, grab it while you can. It is an awesome summer beer, and I have yet to find a worthy competitor beside HT. Not as fruity as a TreeHouse brew, but definitely to that level of goodness."
"Gold standard for all beers. Refreshing, delicious, well balanced, perfect hoppiness"
"dry, citra-dominated"
"I've sampled a many Pliny the Elder, Heady Topper, Lunch, Dinner and probably 200 - 300 IPAs. Sip of Sunshine is by far my favorite! I was lucky enough to have a very recent can of Heady, sip of sunshine, and a bottle of Lunch that I sampled within a night. All delicious!! I love them all, but the edge goes out to Sip of Sunshine."
"Had it with other doubles one evening. Was the clear winner. Crisp, flavorful and aromatic. Great beer."
"Had an opportunity to have this today. Golden, very faint haze, with delicious hoppy character both from smell, and finish. Definitely the popularity of this IPA certainly overshadows my taste buds. While it was a flavorful offering and one of the better IPAs out there the rest remains exactly what it is , a product which its ratings reflect based on a popularity first, taste last."
Canned 2/16/16
A: Crystal clear gold liquid with a generous tight head.
"I was expecting more, but don't get me wrong this beer was still better than most. Solid well balanced beer with a medium mouthfeel and good amount of carb. Almost like an anise aftertaste which I wasn't the biggest fan of."
"Checking out at a beer store in Torrington, CT and the owner, seeing that I am buying among other things a 6 pack of Super Session #2, says to me, you want some Sunshine....I got a 4 pack in the back."
L: Beautiful. Orange-golden and brilliant. Off-white head with good retention. 
"We came on a mission to try Heady with a side trip to Hill Farmstead, but left with a surprise in Sip of Sunshine. Tried it on tap at Pro Pig in Waterbury. Great a amber color with an amazing citrusy aroma. The taste was sweeter than I expected but still fairly balanced, went down awfully smooth, with no evidence of its alcohol content. Both HT and SoS are world class, so it really came down to personal preference for me. Overall it's a great beer but there's other top notch DIPAs out there that are easier to get your hands on. I wish this was one of them."
16 oz Can dated 12/29/15 12:04
"Can is dated 2-16-16. Pours orange with good head retention.What a great beer, so complex in aroma and flavor. Not a hop bomb, but just about perfectly balance DIPA. Citrus abounds which does away with the bitterness that you would typically find in the finish of a DIPA. The 8% abv is completely unnoticed. I'm so psyched to finally tried this, and was not disappointed."
"Beer pours very clear with some light carbonation. Fluffy head on top. Dare I say the color is that of...sunshine? Sorry. Anyway, picking up light citrus hops in the nose. Not overpowering. Taste is not what I expected, but excellent nonetheless. Citrus hops, a bit of lingering bitterness but with a solid malt backbone to balance it out. Not the hop bomb I expected but balanced DIPAs can be just as enjoyable. Drinks more like an IPA than a DIPA. In a good way!"
"This is such a refreshing IPA. L: Golden haze. S: I get bright and crisp hop aroma, and a lot of tropical fruit mixed in with bready malt. T: Really nice balanced and bright hop flavors that intermingle with guava, mango, and other tropical notes. Perfect malt balance, bready and slightly sweet. F: Unique. Medium feel, but almost light and pillowy, a creamy sensation. Outstanding. O: So glad I got to experience this one. Highly recommended."
SoS dated 2/5/16 
"Hands down my favorite IPA. The smell is magnificent and the first taste always makes everyone say ""what the........."". I truly enjoy this beer and it's counterpart the super session 2. Tops the list for me. It's good that everyone isn't like this. Sets a part from the pack! Kudos on an EXCELLENT beer."
"Lived up to expectations. Crazy good, easy to drink and just the right everything... awesome beer can't wait to get more!"
"SoS is it when it comes to NE DIPAs. Beautiful color and haze, as well as taste. Smells so citrusy and goes down very smooth. I couldn't imagine having access to this on a regular basis."
"In blind tasting vs Heady Topper, I picked SoS. I couldn't believe it. "
"pours light orange with minimal carbanation, could use more. smell is very hoppy at first but leaves quickly."
Best IPA from the Burlington beer Mecca!
"Worthy of its praise, hazy unfiltered look; aromas of citrus and flowers forward on the nose, to be accompanied by more floral citrus fruit on the tongue. Medium-weight, plush, and softly clean drinking. A real winner."
"Finally got around to having one of these after trading for it at the Other Half line in Brooklyn. Heard many good things about this beer and for the most part, they were true. Juicy, bright, and easy to down, the alcohol was so well-hidden that it didn't even feel like there was much in here! "
pours a nice off orange color w syrupy appearance as there are small floaties in the pour but they are suspended in the liquid and not moving. smell is of light citrus but nothing overpowering. taste is nice tangerine w maybe some melon. as it warms the flavor really comes through and i get nice peach at the end with lingering bitterness. mouthfeel seems like it a little more carbonated than other dipas but nice feel overall. I've had this beer before and seem to remember it being better. still a nice beer overall.
Sooo juicy. So crisp and refreshing with incredible citrus bitterness. Juiciness is so we'll balanced with bitterness. Fruity and hoppy and awesome.
"The sky blues and the clouds clear when you drink this beer! It truly is one of my all-time favorites; in my top 10, I would even say top 5. Complex citrusy hops hit you, wave after wave. Very drinkable! Salud!!"
"This beer appears faint at first, but slowly grows darker as it settles in the glass. With a soft, kind of mushy head,this beer is perfect to split with fireflies on a summer evening. With aromas of tangerine, lemon, and mangrove, this beer smells like the Florida everglades. The subtle taste of cherry licorice reminds one of childhood candy store runs, and the more noticeable taste of feta cheese stuffed olives is perfect to relax one after a long day."
The color of this is what you would get if you could filter a mimosa.
"Outstanding beer, which I preferred to Heady in a head-to-head."
"I have had SOS dated 12/23/15 and 1/22/16. This has always been my favorite beer, even better than the various Tree House beers, Heady, Pliny. But the past two releases of SOS have been off. None of the awesome aroma that punches you right in the face, not the great heavy juicy body, and it's missing that great bitter finish. I figured that the first batch was just a one time miss but now it's been two in a row. Wonder what they're doing over at Two Roads?? Hope they get back on track!"
"one my all time faves...so happy it is now brewed in CT. Gorgeous orange hue, absolute tropical aroma bomb heavy on mango, pineapple and lime. taste starts sweet and finishes with just the right amount of hop bitterness. Right up there with the Heady in my opinion...an almost perfect brew"
"Welcome to the world of NE IPAs. Very nice brew, very floral, bit of bitterness, smooth as hell. One of the better Double IPAs I have had. Not much more I can tell other than wow."
"This is some high quality IPA brew ready for consumption. The beer can art is at the top of the heap, and the taste of the beer is world class. I think Heady Topper may have some more thickness to it, Sip of Sunshine provides a more floral approach. "
Pours - Very nice clear golden color thick white head that lasts the whole glass good lacing.
"Just above heady topper in my mind. Done a side by side numerous times and both are great beers. Comes down to personal preference for me, and I prefer Sip."
Freaking awesome....lives up to the hype
"This beer is perfect if you're an IPA fan. Just the right amount of hops, great color and hoppy aroma. And more refreshing due to the citrus finish then most IPAs. A pleasure to drink."
"Nice, full-bodied, stinky IPA that will knock you on your ass thanks to pint cans @ 8%. We drink a lot of different brews and this is one of our faves (always seem to have a good time drinking this one). Sold in four packs. Can be pretty hard to find."
"L- As Vermont DIPAs go this beer is quite clear. A cautious pour still led to a towering 3 finger bone white head. The lacing is modest, but lasting. Color is a beautiful light gold."
Much better than I had expected. Delicious brew with strong citrus flavors . Difficult to get but well worth the price. A world-class brew!!!
Great stuff. Tastes pretty similar to all the other great New England IPAs
"I was expecting a lot with all the hype around SOS, and it lived up to it's name for sure. Very different from heady and pliny, but certainly in the same league! The taste is like nothing you've had before and the feel in incredible. An undisputed world class beer, well deserving of a BA 100."
Poured into a tulip
After all the hype...this one doesn't disappoint. The effect is almost akin to biting into an unpeeled grapefruit.
Simply the best
L: This one pours a hazy orangish color. Two fingers of white foamy head that disappates at a moderate rate.
2nd best ipa in Vermont
16oz can dated 12/18/15 into an IPA glass at fridge temp.
Fantastic beer! I think it's better than Heady but not quite as good as Focal Banger. The citrus flavor shines through for sure. Extremely drinkable at 8%. Get some if you can. It's a great summer beer. Love the can too.
"Love this beer, probably more than Heady Topper. Great citrus and tropical aromas combined with the lightest hoppy dankness. Good malt backbone supporting great hop flavors that mirror the aroma. Great body and feel. Little to no alcohol presence makes this 8% IPA very easy drink."
"Fantastic beer! recently went through some BA Score 100 IPA's after a couple east coast trades and really enjoyed this one. The mouthfeel is what really stood out for me on this one. Very luxurious, almost creamy. Can't get over how drinkable this was either. Tons of great citrus flavor. Never would have guess 8% ABV"
Eminently drinkable. 
jan 13 2016 - 4.25
"Love this beer. Another winner here from a small area in Vermont. Lots of citrus, grapefruit and pith. Nice balance of the citrus while still having a good hop bitterness and bite. Overall a very good crisp dipa."
"I was fortunate to spot the only remaining one of these at a local Italian restaurant that boasts a pretty impressive beer list. I instantly ordered it, even though the price tag was quite high. Unfortunately, I didn't think this one lived up to the hype. While it was a typical juicy IPA, I didn't notice any standout characteristics that would set it apart from, say, Victory's DirtWolf, which I think is actually quite better. The aroma was sort of nonexistent and it just didn't blow me away as I'd hoped."
"Definitely a great one, just something missing to make it a 5"
Exceptional IPA and worth all the hype.
"The first pour is crystal clear, the next pour yields a moderate amount of haze, either way it's a beautiful pale copper with small amounts of white head. Aroma is unsurprisingly hoppy with some juicy grapefruit and mango but also a bit of resiny pine and some bready malt. Taste follows the nose; the focus is on juicy tropical fruits but a bit of bready malt is also present. Medium-light body with a bit of slickness from the hops. I can see why this is so highly sought after, lots of hoppy goodness, and immensely drinkable."
"This is the best IPA I've ever had. I've had some of the so called best on the market and a ton of insane west coast American IPA's as well as Vermont's ""Heady Topper,"" but this offering by Lawson's Finest Liquids brewed right in ""Two Road's,"" brewery in Stratford, CT is better. Bright, crisp and ornate. Loads of ruby red grapefruit on the palate with gooseberry, pine and lemongrass. If I find an IPA better than this, it will likely be in heaven. It really is a Sip of Sunshine."
Poured from a can into a tulip glass.
Possibly the perfect beer. It is really unlike any other IPA I've ever had with such over the top tropical flavor and aroma yet somehow balanced incredibly well against big puberty hop flavor that put Vermont IPAs on the map.
"What can I say...The best beer I have ever had. I pray that every craft beer enthusiast has a chance to enjoy this. Poured in to a Luminarc 16oz IPA glass. Huge golden and orange color, nice bright vibrant head. Intense citrus aroma. Very crisp and smooth in my mouth with poignant hoppiness bursts. Amazing. This will be my sought after beer each trip to VT."
Look: golden; honey. Translucent but not clear. <1/2inch head; small creamy bubbles.
"Four pack found in CT 12-27-2015. Local package store. Was searching out Captain's Daughter, and this was an added bonus. "
Can from Joe back at Zeebra 2015. Good times man! 
"Pours deep gold, moderate head, Smell explodes in waves of citrus. Taste is rich, complex,delicious, with a long finish. Smooth creamy feel, just the right amount of carbonation. Lives up to it's great reputation."
"As promised, loads of tropical hop-forward notes. So smooth at 8%, this has tons of flavor yet super drinkable. Low to medium bitterness and finishes as great as it starts. Highly recommend"
"Acquired from Goudaphunk through trade. made me read a lot on Lupulin (thanks to the can description). great example of the amazing New England IPA. great nose of tropical fruits, hop dankness followed by equally nice taste. very well balanced yet hop forward IPA. Get it, if you can!"
"Pours a very hazy golden, glowing orange color with two fingers of an off-white head."
"This is the epitome of a NE IPA for me. Piney flavors, beautiful color. A notch above Heady for me."
Had this in July. A very easy IPA - enjoy!
"Had this at GABF this year so my review is a little terse. First of all, for coming out of a can, the flavor surprised me. It was complex, citrusy, hoppy, and interesting. It rivals some of the best IPAs, in fact. An american IPA done very well."
Another great NE brew.
Looks like slightly watered down orange juice with a big two finger light beige head. Nose is just incredible with big juicy citrus tons. So full and juicy. Taste is just as wonderfully juicy bursting with pulp based citrus feel. The back half of the palate of this brew is just as interesting as it develops piney and dry notes on the back end. So complex and wonderful overall.
On-tap at Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier.
"For me this might be the only ipa to rival Pliny, Nice and juicy, great citrus aroma. I can drink this beer all day long. I have to get my hands on some of their other beers."
"wow. been wanting to try this one for awhile. tried to not let the hype affect my perspective but this is very delicious. beautiful foam on hazy golden liquid. nice subdued tropical notes in the aroma and flavor. so easy going down.... sessionable, even? I wanna move to Vermont....."
"wow, look was great deep orange with a smell of citrus and deep hop taste, very clean and flavorful taste of a very well crafted beer with a long clean finish and feel, overall this is a great great beer rivaled by few. an alcohol flavor is prominent however."
"A: The beer is relatively clear yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger and a half high bright white head that died down, leaving a short head covering the surface and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass."
Best IPA out there!!!!
"Tasting notes from November 11th, 2015"
"Pours a beautiful golden color with a pretty foam head and plenty of lace. Amazing and juicy tropical fruit blend and dank resiny hop oils. Such and interesting and complex taste that manifests itself in three stages. First, it is citrusy and sweet on the tongue. In the middle phase the palate becomes much drier as does the finish. This is the phase where the hops take over as well as a some bread malts coating the big hoppy taste. By the third stage, the tropical fruit juices re-emerge and form a balance with the hops. An unbelievable and unearthly creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied and on the dangerously drinkable side."
Got this as part of a wedding gift. Imagine getting a basket full of great beers. This one was really good.
"Very fresh pounder can provided by my good friend Syndicate.. Pours slightly hazed light golden.. nice foamy white head with good retention.. Lawson's always does hops very well.. Pithy and tropical fruity hops show nicely in the aroma, very dry with almost no background maltiness.. Flavor is nice .. good hoppy flavor but the overall package just isn't there as far as world class IPAs go.. Dry and pleasant, but no real complexity... Almost sessionable.. "
Got as a gift from a friend. Thx Markus! Served at 6deg C in a draught glass
Nice hop aroma. Great citrus presence.
"Can from psweendogg. Thanks, Patrick!"
CAN
"Worth the hype. Perfectly crisp, juicy as advertised, subtle dankness."
"The description on the can explains this beer perfectly. However, I went the opposite direction and enjoyed this on a chilly fall evening while grilling out steaks for the last time this year. Best IPA I've had from the northeast to date; so smooth! Will definitely seek out more through trading and future Vermont vacations. Midwest comparison - fresh Two Hearted on tap. Similar floral/tropical aroma and flavor."
"Very underwhelming display. Nose and appearance were right, citrus pineapple and a hint of pine, Very fantasic nose. Taste was off, it was a 3 week old can, and it tasted like the malt took over, There taste had a little fruit to it, but the hop profile wasnt on display like it was in the nose, Disappointing overall for such a hyped beer,"
"After 3 unsuccessful trips to the beer cave at my liquor store i thought this brew was impossible to obtain. I always assume local vermont brews are in short supply, but this one in particular was a bitch to find. After I finally did get my hands on it I chilled it in the fridge for a solid hour, counting down the minutes till Lawsons. The opening was crisp and the aroma immediately struck me as a fresh hoppy smell. I mean this beer was made not one week beforehand, the aroma filled the room. I took my first sip out of the can and the taste seemed to change 3 or 4 times while just in my mouth. A light citrus turned into a hoppy crispness then to a true double ipa; airy but lets-you-know-its-8% finish. "
"Look - Pours a medium golden color, hazy with a nice cream colored head with heavy lacing."
"This is just a great beer. Period. Lawson crafts interesting (and sometimes challenging!) beers but S.O.S. is super smooth and and easy-drinking while at the same time completely loaded up with hops. The nose on this beer is amazing. The interesting thing about S.O.S. is that it doesn't linger. You get a great nose, its enjoyable on the palate and after you swallow you're left wanting for more. No extensive lingering bitter notes."
"Wow, just wow. Tons of juicyness and tropical fruits, nice sweet malty backbone. So supremely well balanced, and a nice fluffy mouthfeel, so good."
16 oz can into pint glass. 10/21/15
"Pours a glowing hazy orangy color, it's beautiful. Aroma is hoppy. Notes of citrus an resin. Flavor is citrusy, piny and a bit of bitter hops. Leaves a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. Overall a great IPA that I really enjoyed."
Great taste - would have liked more body to it - enjoyed on a nice summer day
"This is absolutely, hands down, the yummiest beer going. just finished a 4 beer show down, blind taste test with another beer lover friend - Heady Topper, Focal Banger, Julius, Sip of Sunshine. We both called Sip of Sunshine our favorite because it was the smoothest and had excellent flavor balance. Heady was behind it, but it seemed so complex (in a good way) after drinking the Sunshine. Was hard to absorb so much flavor in one night with those 4 beautiful cans!"
Awesome!
I was stoked to find stacks upon stacks of this at a quick-stop on the way to Hill Farmstead. The citrus on this makes it a splendid day drinker.
One of the greats. This beer is just how an IPA should taste. Citrus notes cascade over your tongue with a remarkable mouth feel.... Really quenching.
Look: Beautiful murky orange with a thick white head. 
World class for sure!
"Canned 10/3/15. Served in a pint glass around 50 degrees. Unbelievable brew. Citrus, pine, a touch of sweetness. Creamy mouthfeel. You must serve this beer at the proper temp to really let it shine."
Excellent IPA. Can't wait to have it again.
I didn't like the boozy aftertaste I got on the back end. The front end was fantastic though.
Can from a trip to VT
"L: very hazy, pale and a touch of gold. White medium sized head "
16oz can poured into a globe.
Fantastic! Nothing more.
"Canned on 10/3/2015. Body is clear, sunshine orange color with a thick white head of densely packed bubbles. The aroma hits you as soon as you crack the can. Lots of sweet orange, tropical fruit, and caramel/honey malts. Ripe grapefruit, resinous pine, mango puree, pineapple juice, guava, oniony dankness, honey, peach, and some melon. Flavor has good bitterness, balanced with honey sweetness and tropical fruit notes. Bitter grapefruit, candied orange, guava juice, spicy pine, apricot, peach puree, biscuit malts, honey, and pineapple. Very smooth and crisp. Dry, clean aftertaste of pleasant tropical citrus."
"Fantastic beer, had it in cans, big taste, not overly carbed and no alcohol taste at 8%. Love it."
"This beer deserves all its accolades. It has a gorgeous golden color and delicious aroma to get the taste buds prepped. Majorly hopped character right up front, but dry and carbonated enough to taste strong but still be refreshing. Grapefruit bitterness is the main player here, with touches of pine and orange.For a beer this flavorful in a 16 oz can, they go down so smooth that I have to count the empty cans to realize just how much I've drunk today. Similar but slightly more flavored and fuller that it's north VT brethren Heady Topper, I consider this among the best beers in New England."
"There are a few beers that have the appearance and aroma which are backed up by the balance and brilliance. When you taste something that is flawless, with excellent appearance, head, mouthfeel, aroma, and finish... Just give it a 5! This is just damn delicious!!!"
Look - A nice honey/golden orange color. Slight haze. Tons of carbonation. 
"Full of that citrus character that makes it so sought after. I mainly detected grapefruit. I enjoyed every sip, but preferred it as it mellowed towards room temp in a pint glass. Will be on the look out for this in Central CT coolers to replenish my personal stockpile."
One of the best DIPAs on the planet
"an absolutely wonderful IPA from Lawson's Finest. got this in a trade with another craft lover for some Tree House Julius and glad i did, The smell is very citrusy with a good balance of bitterness to citrus pop."
"The beer has a slightly hazy orange color. The aroma is tropical fruits and light malt. The taste is big tropical flavors, slight creaminess, and biscuity malt. It taste very similar to Wicked Weed's Pernicious. Exactly what I'm looking for in a beer"
Very nice IPA. I like it better than many of the other higher rated IPAs.
Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter. Bottom of can says 09/21/15.
"Drank from a spiegelau IPA glass. Poured a light amber, almost orange color. Huge off white head that hung around for a while. Aroma of the usual suspects, tropical and citrus fruits. Taste is pleasantly hoppy with malty sweetness midway through. Nice lacing. Overall this is a great beer. I could drink a lot of this beer and not much else. Very good."
"Was recommended this after the heady topper was sold out and couldn't be happier. I do love the heady, but this was a big surprise. "
Absolutely delicious!
This is by far the best double I have had to date. Had Heady right next to it and something about Sip just stands out above Heady. The aroma is just a blast to the senses - an unbelievable scent of sweet sweet citrus and dank hops. Unreal nasal experience (lol). 
"Pours an off white and pale yellow with a thin head. I had this out of the can and into a tulip glass. Smell is a mix of floral hops, grapefruit peel and a bit of resin."
Delicious VT IPA!
"Description: Slightly cloudy, golden color with a thin white head. Aroma is complex with a lot going on: citrus, peach, grapefruit, pine, orange, etc., and it all works together very well. Taste is initially fruity with peach and grapefruit and then slowly drifts into some bitterness at the end. The bitterness then fades into a very clean, dry finish. Carbonation is light to medium and the alcohol is well hidden and barely noticeable."
8/20 canning date. Taste better as it warms up.
A very good IPA. Not on the level of a Julius or Heady topper but very good. Less citrusy and fruit notes with a piny finish.
"Very clear, light golden in appearance. Huge juicy, tropical fruit on the nose. One of the best smelling beers I've had. The taste follows just as well, with an explosion of sweet, juicy, fruity goodness. Excellent."
Very good! I wish I had more!
"Clean, crisp, fruity and flavorful. Good stuff! Not unlike any other IPA, but I'm glad to have tried it."
"Very clean, well balanced IPA. Poured into a pint glass, light golden color with white head. Very easy to drink. One of the most well balanced IPAs I've tried. It's not a heady but almost like a good little sister of it."
The wonderful little sister of Heady Topper brightens your day with a sip. Not quite as complex as Heady but I don't think S o S was seriously trying to compete either. 
One of the best I've tasted. I'm in love. Currently in my Top 3
had it at 2015 GABF. Its delicious and my new favorite IPA.
"Excellence. Truly a remarkable IIPA. When fresh.....Maybe the cleanest, well balanced IIPA in existence.....right there with Dinner. Unfortunately you have about 2 weeks to drink or malt creeps in."
"This brew was hyped up to me by my beerseller. At the price he was asking I figured it was bound to be awesome. Unfortunately I was underwhelmed. Perhaps I wasnt in the right mood, or whatever, but I found it to be a bit more piney than I tend to like. Perhaps Im a bit spoiled by my access to my recent favorite brewery. I wouldnt say it was a bad brew and would definitely be willing to try it again with a clean and fresh palate."
finally got this at great american beer festival this year. lived up to the hype i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. all their beer were a cut above
"Light golden color, white head and lacing. Floral aroma, with hints of citrus and pine. Citrus taste, sweet biscuit, pine and floral. Excellent body, really smooth. Crazy easy to drink. What's the abv on this?! Excellent dipa"
Huge floral nose. Absolutely delicious. I actually preferred this to heady when had side by side. Less of a malt backbone but super smooth and balanced. Fruity citrus hope explosion. I wish I could get this regularly....
"If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life it would be this... Over Heady, Pliny, Abrasive, Lunch, etc any day. Sooo much flavor and complexity yet so drinkable."
Slick and resinous. Huge pine and grapefruit rind nose with some grassiness. Hop resin and extract flavor. Huge grassy/piney flavors balanced by a slick mouthfeel. Great all around IPA.
Look: Pours with a thick head lots of lacing and hazy color
Thanks to angrybabboon for the can.
"Pours gold with off white head. Faint aroma. Taste is a creamy passion fruit and mango juice. Light residual bitterness. One criticism is that the lingering bitterness interferes with the tropical fruit in subsequent sips. Still sunshine though. One of the best IPAs out there, one I prefer to Heady."
16 oz can poured into Spiegelau glass 
"Canned 8/21. I poured into oversized wine goblet like I do for review purposes for imperial IPAs, although sometimes, I do drink them in the can. Maybe with my last one, I'll drink It canned and see if my review is different. A – cloudy, orange and gold colors, strong and slightly lasting head and carbonation. Looks exactly like I want this style to. S – hops, citrus, dank, all strong, balanced well. T – follows up exactly where expected off the nose. It's piney as well, which helps with these. F – a wonderful blend of crisp and smooth, with just the right amount of bitter aftertaste. It took me three cans of this to determine I would pick it over Heady or Pliny. Of course, then a friend reminded me that this is a different beer that those. I swear, this drinks more like an ideal Imperial IPA than the other two… Oh well. Simply an outstanding beer no matter how you describe it."
"Sip of Sunshine presents with a beautiful hazy golden color, one inch of white head, not a great deal of lacing, and dank tropical fruit on the nose. Tropical fruit hits the palate upfront and moves to dank bitter hop finish. There's a pleasing soft mouth feel. This is a sipping beer. The complexity of the flavors lends itself to slow sipping. I can't wait to try more of Lawson's offerings. This is a masterfully crafted IPA."
"World class!? Not for me. A good, solid IPA for sure. Well rounded. But to be honest, it's not quite a ""4"". Better beers locally than this for me. I think hype gives people high expectations and they follow through with their ratings for that ""me too"" warm fuzzy feeling. I do like this beer though...just not that much."
As close to the impeccable Heady Topper as I've tasted.
Can dated 7/24/15 poured in to glass. Cloudy opaque appearance just the way I like it. Aroma is tropical as described with a bit of apricot and floral dankness. Taste follows suit with a touch of sweetness and pine. Feel is great and has that oily resin finish that some many NE beers seem to have. Very smooth and satisfying.
Tasted better as it warmed
"Poured into a Trillium tulip, looks wonderful. Huge nose of tropical fruits... pineapple, papaya, tangerine, citrus zest, some earthy pine and a definite caramel malt. smells great from the can as well, light grassyness and a chemical dankness that I really really enjoy. taste is similar, big hop presence up front, candied fruits and nice sweet malts are definitely working well together. Finishes with a nice amount of bitterness and a wonderful creamy feel. very refreshing, goes down very easy. one of the best doubles out there, highly recommend this beer!"
Drank from a 16oz. can dated 9/3/15.
A: Hazed golden color with a monstrous fluffy white head. Loads and loads of lacing with each sip. Looks amazing.
"This is the kind of IPA that ruins other IPAs. When people describe beer using terms like 'juicy' or 'tropical', the referenced beers are accurately described but also subtle. SOS hits you in the face with flavors of citrus, pineapple, apricot, mango and an amalgamation of insane tropical fruits. Take small sips and the bitterness will linger as a pleasant afterthought, while the that 'juiciness' comes in headfirst along with a balancing yeast in the aftertaste. The result is a sweet, juicy, not overly bitter, and very balanced Double (yes) IPA. My palate is officially spoiled forever. If you see it hoard it."
Had a two month old bomber (would love to try fresher). Pours a medium yellow color. Good citrus aroma. taste is smooth and crisp. perfect balance between malt and hops. Good body. Lots of citrus and especially lemon coming through. Good juicy finish. Will be seeking fresher in the future.
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to a stemmed, tulipped, oversized wineglass. This was purchased a little under two weeks ago, and according to the date printed on the underside of the can it was canned on August 24, 2015 (“08/24/15 10:55”), which would make this cab just over two weeks old. It’s been kept in good conditions. "
This beer gives Heady a run for it's money. I would probably say it's better.
"Pours a hazy golden tangerine orange shade. A big, fluffly, pillowy white head emerges. 1.5 fingers, and sticky, lacy, staying power for days. Beautiful beer here. "
22oz bottle poured into a snifter.
By far the best IPA I've ever had. I've read reviews for other beers I've had describing a tropical fruit taste. This IPA is the first one I've had that has a very distinct tropical fruit taste and aroma. It seems like a strange taste to have in a beer but works perfectly for this one and all the flavors are perfectly balanced. Be sure to follow the instructions on the bottle and keep refrigerated.
"Highly floral notes emerge from an almost pilsner like beer. Very dank. Translucent gold with cakey white head. Light tropical fruits; dragonfruit, jackfruit, passionfruit. Fuzzy fruit; kiwi and apricot. Delicate pine resin. Background orange bitters. Mellow and soft. Medium carb."
"Finally can say I've had a sip. Tropical vacation, sooooo drinkable and delicious"
Poured into a teku from a 16oz can dated 7/21/15.
This is one exceptional brew. I say we all come together and pay these guys to educate the rest of the brewers in the US. 
Came across this beer on accident on a business trip. This beer is s bad ass IPA...everything that you could ask for. Loads of floral hops and a sticky lacing to match. Anytime anyone I know goes to the east coast...I ask they keep their eyes open for me.
I bought a 4-pack of this about 10 days ago up in Winooski VT (for about $14.00 or so). Getting into a 16oz can right now out in The 'Zebo.
"The fruity notes are everywhere. I usually love the unfiltered opaque hazy Tree House IPA look, but this look has more of a Pliny look to it. Hops are well balanced in with the citrus and malts and this is a very smooth drinkable beer. Not sure how the ABV is 8% and their Double Sunshine DIPA is 8%, this is categorized as an IPA and drinks like an IPA but has the ABV of a double but I'm not complaining. 5 star."
"This was a bonus beer when a buddy was able to get me some Heady Topper while in Vermont. It wasn't on my radar but I'm glad he picked it up. Fantastic IPA with rich hop depth, lots of fruit and just a hint bitterness. Light in colour, tight carbonation."
16oz can received in a trade.
Look - Slightly cloudy
"pours a medium orange/yellow. very fine particles make the beer hazy, although the beer between the particles is pretty see through. smell is pretty balanced, citrus and sweet malts on the nose. taste is much much more intense than smell, huge juice hop bomb. citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, tropical bomb with slight pine and resin, slight bready malts also coming through. sweet but not sugary. mouthfeel is decent, good carbonation but the beer feels slightly thick and slick. very good brew coming out of 2Roads factory. hard to find too."
"Poured from a can dated August 10, 2015"
"Very nice beer but in this day and age, this once one of a kind best of the best IPA's has a lot of competition now but I'm still thoroughly impressed. I will be happy drinking my local OH stuff that is just as on par with it, though."
"This beer is overrated and overhyped! I wouldn't put it on my top 10 IPAs. In a blind taste test I believe many off the shelf IPAs would beat it purely on taste. The look and smell are first rate. It smells like mangos and citrus. The taste just doesn't do much and actually gets tiring to drink. I find the hops to be uninspired and not the best in terms of integration with the malt. I thought maybe it was my palette so two days later I had another's SOS. No better. No excuses for this IPA. It was fresh, had plenty of head and smelled good. However, It's drinkability is just average."
Wow. Thrilled to finally try this beer. Canned on 8/10. Enjoyed on 8/25. Pours great. Juicy explosion with a great creamy finish. Am truly enjoyable beer in every aspect.
"Nice rich golden color, hazy, huge fluffy white head and lacing. Smell is more notice out of the can, lots of citrus. Taste is tangerines and a touch of lemon, light and refreshing for such a strong beer. Easily the best mouthfeel out of any beer I've had, creamy and almost feels like it's been on nitro. World class."
"Had on draft in a 12oz mug. This beer pours a brilliant shade of bright yellow, slightly hazy. Small white head, but great carbonation and excellent lacing. Smell is a hop fruit bomb... aroma is an explosion mango, grapefruit, pineapple, orange and some floral hops as well. The taste is exactly the same on the front end, but mid sip a heavy dose of pine and bitterness appears and then quite a dry finish. Feel is light and very carbonated, the 8% is extremely well hidden. Overall this is up there with the best IPAs I've ever had. Never had a beer that starts off so juicy amd fruity, but transitions to a bitter finish so perfectly. Absolutely outstanding!"
"What a great beer. I'm a bit of a hop head and really love a good, smooth, flavorful IPA--SoS is just that! The smell is great, not overbearing on any one hop over the other (citrus, etc.) and very well balanced. The taste is smooth from start to finish and masks the 8% ABV very well. Simply put, this is a phenomenal beer."
"Medium, honey colour with billowing head, lacing, and aggressive carb. Big grapefruit and pineapple with mint and floral aromas. Taste follows the nose. The fruits give way to grapefruit pith and the bitter finish overpowers the fruit a little. Mouth feel is creamy with medium carb. Very nice beer."
"First off wow. I'm normally not a huge fan of overly fruity beers but this is a fantastically crafted beer. I poured this lovely beverage into my pint glass out of a bomber I received in a trade. It pours a vibrant hazy orange color that says drink me after an all day hike. The aroma packs in a perfect mix of hops and tropical fruits that matches the taste perfectly. Upon the first sip your palette is hit with all these flavors but not overpowered. The light, crisp and clean flavor has the right amount of carbonation making for an awesome mouth feel. My overall thoughts on this long winded review are try this beer. This is the perfect beer for a hike, picnic or the beach."
"This one came to me as a complete surprise. One of my awesome regulars at work casually dropped it on me on a whim. Really bursts with sweet citrus fruits without being too sweet or malty like some higher ABV IPAs can be. Very clean on the tongue easy to drink...it was hard for me to give a few minutes to warm up a little, I really just wanted to drink this one. Hides the 8% incredibly well. Finishes with a mild hop bitterness but in a good way. Will definitely have this one again."
Sooo good. Every time I open a can of this .. I fall in love all over again
"Consumed 8/25/15, canned 8/10/15"
Another fantastic brew.
"Incredibly smooth, not too bitter. Very citrusy with hints of grapefruit, mango, and orange. The drinkability is outstanding. Much easier to get than Heady Topper and in my opinion, slightly better."
Very similar to heady topper. Crisp and clean flavor. It's much easier to come by than heady topper and honesty every bit as good. I encourage you to seek this beer out
Lemon base ipa with a great after taste
"Golden hue that is light on taste, but big with flavor. Hops are subtle but a refreshing citrus taste. The citrus isn't overwhelming, but still present. Def one of my personal faves. I keep it on the shelf as long as possible. If you can get this trade for it!"
Huge thanks to nograz for generously giving me a can of this.
Big thanks to Kevin for this one. A bomber poured into a matching lawsons snifter. The brew appears a hazy golden color with a firm 2 finger white cap that slowly fades painting the walls with soapy suds of lace.
"Poured from a tall boy can into a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, slightly hazed, golden orange coloring with a fluffy, dense, bubbly, clingy, white head. Beautiful. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, candi sugar, a subtle caramel backbone, heavy doses of resinous hops, pine, subtle pepper spice, and a blast of grass. Unbelievably balanced nose. Flavors are juicy and sweet forward, a perfect balance of orange, grapefruit, subtle tropical notes, and a candi sweetness, all balanced by a heavy resinous hops presence, heavy on piney notes, cut grass, and dank vegetal notes. Amazingly balanced palate, with a lingering resinous character into the aftertaste. The hops aftertaste is highlighted by tart grapefruit and orange, and both linger on through the smooth, dry finish. This is a beast of a beer!"
"Watching the (unmarked) Lawson's truck pull in to the smalltown Vermont grocery (minutes before the Heady delivery) was a sight for sore eyes, especially after rising before the sun with two wee ones in tow for the trek north to obtain this rare gem of a brew. Pours bright and translucent from the pint can with a moderate head, slight carbonation and tight lacing. No eye-bulging hop blast here but a delectably mild tropical ecstasy of passionfruit and tangerine with a hint of clove, and a finish smoother than shea butter on your....well, I digress. Lawson's is freak fluid - the finest liquids fo' sho'. Make the journey for this epic summer ale."
"Though the label claims 8% ABV, it drinks incredibly smooth. It's a hoppy brew, but isn't very bitter unlike some of it's counterparts (Heady Topper or TH Green). Worth trying to find, but there are other IPAs out there that should boast a similar if not higher rating."
"The more citrus-forward and less bitter of VT's famous two, SOS is a world class IPA that sits among Heady, Pliny, and 2x4 as my favorite IPAs in the world. Bright and floral with plenty of fresh hop dankness, in addition to being perhaps the most ""drinkable"" world class IPA alongside Pliny, this is certainly one to seek out."
"I felt the need to edit my original rating. The first time I had Sip was on tap and now I wonder if it was old or the lines weren't clean because I've now enjoyed it on tap as well as in cans and my opinion has changed greatly. This beer lives up to the hype. It is right there with the many outstanding VT brews such as Heady, 2nd Fiddle etc. Not quite the juice bomb of some DIPA's out there - think Treehouse - but just such a smooth, tasty - drinkable beer plus you'd never know it was a 8.0 ABV if you didn't read the can. Superb brew and worth seeking out."
6 weeks old from a 22oz bottle. My first time trying this and I was not disappointed as it lived up to all the hype. Bright and fresh with a wonderful hop smell and taste. Glad to finally get to try it!
"In New England, we are extremely spoiled with local IPA's & DIPA's...Heady, Lunch, Congress & Melcher, Julius & Green, Abner and Susan..."
"16 oz can. Hazy light orange amber, thick white head that slowly fades to a consistent thin layer, lacing. Aroma is a blast of citrus, wow! The up front flavor is a delish blend of grapefruit peel, fruity sweetness, a little apricot, bready notes. Great balance. The back end is a bitter earthiness, some grass. Not crazy about the finish. Mouthfeel is super soft. Overall a top notch IPA with a ton of different flavors."
The best beer on the planet
Excellent tasting clean finishing beer
"From the 16 oz can dated 08/10/15. Sampled on Aug 13, 2015. Pretty darn fresh."
"Purchased a Case at the Warren store, Thursday morning at 11:30am. "
"Not fresh, canned 4 month ago, but most of the time stored in a fridge. Transparent yellow colour, small pale head, lacing down the glass. Smells like fresh tropical fruits with notes of pine and flowers. Very much mango, pineapple, grapefruit. Palate same as the smell. Bitterness, sweetness creates wonderful cocktail. The mouthfeel is great, so smooth so delicious. It’s real summer delight. I would like to try a fresher sample."
"Poured into a snifter glass. Bright orange, less cloudy than previous batches but still slightly hazy. Smell is a ton of orange, mango, and pineapple, all really balanced and bright. Taste is similar, super juicy and slightly sweet. Malt is light, but not non-existent, adding the touch of sweetness that compliments the hop burst. The bitterness is very low, and the mouthfeel on this is super creamy, with a perfect amount of carbonation. Extremely well made and delicious, worth the hype."
"Pours a bit hazy, golden to light orange"
"On tap at Pizzeria Mazzo - Danbury, CT"
"I was able to get a case of this last week at the Warren Store, and it was as fresh as could be. An outstanding beer that Sean Lawson truly puts his heart and soul into."
Appearance - hazy golden color liquid with white head
Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
It's hard to rate a beer as a favorite. But this is definitely close to such.
"The aroma is intoxicatingly tropical, and the taste is like a juicy IPA-flavored Starburst"
Better the heady
Poured from a 16 oz. can into a tall stange style glass. Canned on date 06/08/2014
"Poured from a week old can into a tulip glass. Appears a light golden color with two fingers of head. Aroma is of sweet sap, grapefruit, and pine. Taste is tropical fruits (grapefruit, orange), honey, and sweet pine notes. The finish has some mild bitterness but overall not at all bitter. The mouth feel is smooth. Overall this is another world class NE hoppy beer."
"In Vermont, this is the ""insider's"" new best IPA, including by some who, in hushed whispers and darting glances, call it better than Heady Topper. While technically it's not a Double IPA, it's almost as strong as Heady in terms of alcohol, but does much less with it in the flavor."
Rating is from the recent 22oz bottle release.
22oz about 3 weeks old into a snifter
Tall boy can poured into HF wine stem.
this is the first time i've had a Lawson's that wasn't a collaboration. wow. this is a gorgeous IPA. the fruitiness reminds me of passion fruit / grapefruit. it's a very creamy mouth feel. i love it. i wish i could get more of this consistently. i'll have to make a trip to Vermont just to get more.
"This one pours a lovely golden yellow with a creamy white head; leaves plenty of attractive lacing on the side of the glass as well. The smell is extremely tropical at first - think shoving your nose into some hybrid of mango and pineapple. There's a little bit of hoppy bitterness mixed with profound dankness in the nose as the beer warms as well. My first taste was slightly less tropical than I was expecting, but is ultimately very consistent with the bright fruity nose. As the beer reaches the back of my throat the tropical fruit flavors segue seamlessly into some a bouquet of hop flavors, before finishing bitter and leaving me wanting another sip almost immediately. "
"The hype is true. Unfiltered golden look. Citrus after taste, delicious."
Got this in a trade. Poured from the can into a SA perfect pint glass. Smell has a decent amount of tropical fruit and some pine to it. Taste is consistent with that but not mind blowing. I would best compare this to Booming Rollers or Jai Alai. Good not great.
"Pours with a two-finger head that smells of a mixture of tropical fruit (pineapple, passion fruit) and citrus. Taste is a nice blend of hop bitterness and citrus, though not quite as tropical as the smell would suggest. The flavor is very well-balanced. My wife said it reminded her of Deschutes Fresh Squeezed (but obviously much much more delicious!)."
"Overall a smooth IPA. Have to say the citrus IPAs are refreshing as is this one. Poured a nice head. Smells pungant like passion fruit. Drinks crisp. No bitterness. Not as smooth as Treehouse, nice summer beverage."
"Here it goes. The infamous sos. Pours a gorgeous hazy orange color. Smells of oranges, hops, and some pine. Taste follows suit. Wow. I definitely see the hype here. Creamy mouthfeel. Excellent stuff."
Poured a really nice golden orange color from the can. The nose is nice and tropical and juicy and the taste surpasses the nose. It's very satisfying and juicy with some nice malt and hardly any bitterness at all. Finishes very clean and refreshing.
"This is the best beer I have ever had. I was able to score a case and half on a recent trip to Vermont. WOW. I just can't get enough. Switching from the can to pouring in a glass, and had on tap up in Vermont, all ways are just spectacular. If I ever try to make beer on my own, this will be my target/goal..."
"Pretty stunned by the 100 rating on BA. There is a funk, that I assume comes from the yeast used in this brew that comes through in the aroma and flavor of this beer. I'm assuming this is not a bad batch, but I have my reservations. I'm very curious now as to what yeast is used. If it is 1056 or 001, something is definitely amiss. This beer would have been far better if it had a cleaner, more neutral fermentation. Color, clarity and mouthfeel is solid. Overall, a big disappointment."
"I work at a liquor store and when I can get this I do. Jeez Louise it's so damn good. Usually I get a can so who knows what it looks like, but who cares. One time I did have it at a bar on tap and showed it to a few friends, everyone was in agreement and awe of it's greatness, and it has a nice deep golden hue to it. Then another time my boss bought all the employees a keg of it that we drank while playing wiffleball one sunday this summer and I remember thinking how goddamn awesome it was even on my like 6th pour into a red solo cup."
Ultra grapefruit flavor in an amazing way. Smooth with not the slightest hint of bitter.
"The finest East Coast IPA I've tried. All citrus and fruit without a hint of bitter. Sweet, but not cloying, and it has an amazing mouthfeel and finish."
appearance- Golden amber and pretty clear. Pours a two to three inch head. 
Nice orange color with a fluffy white head. Nice lacing down the glass. Nose of citrus and slight pint resin scent. Citrus up front finished with a floral bouquet in the mouth. Juicy chewy hop finish. All around enjoyable and leaves you wanting more!
Can dated 7/10/15; drank from an 8 oz tumbler glass on 7/22/15
16 oz can poured into a Stone RIS tulip
"The furthest thing from an IPA guy on most occasions, but SOS is an exception. I wanted to drink a few of these on different occasions and from different batches to give a review for fairness sake. Being that there has been little to no inconsistency I can safely say this is one of the best regularly available IPAs on the market."
Fresh clean tropical and too easy drinking. I wish I could get this more often and it would be a go to beer for me. One of my favorite ipas for certain
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright yellow color ale with a nice foamy head with great retention and some excellent lacing. Aroma of grassy floral notes with light citrusy undertones is just about perfect. Taste is also dominated by super fresh grassy notes with citrusy undertones, very limited bitterness with some tropical fruit notes. Body a light oily texture with average body and good carbonation. A little sweeter then IU would have liked but just about perfect overall."
"Usually not a big IPA guy, but this beer was an exception "
"July 2, 2017. On tap at [name withheld to protect the innocent]. Since my first taste back in '15 this white whale has been on my wish list every Christmas, Birthday & ""...no it really was nothing to simply plug your mouse back in to get your computer to work again, but if you insist, I'd love a Lawson's Sip o' the next time you drive through CT"" request list."
"This is exactly what an IPA should taste like. Though Double Sunshine may be better this still is immensely complex and delicious. Tropical fruits, passion fruit, tangerines, nectarines, oranges and light grapefruit meld with a sweet caramel backbone. So easy to drink and so delicious."
Reminiscent of Pliny the Elder
Very good beer.
"this is a single IPA just like ZD is a pale ale. there has to be sugar, or syrup in there somewhere. i don't know how a single IPA has 8% and That much hop..."
Pale golden color with a rich full head. 
This is yellow canned perfection. Every time.
"Lawson’s Sip of Sunshine IPA is so good that it’s almost bad (explanation to follow). Remember the Tang commercials from the early 2000s with the karate chimps? SoS looks, smells, and tastes just like the juice bags that those ridiculously coordinated chimps used to sell! To be clear, I’m talking about Tropical Tremor (not that Cherry Craze crap). Now use those opposable thumbs to crack open this fruit bomb of an IPA and find out what I mean. Without a doubt, the most striking quality of SoS is its appearance— although I seriously doubt that anybody ever took the time to pour a Tang pouch into a glass, I feel like they would look identical. A vibrant goldenrod (orange/yellow) radiates from the glass as scents of orange, lemon, and pineapple stimulate your nose (and slowly evolve into a lingering tangerine/grapefruit fragrance. And now for the most important part… there is a problem: SoS lulls your taste buds into expecting a Tropical Tremor Tang juice (a vastly underappreciated beverage by the way), and as a result, your mouth is shocked by the bitterness of the IPA style. Once you are able to accept that the amazing smell and appearance of this beverage (and their other brews) will lead to drink a beer and not a juice-like fruit drink, you will come to respect Lawson’s as one of the premier IPA-makers on the East Coast."
"Drank most of it from the can so hard to give an accurate rating on look. This was a near perfect IPA though, I loved every second of drinking it. Big thanks goes to Laura for sending this little gem to Wisconsin."
Hazy orange color with moderate white head retention. Tropical fruits and pine mingle in the smell with citrus playing a bigger part in the taste. Drinks easy but slight alcohol on the finish. Overall a fantastic brew.
"Pours a hazey yellow in the glad with a two finger head. Smells like pineapple, taste has citrus up front and a big hop finish. Can't wait to get my hands on more. Greet beer!"
Maybe my favorite IPA to date
"A- 2 finger thick white head, hazy golden body, pure. S - floral, tropical fruits, hints of pine. T - where this beer makes its name, smooth,tasty plump juicy hops. O - great beer."
"Wow! Thanks to my brother I'm enjoying this in a can here in Imperial, CA. Poured into a tulip glass, nice 1 1/2 in head and lacing stuck to the glass very well. Smell was good and the tasted even better. Had both heady topper and SIP side by side with heady taking the edge by a hair. I thought both had there own characteristics but very similar at times. Great beer! Hope to have it again some day."
"A great juicy citrus brew! First sip blew me away, and each after. Not everyone will like it, I'm sure...but it is a must try!"
That's it. I need to go to Vermont. I can not believe how good the Vermont ales are. Between this and heady I don't think I could pick a winner. So much tropical fruit on this I'd swear it was fermented on juice.
"Draught @ Cambridge House: This one pours a hazy lighter shade of honey. There was about no head on it and no lacing. The aroma was very nice. Tropical fruit hops, as well as grapefruit and floral notes. The taste is excellent. It has a full body, yet almost feels delicate in your mouth. A plethora of hop flavors, with tropical fruit tastes being the most prevalent. An excellent beer. One that lived up to the hype."
Citrus up front taste. Very similar to Heady.
The nose of this beer is so fantastic! Great mouthfeel and such a burst of hoppy goodness that keeps coming in wave after delicious wave. This beer defintely lives up to all the hype.
"Absolutely fantastic. Very approachable IPA, hop flavor up front, but ends with a bit of a sweet note at the end, making for a great finish. As far as how it pours, I drink from the can so I couldnt tell you."
"If you can get your hands on some, get as much as you can. Great IPA. Very refreshing. So good. 100 all the way."
"A - Golden orange, hazy transparency, white head forming tight and white, with extensive lacing."
Pretty much everything you want in an ipa. Incredible stuff.
"Sip of Sunshine is right! Had the chance to enjoy one of these on tap at Prohibition Pig in Beertown, VT (Waterbury). The atmosphere was awesome; the beer was out of this world!"
"what a great overall IPA, amazing smell, feel and taste a true CLASSIC!"
"Aroma is resiny and grassy initially, turning citrusy, with fresh cut grass."
Another amazing brew in the NE!
updated 2017 review
"Poured on tap, a very bright copper color with a fingers head that fades but the lacing is excellent. Smells of juicy tropical fruits, pineapple, grapefruit, orange. The taste just explodes, it's the juiciest beer I've ever had. Tastes so fresh. It's crisp and refreshing. The mouth feel is great. Pleasant the whole way through, good carbonation."
"pours a mostly clear golden color with a nice head, smell is mostly tropical hops with some malts ,Taste is topical hops with notes of mango,papaya, nice floral and juicy citrus also its very good a touch of malts , medium carbonation with bright floral hops they are in charge a touch of bitterness with each, superb IPA"
S-fruity citrus and tropical goodness with a substorms malty backbone
"Can; thanks for sharing, Emma!"
A: Pours a clear honey gold with two fingers of white head that fades into a frothy ring with great lacing.
"Appears a bright, ret hazy orange."
This was good but not particularly impressive.
Jesus this a dandy. Know a few who talked it up and unlike many this met the hype.
"This one is up there with one of the top beers I've ever tasted. Very floral and taste of citrus and tropical fruits. Hop oils linger on the palate for a while, to my content. This beer raises the bar to another level amongst competitors. Fantastic brew."
"Amber gold body with a good amount of haze. Two finger white soapy head fades to a weak ring with nice, wet lacing."
"People herald this biz as the crème de la crop, I was out in Denver and saw a can of this as a trophy. I’ve had it before, but after my CO trip let’s see if it’s changed at all."
Tropical and lush. Wow. This is good stuff.
Damn this one is good. Really complex flavor and feel.
The beer had a smooth mouth feel and was easy to drink. I agree with the description on the can that the beer is juicy and has floral aromas.
"I really enjoyed this beer the smell when I first open the can was great, kept smelling it. The taste was also great smooth feel. Very good iPa"
Had on May 31st at Owl Shop in New Haven. 16 oz can into a glass.
Exceptional brew. May have taken my number 3 spot for brews.
16oz can poured into Spiegelau tulip.
Soooo good. First new wow beer I have had in a while
In my top 3. Love it.
Look: Golden color in my Tulip glass
This is a beer that has a permanent locker space in my head. It was one of the first beers that blew my mind and kicked off my personal IPA fascination. A simple 2 ounce pour at a CBF a while ago was all it took. Now it is being distributed in MA. Unreal. 
What IPAs strive to be....
Excellent head retention. Knockout tropical flavor on the nose. Light floral notes and medium piney finish.
"Got a can of this on a trade as an extra. Poured a darker burnt orange color. Not much head, although I poured it very slowly. Light fruity bitter taste. Sort of a resin finish. Fairly malty in the flavor though. It’s a pretty darn good beer. Liked the Julius I also got as an extra a little more though."
Scent is really off giving a bad vibe immediately. The aroma lies here. This layered DIPA provides cirus flavors on top of earthy tones that set this beer apart from others. The aromas are a bit funky but do not let them determine your rating. Light malt bill let the hops showcase in this brew. Impossible to find on the west coast but reasonable when trading with the east coast. I got a fresh can which is neccesary ith this beer.
16oz can dated 4/27/15 poured into a SN/DFH IPA glass
Had poured from bottle and can into snifter.
"Had this on tap at Prohibition Pig in Vermont, and I was really impressed. Was on a Heady run and the local beer shop man pointed me at this beer. Couldn't find any in cans - unsurprisingly - but had it on tap, and enjoyed it thoroughly."
"16oz can, another stellar mule effort from doktorzee to get this white whale in front of me. Given that today is sunny and pushing +30C in May, this seems like an appropriate offering."
Canned 4/27/15
"Great tones of citrus, refreshing but strong. An easy beer to drink anytime."
"Another gem! This is another extremely well made beer. Citrus and sweet at the same time. Can't forget how the hops add to the mouthfeel! Crisp, slight bitterness and a smooth, dry finish. One of the best....Save Our Ship (SoS)...we need some more SIP!"
"Pours amber in color with a two finger head. Very noticeable carbonation. Smells of citra, fruit... almost pineapple. Taste is bitter and smooth. The citrus doesn't seem to stand out as much as it did in the smell. Seems so well balanced it's hard to say it's leaning heavily in any direction -- other than delicious. Very easy to drink. Was really looking forward to this beer and it's certainly among the best I've had the privilege of trying. Highly recommended."
"First had SoS from a shared pint can, sent to one friend by another, and had most recently from a pint can, surreptitiously removed from first friend's beer fridge (he lives in Vermont; he can afford to ""share""), poured into tulip. Who would distract themselves by making tasting notes while drinking this beer?"
VT beers are superb IMO
Looks like an IPA
"Tropical notes, refreshing and balanced."
Gives Heady a run for it's money.
"Obtained at local liquor store and enjoyed in Two Roads glassware (where this is brewed). Orange in color with a sweet, fruity nose. Definitely has a straight up concentrated hop flavor. Medium to full body for this IPA with pleasant carbonation. This beer really is a vacation in a glass. Cannot wait to have a bunch of these during the hot summer days ahead. One of my favorite IPA's for sure!"
"Not quite Double Sunshine, but for how much more obtainable it is, I love this beer."
Cheers Tommy for the killer VT 6pack!! Pours a lovely orange-gold with a finger of white head that leaves some great lacing behind.
My last of a 4-pack :(
Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy amber with a decent head that leaves a few squiggles of lacing
A nice blend of sweet and hop spice. Overall not the bright juicy flavor expected but a nice change of pace from some of the standard citrus-only IPA's it gets compared to.
16oz can poured into a Lawson's stemmed glass.
"Yep - it lives up to the hype. Eleven days old. Tropical nose, sweet and mildly bitter. Tay-stee!"
"Wanted to love this beer, but it just didn't have the in-your-face tropical fruit hop flavor I was expecting based on word of mouth and reviews. A very good DIPA, but there are others in the category I prefer with similar hop profiles."
Glad I got to try this one.
This stuff lived up to the hype for me! Super full of citrus and pine. Not overly bitter which I loved.
"Simply a delicious, lots fruit flavor, hops are balanced. Probably my favorite IPA thus far."
"Serving: 16 oz. can poured into a tulip. Canned on 4/13/15, making this exactly 3 weeks old. "
"Delicious beer! This is a big bold IPA, but so well balanced that there are no overly protruding flavors or tastes or sensations. This is extremely drinkable, smooth and robust. Instantly tops my charts of big IPAs (maybe just behind Dinner)."
Canned 4/13/2015.
An all around awesome IPA (DIPA).
One of the best IPA's I've had. Love this beer.
A= Great color and head retention
"Delicious and refreshing IPA. Full of hops, wonderful aroma."
"Pretty fresh. Canned on April 13, 2015."
Basically the best beer ive ever had
"1 month old can, drinking very well"
Can dated 4/13/15 and enjoyed 4/27/15.
"A-golden hues, looks a lot like a saison. Inch of fluffy white head."
Exactly what you are looking for. Exactly.
"One of the best beers I have tried. Had it on draft and in cans, both fantastic. Clean and hoppy with a tropical fruit taste that tells your mouth to have another sip. Fantastic."
pint can. poured into a spiegelau ipa glass. Dated 03.20.15. consumed 04.15.15.
"Stunning, very refined. Great smooth feel, aroma is perfect."
"I think this rivals Heady. Great taste, body, the whole thing. The way they have incorporated the hops and fruit character is amazing."
"All I can say is...wow, what a phenomenal beer!!!"
Lives up to the hype and well worth the time invested tracking this one down.
"An average head, very foamy and cloud-like in appearance, dissipates rather quickly but leaves phenomenal lacing. Golden appearance, mainly clear but a bit of hazy. Very floral nose with a nice bright citrus presence. A really nice balance of sweet and bitter which a touch of acidity. The flavour dance on your tongue and the malt keeps them all in balance. The finish is a touch of sweet and bitter that sticks around for quite some time."
Its like a tropical hop trip for your mouth
"Not the citrus, fruit loop punch I was hoping for but still an excellent IPA."
By far the best beer I ever had all around
The fresher the better this beer is.
Thanks to mrbubbler for sharing this one at Retsinis' tasting.
Excellent. The chase was as much enjoyment as the drink. It took me over a year to find this.
"The best beer available in my area and probably my all time favorite beer. I like to tell people that, in my opinion, this is the best beer available in the states today. I'm on a search to find one better, and it hasn't happened yet."
"Received a bounty of fantastically fresh SoS thanks to fellow BA JamesonTrades. So much that I was compelled to share with some local beer friends of mine. Reviewing from my notes after enjoying this particular one on 2/28 out of a 16 oz can and poured into a Speigelau IPA glass. The bottom is marked with a canning date of 2/13, so it's just a baby at two weeks old."
4/11/15
"SOS on draft is awesome. That's what my rating reflects. Two Roads is not brewing as good as Sean Lawson. In a can, it gets about a 4.1 overall rating."
Love this beer. One of the best double IPA I have had the pleasure of tasting. Hate how hard it is to find.
Served in an IPA glass from a 16oz can
Tried on draft in burlington. Had Heady and Abner for the first time on the trip and this was absolutely in any conversation for best beer of the trip. Just beautiful hoppy goodness with to die for nose.
Been trading for the last couple months and have 20+ on the top 250 list. This is probably my favorite.
Most amazing liquid sensation on the planet...
Just a fantastic beer. Lived up to the hype for me.
Great tropical fruit aroma and unique hoppy flavor.
One of my favorite beers currently!
"Pours a hazy orange w ample head and great lacing. Smells piney, citrusy and tropical. Tastes of citrus in the front followed by tropical fruits with little malt backbone. Mouthfeel is smooth. This is a great beer!!"
Canned 2/20 drinking on 4/6 stored cold
"This is probably my favorite IPA out there. I am a new englander, and my vote goes here over heady topper. I can't get my nose away from the can after I pour it into a glass. I amost feel bad about getting rid of the can! I can smell grapefruit, pineapple, and other tropical fruits in the aroma of this one. The taste pretty much yields the same. It's like taking a tropical vacation in a can. I absolutely love this beer and it has quickly become my go to. I only wish it was a little easier to get."
16 oz can.
"A: Hazy, light orange/golden yellow in color with plenty of bubbles coming to the surface. Pours a nice foamy white head."
"Obviously this is a good beer. Although the hype behind it may be leading to some of the higher than high scores. Most of the hype is valid. This is an ipa in the upper echelon for sure. Comparable to Heady, 077xx, Juju, Pliny and others that live up to the hype."
1821st Review on BA
"Maybe I got a bad batch from the two roads location... Was super excited when I read about this beer and saw the 100 ba rating. Unfortunate that I don't see it, but the flavor profile was not for me. Did not get a glimpse of floral or citrus AT ALL. For me it's a bitter hoppy booze ridden ipa, that is very mildly carbonated. I can feel the boozy heat in my stomach. It's not that I dislike this beer at all but I don't think it lived up to my expectations of dipa due to the amount of wonderful ones I have had lately."
Super juicy with tropical fruit all over the place. Incredibly easy drinking this is an example of a perfect beer. Lawson is on top of his game right now!
"I had tried Sip of Sunshine three months ago. Was unimpressed, but to be fair I gave it a second shot this past weekend."
Great beer. One of my faves
Intriguing floral notes and well balance hop flavor. A truly nice IPA and I'm generally not an IPA fan.
Poured from can into tulip. Excited to try!
Exceptional beer at a great cost now that it's canned. .
Nice double from the can. Love those hops.
Pored a lightly hazy beautiful light honey color. Decent creamy head but with little retention. 
"My first moment tasting the beer occurred in...São Paulo?!? I was shipped a pair of cans which were brought to Fil's apartment, and part of the reward is taking part of tasting it. From a 16 ounce can, on to the beer:"
Double Sunshine's little brother. Close enough that it's almost indistinguishable.
One of my favorites. On a relative level of dankness as Heady Topper honestly. I got to try this once so far and it was incredible but I also had a toothache which prevented me from making an in-depth review or enjoying it as fully as I could. I nonetheless determined it to be one of my top 5 IPA's. Would love to grab this again. It literally tastes and smells and FEELS like the tropical vacation it promises on the can. 
as perfect as anything in a can comes!
"Had this on 2015-03-22 and again on 2015-10-30 and 2016-05-25 in Columbia, PA from fresh, 16 oz cans. Thanks Mike, for turning me on to this fine brew."
"From memory. Color was a hazy golden yellow. Smell was super dank, fruity, and oniony. Taste followed. Full of citra goodness. Low bitterness and barely any alcohol. Overall a really awesome DIPA. Wish I could get some more."
Thank to shanem12
A very smooth citrusy IPA. A favorite
Great in the bottle or can.
A ghost in Illinois delicious and worth importing
Wow. Amazing beer! Could drink everyday.
"Canned February 13, 2015"
"Bought in Barre, drank while enjoying lunch."
Really a must try for any IPA fans. This really knocked my socks off at how nearly perfect this beer is.
I mean....really? I just had one with a 1/23 canned date on it and I evaluate it this high? Makes me really want a FRESH stash to enjoy!!
In my top five ever ipa list for sure
For sure the best 'session' IPA out there. Still a session IPA.
"Look: Bright, clearly unfiltered. Awesome and appetizing orange tone."
"Great flavor, I think it's better than heady!!"
"I was lucky enough to try this beer on tap at Three Penny Tavern in Montpelier VT (stellar place for beer and food). It was one of the top 20 beer experiences of my life. I would have drank myself into a happy, hoppy stupor, but alas I was on work assignment and had to drive home. I'm going back there in a month praying that it is there again. Drove home with a case of Heady Toppers and two four packs of Sip Of Sunshine. This is a good St. Patricks Day for this Irishman. "
Too much of a fruity taste.
This is currently the best beer I've ever had. Well worth the trip to Vermont to acquire
A: Pours a hazy golden amber which runs a little light. The glass
I can't believe this is rated higher than Double Sunshine!
"Beautiful looking beer. Hazey honey gold with a sticky, persistent head that leaves a whole mess of lace. "
I'm raising my rating to 5.
"OK, going to be 100% honest and say I was expecting more from this brew. The hops were there, but I didn't get the super tropical notes I read about. The pine/resin was more prevalent than I really enjoy. It din't even pour that beautiful hazy/cloudy that I love in most east coast IPA's. Liked it, didn't love it."
"Extra from stater, canned 12/12/14 (with full disclosure upfront of course) I had to try it. Holy smokes! Your lying this is from December! Hop punch in the face. Immediately reminds me of abner. If this is 3 months old this stuff fresh will make my head pop."
"Fucking delicious. Taste like everything you'd want an IPA to be. Would drink this over Heady Topper any day, hands down."
Bursting with citrus. This is such a killer beer. Would love to get my hands on this closer to summer. Would be amazing on a hot day
"I have to give this almost a 5 across the board. For an Imperial... not sure anyone can get it as smooth from start to finish... either from the can, tulip, or a frosty. Cool to see this being brewed by Two Roads... time from tank to mouths is getting faster... and the quality is magnificent."
This ipa is very tasty with a fruity finish
"This beer is phenomenal. I haven't tasted anything like it before, or since I first tried it earlier this year. Such a complex beer, with a great tropical flavor, mouthy carbonation and lingering aftertaste. There may be a better IPA out there, but my head would probably explode if I tasted it. Just an amazing tasting beer. I just wish it were more accessible."
Well worth the search. Everything you want in a IPA. The aroma and taste are outstanding!
Definitely lives up to the hype. amazingly tropical fruit smell. perfect balance of crisp HOP and sweet tropical deliciousness.
For lack of a more appropriate colloquialism; this beer is the absolute balls. 
"In my opinion, Lawson's calls it Sip Of Sunshine because some sips taste like orange juice. The citrus grabs ahold of your pallet and lingers for quite some time. The taste rests on the back your tongue. The hops in this beer are well taken care of and probably sung to"
"Exceptional beer, everything is as you'd hope. Compares favorably with the great ones. Well done."
"Just got back from a successful trip to Vermont. So, might as well start drinking at 3:30 pm. 'Cause, that's what you do when you get back from Vermont. Hey, what the hell, I woke up at 4 am, might as well start now and go to bed at 8."
Looks: Canned on 2/26/15 and poured into a tulip glass. Two inches of head that dissappated after a minute. The color is hazy gold.
"Brilliant ""Lupulin laden beer"". Hop forward with tropical fruit flavors and a very pleasant floor nose. Dangerously drinkable."
"Great beer, but a little pine aftertaste"
Big thanks to Chris N. for sending this to me down in Louisiana. What a treat!
"Sips of sunshine used to be top notch, really stand out. I mostly liked it because it was lower malt and had a nice hop backbone without being overly bitter. Pretty clean flavor profile. These days its just not that exciting"
"So good- fresh can, poured into a ghandi bot tulip glass. Great tropical hops aroma, the coloring is way lighter than expected and the mouthfeel is so creamy. The taste is fantastic, one of the only good things about living in ct is that Lawsons distributes here! I would totally do this one again"
"Just a hands down awesome beer. It looks like sunshine on the pour, golden straw in color with a billowy white head with good retention and leaves decent lacing."
"Better than Heady, hands-down - it retains a great taste and feel even as it begins to warm up towards room temp."
The One of best IPA that I have ever experienced!
Ahh yes...Sip of Sunshine...highly rated and super hard to get...
"Drank on tap at The Elbow Room, West Hartford, CT"
Excellent IPA. Much better than heady. Loved the complexity. This is a great IPA with balance but still tons of fruit. Nose could be more appealing but overall would love to get more of this and will def look into more from Lawson's.
Absolutely amazing. The highlight of my recent trip to Vermont.
"Complex hoppieness, excellent finish, top five IPA."
"Thanks to irishrogue for this lovely 16 oz. can with “sunshine” on it, which makes me feel better after an interminable couple months of clouds & cold here in cheery MN. Can dated 1/23/15."
Simply amazing liquid. Huge thanks to the librarians husband for hooking me up with a canned pint. A thousand blessings upon your household!!
"Very fresh, complex, and so delicious. Jonas has turned me into a hop appreciater. :)"
"Hazy golden peach color with a white head and great lacing. Aromas of big tropical and citrus hops. Grapefruit, mango, peach, orange and dank stuff fill the nose. Sweetness up front lends well to grapefruit, orange and tropical fruit notes. Finish brings a hoppy bitter bite slight pine and a final touch of that sweetness. Medium body, creamy and resinous. Semi dry finish and very drinkable hiding all alcohol. This is very good but I'd be hard pressed to put it in my top five or past some local options."
I would consider 5* across the rating
Pretty solid brew. Super juicy
Well balanced. Fruity with right combo hoppiness. Great beer
"Really an outstanding beer, with considerable tropical fruit, light pine and considerable hoppy bitterness. The beer has a nice juicy quality that's really great to see in this beer as well. The finish is dry, bitter and long, and the alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile. This DIPA is quite well balanced, with everything seemingly in perfect perportion."
"Can from trade as an extra. Killer! Thanks man. Pours golden with a slight haze and a creamy fluffy white one to two finger head. Aroma is pine and strong florals, lightly sweet malt notes, more floral hops. Nice. Flavor is dry up front with definite floral piney hops, light citrus rind though not super juicy, much more dryness here. What seems to be a characteristic Lawson's yeast flavors. Medium bodied and on the dry side, slight resin, medium plus carbonation. Nice beer and way too easy drinking for 8%. This is delicious, but the huge score seems to put it in the overhyped category. But that's nitpicking. I'd drink this every day."
Can poured into snifter
"The pour yields a slightly hazy golden-orange with a pillowy white head. Pungent ripe tropical fruits fill the nose, mango, guava, papaya, with a bit of stone fruit. There is a fuzziness to the smell that draws you in, enticing you with the promise of the first sip."
"Very very good, just prefer Heady better"
Great IPA. Can't wait to get my hands on a case or four.
A: slight haze; golden colored; 1 finger ivory head that receded slowly to a thin film; very nice lacing;
This aromatic ipa is delicious and has a very subtle sweetness that pours down very nicely. Well balanced and awesome
Poured from a 16oz. can dated 2/13 into a tulip glass.
"Amazing beer. Perfection. Try it, or forever be unhappy."
Amazing fresh and full of tropical fruit
"Look: Golden in color; slightly hazy; lots of small bubbles. Pours with a rich, creamy 2 finger head that dies down rather quickly leaving a thin uneven layer on the surface of the beer. Looks inviting."
Best in the summer but still good all year round
So juicy! Huge tropical fruit.
"Truly world class, I might drink this every damn day if I could."
"This is outstanding beer. Flowery nose, soft citrusy taste. Great finish."
Outstanding DIPA had it super fresh and it has everything you're looking for in a double ipa
Its not Double Sunshine but wow was it great! Nice Citrus note and taste!
Really enjoyed this beer.. Wished it was sold locally.
Very good.. Overhyped is a strong word.. It has everything you would hope for in a great IPA.. If you can get your hands on it I would highly recommend giving it a try.. I know I will definitely drink it again! Thanks Lawson's
"We crack a tallboy, pouring into our oversized tasting snifters. It shines the color of a ripe Georgia peach. A powdery, snowy two finger head of white sand colored bubbles adorns this liquid, standing tall and retaining well. It is also highly reproducible. Thick sheeted cheesecloth lacing is left around our glasses. Chill is definitely apparent, as are some tight dots of sediment with the dregs of the can. Carbonation appears to be mild. The aroma is bright and natural, with hoppy varietals spanning citric to densely piney, bittering and serious lemon zest, spicy pale and earthy amber maltiness, fresh tomato acidity, pineapple and pear fruity mealiness, tin, warmed Granny Smith apples, green acorns, tight juniper stickiness, mineral-laden clay water, succulents, dried spaghetti, peppery spiciness, celery salt, and fresh spring dew. The flavoring gives creamy pale and wheaty maltiness at the forefront of the sip, dried rye and soaked barley, intensely floral and citric hoppy wash, cantaloupe and bitter grapefruity pith, under ripe pear and white grapes, dusty wool, mineral and metallic simple ale yeastiness, dried willow bark and honeysuckle, organic well water, tangerine flesh, vanilla extract, fusel booze, and stale white chocolate peppermint bark. The body is medium, and the carbonation is lightly medium. Cream and froth are up there, and slurp and smack are nice as well, but leave little room for a crisp finishing pop. However, the fact that it finishes so cleanly to flavor makes us happy regardless. The mouth is cooled, coated, and creamed, with lingering bittering astringency to pull us into a mild pucker. The abv is appropriate, and the beer disappears at a nice pace."
16 oz can was poured into a pint glass.
"Can, pretty good IPA. A bit over hyped"
"Simply overhyped, but still tasty."
"Not worth the hype, as is usual with Lawson's beers."
"Brought in fresh from a buddy in VT. The smell was incredible, and the taste was right there to back it up. So smooth for an imperial. Really wish we coul get this on the west coast!!"
"Served from a can at the Blue Point pizzeria in Stowe, VT. "
"It's Perfect, few can compare!"
Last of a 4-pack (it went very fast) recently purchased while up in Vermont. Have had this on-tap many times in the past as well. Canned on date is 1-23-15.
Another great VT IPA. This beer pours a light straw color with great head retention. Lots of tropical hop notes makes for a very balanced and easy drinking 8% IPA.
I never want to just hand out all 5's to a beer. I actually look for negatives and things I didn't like as a consumer of the product so I can fairly rate it. This was my first time drinking Sip of Sunshine and I was very impressed. 
"Lots of fruit from the hops, very crisp malt character. "
"Enjoyed this from a 16 oz can, poured into an IPA glass. Full cream colored head with fine lacing. The body is opaque amber. Classic pine bouquet on the nose, enticing you to drink. Absolutely deeelicious, with the sweet citrus flavor of tangerines and orange zest, with the bite of bitterness to refresh the palate. This Lawson beer is brewed at the Two Roads Brewery in CT."
"Sip of Sunshine - Lawson's Finest Liquids - Warren, Vermont - American IPA - 8.00% ABV - This outstanding India Pale Ale poured a slightly hazy, copper-gold color, with a thick frothy head that leaves sticky lacing on the glass. The nose featured dank hop aromas of resinous pine, fresh pineapple, juicy oranges, and sweet malts that blend together beautifully. The mouth was nothing short of amazing; flavors of zesty oranges and ripe pineapple are prevalent up front, followed by notes of grapefruit, papaya, and caramel malts on the back end. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a flavor bursting finish that sets it apart from any other standard IPA. I've been looking for Sip for quite a while now, and my buddy, @billylightning delivered. This is truly an outstanding brew and is easily in my top five for best American IPA. 100/100"
I've had this before but haven't typed up my notes. Here are brief impressions from a can (first review was from the bottle).
"16 oz can poured in into Sierra Nevada IPA Glass. Can date 12/12/14, muled back from VT."
16oz Can.
Like drinking a forest floor.
"Completely blown away. This beer was so unbelievable. I knew it was hyped, and I've been trying to get it for a while--but damn, so legit. The nose on this beer was better than anything I've ever wafted. The flavors are even better somehow...recently had a Gandhi Bot and unlike Gandhi, this one has a flavor that clearly backs up the fantastic smells. SOS is a fantastic beer that I will certainly look for again. Would love to do a blind test with Heady."
L: Slightly hazy brass tone. Faint orange hue in the head when poured but as it thins it appears much whiter. Very delicate lacing.
Phenomenal Beer! Can't wait to get more
"I'm having a chance again to enjoy this beer; well I'm having 72 chances since I came home with a few cases. This is the beer i pray for the moment before I open a new ipa in a can. Don't misunderstand, it's by no means the quintessential IIPA but it is gooooood. Smell is filled with tropical fruit, hop resin hits hard, lupulin-laden is the perfect description both in feel and flavor; bitterness is almost to much but as long as you let it diffuse in a glass for a minute it drinks perfect. Complaint I have, and yes only one, is the aroma is harsh at times; kinda nail polish remover."
"Delectable in its supreme hop glory- Lawson's Finest continues to both tease and mesmerize hop-heads with tangy citrus, deep tropical and herbal waft layering gently upon one another."
"Amazing IPA the closest I've ever had to the illusive ""Heady Topper"""
Awesome...just not heady awesome.
"I would give the beer higher ratings if it was on draught. Also for some reason I feel like the cans are not as good as the bottles. Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me but the beer cannot go toe toe with the elite Vermont DIPAS: Heady, Mastermind, Double Sunshine, 2nd Fiddle, Abner, Double Citra, S&S6, Double Galaxy, etc."
The smell pushes it over the top.
Love this beer. Had it next to a Heady which is a bit unfair..... Beer is excellent
Served in a snifter from the bomber. 11/13/14 bottle date. 
Poured from a bottle into a tulip
Really Really great IPA.. orange hazy color through out.. East and West coast styles mashed together to make this. it has solid mouthfeel and great flavor.. World class IPA
"From can, many thanks to Steve for this!"
Made up to Vermont this week and was able to sample Sip of Sunshine (tulip glass) and Heady Topper (can).
"Last beer of 2014, and the year is wrapping up with a bang. This is a gift from my beer brother Jim. Apricot honey colored with a two finger head of beige foam that lingers long. Bright and inviting aroma of citrus, pine, and mango."
Great ipa. Smooth finish. Whole lotta onion flavor but my friend who spilt a can with me didn't taste any onion. Love the ipa. Would love to get again sometime.
amazing!
"Pour is hazed amber with a tight white head and decent lacing. Nose is doughy bread, faint grain, a bit sweet, and very tropical fruit punch juice. Taste has a bit more sweet malt, more hop resin, still very tropical, pineapple and citrus. Gets a touch sweet, very light bitterness, well carbonated, lighter body, a hint syrupy."
Big juicy IPA. One of the best I have tried. Just fabulous.
"2 week old, 16 oz can poured into Spiegelau glass"
Such rich fruity and floral flavors. Phenomenal beer.
"Very good, think it was a bit old too."
"Tons of tropical fruit flavored, great feel and even better nose. Snatch it if you see it, or be sad"
I have been so excited to taste this one since we found out it is being brewed at Two-Roads in CT
Thanks to Travis for getting me a bottle of this...and making sure it never left ice from VT.
16oz can dated 7/21/15
"One of the more unique noses I've ever experienced--a fruity sweetness, close to sugary. The taste was juicy and delicious. A unique and delicious brew; ecstatic to have it in CT!"
Outstanding. Pours a deep yellow with a fizzy head that trails the glass as you drink. The smell is full of citrus and pine from the hops. The taste is amazingly bright and full of flavor from the beginning to the end. This was almost a love letter to hops on it's own. I hope this becomes more available in the following months because I think this might be one of my favorite IIPA's and would love to get more.
"22oz bottle, bottles 10/11/14, poured into oversized wine glass"
Leaves a taste on you tongue that you can't get enough of. Can't wait until they can make more barrels and I can get a case instead of only 4 pack.
Just got it in the can. I've had it a few times on tap. Its tastie in every incarnation. My new gold standard for IPAs
A very fine brew. The smell is heavenly with pungent rich hop esters. The taste follows suit with some citrus up front leading to some onion and thick honey malt finish. Feel is ok but a little thin and slightly off in its bitter finish. Overall very good!
"Amazing brew, hands down one of my favorite."
"Went up to VT recently and stopped in the Mad River Valley for Heady Topper. Upon walking out of the store with Topper, we see the Lawson's truck pull up and they have 80 cases of Sip of Sunshine in cans!! So..."
"Canned on 12/12. This is an all-around fantastic beer. The tropical arrangement and finish are better executed than Double Sunshine, which is another equally amazing DIPA. If you haven't had this yet and you require more specifics, see my review on the aforementioned DS. For my money, this one hits all the notes and then some. When it comes to the IPA game, Vermont has the master key. "
I've gone through a lot with this beer. Loved it at first. Was a regular drinker of it for a few years. I'm not certain if my taste buds or the beer changed but the last few times I get it I would rather drink almost any other IPA. Smell was metallic and horsey and the flavors were lacking the juiciness and complexity I recalled.
In my opinion one of the best DIPAs out there. Lives up the hype.
A: golden pale ale thats a bit cloudy but pours a nice white head and some amazing lacing.
"This is a pretty hit-or-miss brew for me, but my last can was pretty solid, so I'll score based on that one (at least for now). Nose is on point, tropical hops with a bit of malt seeping through. That malt is interesting -- it almost makes me think there's a touch of wheat in there, as it has that trademark hint of dampness wheat can give off. Anyway, taste isn't earth shattering, tropical sweet maltiness, but the nose saves this one, as well as a nice feel. Nice stuff but nothing worth killing yourself to trade for."
"It's no Double Sunshine, but it is very good."
"Beautiful golden pale ale; ""sunshine"" is a rather apt descriptor. Fairly clear with just a little haze, and topped by a beautiful snow white, light and fluffy head. Very good retention, and huge snowdrift chunks of lace."
Poured from a 22oz bottle (Bottled On Date: 11/13/14) into a 17oz Belgian snifter/tulip glass.
"From 12/14/14 notes. Big thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing a bottle of this one, it was awesome. Bottled 10/27/14, 22 oz. bottle into a tulip."
"On tap at Plan B. Pours a semi translucent orange color with very little head. The aroma is lots of tropical and citrus fruits. Tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, and orange. Smells fantastic. The taste is much of the same. Tropical and citrus but with some pepper and onion. Grapefruit and tangerine are the main flavors. Slight dankness towards the end. Very little alcohol presence. Finishes with more dank and tropical fruits. Lightly carbonated. Super easy to drink. I'm certainly looking forward to this in cans, it should work well. Overall, great IPA. Glad I live in CT."
Juicy aromatic luscious hops flavors and aromas. The kind of beer there isn't enough of when you take that last sip.
This is a very good beer. Thanks to my trade from RI! Cheers man! I have seen this one for a while and wanted to try it.
"L - This is beautiful, hazy golden/yellow with an inch of foam forming. "
Poured into Ommegang tulip
Heady is good but this is better for me.
"I'm not one for intricately describing how a beer tastes. But if you like IPA's and you appreciate a very smooth double IPA, this one is for you. A 1 pint 6 oz bottle of Sip of Sunshine was handed to me as I picked up two cases of Heady Topper. I originally said no, but I looked back and saw that everyone else was taking one...so I did too. I wasn't sure at first, but I'm so glad I changed my mind. Delicious beer - hoppy, fruity, fresh (bottled 15 days before I picked it up), and smooth. Is it better than Heady Topper? A little more session-able in my opinion, but not better. Not as good as Heady Topper? Wouldn't say that either."
"Dank, heady, aromatic, infused with resinous resonance. Top of the charts, setting a higher, hompier standard for VT DIPAs - ales that are starting to merit their own desigNation. Step aside or step up Heady Topper!!"
Vermonters keep their Imperial IPA game reeeeal tight.
"It seems like every time I have a Sip of Sunshine, I like it more than the last time. The tropical and flavor notes on the nose are incredible and it drinks very easy for 8%. It doesn't get much better than this."
SERVING: Bottle
"Poured from a bomber, bottled 10/17/14."
"A - Pours a clear, bright dark gold color with a nice, thick, white bubbly lacing ring."
"Thanks to threelions for sharing, and glad I got to review this as the last bottle I had wasn't up to par with what it should have been so I don't think it was treated right."
Big thanks to Threelions for sharing this beer at my little birthday gathering. Poured into a Kate the Great tulip.
On tap in a stemmed tulip.
"22oz bottle shared by MrBarleywine, thanks for the opportunity!"
Gteat nose of sweet tropical hops. 
"It's BA score of 100 is way overrated, and honestly doesn't even make my top 3 Imperial/Double IPA's. Reminds me more of a India Pale Lager, as it is on the clear side with only a moderate amount of lacing."
"Lots of tropical fruit on the nose, but taste turns into a classic grapefruit American IPA with firm bitterness. 9/18/14 bottling."
"This Sip of Sunshine had a bottle date in late August, 2014. The head on this delicious looking beer is white, dense, and very persistent. It has been airing out and warming up for the last few minutes and the head is relentless. The body appears golden/orange, and appears to have a great deal of substance. "
"This one caught me a bit off-guard. It pours an orangy-straw color, a little haze, nice head, a nice looking beer, but nothing unusual. The smell is where it starts. It is startlingly strong and delicious. Big citrus hops, with a bit of dank, which is exactly how it tastes, but the finish reveals a fantastic tropical fruit flavor as well. Mouthfeel is great; not magical like some of Hill Farmstead's beers, but great. Overall, this is a shockingly good IPA, one of the best I've ever had. I'm so impressed and so bummed that I may never find it again..."
"Bomber poured into a snifter. Bottled 9/18/14, drank 10/15/14."
22oz bottle poured into a large snifter. Bottled on 9/18/14. Traveled in checked luggage with a friend.
Rating change I love this stuff!
Look: Opaque Hazy orange-gold with a big frothy white head. Little activity. 
"Served on-tap at The Reservoir in Waterbury, VT."
Had this on tap at 2 different establishments and the beer were not very similar. I can only assume one was made in Connecticut and the other at Lawson's. One was very dank (not very sunshiney) the other was a tropical spice blast - that one was outstanding!
This was really great. On tap at Prohibition Pig.
22oz bomber bottled on 9/18/14. Poured in a snifter glass.
22oz bottle into a Worthy Glass tulip style
A: Pours with a light white frothy head that slowly settles down. Lots of lacing. Beer is a rich amber color with moderate haze. I like a dirty beer. 
"A - Crystal clear orange/yellow. Much different to the bright orange, murky body of Double Sunshine. "
"Had this on tap at a couple of locations in VT last week. It was excellent every time. Hazy with a light orange color. Odor was pine and citrus. Taste is incredible! Excellent balance! Blend of citrus (grapefruit mostly) with pine. A little floral odor comes through while being tasted. Steady pine and green throughout and a great, dry finish. Overall, one the best beers out there. Worth a try if you can get it."
"Look: slightly hazy light orange color, head gone fast"
Lawson's has another winner on his hands with this DIPA. I though it was like Double Sunshine with less sweetness and more grapefruit beauty. Nice dry tropical finish. Very refreshing. Made the mistake of having a Heady after this and it tasted fairly bland.
650ml bottle poured into a Lawson's snifter 9/3/2014.
"One of an epic flight of four (Heady, Conehead, Edward, Sip of Sunshine) at The Reservoir in Waterbury, VT on 9/21/14. SoS beat the others - yes, including Heady Topper - hands down. Finest beer ever."
L - Pours a very golden hazy orange. A good inch to inch and a half of bone white head forms. Very tight bubbles compose the head that dissipates rather quickly. After the dissipation a crown forms around the glass and leaves very nice lacing behind. It looks like a beer you want to drink.
"On tap at Three Penny Tap Room. I was very surprised to see a Lawson's beer for sale outside of Warren (and on draft, no less), but was confused when the bartender began describing the beer in almost apologetic tones. He explained that it was brewed outside of Warren in a large facility, that old man Lawson oversees it as much as possible but, gull darn it, you can't really guarantee quality at a large facility the same as you can at his ridiculously small brew house. "
"Pours cloudy gold color (darker gold for second pour of the bomber) with a lot of sediment floating in the brew, leading up to the 1-2 finger foamy white head that was full of bubbles and faded very slowly, leaving great thick foamy lacing coating the sides, rings as it went down and a layer on top. "
"Great beer! pours a nice golden head, has a citrus aroma and a mild hop malt character taste. I could drink this often as its very drinkable with a good mouth feel. Lawsons does it again!"
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass canned on 2/5/16. Pours a cloudy bright orange, with a 3 inch sticky white head that leaves behind loads of lace and has excellent retention. "
"Oh man, what a great beer!"
Poured into a pint glass via can
"I've had this brew several times over the summer, each time a bit different. Sean even states on his web blog that this beer may vary slightly. Overall a delicious citrus full flavored IPA."
"A-Semi cloudy deep orange, two finger head that leaves some lacing."
Thanks to jchem137 for the hookup...
From notes
Acquired in a trade with a friend. Many thanks to them for the hook up. Poured into my trusty teku glass.
"Pours a dark hazy gold with a large white head. Good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of tropical fruit and citrus with a hint of herbal. Lots of bitterness on the tongue, great hop flavor with herbal spiciness. Medium bodied with effervescent carbonation. Overall the extreme bitter nature and 8% ABV make this more than an IPA, maybe not quite a DIPA, maybe an IPA and a half. Outstanding work Lawson's!"
"Poured from a can dated 12/04/15 into the modified tulip glass,"
Blast of Citrus. Yum! I wish I had Double Sunshine to compare this against.
"This is another of my daily drivers, I drink this or heady on tap every night after work, depending on if heady is on tap or not... Try it!"
The beer comes in a deep rich reddish amber.
wonderful IPA with plenty of body and mouthfeel for the pickiest of beer lovers
I've been meaning to score some Lawsons for quite a while. Bottled 8/15/14.
Date: 08/23/14
Oh My! Another absolutely delicious IPA. 
Bottle received in an IP trade.
"Had this brew a couple of times. The first time was a bomber that I shared with three friends. The second time was on draft at the Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock Vermont just a few days ago. This is a truly great brew; right up there with its sister Lawson's Double Sunshine. Served in a sniffer. Very smooth, nice clean taste, plenty of hoppy nose, right amount of head and lacing. I think because it was a draft I enjoyed it even more. Highly recommended."
"Pretty much the closest I may ever get to having Double Sunshine again but I'll take what I can get. This beer pours out as a golden yellow color with a subtle haziness to it. The smell is very hoppy. The taste has a great balance of bitterness and juiciness. The feel of the beer is very drinkable for 8%. Overall it's a really great beer, I drink it whenever I have it on hand."
"the farmhouse is a mecca, and this on tap is a real treat, even in the absence of double or triple sunshine, this is special. brewed in CT I think, but whatever, good beer obviously comes from there, or at least it does now. a huge citra bomb, blonde and hazy and heady frothy white like it should be, with essence of lemons and tangerines and zest and IBU's just right. its at once delicate and enormous, and smells like Vermont in all of its hoppy glory, but is very much west coast styled. malt is light, maybe with a touch of oats for body and lasting residual sugars, but not sweet at all, in fact quite dry and almost funky, or at least seeming to be born from native yeasts or something unique and happy to be medium warm. I like this because of the hop complexion, which is citrusy and clean but quite big, but I like it more for the mouthfeel, which is softly but happily carbonated, and pillowy, light in body really, but overall a full mouth experience. I know this isn't double sunshine, and I seem unable to track that down right now, but I am awful happy to have this big ipa in its place. a real gem from a Vermont legend. the others will have to wait, but stoked to have a sip of sunshine..."
22 oz. bottle dated 7/17/14 poured into Belgian ale glass
"On a recent trip to Burlington I had a Heady Topper one night and this the next night at The Farmhouse and Sip of Sunshine was just....well, just that, a sip of sunshine. It smelled great and tasted even better. When compared to Heady Topper....well, I would say it has the slightest edge. I thought it a little lighter, a little more citrusy and the smell just a shade better. I was seriously bummed I couldn't find any to bring home, not even a couple bottles at Hunger Mtn, but maybe next time."
Thank you to the always generous Brandon for gifting me a fresh bottle. Cheers bro!
"22oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Huge thanks to BA morningthief for picking me up 2 bottles of this (and some Heady, woo)."
"Poured from bottle into a tulip glass, enjoyed for IPA day. Bottled on july 17th so this is 3 weeks old. Beer is a bright amber gold, really impressive film and lacing on this, a little cloudy."
Bottled on 7/17. Consumed on 8/7. Poured into an IPA glass
"650ml bottle, dated 7.14.2014, I assume the delay in releases was due to bottle conditioning, poured into a Lawson's snifter."
Great Beer!!! Certainly has a nice and strong hoppy taste to it.. I believe the fruits end to it sticks out when you drink it.. It's hard to deny this beer being a top 20 beer in the beer advocate... Once you had one you feel like you just want to keep drinking this beer.. Cheers!!!
22 oz bomber poured into Willy glasses and shared in the garage while homebrewing. 
On tap at Prohibition Pig. Served in a snifter.
"A - pours a hazy glowing golden yellow with a finger of dense, near white head. Fantastic retention, great lacing"
"Living in CT, I get this quite regularly in the liquor stores, although even in CT it is almost ""limit 1 per customer"" and sells out quickly. This week I had it on draft for the second time. TOTALLY different experience, in a good way. More floral, fruity, sweeter (not too much). I sometimes fear this beer is overhyped, but I love to buy the tall boys and I will absolutely choose it on draft again over almost (I'll say it again, almost) anything that is normally on draft."
"A-Sip of Sunshine pours a hazy yellow hue with a full figured, fluffy white head. Looks tasty."
"Pours a beautiful yellow orange with a crisp thin head and moderate lacing. Aroma of tropical fruits and slight piney hop. Taste starts with some fruit notes; mango, pineapple, and tangerine came to mind, hop bitterness and another heavy layer of fruit come on in another wave. Moderate carbonation, and a fairly dry finish. LFL at its finest!"
"Crazy what the ""Lawson's"" name will do. This beer is rated 100? It's solid but not nearly on the top tier of New England IPAs in my opinion. It looks like a typical filtered West Coast IPA. There's a nice dank flavor and the ABV is well hidden but there's not much nose and it's a bit on the bitter side for a Vermont heavy hitter."
Very malty/grainy. The hops don't seem to balance it out. Had on tapmat Prohibition Pig
"Had on tap at Prohibition Pig, served in a 13-oz tulip glass"
"One of the most impressive beers from my trip to Vermont. I've had this both on tap and in cans. I prefer it on tap, but I couldn't say much of the beer's presence is lost in the can. Another terrific IPA from Vermont. No surprise there, really."
Appears a glowing orange with a foamy white cap that slowly fades into a gentle collar. Scatters bits of lacing are left around the glass.
On tap at Blackback.
"There are a good amount of opinions and some dissention by a number of loyal Lawson's Finest Liquids devotees regarding SIP OF SUNSHINE IIPA. For starters, this beer, while Sean Lawson's recipe, is produced at and by Two Roads brewery in CT, so when someone like myself looks at a tap list of a well respected tap room (that shall remain nameless) and notices that the ""origin"" of the beer is listed as ""Vermont,"" and a 12 oz. pour is $8 (same price as Double Sunshine), there is a feeling of deception (in defense of Lawson's, another more reputable tap house mentions the origin of brewing as CT). Bottom line, it feels deceiving buying a ""Lawson's"" beer that isn't hand crafted by Sean Lawson himself."
"I enjoyed this on Tap at Mad Taco, served chilled in a pint."
"My first Lawson's brew, and enjoyed in great company. We had the rare opportunity to get a pour from the bottom of one keg, and from the top of next. A slightly cloudy honey look in the glass, and I could smell the fruit while the glass waited on the table for the ladies to get their wine. Grapefruit and citrus, orange or tangerine were repeated with the first sip. Big and long bitterness. The pour from the new keg had more grain notes which better balanced the bitterness. The alcohol of 8% was we'll masked. Overall a great beer which I would gladly sample again."
Served on tap at the Black Back in Waterbury.
"I have had this beer a number of times and recent experiences with the canned version have turned me off slightly as there are major inconsistencies with the canned versions of this beer. On tap, it is a truly special DIPA full of dank and citrus hop aroms and flaovurs with the perfect mix of bitterness and sweetness. It is nearly perfect on tap, but my rating reflects my average experience."
"Lawson's Finest Liquids - Sip Of Sunshine, poured into a Lawson's tulip."
"On draft at The Reservoir in Waterbury Vermont, served in a Lawson's snifter."
"Funny thing about this here beer, it's brewed at Two Roads Brewery in Stratford, Conn (much to the chagrin of my god knows how many-generations back Vermonter friend). Supposed to be similar to Double Sunshine and destined for regular appearances across VT. Should be good."
A-muted orange with undertones of yellow; off-white head and good lacing on tulip glass.
A-golden orange color with a nice off-white head and good lacing
"Had on tap at Three Penny Tap Roon, 9oz pour"
"Had at Prohibition Pig. Great place, my company was lukewarm though. Pours a nice copper hazy color with a head that retains nicely. Really gamey smell..so fresh. Such an amazing beer. Not sure what to say but than other to say this is perfect. If only I could change tables"
It’s pretty much old school west coast IPA at its citra finest....
"Well, here is it: other than Emily Didonato lying at the foot of my bed - this is my number 1 want: Kern River Citra."
Awesome!
Great beer with the creepiest finish. Amazing from the bottle but best on tap.
"Surprised by the haze, it's a nearly fully opaque orange-amber with a lighter gold around the bottom edge, topped with a large khaki foam that slowly settles to a thin film with a bubbly clinging collar."
"On-draught at Verdugo Bar, Los Angeles. I've waited a long time to try this one."
Had on tap at KRBC. Unremarkable head at beginning...but stunning rich amber honey color... and outstanding lacing. Full hop aroma and a citrus bomb for flavor. So clean and drinkable. Reamarkabke easy for an 8% DIPA. Definitely built in the malts perfectly. Yep... lived up to the hype.
"Having on draft in a pint glass. Dark amber color with a slight haze and one finger head. Smells of burnt caramel and toasted orange rind. Totally full bodied with creamy carbonation texture. Flavors of roasted pineapple, peach with toasted orange rind bitterness. Long lasting fruit sweetness and bitterness."
L: Pours a beautiful golden color. 2 fingers of foamy head with good retention.
"Best IPA I've ever had. I waited years to finally get a case of Citra and the wait was worth it. Scary drive to the brewery to pick up the case, but it was a fantastic trip. Numerous great beers but Citra stood out. Actually, they had ""Hazy Citra"" on tap and it was wonderful. If you get a chance to try it, don't pass it up."
Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Teku goblet.
A: bright glowing orange. Slight haze. Thick eggshell white bubbles
I traveled 2 hours to grab a case of this after I learned about it from a friend. I had to make an advanced purchase online to be eligible for picking it up directly from KRBC. While there I grabbed a couple of pints from the tap. 
My local dealer hooked me up with this one. I am no stranger to whales but i honestly had never heard of this brew before my buddy mentioned it.
"This was such a highly rated beer, with a previous lottery system, and I was excited to have finally gotten it. I liked it but was a bit disappointed. Look was dark and clear. Smell was pretty weak in comparison to the other strong citra-dominant beers that are out there now. The taste was a lot more balanced between the citra tropical juiciness and the sharper piney bitterness. Was expecting the citra to be more prominent. Mouthfeel was like any other regular IPA. Not bad, but not good. Overall, it was a good beer, but did not live up to my expectations, especially since there are so many newly-popular hazy citra bombs out there now. Worth having, but won't make the tough effort to have again."
Look: golden yellow light white head about .5 inches 
"It was almost 2 months old, but it didn't hold up as well as many of he New England IPAs after 2 months."
"Pours a light orange color with a soapy head. Aroma is dank and tropical, with herb and fruity scents."
"Juicier than west coast IPAs traditionally tend to be. Brings the malt backbone that is characteristic of West Coast IPAs, imparting additional caramel sweetness. Overall very solid, but for me at least, I prefer the newer trend of hazy, juicy IPAs coming out of places in New England, from Tired Hands, and, for example, from Monkish on the left coast."
"While this is a great example of a good west-coast double IPA, I don't know that I agree with the consensus so far in that it's top 50 worthy. The flavor was solid, but nothing over the top like some others, and the mouthfeel was pretty standard for a high quality IPA. Glad I tried it, but won't be rushing out to get it again."
"This is a very well made beer, but from talking with friends, the citrus profile falls off quickly. Well balanced with a small amount of citrus, but dominated by the dank/bittering hops."
22 oz. bottle poured into a Founders snifter. Bottled on date on the case 11/11/16.
Finally get to try this one...thanks Jason!
PTE clone???
Excellent DIPA.
this is really good!
Fresh 22oz. bottle poured into a fluted snifter.
Slightly hazy orange brew with a white head that leaves lacing everywhere. The aroma is amazing with oranges and mangoes with a brightness reminiscent of lemon. There is detectable sweetness and a nice pine in there as well. The taste starts sweet upfront with fruit and sweet malt but changes to an aggressive pine bitterness that then backs off as the sweetness returns to balance it out. This is a fantastic beer.
"Very great. Smooth, you wouldn't know it's 8%. This is all I want in an IPA."
"The pinnacle of the west coast ipa. Absolutely delicious. Only downfall is there's almost no carbonation. Flavor, scent and look are all perfection. If you're lucky enough to get your hands on this, buy as much as you can!"
"Reviewed from notes. On-tap at the brewery, served in a pint glass."
"Awesome beer, delicious, great taste, smelled great. Lucky to have this a few times. Probably the best west coast IPA I have ever had. Great hop taste."
"Wouldnt say this comes anywhere near being super impressed with the appearance here, it is cloudy. I realize thats all the rage on the other coast, but sorry, I find that to be maybe not a flaw, but certainly something that would prevent a 'perfect' appearance score if you will. Now, that is about the only ""flaw"" we will speak of during the review of this beer."
Such an incredible beer!
L - Hazy golden orange with a little transparency. Two fingers of slightly off-white head.
"This was an absolutely phenomenal west coast IPA. The nose was absolutely incredible. Tons of pineapple and other tropical fruits. The carb was on point, and the color was beautiful. My only gripe is that it was pretty resinous and piney with a strong bite on the finish. For a big hop head, this would be incredible. For me, it was a little overpowering."
Poured from a bomber into a taster glass. More citrus / less pine than what I consider to be a prototypical West Coast style IPA. I bit sweeter than I would have preferred.
On tap at Kern River Brewing Co
2/20/2016 batch drank on 3/3/2016. Bomber poured into a tulip.
"This is the best west coast beer created, period. It does a lot more than Pliny the Elder and gives Heady Topper a run for its money. But, this beer has it all from great smell, smooth as silk, totally drinkable, I could go on and on."
Bomber into an IPA glass at ~fridge temp.
I'm really excited I got to try this beer. Thanks to my new buddy in California for sending this my way. Tons of citra hops (obviously) but the Amarillo hips are a welcome addition. Tastes to me like an imperial zombie dust.
Holy Christmas!
Even when poured from a bottle a little over 60 days old. This is a great beer lots of nice hops in the nose and the taste surely follows the nose. With nothing but citra hops the taste is superb. The mouthfeel is good. This is a great DIPA and I like to try a really fresh bottle.
"Darker straw color with slight white head. Smells of amazing citra hops, mango, grapefruit and pineapple with slight sweet malt hiding in there. Deliciously hoppy with a nice malty base meeting those same citrus fruits shine. Great mouthfeel of carbonation and drying hops. Overall what else can I say about this amazing beer? Except that I wish I had better access to it in Ohio."
"Exceptional DIPA that I was pleasantly surprised didn't have an overwhelming boozy taste to it. Instead I got bright hops and an extremely drinkable brew from Kern River. Wish it wasn't so hard to come by, but very glad to check this off my beer bucket list!"
Dark hazzy straw color
L: Golden wheat with a nice layer of head
"Had on draft. This beer surprised me in that it didn't blow me away with intense hop flavor and aroma. A lot of highly rated DIPAs are packed with as much flavor as possible but this one is more delicate and well balanced. There are a still a ton of tropical fruit flavors and even more dankness but it's controlled. I could easily drink 5 of these and not have a complete palate blow out. The mouthfeel is also exceptional, very full and creamy. Overall, this is a surprisingly easy drinking beer full of wonderful classic citra hop flavors and an incredible mouthfeel."
Been looking to try this beer for quite sometime. Looks slightly hazy with a nice frothy white head. Smells of citrus with follows in the taste with an amazing velvety mouthfeel. Not too bitter and alcohol is very well hidden. Unbelievably well balanced beer. SO happy to have had the chance to try this. Will definitely look for it again in the future.
I had at least 5 pints of this beer last weekend at KRBC but I am currently reviewing this while sipping on the ONLY BOTTLE I was able to score. 
"10 oz pours at Encinitas Ale House for SDBW. Pours a hazy golden orange with amazing nose. Tropical, bitter front end and oh so smooth finish. Hides its abv well. Overall, less tropical and more hoopy aggressive than HF Double Citra but amazingly balanced. I could (and did) sit and drink this all day...."

"Woah, am I glad I got to try this!!"
Disappointed!
"Was pretty disappointed in this one. With the limited availability, hype, and top rating on BA, I had pretty high hopes. Frankly this does not belong in the same class as Pliny, Heady, Zombie or other world class IPAs."
On Tap at the Brewery – 11/16/2014
This is truly a delicious beer. Everything about it is outstanding. I tried the lottery to try to buy this beer but no dice this year. I'll keep trying. It's really worth it!
"This drinks so smooth! Lots of dank hops like pine, herb, cannabis, floral and chive but no bitterness or astringency. The mid palate senses a stiff caramel backbone before this finishes with fruity apricot, honey, tangerines, grapefruit, mangoes and tropical fruit punch. Great use and dose of Citra!"
What a delicious DIPA. Thanks to hefman for trading one to me all the way from Cali. I think I need a few more to be sure just how amazing they are...
"Pours that hazy peach color that tells me its a winner-- (just say no to clear beers)-- smells like the tasting pours at my favorite brewery, HF. Taste is hop deliciousness, piney, very mild citrus, and an interesting finish, ummmm- nutmeg? Yes, there are a lot of maybe better new-comers to the DIPA market, but this is still a fantastic beer!"
"After reading all the great reviews and seeing all the hype, I wanted to love it but definitely didn't."
"Received this recently in a trade. Blew my mind. Seriously. Easily on par with the better IPAs I've had - Heady, Dreadnaught, Pliny, etc"
Got a bomber of this brew from a trade. Big thanks for that! Love those DIPA's. Let's see how this measures up!
One of the best in this style. I haven't had a Kern for some time and was blown away...
"To be honest, I was so disappointed when I traded for this beer. Smell was nice, but the taste lacked the tropical/fruit hop bomb I had expected to have. A nice beer, but not worth the effort. Maybe I got a bad bottle??"
"Poured from bomber into a 10oz snifter. The aroma was pungent and unpleasant, the taste was much better. Seemed very smooth and balanced to me. Beer was a few weeks old."
Very solid. Great sharpness to it.
Type: 22-oz. bottle
Two inch head that dissipates quickly. Huge tropical fruit aroma and flavor. Lightly carbonation so easy to drink. Just wow.
"Citra is burnished bronze in the glass. The nose is pineapple, mango, sticky weed and a bit of jasmine."
Bottle date 11/8/14
Glorious Citrus Bomb!!! Love this and wish it were easier to find
Subtle hints of Amarillo and citrus.. Smooth and refreshing taste for 8%'er.. Strongly recommend.
Received in a trade. It's from the last bottling (early November) which makes this over a month old.
Big thanks to mikul93 for this beer which becomes my very first review. 
"What can you say about this beer? It's perfection. Color amazing, smell unbelievable. Just so fruity and juicy on the taste, and a mouthfeel that is only surpassed by Double Sunshine. When that is all you are competing with, you are doing well."
"Amazing West Coast IPA, this beer shoves Citra hops in your face on the nose and taste. It is so full of flavor, the taste will longer so long you forgot you haven't had another sip."
Date: 09/11/14
"Aroma: Pine, Grapefruit, Lemon zest, orange, and Mango, Absolutely superb nose, the citra hops are outstanding in the nose from this beer! 5/5"
"Finally had a chance to try this - perhaps the last of my top wants in my list that I've compiled for the past several years. Poured into a tulip glass at FWIBF. Pretty sure this is a fresh batch, but I was too pleased with glee that this was in my hand that I forgot to ask how old."
Never have I ever had such a pleasing ratio of Citra and Amarillo.
Wonderfully crafted DIPA.
Thanks to David Frank (wuntrikpony) for giving me the opportunity to experience KR Citra via trade!
"The beer comes in a hazy bright reddish amber orange with almost tinges of ruby and pink coming through as well, with a fluffy white head."
Huge thanks to Marco_Gtz for this!
possibly the most anticipated beer I've ever had! thanks to wicked BA Abbbp for the trade. 22oz. bottle poured into a NEBCO tulip
"22oz bottle generously shared by Doug. Thanks man! Poured into a Bell's snifter today, 3/11/2014. Must be about 2, 2.5 weeks old as this is from the previous release."
"Unbelievable!! I have made the trek up to Kern River twice to get this after winning their lottery. As good as it is in the bottle, it is every more amazing on tap and fresh. One of the best."
"A - Cloudy pale-ish yellow amber. Pours with a nice finger head, which dissipates fairly quickly to a thin foam layer. Nothing special."
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Thanks kflah41 for this whale!
Received in a trade from my man Steve in Cali. Thanks again buddy!
"Pours a big, fluffy white head. Brew is cloudy and deep orange, deeply translucent, with gold and amber highlights and hints of red. Head retention is excellent, and lacing is sticky and thick."
A: Vibrant hazy golden that seems characteristic of all of KRBC's IPAs with thin white head dissipating to a very minimal ring around the glass. 
"First Kern Citra, first Kern anything. "
"Pours cloudy, golden like honey with a attractive cap of parchment colored head. Pinnacle of two fingers with some good hold, leaves a dense cap through the entire drink. Lacing is plentiful but sloppy."
"The one, the only! Being from Bakersfield, I feel so very priviledged to be so close to the origin of this sweet hop nectar! I've been told Citra is best tasted and judged on tap, so that is what I shall do for my review. Had this on tap today (2/23/14) at the source at KRBC. Poured into a standard pint glass."
"Make more Citra. I always seem to miss out on it. This has added to the legend of this brew but make no mistake, it's not just hype man oh man is it nice. Careful if you like to chug, it tastes like nectar. Doesnt taste anywhere near 8%. I love you Citra. Best DIPA from Central California hands down."
"Citra pours a golden brew into a large wine glass with a one finger head. The smell is of citrus (orange/grapefruit) with a hoppy scent. The taste follows the nose with the citrus flavors but subside to mango and papaya further back on the palate. The taste is monster hop forward and the Citra hops do not disappoint. I love this beer! For me, it is the only beer that would give Pliny a run for its money."
"Very great beer. I can see why it is rated so well. Everything you want in a IPA. Great nose, terrific citrus flavored. Very floral. Love this beer. The best part of this beer is the actual taste. Some beers like zombie dust have that over the top great nose that you could never match as far as flavor. But this is a tasty one."
"Poured into a Kern River shaker pint (currently their only style of glassware available). This was one attractive beer: cloudy apricot-orange color with an inch or so of thick, foamy, white head that retained strongly, coating the glass with lacing. Nice aroma of citrus zest and underripe pineapple, for a fresh bottle, it wasn't really exploding with aroma as I had hoped, but it was still nice. The taste was good, nothing mind-blowing, pretty much average on the scale of IPAs or DIPAs. Good burst of hops, more bitter than fresh and juicy, citrus rind, underripe pineapple, herbal notes, grassy notes, bready malt base. Good, but nothing special or unique really. Smooth mouthfeel for a double, with just about no alcohol burn at all, though a little graininess lingered in the aftertaste. With all the hype this beer gets, I really expected something different, but it was really just a basic IPA, and offered nothing more than a typical local option. Still good, of course, just wackily overrated."
Huge thanks go out to Sir Paul for this FRESH bottle of Kern Citra!
"Thanks to StonedRaider for the trade. Pours a cloudy amber with a thick white head. Good retention and nice soapy lacing. The nose on this DIPA is huge, lots of citrus, tropical fruit, with a hint of dank earthiness. This is what a world-class DIPA smells like. Strong hop bitterness on the front of the palate that becomes fruity and dank. Finishes dry and citrusy. No alcohol burn at all. Medium bodied with fizzy carbonation. Overall, an amazing DIPA, well crafted and supremely drinkable, this one is well worth seeking out."
"Pours a hazed pastel orange with a melon hue. Unique and pleasant color. A fat head of cottony foam that will not fall down. Don't bother to wait. Leaves spectacular cotton candy lace. There are plenty of bubbles rising to the surface. The nose is simply terrific. Tropical fruits. Pineapple, mango, Grapefruit, orange and lemon citrus, candied fruit peel. A sweet floral and a succulent hop sweetness. The malt promises some sweetness but doesn't smell heavy or sugary. Taste is splendid. Grapefruit comes to the front of the palate bringing a hop punch of juicy fruit flavors with it. The body of the beer is soft and while amply carbonated it's supple and smooth. The malt teases you with a bit of flaky biscuit that is not too sweet. "
"A- Pours a moderately hazy orange/gold with a massive, billowing white head that retains well and leaves lots of sticky lacing."
"Smells like hoo boy... I opened it up and my alcoholic cat start meowing from across the room, even though it hadn't even been poured. She's not allowed anymore, though. But, seriously I wasn't exaggerating even a little there; the aroma is super intense, and super excellent. "
A - Amazing dark orange/Gold. Small bright white head. 
"A - Beautiful dark orange. Can't see through the glass but there's no sediment floating around. Very nice, bright white, two finger head. Large bubbles and spotty lacing all over the place. Absolutely perfect."
Poured from a bomber into a tulip. I believe this was bottled about a week ago.
"A: Pours orange with a very slight golden hue to it, some murkiness to it, hard to see through it, leaves a nice bubbly head that went quickly, very slight lacing on the glass, looks wonderful in IMO"
Citra Double IPA
Served in a tasting glass the Firestone Walker Beer Fest. From notes. Reviewed 1 June 2013.
Live review of a bottle scored from the latest batch. 
"Was able to try this during San Diego Beer Week and San Francisco Beer Week. Both times served from tap in a pint and in 12 oz tulip. The appearance is murky with a slight green-yellow color. The smell and taste is amazing. Citrusy pineapple and mango flavors last from the sniff to the swallow. The mouthfeel is the most amazing part of it, 8% and unfiltered gives it the perfect consistency. It's juicy! Each swallow only makes you crave more. My favorite IIPA. HF Double Galaxy and Heady Topper are a close second and thrid."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a nice thick head, pretty creamy. The smell is strong, tropical hops, as is the taste. Nice level of bitterness. It has good body, feels nice in the mouth, there's really not much fault to find in this beer. It's one of the best DIPA's I've ever had. I feel like my ratings above might be too tough on it and if you get the chance to try this one, do it. Absolutely outstanding! Thanks to the citra fairy in CA!"
"Thanks to Cuzco for sharing this, a longtime want."
"Citra DIPA is a hop-heads delight. It's like ""chewing on a pine cone"". You have to be a hop lover to enjoy, this would likely overpower any dish it could be paired with. If a hoppy beer experience is what you are looking for , this is your ticket. Best single hopped beer I have ever had."
"A - Hazy copper, near white head leaves fast. Some spotty lace."

"A-Cloudy yellow, two finger head, carbonated with great lacing."
"Big thanks to DaveHack for pouring one of these for me. This beer poured out darker than I expected. It has a golden amber color with a nice foamy white head on top. The lacing and retention were very nice. The smell of the beer is very nice, big amounts of peach and pineapple aromas on this brew. Smells very fruity and sweet, very inviting. The taste of the beer has some subtle lemon flavors with other hoppy citrus notes and a balanced malt backbone. The mouthfeel is smooth, very creamy feel to it along with some light carbonation. Overall this is very good, I would drink lots of this beer. Very pleased with how this beer was. Worth seeking out for any IPA lover."
"Courtesy of Mike, who shagged a few bottles at the release the weekend before. "
"Big thanks to karink for this one - a huge one from my wanted list finally gets crossed off. Pours a deep copper color near the top that cascades through a gradient, finishing at a shade of amber near the bottom. Hazy and cloudy everywhere but the very edges, topped off with a thick fingered, foamy white head that leaves behind some huge pieces of chunky lace. This beer is simply beautiful. Maybe I'm swooning a bit too much because this was such a huge want on my list, but this is spot on for a DIPA... Looks good enough to drink."
Bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead stem.
Notes from 9/17/12. 
"This review is being transcribed from notes from a prior bottling (2011) Huge, fruity DIPA which is all about hop flavor as opposed to hop bitterness. Tropical, citric flavors with no trace of alcohol. Excellent lacing, abundant hop aroma. Definitely the best dipa I've ever had."
"Tap at Toronado SD for SDBW. Pours a bright, low haze, light orange. Small, white head. Nose is heavier butterscotch, vanilla, some vodka, mango, parmesan cheese. Taste is boozy/white alcohol/vodka, butterscotch. Palate is thick, chewy, oily. A bit sticky/syrupy. Not what I was expecting."
Shared with JLindros and reviewed from notes. Poured into a Kate The Great tulip.
A - pours an orange color with a touch of rustic brown and a pure as white snow color of a head
"This is my first review in a WHILE! I'm now going to start reviewing in my own format and not worry about the Appearance, Smell, Taste, Mouthfeel, & Overall ""Format"" I've used so boringly in the past. Leggo"
"A little darker than expected caramel color pour with a nice sized pillowy head floating on top. Huge resinous pine hop notes are mixed well with some tropical fruit and more dank dank dank. Flavor is a bit more malt forward than I figured. Aggressively bitter finish, great carbonation for the style. Very nice."
A- Light amber body with a white head and a light lacing. The head dropped to a light foam cap.
"Orange brown opaque pour with small but dense white foam. Aroma is a blast of tropical fruits, lots of pinneaples, mango and oranges. Also some of the distinctive cat pee and wet grass from Citra hops. Taste is also very fruity, some resin with definite bitterness without being over the top. Could have a little more carbonation. The perfect example of the fruity IIPA."
Pours a slightly hazed golden orange color with a massive soapy white head leaving tons of sticky white lacing along the glass..
Citra DIPA
"once again, a million thank you's to GrumpyOldTroll...this guy is just insanely generous and mad cool. asks for my address and when i say why he says ""well you said you haven't tried citra yet so i wanted to send you a bottle"" - the bottle arrived yesterday (a day after the discussion). i tried to rally the local troops so we could all get a taste, but the stars didn't line up, so sharing this one with the wife. poured into 2 captain lawrence tulips."
Huge thanks to ArchEnemyBrew for send this beer for me to share with a friend! Thanks Hollis!!!
"Pours a one inch dense white head. Opaque dull orange in color. Sticky lacing, excellent head retention."
From a recent Baltimore tasting group event (many thanks to Online73 for the opportunity to try this one).
"A - Really nice hazy golden orange with a nice 1.5-2 finger frothy white head. Delicious looking beer as long as you like the hazy unfiltered look, which I do."
"A: Light copper, excellent clarity, long lasting white head. Tiny bubbles. Beautiful, very appetizing beer."
"Thanks to a generous trader for sending this as an extra. Pours the color of honey with poofy white head. Tastes and smells as advertised - great tropical fruit notes. Super well balanced with malt. Love the super fresh flavor. Overall, a fantastic IPA, and I usually don't like IPAs."
Poured from the bottle into a Chimay goblet. Really glad I got to try this one at long last!
"A - Pours a cloudy golden orange color. A two finger, slightly off white head settles down to a nice layer of bubbles that hang around until the end. "

22oz acquired in trade. Been waiting for this one! 2012 release. 
Huge thanks to Ryan (Treebs) on this one once again. 
"A: Pours a massive white head with heavy lacing and froth on the top of the glass. The body of this is very light, perhaps a little lighter than most DIPA's that I see, but it does look appealing."
"Updated review. After trying a fresh bottle, I realized my original review was of an older bottle. The hops were much more prevalent. Great flavor, great smell. I now understand the appeal of this beer completely. Overall a great beer that fully lived up to my expectations with the fresh bottle."
pours a hazy golden with a huge almost pure white head that lasts just a bit yet laces very well.

A - Pours a clear and very rich looking medium copper color with a one fingered creamy layer of foam. The foam sticks to the glass like cotton candy glue.

Pours a deep orange with a sticky bubbly big white head.
Thank you Jimmy2282!
"got this brew through a trade and thank you so much for it. A totally awesome brew. So fresh absolutely one of the best DIPA out there. Full of Citra, grapefruit and flowery sweetness that only having a sip can explain. Well worth the travel to find one. Oh yeah and it is full of CITRA and a little more CITRA."
This is just straight up awesome. Best IIPA I have ever had.
"I had the opportunity to try this beer at GABF, and much to my dismay, was extremely underwhelmed. This couldn't have been the Citra that everybody has been raving about.. so I decided to chalk it up to a botched batch, server error, oxidation... whatever. A few months later I was able to track down a fresh bottle from my local shop."
12/18/2011
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a New Belgium globe. Pours a hazy dark gold/orange with a finger and a half of foamy white head. The aroma is very strong, a lot of fruits (pineapple, citrus, mango) along with some pine notes. The taste is very much like the great aroma, a lot of tropical fruits and some complimenting malt characteristics. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied and crisp, an easy drinker for sure, but the lack of bitterness and the fact that it was lacking complexity in the finish was a bit of a letdown."
Thanks to DarthKostrizer for setting me up with a bottle of this no questions asked and BHOBS for shuttling it back to the SCV!
From the release a couple weeks ago. Tulip glass.
I had this in a pint glass poured from a 22oz bomber.
"A- Brownish copper color with a fluffy off-white head that keeps a healthy cap, lacing the glass nicely as it goes down."
"Opened a box from BA Tieman today expecting some Pliny or something similar and pulled this baby out. Thanks again, Dan!"
"A- 2 fingers frothy white head. Hazy, golden orange zest color. Lace holds on to the glass. This is what a IIPA should look like. "
"I was fortunate to get two fresh bottles this week. First time with this uber-hyped cult hero. To be honest I was sure this was just going to be another really good DIPA that gets the uber hype so associated with anything made in limited supply that is equally very well made, in my wine world it is the Screaming Eagles, Schraders and SQN'S. To my pleasant surprise this is the Schrader of the craft beer world. The first thing that told me this was special was the nose, huge hoppy, all stinky and sweet, simply amazing. The color is a nice clear golden yellow with a medium head with nice lacing as I drink down. The flavor profile is awesome, sweet tropical fruit, loads of grapefruit,crushed orange peel and a oyster shell mineralality underline the overall package. The mouth feel is unlike any other, tangy carbonation that leaves bone dry and ready for another quaff. I am so glad I finally was able to taste this beer. And I will say it is worth every bit the well deserved hype it gets."
"Finally got my hands on this one, a fresh bottle from the Thanksgiving release. It pours a really fantastic honey straw color, hints of amber, hints of goldenrod with an aggressive 3 fingers of soapy head on top. This guy sports some wicked lacing and a nice layer of soapy head sits atop the entire way down, very impressed at first glance. The smell is overwhelming, an insane amount of dank hops hit the nose, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, some bubble gum all play a role, but none crowd the other out and a nice soft grain straw aroma seals the deal, just enough to remind you there IS malt in this. Nice bitter kick of hops on the tongue, earthier than the nose leads on, resinous pine, some sappy flavors, but it doesn't let you forget the citrus, big grapefruit and zesty acidic flavors come to the show, a hint of biscuit, but it's nothing more than the faintest of counterbalances. It really pushes the envelope of hoppiness, Pliny the Elder does a great job of having that mad hoppy thing going for it, but it reigns them in exceptionally well, this reminds me more of Hop Riot in the sense that it's just overwhelmingly hopped, but Citra sets itself apart from all challengers with the perfect balance of flavors and remains quite drinkable. It's got a nice body, a bit soapy from the head, but overall, really nice, not too big and chewy and nowhere near too thing."
Poured from the bottle (batch released on 11/25/11) into tulip.

"Golden amber, white head, decent lacing."
A - Deep amber with a half inch head that dissipates to a fine lacing after about 1 minute.
"Glad to have finally tried a beer that has been on my wish list for so long. This was made possible when Kern River finally decided to bottle this great beer. Pours a hazy gold/copper-orange-amber body. Large, off-white head formed from a sizable stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. Good retention holds the head up for a few minutes before crashing to a nice skim and a well-defined ring. Nice coating of lacing. Aroma picked up some tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange dominate up front. A nice resinous quality. Some zesty spice. Tons of hops, but a sizable malt base. Like the nose there are massive doses of hops and malt here in the flavor profile. The hops are pronounced with mango and grapefruit separating themselves from the rest of the citric notes. Creamy, medium body with good rolling carbonation. Resinous and oily. Solid bitterness throughout culminating with a nice aggressive floral bite."
"Smells mainly of citrus--mango, orange with pine in the background. First smell was very promising. "

From tap to tulip glass
"Thanks to Richard for sending me a 22 oz bottle. Wish I could've saved this to try along side fresh Heady Topper and Ephraim next week, but promised I'd consume immediately upon receipt. Bummer :)."
"Bottle. Clear golden pour with a nice white head. Tropical fruit & citrusy hop aromas. The taste pretty much follows suit with peach, orange, mango, pineapple, and pine notes supported by a muted caramel malt backbone. Light and refreshing. A very nice DIPA, but maybe not worth all the hype..."
"Finally! I get to try this one! Pours a slightly hazy, golden orange color with a large white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is AMAZING! Extremely hoppy with a ton of citrus aroma and pine. Maybe a bit of tropical fruits as well. Such a pleasant smell. Taste is initially hoppy as hell with lovely grapefruit and orange flavors. A bit of melon and pineapple mixed nicely with hop resin and pine needles. Amazing west coast taste. Mouthfeel is full bodied and well carbonated. A little on the sticky side, but not overdone. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a wonderful DIPA that I wish I had more of. The Whole Foods in Valencia only let me purchase one bottle, and I couldn't find anymore anywhere in LA. I would love to do a side by side with some Pliny."
"Big thanks to splax23 for forwarding on this bottle in a recent trade, jazzed to try another beer from Kern. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife."

WOW.
"22 ounce bottle courtesy of smarcoly, I can't thank you enough for this. Split with my buddy Nick for a video review and poured into two globe glasses."

22oz bottle (care of Stupac2 - thanks!) poured into a sam adams perfect pint. Super fresh - this was released ~2 weeks ago and been refridgerated for half of that time.
Growler from Sideswipe served in tulip pints and shared with a bunch of awesome ba's. 
"Pours a light honey orange color, with an eggshell colored finger of fluffy head, nice lacing. "

Bomber from the most recent release (about a month old I think) poured into a snifter. Thanks Ross (locke459)
Poured into a tulip.
"Big thanks to McDiddyPop for the share, and for setting up a very enjoyable mini-tasting. Citra pours a slightly hazed orange-copper hue, and is capped with a nice off-white head, leaving small lace deposits as the glass is upended. The nose is, unsurprisingly, heavily citric, and is backed by a nice sugary sweetness with no aromatic suggestion of caramel (a plus in my book.) Notes of candied tangerine, lemon zest, sweet pink grapefruit and a hint of Saturn (donut) peach are found in both the olfactory as well as the gustatory. The malt (and mouthfeel) is, again, on the lighter side for a DIPA, which is just how I like it; it has a very nice sugar cookie-like tastiness which is quite complementary to the hop profile. The hop component, by the way, is unquestionably nice, but is neither vibrant nor complex enough to be on the world-class level of, say, fresh Pliny or Double Trouble. Nevertheless, it is a delicious and delectable brew, and is every bit as good as its smaller sibling, the aptly dubbed 'Just Outstanding'."
Huge thanks to glazeman for dropping this long-sought-after whale off at my house prior to the beginning of a 3 month stint without tasting sessions. Been waiting a long time for this one.
Fresh bottle as an extra from pastradul! Thanks buddy!
Bottle thanks to jmadrigal2. Thanks Jose! Poured from 22oz bottle into a tulip glass.
Generously hooked up in a trade from Slaphappysnark. Fresh and sticky. Thank you Becky!

a fresh bottle thanks to vacax
"First off, this beer was enjoyed at an EPIC stout tasting (KtG, BT, BA Speedway, DL, Jackie O's BA DA, etc...) and this was probably the best beer we had that night. It's just outrageously delicious."
"Growler pour to a La fin du monde tulip, huge thanks to Brian for this one."
Poured from a bomber into a Lost Abbey tulip. Big thanks to Jodan for the chance to try this one. 
Another bottle thaks to jodan.

22 ounce bomber split and poured into a Portsmouth tulip.
Big thanks to stupac2 for hooking me up with this one. Released a week ago today. Enjoyed on 08/27/11.
"A: Rusty orange, hazy, almost muddy. White head"
Bottled opened on 8/26 and poured into my RR pint glass. 
"Bottled something like 8-19-11. Pours a slightly hazy golden-orange color. Big fluffy white cap of head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. Big, inviting, juicy tropical hops in the nose, balanced slightly with a touch of malt sweetness. This is clearly not one of those dry hop bomb DIPAs - instead the nose brings you right in. Really, really nice. Taste is citric, tame hop bitterness. Tropical (not as crazy tropical as Jai Alai, though), juicy, with a reasonable amount of malt balance. Clearly more juicy hop flavor that bitterness, which is pretty low key and appears mostly in the finish. Not dry by any means, but the malt sweetness and body is medium relative to some sweet and heavy DIPAs. This is exactly the way I prefer my hoppy beers. I do feel like this might be better on tap and clearly freshness will be very important. Still really nice with big, juicy, tropical hop flavor. I could drink this constantly. Another great beer from what seems to be a place that makes some good ones."
"Pours a nice and clear orange. A nice bit of white head. Smells like Citra up the wazoo. Hops but not too much bitterness. Tastes similar. Incredibly crisp and hoppy, not too bitter. The taste of this beer is as clean as I could ever expect. Smooth but low carbonation. Overall top notch"
Growler courtesy of cam
"A: Pours a muddy golden color and has pretty solid head, lacing is ok."
A: Poured Dark Golden color with a one finger head. Good lacing.
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Stone I.R.S. tulip. A finger and a half of big frothy white head. Beautiful dark golden color. The smell. Where do I begin? Grapefruit, mango, pineapple, pine and sweet malt are all present. Top 5 noses on an IPA I can remember. Citrus and more citrus on the palate. Medium dry. 3/4 of the way to super bitter. The finish lingers drying out my tongue. The mouthfeel is very creamy, I wish there was a bit more prickling my tongue. Holy crap I love this beer."
"22oz bottle with no bottled on or freshness date, poured into Hair of the Dog tulip, reviewed on 8/25/11."
"Pours a crystal clear amber with a nice white head (historically when only on tap it was cloudy orange with some particulates; clarity is as a result, I'm told in a change in brewing procedures for bottling). "
Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a pretty clear golden amber color. Very nice and thick white head. Super sticky lacing.
"As always, a BIG thanks to Kim for holding these for me. You Rock!"
I have been driving to KRBC 1-4 times a month. I have tasted everything. My favorites are Citra and Class 5.

Kern River Citra DIPA
I have been trying to get my hands on Citra for some time and I finally copped a bottle down the from my house.
Split a bomber with Walows. Been dying to try this for ages but our Kern River fishing trip/beer journey has yet to pan out...
Thanks to DarthKostrizer for the growler share and Alucard4 for picking it up. 
Growler shared with MrVonzipper
First and foremost - a big thank you to Kyle the brewer for finally bottling this and making it a little more accessible for people to try what I consider my favorite overall beer I have ever had. 
Growler shared with Stupac2.
"Pours a light gold. Actually kind of surprisingly light for a DIPA. The beer has a nice foamy head that sticks around. The aroma is pungent and hoppy. Tons of hops, no noticeable malt on the nose. The hops are citrusy and floral, there is some pineapple on the nose and just a hint of pine. The taste is pure hops but there is noticeable sweetness on the palette. This is actually less hop forward than I was expecting. The balance is good, not too sweet with a nice refreshing burst of hops. "
Bomber split with my brother a day after the release.
Thanks to Chris for sharing this growler.
A: Lovely cloudy golden hue.
A - Slightly hazy orange copper with a long lasting whitish head. Tons of lacing left throughout.
A: cloudy unfiltered looking with a nice vibrant orange/gold hue
On tap in sample size at the 2011 Bistro DIPA Fest. Pours a hazy golf with a dense white froth. Malty brown sugar and candied lemon hops on the nose with a piney accent. Flavor is lemon zest with a light pale malt note. I appreciate the hop focus without a syrupy malt profile but it also is allowing a soapy astringent note to come through. Solid bitterness but not really up to DIPA standards. A good beer but I'm not buying the hype here.
"From notes 4/9/2010 - Had this on tap at O'Brien's in San Diego. It was cloudy, no chance of seeing through, the keg had just been tapped so that might've had to do with it... but the color was a nice burnt orange and the head was fairly meager. My rating for the appearance is on what I think it would be had it not been ""O'Brienified."" Their pours often do a bit of injustice to the beers appearance. The smell profile was very similar to blind pig but even more potent. Very citrusy. The flavor was similar as well but carried an even bigger mango presence than Blind Pig normally does. I perceived this as a fairly well attenuated beer, not a syrupy sweet mess. Very enjoyable."
On-tap at Downtown Johnny Browns in San Diego. Poured into a Pint Glass.
An outstanding example of a Double Indian Pale Ale
Been waiting for this one for a while. Thanks go out to mrbubbler for the opportunity.
Thanks to Damian (Solomon420) for the trade
I had this at a growler share. thanks for sharing tjmodica! I never had heard of Kern River and was asked to try this since I'm a big hophead. Glad I didn't pass this one up.
"Tried on April 14, 2010. Growler shared by Mike. Thanks Mike!! Pours orange with white head. Aroma is citrus and pine. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is lip smack puckering, tart, juicy, grapefruit rind, and finishes with a touch of tart pineapple. This was my first brew that I know of that uses Citra hops. Great stuff. Thanks Mike!!"
"A - Poured with a small head of white foam that settles quickly and leaves good lace. The body is a hazy, copper-orange."
"Been hearing good things about the citra, and now I have a growler to share thanks to Marisatheyounger, your the woman."
"On tap at the T, 2010."

A growler.
Received from a very generous Marisatheyounger. Huge thanks to her for this want of mine.
A good friend acquired this in a trade and generously shared it at a low-key tasting. Thanks Jonathan!
"Thanks to Ultraman9000 for the trade for this growler. I have to echo starrdogg (who was at my tasting) that I expected the beer to be one of the best DIPAs ever, and it fell short of that, but still was a very nice beer. "
"Big thanks to Dreadnaught33 for sharing a growler of this one last night. It's one I've been looking forward to for a long, long time."
Thanks to Austin for the opportunity. Growler shipped to and enjoyed with friends in Las Vegas the past weekend. Wasn't sure if I'd have the opportunity to try this and certainly didn't expect to be walking through the MGM Grand drinking this from a wine glass and returning to the room multiple times to sample this growler. 
Huge thanks to jpaco47 for sharing this!
Thanks to Solomon420 for the hookup! 
"A growler of the new batch (from February 10, 2011, I think) courtesy of mrbubbler. Thanks! Opened on February 25, 2011."
Had on-tap at Gourmet Haus Staudt in Redwood City for Kern RIver night as a part of SF Beer Week. Served in an Aventinus glass.
Received a growler from marisatheyounger at the end of last year..thanks!
This is a review of the recent batch released on Feb 10. 
On tap at Beer Revolution for Kern River day during SF Beer Week.
"On tap poured into a tulip pint glass. Beer pours a cloudy and hazy golden yellow with a finger of pure white foamy head. Head dissipated quickly to the surface, leaving a bit of lacing. Some carbonation is visible through the hazy beer, but I'm pretty excited for the haze as that means a bit of dry hopping for this style. "
Somehow I forgot to review this beer. Got it more than a few months back from Solomon420. Thanks D!
"I have been wanting to try this one for a long time now, a big thanks to Chris for bringing this back. Pours light golden orange with a small white cap, good retention and lacing. Smells of citra hops and straw, very grassy with some bright citrus fruit, slightly malty and very balanced. Taste is grassy and bitter, pale malts but not sweet, some orange and tropical fruit hops in the finish. Medium bodied with a medium light carbonation. A very drinkable IPA. Not my favorite of the night, but this is the one I went back for more of. Very subtle flavors for the style, an excellent DIPA."
"Poured from 22oz brown bomber into a Duvel tulip. Sticker states ""Hand bottled Jan. 2, 2011"" on bottle neck. Able to try this brew only due to the exceptional generosity of Solomon420."
thanks to Wadsey for sharing the growler
Growler. Courtesy of maltzilla. Poured into a tulip glass a slightly cloudy orange amber color with a slightly off white head head that laces nicely as it settles. Aroma is that of tropical fruit like mango mixed with citrus. Malty start gives way to a very strong hop profile that lingers on and has nice flavors of citrus and fruit. Nicely done and well blended.
"Got this growler thanks to route66pubs. Thanks a ton, man! Shared with my roomate and another BA on Christmas day. Served into my town hall snifter:"
Thanks to bu11zeye for sharing this growler. 
"2010 release poured on-tap at the brewery in Kernville into a pint glass. The beer has a bright yello/gold color to it, with no head. The beer has a citrus accent to the pine and hops smells of their regular IPA. On tasting, you get a very instant flavor of grapefruit, with the hops and floral flavors of their flagship IPA underneath for balance. There is a bit of a sour and bitter aftertaste, but again remains balanced. Despite the finish, the beer is still pretty easy to drink. Decent brew."
"I saw Naja's Place posting on facebook that they got Citra in on tap, so I made it over there to get me some before it all ran out. "
"On tap at 38 degrees in Alhambra,CA. Beautiful example of what a IPA should be. Perfectly balanced taste between the malt and citra hops. Citrus notes blow at you followed by the dryness but that's expected of this style. Nice head retention and very very drinkable. Am glad to have been able to sample this fine beer."
"Re-review off a growler on 12/11/10. This is much more bitter and less aromatic than previous batches. Still good, but much less drinkable, and the scores have been adjusted. I understand batch variation happens, but this is a pretty big swing. "
"I could smell the Citra all the way in Orange County as a keg was tapped at 38 Degrees in Alhambra. Served in a large snifter, on to the beer:"
Poured from a freshly opened growler -- bottled 4 days ago -- into a tulip. Thanks to marisatheyounger for sending it.
"On-tap at Beachwood BBQ, glad to see this finally in the Southland,"
Big thanks to Jose for getting this to me. I love the tropical fruit like hoppiness I got from other Citra hopped beers I've had so I've really been looking forward to this one. Opened up the growler to share with my Fiance as we put up the Christmas tree. 
on tap at toronado SD for SDBW - kern river night
Drove over 600 miles to get a couple growlers of this bad boy..
APPEARANCE: 
"Pours a hazy deep orange with a fairly small head, but some pretty wicked sticky lacing is left when I swirl the brew around in my glass."
"Thanks to ramnuts, I was fortunate enough to try this exceptional DIPA."
"Reviewed from notes taken on my BlackBerry Saturday 11-13-10. I think it was Monday or Tuesday last week when I got a BM from the always generous ramnuts simply titled ""Citra"". In the BM he went onto explain that he had a growler headed his way from arbitrator and wanted to share it! So a big thanks goes out to ramnuts for giving me the chance to try this improbable want and thanks to arbitrator for directing some of this CA rarity up here to North West. "
"Scored a growler of this thanks to a very generous BA in a trade. Pours a hazy orange with a brilliantly forming two finger off white head with great retention and lacing. gorgeous pour. The smell is absurd. It is seriously like heaven. I have given 5's before for aroma. I have never smelled anything like this. Grapefruit, peach, lemon, orange, passion fruit, pineapple, pine, and pure deliciousness. I want to smell this all day long. Seriously."
Really excited for this growler!
"I put this one up with Pliny. A magnificent beer that smells of orange, pine, tangelo - enough with the descriptive words. If you know WCIPA's, then this is everything that you've dreamed."
On tap at Toronado's San Diego. Served in a pint glass. 
Big thanks to the KRBC for bringing a growler and a keg to the Pour House in Paso Robles for the FW14 after party.
"A big thanks goes out to einhorn and PasoPourHouse for making this available to all of the BAs at the Firestone 14 After Party at The Pour House in Paso Robles, CA. Shawn, thanks again for hosting this event!"
"Absolutely fantastic beer and among the best DIPAs that I've ever tried. I had a few glasses of this beer and was just blown away. I really didn't expect it to live up to the hype, but I was happily wrong on that score. It has easily the best Citra flavor in the 10 or so Citra IPAs I've tried so far. It was all very bright floral and tangerine notes. The beer is quite well made. Just enough light malt sweetness to carry the hops. Finishes mildly dry and refreshing. Little to no harshly bitter notes, just tons of incredible hops. The hop flavors seem fresh and interesting. There's practically none of the blandly bitter notes that drown out all of the delicacy in so many other (D)IPAs. Mouthfeel was light and fairly smooth for all of the hops. No booze presence. The beer looks good - a bright, hazy yellow-orange body with a good white head. This is a very easy beer to like and makes me want to make the long drive down to Kernville."
Big thanks to alcstradamus for splitting this one at our tasting.
64 oz growler split and poured into a Duvel tulip.

Growler acquired via trade...thanks Adam. Poured into my Moonlight pint glass.
"Thanks for billshmeinke for sending a growler my way. I waited a few days after receiving it to split with a buddy, so I was a little concerned about the carbonation. However, pouring this into a Delirium Tremens snifter left a nice fluffy two-finger head. Holding it up to a light reveals a dark orange, almost brown, appearance. A few swirls leaves spidery lacing around the edges of the snifter. The aroma is something to behold...it was immediately noticeable after the pour and both the caramel from the malts and pleasant piney/orange citrus hops took center stage. Taste closely follows the aroma, with a near-perfect balance of the the caramelly malt backbone and those wonderful Citra hops...just right amount of bitterness, not overpowering. The mouthfeel is also about near-perfect for a DIPA....not too syrupy, just nice medium-bodied, smooth, and creamy DIPA. I don't know if I would rate this ahead of Pliny, Dreadnaught, and a few others, but it is one highly-drinkable brew and if available, I'd have a constant supply in the fridge....we polished off that growler a little quicker than I thought we would...it just goes down so smooth, with just enough hop bitterness to make you want another swig. Nice job Kern River!!"
Thanks to PeaceLoveBeer for the try. Growler shared with some awesome BAs last night.
"The illustrious Citra DIPA is finally here. I've been drooling over this for quite some time, and now I finally get a shot thanks to the awesome trader Solomon420."
Big thanks to PeaceLoveBear for this one!
Growler received in trade with mrbubbler. I've been lucky getting some of my larger wants lately and this is one of the biggest - big thanks for the opportunity to try this one. Poured into a Duvel tulip.

Poured into a nonic.
"So...I got a couple of 500ml bottles, filled today, the same day the Growler was opened, from tkunkel, as he was passing through Casper ( he BMd me asking if I wanted some of this beer called Citra. He saw it on my Wants List.) Hehe....thanks, Tom!. He didn't WANT anything in return but I gave him a bottle of something anyway...."
"Appearance: Best part of the beer, nice cloud/haze to a honey-straw-golden pour. Perfect white head which leaves some good craggy peaks, although not much lacing down the glass."
BIG thank you to jobcrackerbah for this...

On tap at the brewery 6/27/10
"I guess if #500 was righteous, so should review #501. . . Had on tap Saturday night at the brewery. Was amazed how much it looked like a hefe, all the suspended yeast and massive carbonation left me w/ said impression. Prior versions like I had at the Bistro seemed more orange, less hazy. Aroma was phenomenal, I think I've come to realize that citra hops are my fave aroma wise."
Big thanks to Deuane for sharing this growler!

"Wow. Just wow. Many thanks to inflames, who sent this pretty much out of the goodness of his heart (though I hope to repay him in kind)."
"I was a beer tasting party and some brought a growler of the incredible DIPA. Fairly new and unheard of brewery, but they hit a home run with this one. I ended up blow off the other brews a stay with this yummy brew. It is the best drinking DIPA I have ever had. It starts with a bright citrus hop that dances on your tongue. Its ends anything but bitter, just a fresh hop flavor that lingers."
Growler shared by Joe - much obliged!
Big thanks to dgb3 for generously sending this growler my way. I've had the Citra Hop exactly one time from a homebrewed IPA and it was bomb.com. Drank from my Surly AHA Rally pint glass.
"Thanks to jophish17 for sharing this last Friday. Poured a lovely peach color into a tulip glass. White 1/4"" fluffy head...quite a super looking glass of ale. Unbelievable dank aroma on this one- subtle pine, white pepper, spearmint, peach with big tropical fruit notes. Very soft and delicate up front then the mango and peach start shining. A hint of bitter navel orange rind, finishing dry with a long lasting hop flavor. Not much malt detected, which I don't mind with an IPA like this. Very, very nice CA DIPA!"
Fresh growler courtesy of tkunkel. many thanks man!

Mad propers to Alex for breaking out this surprise growler recently... Review transcribed from notes.
"I had this on tap at the Kern River Brew pub. I think the other reviews speak for this beer. I could just sit and smell this beer all day it smells so good. It's a tropical fruit salad. The taste is great as well. As far as drinkability, I could drink a growler in a siting it's so good. Get some!"
"Big thanks to Jose for sending me this one from the heart of Sequoia National Forest. Shared with the Chicago crowd, served in a Hopleaf tulip glass."
Thanks to Alex for sharing this tasty beverine.
Thanks to drabmuh for splitting his growler with me.
Managed to grab a growler of this through a recent trade. Thanks. Beer is yellow and light in color but completely hazy. Carbonation is moderate which is good since its a growler. There is a lot of lacing on the glass from the white head of small to medium bubbles. Looks nice.
Thanks to chswimmer for sending me this growler. I just couldnt resist this one seeing it sit in the fridge for a couple of days
"Growler shared by chswimmer. Craig was nice enough to share this beer, but then he and others at the tasting were absolutely horrified when I revealed that I thought this beer was...wait for it...really good. As in, really good, not the most incredible liquid ever produced in the history of the world. They attempted to rip up my notes and torture me to the point where I changed my score to an A+, but I resisted."
"Huge thanks to chswimmer for sending this one my way. I knew i had to get ahold of it and quick as word was out, this was one killer dipa. Served cold and enjoyed the whole damn thin last night on 04/10/10."
Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass.
Thanks to chswimmer for sharing this awesome beer.
Growler shared by chswimmer. Thanks!
Very excited to see this on-tap at the Goat. I have been wanting to try a citra-only IPA/DIPA. The fact that it's a Kern brew is just the icing on the cake.
"Citra Hop DIPA from Kern River is hands down the best DIPA I have ever had!!! It is quite possibly the best beer I have ever had. Had 3 pints on tap at the Surly Goat last night and was in hophead grapefruit heaven! Easy drinking, supper dry eight percenter that finishes like a glass of grapefruit juice without a hint sweetness. It blows my mind that it can have such a heavy existence of grapefruit notes without even a trace of being cloyingly sweet. Citra DIPA achieves perfect balance without sacrificing the overwhelming hop forward presence of Citra hops. Mouthfeeling and drinkability add to the experience and draw you back for at least seconds and thirds as each pint reveals greater depth and enhances the experience of having the perfect beer. If Just Outstanding is just outstanding (and it is) than Citra DIPA is Just F***ing Amazing!"
Thanks to Damian for hand bottling two 500ml bottles (even printing nice labels) and sending my way in a trade. Tasted exactly one week after coming from the tap. Poured into a toulip glass.
On tap at the goat.
Had this on tap at Toronado (SD) and had to seek out a growler. Thanks Damian (Solomon420)!
Thanks to Solomon420 for a growler of this when it first came out.
I think my scores for ASTMD speak for themselves. I had this on tap at Toronado's in San Diego... Poured beautifully into a glass with a little bit of head. The color/appearance was spectacular. It smelled wonderful as it tasted just as good. 
"10/2015 - huge hoppiness, tangerine, big malts, ethanol on the nose; dank, pine flavors pair nicely with more tangerine, orange zest; surprisingly dry, lightly bitter finish, with a touch of heat in the back. I like this more than Pliny the Younger for sure."
"Taster and shot-ski at brewery. For a big triple IPA, it’s pretty smooth, almost seems harmless. Goes down very easy, hoppy, but not much evidence of the high ABV. Light golden, mild haze, small fluffy head. Here’s a beer you could drink until...you realized what you were drinking. Tasty."
Had on tap. Just a luscious and delicious dipa. And extremely drinkable too! That 12 percent is dangerously unnoticeable amongst floral and citrus hops and the hazy and bready backbone of the beer. Just bursts off the palate
Growler fill poured into a snifter.
This pours a darker tan caramel color. I get a sweetish citrus aroma that's matched by the taste from each sip. Sweet sticky citrusy and smooth. Hides its abv well.
"Sampled at cophenhagen beer festival in Boston, MA."
Tasted at Copenhagen Festival
10oz tulip on tap at THG. 
"On draft at Boneyard tasting room. Light golden in appearance. Taste was malty with a citrusy component. It was very good for as high ABV as it was, but honestly I don't get the hype."
Had a fresh crowler of this on 4/8/2017
Crowler Date: 3/8/17
had this on tap at the mule bar in Winooski VT. 
Smooth as hell for a triple with 11.5 ABV
Had this on tap on 12/3 at Growler Guys in Portland.
"This beer is pretty damn difficult to distinguish between it and PTY. Seriously. For years now I've been just skipping the big line at the DIPA fest for PTY and just getting Notorious with no line, the beers are almost indistinguishable. "
"A great looking IPA, nice clear orange with decent head. Smells of tropical fruit, grapefruit dank but a bit muted. Taste follows. Not sure if they sent a fresh keg to Shelton Festival, will have to revisit out west. But this fell short of they hype for me."
L- pours a hazy orange color with a half inch head that dissipates fairly quickly.
Coppenhagen Beer Fest Boston sample pour. This has been a want of mine for a while. It was really good. Huge and citrusy. Pithy and resiny but also had some pretty intense fruity hop notes. I often find Triple IPAs are too sweet and boozy; the structure of the beer is all off. This one bucks that trend.
Beer comes in a deep gold to Amber.
thanks mark. this is so good. dangerously smooth and drinkable. the heat is invisible and not syrupy. easy drinking. I am super impressed with this brew...esp since this is a tripleading ipa.
"This is basically like a hoppy barleywine, imho."
"I received a crowler sent from my cousin. I was worried that because I was out of town and it has been quite warm by the time I got home the hops may have fallen off. My worries were eased as soon as I cracked the beer open . The smell instantly filled my nostrils. Lemon, citrus, floral, pure deliciousness. The crowler retained the carbonation well and I got a good amount of head. The taste ... amazing. Similar to the smell citrus and floral and not to bitter with just the right amount of sweetness. Overall and awesome beer. Hopefully I'll get to try it again one day."
"21oz crawler from the brewery, poured into a snifter"
"I was really surprised by how much I loved this beer! Sampled at the Growler Guys in Portland, where I picked up a growler can (don't know the technical term for these). Shared with a friend, served it in a tulip glass."
"I've noticed that more than a few reviewers have described this triple as too sweet. Yes, it has a good deal of sweetness, but a lot of that can be attributed to the very skillful hopping which imparts a complex array of fruity esters to this delicious triple IPA. There is a full spectrum of tropical fruitiness, as well as a dynamic citric component, and even an undefined, subtle spiciness that really fleshes out the flavor profile. There is also a dank component that could be compared to the nose of certain marijuana strains, or even a certain plant that is redolent of cat pee. I don't mean this in a negative way, but rather as a further complement to the overall flavor profile. This triple IPA absolutely ranks among the upper echelon of its peers."
"OMG! Perfect body, not too heavy, and not too light. Immensely complex flavor profile featuring peach, mango, guava, pineapple, papaya, strawberry, melon mandarin orange and tangerine. Could be a bit creamier, but the body is lightly syrupy, and that's just perfect for me. The heat is very restrained for 12%, and the finish is very long, smooth, and even candied (in a good way). Well deserving of its ranking."
"32 oz crowler. Pours hazy deep orange, finger white head with good retention, soapy lace. Light sweet n citrusy aroma. Big flavors hide the huge abv, sweet malt and citrus peel balance pretty well with the edge going to the sweet side. Earthy hop finish. Slick mouthfeel. Very good triple IPA."
"The beer is a dark amber color and I can see through the glass. Looks like a west coast IPA. I get a lot of pineapple on the aroma along with sweet, sticky hop resin. Taste is sweet apple, pineapple, grape, pear, and white wine. There's an earthy bitterness on the finish. The feel is syrupy, thick, and sweet and the 12% is well hidden. This is one of the better triple IPAs, but the style isn't one of my favourites."
Reddish copper with a thin but substantial blanket of foam that retains throughout.
"Have had Pliny the Younger and Elder, Heady Topper, Melvin 2x4, and 4x8 and several other highly ranked imperial IPAs, and must say that Notorious stands up with all of them, would definitely rank it superior to the Younger, and the Topper, not sure if it is better than the Melvins, but it is certainly elite. If you can get it at its freshest in Bend, I am not sure you'll find a better imperial IPA, as it is incredibly well balanced, has a unique and smooth feel with a great finish that is not overwhelming but is just right for an imperial IPA that really hides the alcohol very well."
"Pours a gold/orange color with a slight white head. Big danky hop smell to this one. Can smell it without putting it up to your nose. Tastes of pine, oranges, and malt. This is a big IPA, but the alcohol is blended well within it. Great beer!"
"Pours orangeish and thick. Sticky resinous hops dominate with a nearly creamy mouthfeel. Dank. Such strong ABV but pretty smooth, malt and hops fairly balanced here. Great Triple."
Nirvana!
"Clear amber appearance. Nice pleasant piney/citrusy smell. Earthy hops are abundant with pine, resin and citrus presence in the taste. Very well balanced malt backbone that makes this brew very smooth and full bodied. No hint at all of the 12% abv, and it's dangerously easy to drink."
"Tangerine, or something! Yum!"
L: Golden orange yellow color with a frothy head and lots of lacing on the glass.
"Fantastic triple IPA. Wonderful smell of hops and citrus and drinks so smooth there is no way you would have any idea it's a 12% ABV beer. This would be one of my ""island beers"" if I could only bring a few."
"Boneyard really knows their IPAs and this is no exception. Fantastic hop presence, very resinous, citrusy and west coast hoppy magic. "
Had on Tap at Hopocalypse Day 1/23/16
"Look: Hazy orange with a frothy white foam head, solid lacing."
This is seriously the best beer I have ever had. Had a growler fill and then a second growler for later from Bert's growler garage in Ontario Oregon. Truely an amazing beer if you like IPAs that are a bit potent. Easily enjoyed (almost too easily) and lacks the extra sweetness that strong IPAs are known for. If you see this anywhere buy it.
"This beer is amazing. Loaded with tropical fruit on the nose, nice malt backbone and great fruit and hops taste. This is really easy drinking (dangerous!) for the ABV. Fantastic!"
Finally was able to track this down from a solid trader! Glad they started filling Crowlers! Most impressive TIPA I have ever tasted!!! Tons of citrus fruit nose and then lots of citrus taste on the palate!! Drinks waaaaay smoother than 11%!!!
32 ounce crowler poured into a tulip.
Bright amber color. Not much head but no matter. I smell hints of pineapple. Surprisingly smooth taste. Again faint pineapple tones. Hops are heavy but masked to my surprise. I didn't read a description of the beer but I wouldn't be taken aback if there was fruit of some kind in this. Delicious.
"Served On-Tap a number of times, updating from notes"
"Brought a crowler back from Bend, and it was about 3 weeks old but it help up beautifully. It was just tropical, slightly piney, delicious. If you can, get it. It's dangerously easy to drink as well."
11-21-15 - On tap at 8 oz Burger Bar on Capital Hill in Seattle. Served in a standard pint glass. Went extremely well with my Cajun alligator burger. Tasty and smooth. Great hop flavor with high IBUs. Awesome beer.
Pours a dark slightly hazy copper. Marks come from the lacing and head. Poured with a multiple finger frothy head. Great lacing. Very impressive for a triple ipa. Great smell. Booze does not come through which I prefer in this case. Nice balance of fruit and a bit of pine. First taste is juicy fruit. Unfortunately booziness then comes in and throws it a little out of whack. Considering abv is well within reason. Feel is very juicy. Best one I've had from this brewery.
"I was a non-beer drinking until the age of 38. I brought some Boneyard Hop Venom home from a trip to Bend, OR and chilled a couple mugs in the freezer. Started drinking it with a buddy while working on a home project and it was amazing. My first beer love. It's been my favorite the past 4 years, but now we have a new King. Notorious Triple IPA trumps my first love. Amazing beer...hoppy, citrusy, and a little pine action. Other-worldy. It's like having two beers for the price of one with the over 10%ABV. Love it!"
"L: thick frothy white head, light haziness, darker golden"
"Had this at Brouwers toward the end of a beer-tourism trip to Seattle. Over the last 5 days I've sampled dozens of IPAs, often asking brewers or bar owners for the one they considered the most explosively hoppy. This beer put every other one I've had to shame. By far the biggest, hoppiest, and most delicious IPA I've ever had."
"As I rate more beers I am more likely to call BS on all 5's. Especially some of my own. This beer was perfect. On tap at The Hoppy Brewer. Beautiful bright copper/orange with a nice sticky head. The head lasted. I could have smelled it all night. An intoxicating melange of tropical, fruity and dank hops. They really married together to just create a wonderful aroma all it's own. The taste was an intense and bitter version of the aroma. No cloying sweetness. No burn of alcohol which is impressive in a 12% ABV beer. My buddy who is not as much of a beer but, immediately commented on how incredibly smooth it was. And he was right. For a huge beer it was insanely drinkable. These big bad Imperial IPAs can go off the rails really easy but a gentle hand was at work with this beer. Well done Boneyard! Really worth all 5s."
Slight hazed golden bronze. Slight floaties in the glass. 
"Filled a growler at Elizabeth Station for 2015, Bellingham, WA, Beer Week."
"triple IPA.A very solid beer, a great introduction, Taste and smell are beautiful and make this beer, back end is very full and perfect hop bitter. with a bit of kick in the finish."
"Notorious is certainly an apt name for a beer which is this big but somehow drinks far smaller. Not in terms of its flavor and complexity, mind you, but in its ABV and sweetness. One of the exemplars in the style, now and forever."
"Really good IPA, and very drinkable for a beer with such a high ABV. However, I think I prefer Boneyard's Hop Venom double IPA over this just slightly."
1/2 pint glass @ Chuck's. Pours a clear copper w/ a sticky head.
"On tap at Apex in Portland, Oregon. "
"On tap at Hops and Pie. Orange color, not much head. Great aroma, very fruity, very nice. Flavor is off, very bitter but just doesn't follow the aroma and I don;t like it. Super boozy."
"Holy smokes! Watch out Pliny the Younger... Notorious is in the house! This is the perfect IIPA! It tastes like a lightweight double, but is NOT... This is a great beer!!"
On Tap @ Apex i PDX
"Unfortunatly the growler I received leaked, so the beer was flat. Therefore take this review with a grain of salt."
Most amazing triple Ipa no doubt this beer will be top 10 if they started bottling or had more places on tap
"Tap at Huna day, big bad double IPA, huge Pine and citrus, bitter but a touch sweet on the finish"
"Tastes like a much bigger hop venom, very resinous, piney and juicy. The epitome of west coast, big IPA. This tastes exactly like Pliny the Younger. If you can get this, don't worry about younger. "
As good as it gets.
Awesome imperial IPA. Great taste. Had this on multiple times in the past. Recently had this side by side with Pliny the Younger. This beer is solid as hell.
Everything you would want in a triple IPA. Big alcohol and big hops. Great beer. I order a pour everytime I find this on tap
"This is my favorite beer I've ever tasted. I've had the chance to drink it twice, each time at a double and triple IPA festival that also featured Pliny the Younger and other sought-after beers. It's similar to Younger, but I like it better."
Very nice double with a nice citrus backbone.
"Many thanks to TapThat for this growler. Pours a clear orange amber with a slight eggshell head. Smells of fresh C hops, grapefruit, pine, evergreen, very fresh. Tastes very crisp, lots of citrus, a bit of green apple, a bit of pine, a bit of boozy heat and nice malt backbone but not too bready. Mouthful is smooth and creamy without being to thin or too chewy. Doesn't feel its abv at all; tastes like a double IPA. One of the best triple IPAs in this great land or anywhere. Lived up to my expectations and more."
IMO this beer is perfect and as good as any IPA in america.
"The best beer I've ever tasted. Had 10 oz. pour on tap at the growler cafe in Lebanon, OR 1/2/15. This is my fourth time tasting notorious over the past 3 years and each has been one of my most memorable moments tasting beer. The rest I cannot put into words. You have to try for yourself."
"Taste: Malty, extremely hot. Overall: More of a unbalanced barley wine than an IPA."
"truly a stunning beer. about as strong as hoppy be can be and still be reasonable, but this never seems big for the sake of being big, although it undoubtedly is. the hops are so fresh in this muted thick and incredibly cloudy brew. the head never settles and ring lacing appears on every sip, leaving a horizontal zebra in the glass when the pint (yes pint!) is exhausted. aroma of mango and other tropical fruits, and of course this insane hop resin that mixes fruity with bitter in a way that seems too delicate for a beer this large. the flavor is just the same, with a definite mango character to the honey textured hops. it never shows its alcohol strength, and actually i find myself drinking it pretty swiftly given its size. great big ipa, extremely well done, seems more of a creative exploration than a junk measuring contest, which i appreciate in so many ways. thanks for making this boneyard, its delicious."
Served in a 6oz snifter on tap.
Received this as an extra in the Homebrewtalk MAW thread. Growler poured into a snifter. 
Major thanks to John for this extra!
"This is an incredibly easy-drinking DIPA, especially for 12%."
"On-tap at Toronado (SF), x2. Pours a nice opaque orange with good head + retention. The smell is pungent tropical and citrus fruit with a bit of caramel. I get grapefruit, lemon, orange, mango, and misc. tropical fruits on the taste. It is a bit sweet, but not nearly as much as a lot of other triple IPAs. The feel is a bit resiny but overall this drinks incredibly well for the ABV. Overall, I'm pretty blown away by this one. Easily in my top few double/triple IPAs."
"Reviewing Notorious from Boneyard Beer Company out of Bend, Oregon."
Served on tap with an 8 oz pour into a pint glass.
"This absolutely an amazing beer. One of the best smelling beers I have ever had. Awesome taste, for such a big beer not syrupy or boozy, as good as it gets."
"Growler pour at Woodshop 8 held at The Hermosillo in Los Angeles, CA."
Appearance- Pours up about a half a finger of head which appears to have excellent retention. The head is a pure cotton white while the body is a pale amber which shows as a golden straw when held up to the light. A good amount of sheeting. 
on-tap @ Horse Brass Pub.
Growler thanks to Todd. Served in a DryHop taster glass.
"Low aroma, mid carbonation, sweet with a little bitter, sweet with a little bitter linger. Similar to Alpha Queen Imperial IPA but without the underarm sweat."
So good. Had at the Boneyard plant in Bend. Pours a nice copper color and a decent head. Hops and hops and hops. Well balanced and flavorful - completely surprised by this since it was 11%. Great carbonation which was nice on a hot day. Great beer which I will keep a lookout when I can
32 oz growler courtesy of Duane. His generosity knows no satiety. Thanks a bunch buddy!
32 oz. growler poured into a snifter.
Review from notes. Had on tap at Latona.
On tap at Apex in Portland
"32 growlerette that my younger brought back from Bend for me, shared with him, thanks bro!"
Served in a snifter at Bailey's.
"Growler from Main Brew. A well done TIPA is joyous experience, one I haven't had in a few years (since I last had Younger, IIRC)"
"on tap, brouwers"
On tap at Bailey's
Served on tap at Saraveza in Portland on 2/23/13. 
10oz at Latona Pub
8 oz at Apex.
"This was an outstandingly good beer. Maybe the best triple IPA I've had. Had on tap at apex, this is a beer heaven. "
Tasted at the brewery and from a 32 growlerette. Beer was just tapped and about as fresh as it gets.
"Chilled grenade (500 mL growler) into a glass. Courtesy of ramnuts and his smooth ways with the lady bartenders. Thanks, Frank!"
"Had on-tap at Apex (2-11). Enjoyed alongside Pliny the Younger to see if the comparison was valid. Nice tropical fruit forward nose and taste, big alcohol warming sensation lets me know to be careful, less bitterness than I expected, a touch sweeter than PtY. Very creamy beer with a slick finish. While very similar in appearance (both beers are pale gold) Notorious looks exceptional with a light amount of haze a fantastic lacing."
"When it comes to extreme IPAs the theme tends to be the more bitter the better, balance be damned. They can be fun, but I often walk away feeling like someone took a chinook flamethrower to the back of my mouth. "
"This has become my fave IPA! As I say Avery's Hog Heaven is a Barley Wine for IPA lovers, this is a IPA for Barley Wine lovers! Pours a beautiful clean amber color, with a little light white head. Hop aroma fills the air as it pours. The only reason I marked the smell a little low is to leave room for true aroma brews, and the alcohol smell is a little strong if you smell it up close. The flavor is sweet, strong, caramel, smooth(hard to believe it's 12%) and lingers on the pallet. I pray if the Boneyard bottles anything, they bottle this. I would love to see how it ages!"
12/03/2011
A: Poured a yellowish orange with a nice white cap
A beer like this is exactly the name. Notorious...
On tap at Belmont Station the other day. 
"Comes out of the tap a pretty clear golden amber with a typical off-white head. Aroma is EXTREMELY hoppy and evergreen with a surprising honey-sweet undertone. Drinking this beer is like drinking one of Oregon’s famous Douglas firs - it is seriously evergreen, yet has almost no bitterness and is rather sweet. Thick, smooth, mildly fizzy texture leaves an evergreen and subtly sweet finish."
Appears solid clear gold with a small white head.
Hand bottle from Tony.
"On tap at the Boneyard Tasting Room, 6.13.11, multiple samples."
On tap at the Happy Gnome. An easy drinking DIPA.
Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing CO pint glass
Chili Cook-off 2015
"Barely hazy golden beer with a sticky head. The aroma is yeasty, malty, fruity and piney. The taste is sweet, grassy, citrusy and super bitter. Nice medium mouthfeel with great carbonation. Glad to have finally tried this and a welcome break from the many NEIPAs I’ve been drinking."
Lots of pine in this awesome DIPA. It pours dark amber with a red-like hue. The aroma and flavor profile are dominated by pine and grassy notes. The malt base is awesome and balances the intense bitterness very nicely. Full bodied. 
"A wonderful ""old school"" double. I love the bitterness and over the top hops. I never miss getting some when I see it."
Body is just faintly sandy of haze with a large but light off-white foam that dies much quicker than you think to a thin ring leaving some sporadic fuzzy lace.
Poured from 16oz can into glass. Stamped 'CANNED ON DATE' of '10/18/17 08:33'.
"Tasted from can. Pours a slight hazy orange with white head. Aroma is tropical and citrus fruits with some floral notes. Taste is pretty in your face bitter. Flavors of orange, resin, pine, grapefruit, passion fruit, floral notes. Huge bitter IPA. Very well done."
I'm sharing a can of this with my bro-in-law over the 4th Holiday. It poured a hazy orangish with no head and no lace. The scent had hints of sweetness and citrus spice. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink for a dipa. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation. Overall it was a solid beer.
"Rcvd in trade. Two cans. This was poured into a pint glass and a snifter. There was barely any difference between the two glasses. The appearance was a nice looking hazy orange to brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. Once the head died down, the lacing wove around the glass in a nice speckled sort of fashion. The smell had a nice blend of sweet citrus to sweet sharp freshly cut pine and it came through in a strong aromatic way allowing a decent sweet maltiness to come out as it warmed. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and added a nice sweet maltiness coating my taste buds. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was there. The normal harshness of an AIPA was there assaulting my tongue very good. Overall, what a great beer all around. Well worthy of having again."
A - nice golden amber semi clear color with an off white head that sticks and leaves a nice lacing
"Trying this at home now to give it a fair shot. Pours a golden blonde with hints of honey, light haze. Head starts off at a webby 2 fingers, then recedes somewhat quickly to a bubbly ring. "
Poured from a pint can. The beer pours a nice orangish color with a lot of small floaties. The smell is huge citrus with orange and grapefruit. The taste follows with a small malt backbone. Overall a great beer that easy too easy to drink for the ABV.
L: Nice orange amber color.
"The beer looks golden and clear. It also has a great head that last a long time. The smell of the beer is floral and hoppy. The taste of the beer is full and hoppy. Very good taste. The feel of the beer lingers awhile which is great. Overall, I'm glad I found this beer. It is great!"
"16oz, canned 11/15/16; acquired in trade with my friend, Derek "
From can.
"Can dated 10/26/16 into a tumbler glass. Pours hazy bronze with finger of medium density khaki head that had moderate retention and left windshield lacing. Nose is dominated by pine, followed by dank, and subtle citrus. Seems different than a lot of the other reviews, likely due to age. Taste is heavy citrus and pine, traditional 'West side in da house', lots of grapefruit which is fine by me . Plenty of bitterness on the finish, lingers a bit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and some astringency on the finish that left a very subtle tingling (though guess that could be from the ABV also). Even though it was as fresh as I'd like, I was quite fond of this beer. Can only imagine how great it must be fresh!"
Classic top 250 hype beer. I traded for this yet can go to any local retailer and buy shelf dipa's that are more impressive.
Great beer.
"Pours a pretty opaque orange to burnt orange with white foamy head that fades to a ring. Small amount of bubbles rising. No real lacing to mention. The aroma is of tropical fruits, citrus, pine, and a little caramel. Building bitterness, and a slight ammonia-like quality in the flavor, I usually get this from Simcoe....don't know if they use it in this brew? Sweetness mid palate with those tropical fruit and citrus notes. Some slight caramel malt throughout the sip. Above average carbonation, medium full body, and quite dry, through and through. Overall, pretty nice DIPA."
"pours a pale gold with a solid head, lighter than expected. still looks great"
Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter. Canned 10/26/16.
"10 ounce pour on draft at the brewery. 9.2%, no IBUs listed. Oatmeal DIPA Citra and Warrior hopped with Citra dry hopped. Brewed once a year. "
"In between yellow and light copper this beer pours. 1/2"" white head. Very aromatic hop presence on this one. Wowza. Simcoe and Citra? "
"Crystal clear, orange, and happy to present about a finger and a half worth of off white, foamy head that leaves behind only a small bit of lacing. I've got dankness on the nose again. Garlic, green onion, sulfur and a bit of alcohol that gives way to a more lemon zest accompanied grapefruit. I could be getting a little peppery thing as well."
"Look: orange yellow tint, lots of carbonation "
"This beer is as good as a double IPA gets. The taste and the nose are like WHAT THE HELL IS THIS GENIUS LIQUID ENTERING MY MOUTH AND NOSE?!!! The only knock on this beer is the appearance. The head is kinda like meh. It appears and then dissolves pretty quickly. Other than that I just drank two of these in a row (which is pretty rare for TWO of the same beer in a row!) . Two cans straight to my mouth! If you like East Coast Ipa's and you are stranded in the midwest begging people for beer, go straight to the oasis of Abrasive and you will be satiated! Also for those that complain about the price. I really don't understand. COME ON PEOPLE. 20 bucks for 64 ounces of beer! 5 bucks per can. I bet some of you paid five bucks for a shitty beer this week at a bar. Nope."
Canned 2/6/15; drank 3/1/15 @ the Yarchives. 
"A classic, especially on tap. Bursting with all kinds of aromas, hops, tropical fruits, malt, grapefruit, flowers, bread, and pine. The taste is also very good, but not as complex, and the body matches this by harnessing all of these flavors but keeping the beer drinkable. Very nice"
"One of my favorites from surly. Good hazy gold appearance. Aromas of tropical fruits, citrus, and herbal darkness. The taste is intense and fruit forward with some earthy hop presence. Nice mouthfeel with a lingering bitterness that has some zest too. Nice bite on the palate. Overall an awesome dipa from surly just wish it wasn't so pricey."
A 16 fl oz can canned on 3rd December 2015 and poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
Wow. This is a treat. The citrus flavors are very pronounced but not overly so. The bright orange amber color is a sight to behold. I will buy this every time I see it. This may be my favorite beer.
"For me the best of the best of Midwest DIPAs. As of 4 years until very recently I had a just as fruity, juicy and dank DIPA from a local brewery called Mikerphone. That beer was called Special sauce. Abrasive has been my favorite of the style for quite a while. Think I dropped over 100+ on the last release of it and it felt weird actually comparing some out of nowhere local brewery to it but it happened. It's like saying goodbye to an old friend who is moving. You'll still talk and all but now the landscape has changed. Maybe I can get my old friend and new friend to hangout together one day."
"Nicely done double IPA. Hazy golden color. Lots of grapefruit, not super tropical A bit more bitter and less ""juicy"" than a lot of the newer IPA's."
"On tap. Look is medium orange, slight haze. Smell is piles of Citra. Fruity and floral, a little bit sweet. Taste goes in a totally different direction, with the malt coming through smoothed by the oatmeal. Plenty of bitter, but not the same dank fruity of the Citra. The feel is a bit flat up front then the bitter kicks in at the edges. The abv is very well hidden, with only a slight warming. Overall I like it, but I just would have preferred the Citra profile throughout."
Canned 12/3/2015
"Great beer. Slightly inconsistent from having many different batches. Also, slightly brutal on the palate in a good way. Everyone is going completely citrus these days and this has citrus notes but so much more. A must try for IPA lovers! I've had them really fresh but this one is over two months old a slightly smoother. Holds up well with SLIGHT age compared to others."
16 oz can into tulip. 11/02/15 yep that's right almost 4 months old. O well
"Poured can into pint glass. Golden color with nice head. The aroma is very strong and welcoming - fruity, pine, and some malt. Flavor is very full, and very pleasant. The hops are balanced with the fruitiness, so the overall taste is full bodied and very pleasant. I would compare very favorably with any other IPA's tasted."
"Deserving of the 99 rating, one of my favorites"
Mail order from France44.com to California.
16oz can poured into a tulip glass:
"16oz can into a snifter on 2/20/16, can dated 11/10/15. Citrus dominates the nose, pours a hazy and dark golden color with roughly an inch of head that clears quickly. Citrus forward, then malty, then very bitter. Possibly due to the length of time the beer has been sitting. Overall very good, will revisit a fresher batch and adjust my rating as necessary."
"This was a really nice imperial ipa. Lots of flavorful hop aroma as soon as popping the can, and the aroma filled the room on the pour. Grapefruit, melon and some pine. The Grapefruit was the standout though and I couldn't wait to try the beer. The taste is a little bit sweet. Lots of grapefruit and citrus on the tongue, but there is quite a bit of malt there too. I enjoyed this one."
"I have to say for anyone who wants to taste one of the BEST Imperial IPAs in America, get your hands on Abrasive. For all those on the East Coast ... this is a beer that holds its own against any top rated New England IPA or DIPA. Way to represent the midwest Surly!!!"
Damn. This is one fine beer. Wonderful grapefruit nose. Grapefruit on the tongue as well. Nice hop punch but not bitter and doesn't linger much on the tongue. Smooth. Such a nice beer.
"A light, golden orange pour (from a can a few months old) with a nice white head that slowly dissipates. Smell is of hops and fruit. Mouthfeel is a little light, nicely carbonated. Flavors of hops, for sure, but not overwhelming, palate-crushing hops, and fruits, mostly citrusy. Leaves a nice, hoppy aftertaste. Overall, a really good IPA, with great flavor and balance."
"Absolutely incredible. This powerful pale ale is incredibly balanced with a sweetness (presumably from the oatmeal/malt) and ending bitter notes. I agree with the BA's top beers list of rating it above Bell's Hopslam. I purchased a four pack in chicagoland, but wish that I had got more. Go find yourself some Abrasive if you can."
One of the best DIPAs ever
Fan. Friggin. TASTIC.
"Solid, not outstanding."
"It's the bomb, your missing out. Go get some"
Poured from a 16oz. can.
Pours a bold gold color from the can. The nose has a citrus orange and grapefruit aroma with some tropical notes as well. Medium sweetness in the body that is balanced by a medium-strong bitter finish on this rocking DIPA.
"A real winner. Nice malt backbone, chewy, booze is fairly hidden."
"Pours a hazey orange-gold in color, topped with an off-white head. Very good lacing."
"This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a 3 finger bright white head. There is a half finger white cap of retention and spotty sheets of lacing. Smell is amazing. Grapefruit, tangerine and mango burst out of the glass with a nice bit of piney dankness as well. Taste is the same with some pineapple as well. There is a slight bit of sweet malt character, but is no match for the bitterness on the back end of this (and that's not a bad thing). Feel is medium and chewy with good carbonation. Overall an exceptional beer. Been waiting to try this one forever and it did not disappoint."
Amazing.
"Very very good dipa. My only negative on this beer is I think it's a bit too malty sweet for my taste.its got a creamier mouth feel compared to heady, Todd, etc that's probably due to them using oatmeal in this beer. Nice citrus and pine notes on it but I still would like less malt backbone on this one."
A murky amber pour with some lovely head that would make other IPAs jealous. 
In a pint glass from a can. 
"This beer. This very beer, is extremely violent. "
"11/24/15 can, poured hazy dark gold color with 1/2 inch head. Smell is fabulous: papaya, mango, citrus explosion, with bit of bread and malt in back. Taste is really hop dominated, same tropical fruit that comes in the nose but with more sweet notes, ends with bitter finish that gets a bit muddled as you drink. Mouth is crisp, very easy drinking for an imperial ipa. "
"16oz can: This one pours a hazy, somewhat darker golden color. There was about a 2"" head on it that lingered a little bit. There was some lacing. Good nose to it. Lots of grapefruit hops. Hints of orange and pine also. The taste is good. Mainly hop notes without being overly bitter. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple and a touch of pine. A decent malt presence in the background. A touch of sweetness trying to peek thru the hops. I need to stuff some more of these in my suitcase if I get out that way again!"
"Look: Strong bold pumpkin color, non-translucent, great healthy 1.5/2 finger head. A pretty DIPA."
"Hazy, mildly turbid, light golden yellow body, off-white velvet head with intricate blankets of lace. (Although, the next can produced a perfectly translucent body.) Orange/grapefruit nose, mint, bitter, herbal, with bready malt behind it. Bitter citrus fruit dominate the flavor (grapefruit!), slight onion, lavender syrup, with oats as a sweet nearly caramel-like backbone, harsh mint on the finish. Olfactory and gustatory senses are huge and, well, abrasive. Body is crisp, quenching, refreshing, fluid and drinkable."
L: Appears a pale yellow to gold color. Thin head with nice glass lacing.
Reminds me of Pliny the Elder. The same kind of piney and fruity flavor and aroma. There really are few IPA's that come close to Abrasive.
excellent dipa. received as part of bigger trade (extra). highly recommend trying.
"Gold to copper in color with some mild haziness. There's a sold inch of dense off white head on top. Moderate lacing. The aroma is intensely citrus hop focused. The taste is actually much more balanced than the aroma implies. It is brazenly citrus hop focused but there is some nice light biscuity malt to keep things in balance. The mouth is sticky and chewy, appropriate for the style."
Acquired via trade from CapCollector16 so a big “Thank You” goes out to him. Poured from a 16oz can into a US tumbler pint glass. 
Another amazing beer from my favorite brewery. These guys just keep making great beer after great beer. How can you go wrong with Citra hops all up in your nose?
"I usually prefer a darker look, but this dipa is simply perfect. If your a hop head, Abrasive is a must try. One of the best beers I have ever consumed. A huge bonus for us that reside in MN!"
"i knew i shouldn't have bought this one, but i did it anyway. i really dislike citra, and this tastes like one more citra ipa (or dipa in this case)."
Smell is amazing. The same goes for looks. Initial taste pretty bitter but then smooths out to a hoppy taste. There is some sweetness to it.
Its ok
This is one of the best-looking beers I've ever seen. The color is so bright and hazy it almost glows.
"Surly is kind of amusing ... the brewery is anything but surly, they're a friend to all beer lovers, and this beer is anything but ""abrasive"" ... it's actually a welcoming blast of fruity hoppy goodness. I've had IPAs and DIPAs that are pretty bitter and might qualify as ""abrasive"" but this beer is not like that. Most of the flavor I get is fruity and rich and malty, not just bitterness for the sake of bitterness. Yes, there's a bitter kick at the end, just to remind you that is a DIPA, but it's a minor part of the overall taste profile. This would be in my top 10 of ""beers I wish were distributed in the state of Washington,"" and it's one of my favorite DIPAs ever."
"Got this one muled home to MD from Chicago by some good co-workers whom are my cerveza burrows. Poured from can into a Sam Smit pint glass. Nice hazy orange with 1 finger head that continues to hold 5 minutes in. About as good looking as an IPA I've seen in a glass. Smell is all bursting with grapefruit and citrus hop greatness. Taste is powerful hopness, with a really nice mix of citrus, pine and some dankness and some of the oats is noticable. Bitter on the finish which is the only negative but its tolerable considering how good this beer tastes. Very rich feel as well. Overall, its an excellent double IPA."
A: Poured an opaque orange/yellow with limited white head. Decent lacing.
"I don't care how it pours or how it laces...this beer smells, feels and tastes outstanding. You can smell the hops a foot away from the glass. The rich feel in the mouth coat the palate and the bitterness keeps you on your toes. Citrus balances the bitterness and the oatmeal brings a uniqueness to this kicks IPA."
Murky light orange with not terribly substantial white head. Mind-blowing aroma of citra hops: grapefruit and a hint of orange. Taste is similar but there's a touch of sweetness balancing out the bitter hoppiness. Mouthfeel is slightly thin for a 2XIPA but there's also a creamy quality to it. This is a superb tasting and extremely well-balanced beer. Truly world class.
"Nothing phenomenal about this pour, it's ok, at best. Semi-clear, and it leaves moderate lacing in its wake. The smell is beautiful. The perfect mixture of citrus and grass. I could sniff this all night long and say ""wow"". It tastes even better; superb balance of nose and taste, an absolute treat. I get a bit of burnt melon on the back end, but it does nothing to detract from the pineapple on the front, and velvety texture mid-finish. This is a really nice beer."
Anyone that rates this below 4.5 needs to open another. This is among the best. Very hoppy. World class.
"Received a 4pack in a trade today, this glass is bursting with flavor, and none of those are abrasive to this palette in the least. The pour is a lighter colored shade of straw yellow with some transparency. Taste is in yo face. We'll done beer, probably the only 9.0+ abv IPA I have had in which there is no trace of alcohol in the taste at any point. Very nice brew indeed."
Amazing color. Aroma was weak to me. I was expecting a lot more. Solid feel and great finish for a DIPA. Very enjoyable.
"Deep gold color with moderate clarity. Two fingers of white head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves minimal lacing. The aroma is big with a lot of tropical fruits, melon, pine, resin, dank. The taste matches, although not quite as powerfully. The hop presence is the initial flavor, and then a balanced, malty body leaves some slight sweetness on the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium, moderate carbonation, and a balanced finish. The oatmeal adds to a very smooth body. Overall, a really well done, balanced DIPA."
Pours golden with average head. Smell of melon and tropical fruit and taste to match. Nice mouthfeel and extremely smooth for abv. Another winning beer from Surly I wish we could get more regularly in CA
"Pours a golden and clear, one finger head. Smells of sweet malts, sticky hops with citrus. Taste is crisp, nice strong bitter flavor, but not dominating your palate. Bitterness lingers with some subtle sweetness in the mix of all the hoppiness. The ABV is well hidden here, as this is a refreshing and unchallenging DIPA. Really delicious and well done."
"Look - Golden in color, clear in appearance"
"Pours a clear golden color with a large white foam head. Recedes after a few minutes, leaving a thin head on the surface and a lot of lacing on the sides."
Can dated 10/27:
Pint-sized can:
"Fresh can that was canned 3 weeks ago. Pours a beautiful golden amber on the orange side. Best thing is how clean and clear it is. Nice fluffy head to boot. Best looking DIPA I have seen. Smells of hops buried under citrus like grapefruit, oranges or tangerines and mangos. Smell is quite alluring. Taste is wild. Big citrus up front balanced by high hops for a really drinkable beer. Very smooth for something with such high abv. Finishes a little piney rather than huge piney because of all the citrus. IPAs are not my thing but even I love this beer. Just the right thickness and feel. Really good."
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 11/2/2015. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, lemon/orange peel, pine, light honey, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Good amount of dryness from bitterness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
Thanks to stealth for this one...(very fresh)
Solid IIPA with great flavor and very drinkable at 9%.
L: Pale orange
L: Hazy Orange
"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a nice looking hazy orange to brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. Once the head died down, the lacing wove around the glass in a nice speckled sort of fashion. The smell had a nice blend of sweet citrus to sweet sharp freshly cut pine and it came through in a strong aromatic way allowing a decent sweet maltiness to come out as it warmed. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and added a nice sweet maltiness coating my taste buds. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was there. The normal harshness of an AIPA was there assaulting my tongue very good. Overall, what a great beer all around. Well worthy of having again."
"12 oz poured into their snifter pint glass, fresh at the destination brewery tap room in MPLS."
"16 oz can. Pours bright golden orange with slight haze. Thin white head fades quickly. Big piney citrusy aroma. Taste follows with sharp piney hops, resiny , backed by sweet toasty malt presence. Oily slick mouthfeel. This is a terrific tasting IPA, one of my favorites."
This is a Heady Topper clone. That's all that needs to be said. Amazing beer. Put this one on your need to try list.
"Cloudy golden orange, thick persistent head and lacing. Strong hop smell and flavor. Slight citrus and bitter aftertaste. Well balanced hop bomb. Yet another great Surly offering."
Pours a beautiful golden colour much like I'd imagine a fair maidens hair in the afternoon sunlight in the days of old.
"From a tallboy canned 10/28/15, so 2 weeks ago. Color is a very slightly hazy orange honey-gold. Three-finger head is off-white, dense and creamy, and it sticks around. Decent lacing. Smell starts with a big hit of pine and grapefruit, mixed with high-quality dank and just a soupçon of the finest cat pee expertly blended with week-old gym clothes. Some tangerine notes as well. That either dissipates or my pine/grapefruit/dank/urine smell receptors are crammed full, but next come waves of ripe tropical fruit and an earthy grassiness. "
Pours a hazy golden orange color with a finger of an off-white head.
"Poured cold into a tulip glass; canned on 10/20/15, consumed on 11/5/15."
Canned three days before consuming.
"Smell is of pine resin, pineapple, mango, and malt sweetness. Taste is tropical fruit and orange citrus - very juicy and not very bitter with a smooth finish. Alcohol is well-hidden and this does not drink anything like a 9% beer. Great beer!"
"Bought this beer from Heritage liquor in Maplewood, canned on 10-2. I've never had Abrasive so I was pretty excited"
Pored from a can into a beer glass.
"Very well done IIPA! Most beers with 120 IBUs make you slightly cringe. This beer starts strong with a hoppy bitterneoss, balances itself out with the smooth oats, then packs a satisfying hop finish that pleasantly lingers. Noticeable scents and flavors of citrus and pine."
Had on tap at the 2015 release at JL Beers in Northeast MPLS. Poured into a JL Beers tulip glass:
I really don't need to say much about this beer other than it has a massive hop punch balanced by the malt on the back end. It is unreal. The pine and citrus are off the chain and literally make your mouth water. Crazy good! I just wish it was released more than 1 time a year.
Hope to get a fresher next year.
"L: A hazy fold pour supports a 1” pillowy, clingy white foam collar. S: Spicy, floral hops, light fruit, citrus. T: Grapefruit, fruit, spice, grapefruit rind bitterness. The malt is moderate, the hop flavors and bitterness moderately high. F: Silky and creamy. Moderately full body and medium carbonation. O: This is a great beer that needs to be released more often."
From drunk notes. Thanks brentlepping for the share.
"From notes. Based on almost all of the reviews, I was really looking forward to this beer. Maybe my expectations were too high or maybe I had a bad can (about 3 months old; can dated 2-06-15, drank on 4-25-15), but I was a little disappointed. Slightly hazy, bright golden color. Not much of a head which disappears quickly. Nice citrus aroma with just a little pine. Taste also big citrus and grapefruit, but quite a lot of pine bitterness as well. Bitterness was a little too much for me and not well integrated with the other flavors. The bitterness also lingered too long, limiting smoothness and drinkability. The alcohol is covered well. Not much malt sweetness or balance but good fullness of flavor."
"Thank hell this is distro'd where I live now. It's a classic, smooth, great beer. So balanced and refreshing, crisp and hoppy without being overt. Abrasive and subtle at the same time, imagine that."
"Solid IPA. Lots of fruit off the nose. This was really good, but the ABV was definitely noticeable. I enjoyed it a lot and compared to other IPAs I'd put in on the upper teir, but I think it could be a little smoother. It really packs a punch in the finish."
"Even in this age of new-world (incredible) pales, with newfangled hop varieties that mostly make me drool, Abrasive seems like the perfect IIPA. It's hard to imagine a better version of the style. "
"16oz can dated 01/13/15, tasted 05/31/15"
"Malt forward double IPA. Pine like hop character with a sweetness factor made it another solid beer. Lucky enough to try it, wouldn't go out of my way to get it again."
Solid! It has been a while since I had this.
"A: Clear/Cloudy, bright, golden orange with a thin white head which dissipates fairly rapidly."
"Lots of tropical fruit in the nose, very well balanced, excellent brew"
Hop heavy and incredibly thick double ipa. Easy to pick out the floral notes in the flavor. Surprisingly drinkable for a double ipa. High abv makes it even more enjoyable. Definitely not for the new beer drinker.
Delicious DIPA. I was fortunate enough to have this super fresh. Loads of Fruit juicy pinefulness!
"Another ridiculously overhyped beer. The aroma was pretty weak for a double IPA, strong, malty, sweet. Not my kind of an IPA."
I've been wanting to try this for quite sometime and finally with the help of Omensetter got a chance to try it!
This is one of the very few beers I keep on hand and stock up on towards the end of its availability.
Very hoppy and very delicious
L (4.25) - Good golden/amber coloration. Nice fluffy white head.
"Awesome smell, taste flavor complements the aromatic smell. Good finish not too boozy."
Loved every sip. Wish we could get this in California...
L - Pours an orange/amber body with a two finger eggshell head.
Had on tap at Happy Gnome during recent Beer safari in M/SP. More than matched the hype. Beautiful pour...orangey light rusty accents with a rich creamy head. Big citric and tangy spice nose and complex breads and fruit flavor. Citra forward. Malts from oats/grains really added a nice touch of sweet creamy offset to the rich tangerine/citrus flavors. Expected a nice rounding in the mouth feel and wasn't disappointed.
"Disappointing, didn't see the hype"
The saltiest IPA I've ever had. Delicious though!
Surly abrasive '15
"Super hoppy but not bitter DIIPA, loved it."
"Hands down. The best beer I have ever had! Only a seasonal beer, but best beer in the world!"
not an overly bitter beer. the hopiness of the beer is very citrus like... but lasts a little too long for my pleasure.
16oz can poured into a tulip glass. Canned on 01/23/2015.
Can. Murky orangish - yellow pour with a white head. Citrusy hop aromas. Tasty with citrus and topical fruit hop notes. A sturdy caramel malt backbone which keeps things in check. Above average body and mouthfeel. A solid DIPA that lives up to the hype.
This was a bit of a disappointment for me it was good dont get me wrong but it just wasnt what it could be.
"Can sent to me by Ryan, thanks so much dude."
It smells and tastes like B.O.
"This is supposedly a Double, but is NOT boozy at all. Probably the most drinkable Double IPA on the planet. Fantastic, must try beer."
"Tallboy canned on Feb. 6, 2015 and enjoyed from a nonic pint glass today, March 23, 2015"
Poured straight from a can into a 10 oz FW English Pub Glass.
"Pours a bright orange amber that is LOADED with floating sediment. Smell is a bright floral citrus, tropical fruit, apricot, grape fruit, with notes of caramel. Beautiful citrus hop forward flavor with notes of tangerine, balanced nicely with subtle sweet malt, finished with a mild grape fruit bitterness. One of the most flavorful DIPAs I've ever had. Clean and bright, yet doesn't miss a beat with such intense flavors. One of the best DIPAs I've ever had! A real treat from Surly that is a must have"
10 oz. tap pour at the Muddy Pig
One of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure drinking.
Looks: Canned on 1/23/15 and poured into a tulip glass. Not much head. The color is amber .
"I've blind tasted Abrasive with many of the other top rated IPAs and so far Abrasive has come away as the best each time. Great look, great taste, and amazing aroma definitely make it a world class beer that you must try!!"
"Reminds me a lot of 077xxx, with a little extra bitterness on the finish. Must have for any hop head. I think I like this slightly less than Todd the axe man, but this is well deserving of its rating."
"Abrasive's an impressive DIPA, and an interesting one given the beers it compares to (would immediately call up the less-regarded, but similarly excellent Golden Road Wolf Among Weeds). Great, bitter finish with an excellent hop aroma that intoxicates with every sip. Highly recommended if you can find/trade for it."
Canned 2/6. Extremely bitter. Definitely heavy on the hops a month after canning.
A great bitter IPA. Taste good and refreshing and just like a hop head likes. But that aroma. That's what puts it over the top into great territory.
"Big, beautiful notes of citrus and tropical fruit at the forefront of a beer so smooth you'd never believe it's 9.5%. A true masterpiece and my benchmark for what a double IPA should be."
A buddy of mine once said Abrasive was like a marriage of Toppling Goliath Light Speed and ZeeLander. He's very accurate. 
This is an amazing beer. Crisp but not as dry as Pliny with more citrus. Beautiful color and great aroma.
Deep golden yellow pour. Just a hair more clear than opaque. Fairly large foamy white head that disappears almost entirely into the beer. 
"Appearance: Hazy Gold, Light Orange"
Can pour from a 2/6/15 canning. This is a big DIPA! Certainly lives up to its' name. Plenty of bitterness on the palate along with those deep hoppy citrus notes. A little floral on the back end but really the overall feel I have here is the bitter hops sitting alongside a pretty robust malt profile. Splendid stuff.
Once you try this Nothing else will measure up. The best smelling and tasting beer i have ever had the pleasure of trying.
Everything about Abrasive is what beer should be. It is the perfect cold MN winter day beer.
Had from a very fresh keg. Fuller bodied than most of others of the style. A great winter DIPA.
Poured from a can into a tulip
Best smelling beer I've ever had. Super smooth and great tasting. A personal favorite. Wish it was more readily available.
"This is my all-time favorite DIPA. This one is definitely a destroyer of palates, but the flavors are phenomenal. I started on IPA's 6 or 7 years ago when the Dogfish Head Alehouse moved in next door. After all of that time, and countless 4-packs of Heady, Sip, and others, this remains my favorite. This is the perfect IIPA."
"Finally sitting down to drink the long awaited Abrasive ale. And it is delicious ! Glad I finally got to try this long time want of mine. Pretty much lives up to it's hype. Pours a gorgeous hazy gold color with minimal lacing. Aromas are primarily grapfruit, mango and tangerine. Taste is similar with a subtle oaty touch I have to close my eyes to detect and finishes with a funky onion and garlic taste at the end which brings it down ever so slightly. Awesome !"
Hop heaven! Surly does it again.
"This is a big beer with a tremendous nose of dank herbal hops, pineapples, grapefruit and tangerines. It translates to flavor but it ends with garlic and onions on my palate and I just can't rate it that high."
"Serving: 16 oz. can poured into a tulip. Canned on 2/6/15, making this 15 days old. "
This beer is epic... Right up there with Heady... Fantastic
"Cans arrived today thanks to an extremely generous BA. Thanks man! Can dated 1/13/15 poured to a tulip glass deep copper colored with nearly no head. Aroma is straight up malt, no hop presence whatsoever. Straight up caramel sugar. Flavor follows with no hop presence, straight malt syrup, almost like this has been sitting around for a few years. Wow. Thick and syrupy, lower carbonation. Really horrendous. Maybe if this were called a barleywine, I'd give it a few more points. But wow. This is Abrasive?"
"16oz can, canned 1/9/15, poured into a teku glass"
4 week old can poured into a ping glass. Much sweeter and thicker mouthfeel than I expected. Overall very good.
Perfect! Rolling warmth across my tongue. Hops Galore! I wish I could drink this every time I want an IPA.
"All i have to say for this beer is that it is an exceptional ipa, and if i could get it all the time i would, but i cant, so i'll enjoy this experience then be back to ny Molotov Lite."
"I've not tasted a double IPA that balances the extreme hop bitterness like this one. It has a lot more bite than hopslam, but it doesn't let the bitter bite dominate the rest of the beer. Citrus and stone fruit shine through gloriously in the aroma and the taste. That balance alone would make a great IPA, but there is an earthy quality as well. One reviewer described it as herbal. It works wonderfully adding flavor and complexity to an already great beer. Best IPA I have tasted yet. Edit: I've received this in trade on two different occasions since my review and both times it has been average at best. One of those cans was two months old, but the other one was relatively fresh. I'm adjusting my rating, but still want to try this one more time when I'm sure it is fresh to confirm my initial review."
Thanks man for the trade! 
"Not sure if I can add anything to the many reviews other than confirm that this is one excellent beer. So juicy, with a sweetness to balance the bitterness."
"This brew was served on tap from the upstairs walk-up bar, at the new Surly taproom in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Arriving in a pair of thick house tulips, Abrasive shined the color of a freshly polished penny. A half finger tall head the color of French lace stood tall, leaving milky ring etchings around our glasses following a medium retention. A chill haze obscured clarity, but no sediment was noted. Carbonation appeared to be mildly moderate. The nose filled with airs that were oh, so sticky sweet, with big grapefruity citric hoppiness complimented by heavy grassy and fruity nectar varietals, pale and clean caramel malty sweetness, mango and pineapple flesh and syrup juiciness, sweet cornbread, cooling vanilla bean, hot honey, warming white and caramel sugars, toffee, white chalk on sweating asphalt, green grassiness, hearty boozy sweetness, and mild shoe polish bite. The flavoring…BOOM!! We experienced massively bittering citric hop, fruitiness of pineapple, pear, and kiwi, grapefruity skin and juicy wash, underripe strawberries, lemon rind, warmer herbal hop rumbles, green weediness, aloe, foamy plastics, almond extract, bubblegum esters, dandelion, pine sap, worty caramel and pale malt toast, hints of silky fresh oats, and lipstick waxiness. Through the end and aftertaste, flashes of black pepper and old, dried cinnamon, big but welcomed boozy warmth, hoppy garlic airiness akin to Summit hop varietals, and harsh medicinal phenolic wash poked through intermittently. The body sat on the fuller side of medium, while carbonation was higher, but still only gently brushed the palate. Slurp and smack were great, with slightly less cream or froth. The latter were still present enough to contribute towards an initially wet and cooling coating. This dripped into bittering puck and decent astringent dryness. The abv was appropriate, and drinkability was frankly amazing."
Canned on 1/10/2015. Poured into a nonic pint glass. 
"Wow this beer blew me away. Had it at a bottle share with some other outstanding IPA's (2nd Fiddle, Pliny, Gandhi Bot) and this was the (surprising) clear winner. If you handed me this beer I would incorrectly guess it was another dank VT beer. Goes to show that you don't need to be in VT to brew fantastic DIPAs with that signature smell and taste I look for. Well Done!!"
"I know I'm not the only one to get a flat abrasive, 2 were great and 2 were very low carb. This review is for the flat ones, I just believe this beer shouldn't be rated this high when there is the possibility of tainted cans. The good is really good, but the bad is pretty bad. Surly really needs to take QC seriously."
Wow.
"Canned 7 days ago acquired via trade. Golden orange color with a thin head. Great citrus nose and enticing smell. Drinks good and sticky as expected, balanced piny bitterness. Good malt backbone here helps round out a very good beer. I like Cycle Crank slightly better, but this one is a winner. Would gladly enjoy more."
A lot of people stating this years batch was flat. Mine was not and it is great!
A citra hop masterpiece- fantastic
16 oz. can poured into a Burley Oak snifter
Poured from a pint canned on 1/13/15 into an IPA glass. Appreciated over 35 remarkable minutes.
Canned 01/10/15 Poured into a nonic pint glass. 
Sweet caramel malt backbone with big onion and resin presence.
"Hoppy and smooth. Great nose, too!"
"I had some cans from the batches that were missing carbonation in the 2014 vintage, but also had a later can that was much better. Carb was minimal, taste and aroma are very unique and quite good"
16 oz can poured into snifter
"My cans were part of the under-carbed bunch. 1/13/15 bottling date. Still tasted absolutely delicious! Awesome, awesome, awesome beer! As a lucky winner of the most recent Kern River Brewing ""Citra Lottery"", I look forward to doing a side by side with each of them next week. Shout out to Josh012012 for sending this my way, CHEERS!"
Wow! Fruit in your face. Smells amazing. Had great head with a sweet finish with just enough hopp bitterness. Well done! Doesn't hold up over time. Can be malty and inconsistent over different batches.
"Fresh can, nice and clean citrus. Bitter and a bit boozy."
Take a moment to smell this beer before you taste it. You won't regret it.
"From a canning 7 days ago, into an imperial pint glass"
"Nice rich orange color with pillow of white foam. Smells hops, oats, citrus fields. Taste is a rush of mouthwatering citrus and apricot as it fades a nice bitterness builds in the back of your throat. Mouthfeel also leaves the sticky, sugary coating of citrus. *edit: after several 4-packs of this I've changed my rating to a 5. This beer never gets old I nearly shed a tear every time I finish my beer. One of the best DIPAs in the world"
Note: rating is for 01/29/14 can poured into pint glass on 01/16/15
Big Hopps but very drinkable and smooth!!
Look forward to it every year
Better out of the can than on draft.
"Hands down my favorite beer! When you drink this elixir of awesomesauce, it's like soaking your taste buds in Heaven!"
"Awesome DIPA. Plenty bitter, with a nice malty backbone and tons of hops. HOPS HOPS HOPS. Love this stuff."
Better than Heady Topper.
Draft in a tulip at Northbound in Minneapolis. (12/12/13)
Not much of an IPA fan but enjoyed this one
Quite possibly my only 5. Hands down my favorite beer.
Delicious and reminiscent of a heady t
My favorite DIPA of all time. Nuff said. It still has been for years.
From notes on 4/1/14
One of my personal favorites.
"Pours golden, hazy. Color is lighter than you would expect for a beer in this style range. Excellent, complex nose, notes of citrus, pine and floral. This is quite an exceptional beer, better balanced and significantly more enjoyable than furious. One of my favorites from Surly, always brings me back to when I first had this beer years ago."
"Poured a thick, hazy orange. Very attractive, with a long lingering head and good lacing qualities. A big nose of citrus, pineapple, grapefruit. The taste mirrors the nose with big fruit and pine, and little malt notes. Just how I like them. Great carbonation and a nice drinkable feel. Very we'll done."
"Just as good, if not better than Pliny"
Drank from can a la Heady Topper
Appearance:
"I don't know how a beer could be any better than this--citrusy odor and tangy mouthfeel. I just love to have it sit on my tastebuds for a while before I swallow it. There are some issues with the way it looks recently--some flock, but who cares when a beer tastes this good. Beautiful head. Amazing beer."
"APPEARANCE: Thick, hazy, orange in color. A gorgeous white head rests on top with the first pour, but fades into a thin cap fairly quickly. The bubbles that can be seen through the opaque haziness are slow moving , but plentiful. The lacing is rather nice, covering about 60% of the backside of the glass with big, splotchy layers."
"On tap in the Surly taproom. Slightly hazy, dark orange color. Aromas of tropical citrus fruits, grapefruit, and a touch of pine. Taste was bitter, but not overwhelming and quite pleasant. Lighter citrusy hops really come through and blend well with the malt backbone."
Had on draft at churchkey in a snifter 
"Pours a nice golden color with a white head. Very sweet, fruity aromas with a lot of hops. The flavor is beautifully complex, with dry hop notes, sweet citrus, a nice light tartness and plenty more. A very well-balanced IPA, with just about everything going for it. Couldn't imagine it better."
"This beer is where it's at, this beer should never lose it's 100 rating, it's world-class, and there's no messing around when we say that."
Top three DIPA
16oz can poured into s spiegelau glass. Can may be a little old - around Christmas 2013. 
Poured into a 16-oz Pilsner glass.
"An abrasive is a substance used for polishing; Abrasive Ale, funny enough, is a very polished beer indeed. Its ripe banana peel colour has a blinding shine (despite a foggy complexion). Though its head isn't especially impressive the lacing it leaves sure is; this glass is tighter wrapped in cotton-like blanketing than a newborn. "
A: Pours a copper color with a one finger head. Good retention and nice lacing.
Big thanks for my buddy Ryan for throwing this in as an extra in a trade! Canned on 1/13/14.
"This is a great, robust, acidy IPA. Others have said it reminds them of Heady Topper - I wish I hadn't read that before tasting, because I want to believe I would have discerned it myself. Regardless, a great double IPA. "
A - A cloudy amber. Pours with a nice head that lingers for a little while.
"From the can… striking tawny-amber with great depth of color and subtle haze; billowing white foam, persistent. Beautiful subsequent lacing. Flawless. A DIPA can’t look any better really."
"16oz can poured into a pint glass. Canned on 01/13/14 2015, enjoyed on 7 March 2014, at fridge temp (41 F)."
Poured from a can (1/29/2014) into a pint glass
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 16 oz can most recently on December 9, 2017. Tasted in a 12 oz snifter from cask at Firkin on December 21, 2016. Tasted from draft numerous times, most recently at The Vine on December 9, 2017. Awe inspiring beer from can, draft or cask. Highly recommended."
Pours hazy burnt orange in color with a lot of little particles floating around and a good finger and a half off white head that has great retention.
"Can poured into a tulip. Canned 1-7, enjoyed 3-1."
"Found this in a dive in Chicago, snagged a 4 pack for $18. Not sure if I overpaid or not, but happy to be able to try it! Canned 1/14/14, so 6 weeks at the time of review. From my experience, cans hold up much better than bottles in the IPA world, so I decided to give it a go anyways. "
16 oz can (1/29/14 so exactly 1 month old) into DFH signature glass with couple cm white head beer is golden yellow with some sediment haze
"Unreal! This is the end of my 4pk and each can has gotten better and better. Huge dank aroma of very crisp-pine-clean grapefruit, dank astringency, mango, peach and a soft caramel malt backbone. Touch sweet strawberry juice as well. Taste is very dry but an explosion of grapefruit, fresh orange, and tropical fruits but not overly juice or juice-like, which is great. Incredibly clean, smooth, balanced. One of the best I've had."
Pours a deep and bright sunburst orange with plenty of tempting froth.
Pours a pale amber with a whitish head that does last and leaves spidering. Loaded with floaties but ain't no thang.
"Pine, oats, sweet malt, sweet orange, bitter, light tropical"
Poured from the can into a snifter glass. (canned 1/21/14)
A: Pours a pale light copper with sediment and strong carbonation. Nice head that lingers nice and foamy. 
I rated this a 5 last year. Then I got some this year. Blown away again.
A - Gold & slightly cloudy. 1.5 - 2 inch clean white foam when poured aggressively

"This is phenomenal. Tastes of fresh hops not dissimilar to Heady Topper, but the overall product is even better, in my opinion. "
"From: France44, Minneapolis, MN"
This beer is consistently fantastic. The pour is a hazy honey orange with an off white head that fades to subtle lacing and carbonation throughout. Wow the smell bright orange grapefruit citrus with a dank balance and a slight peachy yeast aroma. The taste hits all the aromas perfectly balanced not overly sweet bitter or citrus but does lean toward the citrus side. The taste is near perfect but I do think Pliny and ht are slightly deeper and fuller. The mouthfeel is crisp and full and you want to keep going back to the well for another. Overall a top IPA
Canned 1/7/14
"I love this beer, it is my #1 beer right now. If you have a chance to try it and you like IPAs you have to pick it up. I have had it side by side with Bell's Hop slam (which is also a great beer) and would take Abrasive over it every time. It just sucks it is only available for a few months a year."
"Served on-tap at the Asheville Winter Warmer Beer Festival in Asheville, NC"
A: Hazy yellow orange. Little to no head. Minimal lacing.
16 oz. can poured into a snifter.
"Golden and very hazy, didn't form much of a head following the pour. Retention is not there but the lacing it leaves is incredible."
Canned 12/10/13 so a little past its prime. Poured into a tulip...
"About as close to perfect a DIPA has humanly possible. Super fresh tasting, resiny hop flavors. I buy this one whenever it's available, wallet permitting. The standard against which all DIPAs should be judged - unfortunate that it's not a year-round beer."
Pours a perfect hop bomb orange. Nice white head that settled quickly but it did leave some nice lacing. Smell was awesome. Nice and fruity with a kick of pine. Taste was that of a top notch DIPA. The citrus followed by the pine notes where amazing. Mouthfeel left you waiting for the next sip. Overall a great beer. Abrasive is a fantastic DIPA.
"This is not like Surly's Furious IPA whatsoever. The aroma is heaven, with mangoes and peaches abound. Big citrus notes and slight pine on the taste with a medium carbonation and a nice lingering bitter finish. One of the best DIPA on this side of life. Enjoy it."
"I don't quite get the comparisons I'm reading to Surly Furious. This is a very different beer, and even more hoppy. It's right up there with the Stone Enjoy By Series as one of my favorite IIPAs. Fantastic taste. I would highly recommend this beer."
"A-Pours a murky, milky illuminated orange. Looks a lot like most of my favorite hop bombs. The body seems to be a bit oily and...resiny. The head is a thin congregation of white froth. Sticky lace."
Surly Abrasive Ale (canned 12/10/13)
"Appearance: Poured from a can into a tulip. Pours a rich, slightly cloudy gold with a two finger head of light foam."
16oz can poured into an oversized tulip. Canned on 12/10/13
"A- Pours on the lighter side of golden, with somewhat of a yellow hue to it. Pretty sizable head forms and retains like a champ with excellent lacing. Body of the beer is just a touch hazy, but mostly clear."
"The aroma here is all hops, all the time. I don't get any notes of malt at all. Pine, citrus, resiny....sharply hoppy on the nose. I don't think there's any question this beer is going to be a bitter one."
"Appearance - A cloudy orange-gold. A stiff pour into a darkness snifter yielded a 3 finger head and a thin head stuck around throughout the glass. Also, very nice lacing throughout"
"Poured from a can packed on 10/30 into a Dogfish Head IPA glass. The pour is a hazy, dingy, medium-orange honey-gold with a rocky coarse white head. Nice level of carbonation and even a few floaties. The nose is dank and hoppy, with grapefruit, pine trees, and floral notes. Not really what I would call a ``citrus bomb'', but definitely a good sniffer."

"Thanks amerak! One of my all time wants, at last. Poured out of a 16oz can into a tulip glass. Canning date is listed at the bottom as ""11/05/13."""
My 100th review so I wanted to review a world class brew from my home state
on-tap brouwers
Thanks to BeersandBears for sharing!
"Pours out a slightly dark orange with a two finger white head that dissipates fairly slowly with some nice lacing. Smell is definitely nice and fruity -- grapefruit, orange, and a little pineapple is what I am getting from the nose. Smells really nice. Taste some nice malts in the background. Definitely a hop forward beer with tastes much like the nose. I'm surprised when I'm thinking critically about the beer that I am getting the malts in the background. Definitely a hop forward beer but there is a really nice balance with the malts I really never noticed before for this IIPA. I don't want to overstate the malts. really not balanced but there are some in the background that are definitely noticeable. Mouthfeel is thicker than most IIPAs but this really makes it a treat. Overall this is a great beer that I always look forward to and was really happy it came early this year."
Canned 11/15/13
"Raul has to be honest; this sucker has that hop that reminds Raul (as he has stated many times before) of rocket fuel. You know, that ""Dale Earnhardt"" hop. Well, although Raul isn't a fan of that exact flavor, Abrasive at least is not hot whatsoever. No, no, no, this one will not be sponsored by NASA."
Finally bit the bullet and picked up a four pack of Abrasive Ale.
poured 16oz can into snifter. Canned on 10/30/13
This a great IPA. I really think surly puts out great beers. I would drink this IPA right away. It losses the hops quick. There is a great nose on this beer. It is 16 ounces of awesome. Great flavor. Good mouthfeel for an IPA. Not as much citrus as some of the other IPAs out there but it is outstanding.
16 ounce can into tulip. Thank you lurpy1.
"Poured from the can into a glass, and it produced a finger, and a half of off white head. The beer color is a hazy, medium honey color."
"Slightly amber golden body with big foamy white head when poured into a glass. The nose jumps out with bold tropical fruits. Pineapple specifically. Some mango. The front end is very fruity while the back end is a dank, bitter finish. Very full flavored DIPA. Much better poured into the glass than from the can. A world class DIPA that has something for everyone from fruitiness to bitterness."
Poured from can into tulip. Canned on 10/30/13
Canned on 10/30 and consumed RIGHT MEOW! (11/14)
"Thanks to doner24 for the trade. Pours a deep golden color with a thick, quickly dissipating white head. Very nice lacing. The aroma on this beer is outstanding - tropical fruit, citrus, cantaloupe, resinous pine, lemon, with a hint of breadiness. Bitterness throughout with faint caramel notes mid palate that finishes very dry with a touch of honeyed sweetness on the tongue. Mouthfeel is oily, with a medium-light body and decent carbonation. Overall, a very well crafted DIPA that sits among the pantheon of the finest DIPAs."
About to review my first ever Abrasive. Just finished a König Pilsener which I decided not to review as I am not a fan of the style. Gotta find some crackers or something…
"Had this on cask at 3Floyds in early/mid 2013. Fantastic DIPA anyway, cask puts it over the edge. Bubbly/soapy two finger white head, beer was hazy dark straw color. Great nose of hops but also mellowed as all cask beers are. Phenomenal flavor, still hoppy and balanced by malt, but smoothed over by the cask. Mouth feel was very similar to taste. A rare treat."
16 Grit
"Unforunately because this rotates, this is 6 months old, bottom of can says 1/8/13."
473ml can served in a pint glass.
"Definitely my favorite beer. Similar taste to Hopslam minus the rich honey/citrus. This one kicks you in the mouth with the amount of Hops. Slightly bitter when you first taste it but a very smooth finish. Recommend trying this one in-season, as it seems to go stale fairly quickly."
16 oz can pored into a La Fin Du Monde Tulip
"I have definitely been on a DIPA kick lately, and was very excited to try this one."
"Received as an extra from jeremy6566, and poured from the can into my Deschutes tulip..."
One pint can poured into my Duvel glass. A rich golden honey body has a consistent haze to it. I get only about one inch of head that fades in just a couple of minutes. Head is a soft beige in color. Only edges of lace are left behind. Nose is full of orange rind and marmalade. Softly fragrant but very nice. With first sip I am really taken by how dry this beer is. Based on the nose I was really expecting something a little more citrus based and maybe a bit sweater. Not that I am complaining but the nose threw me off. The hop profile is nicely bitter and extremely dry. There is a twinge of lemon zest on the on the back end of the palate. This beer is not heavy at all and would go wonderfully with some stinky blue cheese. Dryness lingers on the mouthfeel but is just wonderful. A very nice break from all the more sweet IPAs out there lately.
Surly Brewing Company - Abrasive Ale
"Beer pours light golden with 1.5 fingers of foamy head which is dying pretty quick. Not outstanding retention, but pretty good. The lacing is also relatively sticky."
Surly abrasive
Muchas Gracias to Yamar68 for this wonderful beer!
"Abrasive Ale pours a hazy and cloudy copper color, with a large white lacing head. There is a strong floral aroma, with hints of citrus. The taste is sublime, strong floral hops, hints of citrus. Such a full and complete flavor, yet sooo drinkable. Overall all I can say is WOW."
Pours a nice golden/straw color with a big fluffy white head. Healthy carbonation. Looks inviting enough.
"Canned 02-28-13, sampled 04-12-13."
"16oz tallboy canned 3/4/2013, poured into a Bell's tulip glass and quaffed today 4/8/13 after my beloved Wolverines lost in the national title game."
"finally, an abrasive in my glass! been reading about this one forever, so nice to finally get the chance to indulge. and an indulgence this is! pours a sleek reddish orange color with some haze and a couple inches of impenetrable white head. the nose is way way more fruity than I anticipated, super juice fresh squeezed hop complexion, with some pine and definitely an acidic citrus element, but I get a lot more berry and even passionfruit in this. some lighter American 2 row and caramel malts round it out. the flavor is more tropical than deciduous in the fruit department, but still pungently fruity. bitterness doesn't even come in until the finish, which makes this a really unique double ipa. the alcohol is almost entirely invisible until the beer warms up, and even then isn't punishing by any stretch. the mouthfeel is the weakest link, not bad, but a little more malt body might balance this out little better. I feel like it needs a bigger platform to stand out. carbonation is right on though, and it makes the grapefruit and other citrus hops characters come out a little more. id love to know what hops are used in this, its really different. Maybe not the most perfect example of the style out there, but you don't get to be a 100 on BA in this category by accident. Worthy of my anticipation, this is a stellar beer. I can still name a handful of others id draft higher, but this is awesome!"
Poured from a 16oz tallboy can into an oversized wineglass. Canned on date of 030413 on bottom of can. SIngle pruchased by my brother Greg from a Minneapolis area bottle shop for $4.

"This is a very tasty west coast type IPA, I found it a very tasty beer. I enjoyed using the can for beer can chicken and unless I can find this beer on tap I will only use it when making a very hoppy beer can chicken and drink the left over of the 4 pack."
"From a trade with StPaulSuds, thanks for the fresh 4pack brotha. Canned exactly 1 month ago, poured into an oversized Mikasa Tulip glass."
My last can from my trading partner and I'm sad to see it go. Canned 1/17/13. Poured into Duvel tulip.

"Poured out 3oz for the review, but it's cooler from the can."
"Wouldn't have sought this out, but was lucky enough to try at a bottle share. Wow! So fresh and lively. Citrusy pine and a bit of tropical fruit, but overall just very clean flavors. I think the packaging is terrible, but the beer is excellent. Like a whole can of liquid hops. Yum!"
16oz can from Powderhornphil (just because he was an awesome line-mate at Hunahpu's Day!). Canned 2/8/13. Served in a Cigar City snifter. 
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip. Canned 1/17/13. Acquired in a trade from stafford2, thanks man!!"
"Poured from the can into a pint glass, the beer was a light copper color with a slight white head. It left acceptable lacing and retention in the glass. A big floral citrus aroma jumped from the glass, awakening the sense of smell. In the front, notes of peach, pineapple, apple came from the hops. A pleasant maltiness laid in the background as to not allow the hops to be overwhelming. The hops notes seem to unify in the end to a megahop that resembles grapefruit at its base in the aftertaste. Pleasantly warming notes are allowed to linger with thick texture helping the sensation to cling to the back of the throat. This is an excellent example of the style that I could drink any time."
"This beer is amazing! poured a perfect head, smells great and the taste is flat out amazing! this is a World Class brew that lives up to the hype. I would buy this anytime it's available. Seek this out as it's one of the best IPA's I have even had."
16 oz can poured into a FW snifter. Canned on 11/14/12. Thanks to durb777 for makin it possible
16 oz can poured into a Surly Darkness chalice 
"Pours a beautiful orangy color, with a relatively thin head. It's not super clear, but I wouldn't call it cloudy either."
"Thanks again to Mike for letting me split his last one with him. My first Surly IPA. Pours a copper-orange color exhibiting exceptional clarity all the way through. A big, white, foamy head piles up and stays perched atop the ale, leaving remnants of chunky lace all around the glass. Overall, very inviting and clean, especially for a DIPA. And of course, great head. Nothing worse than an IPA with no head."

Presentation: 16 oz. tallboy can chilled and poured into a pint glass. Canned on date of 12/20/2012.
Wow! I gotta say that I am blown away by this can of beer! I am now a believer in the power of the can...or the Surly brew master...probably both
"From notes, 7/29/11. Wonderful aroma of pine, tropical fruit, tangerines and grapefruit hoppiness on a background of caramel malt. Pours a coppery color with a good off white head. Taste is nice and bitter but still quite drinkable. Very resinous flavor. Too dry to be called a hop syrup but it’s a hop party. Mouthfeel is round without getting cloying. Hop oiliness abounds. Great beer. Edit: I had previously tried a growler of 16 Grit, but this review is from the can."
"Can thanks to yamar68, poured into a Hill Farmstead stem."
"Bought from Blue Max Liquors in Burnsville, MN ($15.95 4 pack 16 oz cans)."

16oz can - dated 1/8/13
"16oz canned January 8, 2013, less than 2 weeks old...very nice! Served at around 45F."
"Finally got some of this through the mail. Eagerly anticipated trying this, and it didn't disappoint. It lived up to the hype. This beer is...abrasive. Quite possibly the most appropriately named beer ever. It's like brushing your teeth with hops. Pine, citrus, resiny goodness. As an unrepentent hophead, this is the first beer that made me think ""Maybe that's enough hops."" Killer beer. Great job Surly."
Canned 1/8/13...arrived at my doorstep in CO on 1/16. How's that for fresh where no one can get it?
Canned 1/8/13.

"Is it okay to just write ""nectar of the gods"" and give all 5s? Probably frowned upon here. Seriously though, this beer is amazing."
"I pretty much stopped reviewing new beers, but i thought this one was special. Appearance is a guess, I drink this one like I drink HT out of the can. The nose is a grapefruit smashed into the can, really a wonderful smell, and if i get this up front I generally l know I'll love the beer. The taste really follows the nose, lots of citrus, and a ton on hops right up front. Not quite as balanced as HT, and a little more bitter, this one is very close in taste profile, but I think Abrasive has more citrus hits. This is a great brew from start to finish, and it's a little sad when you hit your last sip out of your last can. If this was available all the time it would always be in my fridge as would HT, sitting side by side where they would belong. 15 bucks a 4 pk isn't exactly cheap either, but as always france 44 gives you fresh stuff."
Twelve day old 16 oz can poured into a pint glass.
"Tall can courtesy of younger35, thanks again!"
"a wonderful clean copper/yellow with a solid 2 fingers of detergent like head. excellent amount of lacing. the smell is insane! spicy (almost like a sweet curry spice), garlic-y, grapefruity.. hops all the way on this.. very earthy scents.. grassy, and delicious smelling. the tase, much like the smell is perfectly hopalicious. very earthy bitterness and spicyness, herbal hop quality, yet still get a good amount of sweetness from the malt. no alcohol warmth or taste is present, which is ridiculous for a 9% beer. medium body, nicely carbonated, creamy and sticky on the lips."
"I dont like giving beers a bad review, but this definatley needs to be brought down a few notches... not a horrible beer by any means, but when you factor in the price (which unfortunatly is not part of the rate system) this beer is a RIP-OFF!!! there are many other double ipas you can find out there that are just as good if not BETTER for a LOT less $$$!! some examples- these being much better tasting in my humble opinion than abrasive and MUCH cheaper - my top 5 favorite double ipas all taste much better than this:"

"Canned 12/03/15 consumed 1/14/16. Very slight haze in otherwise light straw color. Head retains for a while. Smells great, citrusy. Taste is everything I want in an IPA: pineapple, lemon with a little malt breadiness. Clings to the tongue with heavy, resiny mouthfeel. Will seek this out."
Huge thanks to MrKennedy for the Minnesota coup which snaffled this long time want of mine. Canned 20 November.
A - Nice slightly murky light honey with a near white head. Not much lace.
"Poured into a darkness snifter. Nice white creamy head and a beautiful golden hue on the liguid. Smell is mild grapefruit. Taste is a load of citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, orange and some slight lemon zest. What really balances this is a mild sweetnes (honey maybe) that really ties everything together. The finish is very clean and you can't wait for the next sip. The alchol is very well hiden and there is a nice effervesence to the mouth feel. Fantastic beer!"
"Pours a crystal clear pure golden color with an antique white head. The head is quite stubborn, contributing to the aesthetics of the beer. It has primarily a grapefruit nose with some pine breaking through. The bouquet is vibrant and it doesn't fade as the head dissipates. It has a big, thick, full mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation to accentuate the entire experience. The usual pine and grapefruit flavors, but with an extraordinary balance. I've begun to notice that with these IPAs, the key component is balance. Nose, mouthfeel, flavor, finish--this one has it. It all works well together like a well-oiled machine."
10 day old can poured into a large snifter.
Appearance: Translucent golden/straw hue with a soapy two finger off-white head. Good lacing.
Pint can poured into Duvel Tulip. Beautiful honey golden color with good amount of white head.
"Fresh abrasive from John, brewed less than 2 weeks earlier. Wafts hops several feet. Light yellow with a big head. Big IBU. Good drinkability. Orange, tangerine, fantastic IPA, great hops. Slightly acidic, do not try to convert someone drinking Bud all night. Crazy great blend of hops."
"Poured from a 16 oz. can freshness dated 11/14/12 into a Surly Brewing Co. branded Darkness snifter. Thanks to Oboogie for a fresh four pack, an exceptional extra. "
"I just finished enjoying a 2012 Abrasive from a can that was brewed nine days ago. I poured the contents into a pint glass straight out of the fridge at around forty degrees. The beer was pale orange in appearance with average carbonation and a slight slight haze, but still transparent with a single finger of head. Straight off the pour I could smell the hop aroma before I even put the glass up to my nose, very citrus forward with a malt presence. The first sip was straight grapefruit followed by the entire spectrum of citrus flavors, strong malt presence quickly balanced out the strong hop rush that blew my socks off. The sides of my tongue were left with a lingering bitterness, not unpleasant just enough to let you know the hops were still there. The alcohol was hidden deep in this beer and even after it warmed up I could not taste any heat through the hops. The mouth feel was just what I look for in an IPA, it has some body but not too much so that it was not refreshing. Even though this beer comes in at 9% ABV I had no second thoughts about going to the fridge and pouring a second after I slugged down the first. Overall Abrasive is an amazing beer and definitely lives up to the hype, I can't believe I only bought one four pack. I tend to be promiscuous with my beers, but if I ever had to settle down I probably could with this beer."
"This is my favorite beer. I have had some friends who said the don't care for it but it is my favorite so I totally disagree with the bad reviews. If you like a super IPA, you will like this beer beer. My wife and several close friends who dig beer don't care for this beer so it's obviously not for everyone, but I LOVE THIS BEER! It taste great and has a great alcohol content."
"A wonderful, strong as hell IPA. Smell is otherworldly. Tropical, piney and dank. Tastes good as well. Hawaiian Punch beerified. A tad sweet, it's a big beer, but I like my DIPAs dry. A bit to full in the mouth as well. Bitter sweet finish. Extremely enjoyable beer."
It's been nearly a year since I last consumed this beer. It's long been one of my favorites and very excited to crack open a fresh can. Canned 11-14-12.
"Canned on 11/14 and consumed 2 days later, poured into a Snifter."

My Favorite surly they offer. this brew is hoppy and Heavy. Comes in packs of 4 big cans at a reasonable price for how good it is. Great can design. really wish this one was available year round. Looking forward to see the new brewpub surly will be building next year in Minneapolis.
"16oz can courtesy of beeranddogs. Pours a clear orange with a towering, creme head. Huge lace and infinite retention. Nose is not fresh hoppy but not stale hoppy, strawberry pancake syrup either. There is some candy corn, maple syrup, Taste is spicy, sweet, fruit punch, floral and herbal hoppy, loaded with honey, mint, butterscotch. Body is chewy, bitter, thick. Definitely not a hop bomb. Never devolves into an astringent, cloying mess. Even not ultra fresh, it has held itself together fairly nicely. 11/9/2010 6/5/7/4/14=3.6"
"I enjoyed this bitter beer more than I thought I would. I'm not falling for the Surly Cult, but this was a good beer. It was very crisp and went well with a contrastingly rich mac and cheese meal. A strong taste of pine/grapefruit. Light in color and smooth, I think this is a good summer session beer, in my opinion."

Canned 1.23.12. Sampled 3.14.
"A very big thanks to Billakowski for sending me this one. Opened this one up and poured it out to see it's beautiful clear golden color. The head was big and foamy with a nice white color. The smell of this beer was very nice, I loved the hoppy aroma of this beer. The taste was awesome too, there was a big bitterness in there and then deep in the aftertaste I was picking up a honey like flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and gently carbonated. Overall I thought this beer was awesome. I look forward to having more from Surly one day."
sampled on-tap at Churchkey in DC. review from notes.
"An apt name if there ever was one. 3 week old can. Clear orange gold with a nice cap of white foam, good retention and lots of lace. Big time hops punch you in the face from a foot away, lots of pine and floral notes. Tastes even bigger. Not much fruity citrus or sweetness here, just a brutal bitter hop flavor, plenty of onion and garlic to go along with the resinousness, pine and grass. Maybe a bit of grapefruit rind. No maltiness whatsoever. Big brash and unapologetic. Mouthfeel is excellent, big and smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation. Bitter finish lingers and lingers."
"Canned 2-13-12. Pours a clear, light amber color with a large, off-white head. Scent is quite hoppy with a nice malt backbone as well. Earthy hop aromas with some caramel malt a bit of grass. Some grapefruit and melon. Taste is initially quite citrusy. A blast of orange, lemon zest, grapefruit at first. Nice grass and pine resin...pretty dank flavors here. Kinda reminds me of Maharaja. Finishes bitter with a lot of caramel malt. A bit of alcohol burn in the finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and somewhat creamy. Crisp bitter finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, I'm really glad I got to try this. It's a great double IPA!"
Can date: 1/9/12 - Served in an Ommegang Chalice - Thanks Buckeyeone!

"Canned 1/23, consumed 2/24"
"16 oz can into a shaped pint glass. Canned on 1/23/2012, reviewed on 2/23/2012 making it exactly one month old. Huge thanks to ottodyer for throwing this in as an extra!"
"Got this as a great extra, thanks to jrod1969!"
"This DIPA from Surly pours a nice honey color, a bit hazy, but still rather transparant. A big white billowy 3 finger head sits atop the beer, which has a mild retention but impeccable lacing. The aroma bursts out of the glass, big rich citrus notes race forth even as it fills the glass. Tons of citrus, earthy pine and a nice big malt bill anchor the aroma which also has minor notes of lemongrass, juniper and even some mint. The flavors are really superb, it’s a bit malt forward, a variety of cereal malts and lighter biscuit lead the way, but a nice wave of citrus takes charge in the middle and leads to some sappy and sweater pine flavors that finishes with sharper resinous finish. The body is nice and full, smooth and easy going that finishes dry and bitter."
A: I was so excited to drink this beer that it never made it to a glass...
Poured from a can into a Victory goblet
16oz can poured into a snifter
"Abrasive has a slightly hazy orange body with a lot of active carbonation bubbles. The off-white head is about a finger and a half tall, and while the retention isn't stellar, the lacing looks pretty good."
"I nice amber/orange color with a nice two-finger width fluffy head that leaves a nice ring of lacing. If has a huge grapefruit nose followed by a little pine, and finally a hint of some sweetness. After my first sip I feel that I noticed more bitterness in the nose than I am actually drinking. The grapefruit bitterness is there but leaves quickly and doesn't linger on my tongue it is followed up by a malty sweetness. There is also some fruit flavor like orange/tangerine or some other sweet fruit, last there is a good piny flavor to it as well. It has a medium/thin mouthfeel but when compared to others in the style I find it a little too thin for me, the carbonation is on point. Overall this is a good beer if this was local I would drink it, but IMO there are others in this style that are better."
A- Pours a frothy head over a orange/amber color. Good retention. Lacing is rings the glass. 
Poured from a 16oz can into a Duvel Tulip. Canned just over three weeks ago.

"can on trade from samtallica. Nice and fresh, canned on 1.12.12"
Poured from a can dated 1/23/12 into a pint glass.
"16 ounce, canned on 1/12/12. Orange in color, appears to glow. Aroma includes pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit and cannabis (yes, some weed). Taste is biting and bitter and yet so drinkable. The bitterness actually made my mouth salivate in some very weird way, kinda near the front of my mouth, that's never really happened before. Kinda hard to explain. Bottom line, so much great flavor crammed into the can, just an awesome double."
Canned 1/12/12
"Found a single just before leaving Duluth, and unfortunately it was the last one, as I would've loved a couple more fore trades."

Appearance: Amber with orange hue. Perfect 1/2 inch head with carbonation streaming from the bottom. 
"Reviewing the last of my Surly's that I picked up just before Christmas. This one is dated 12/14/11, meaning it is about a month 1/2 old. However, I've had two four packs over the past month, so I've been tracking how it holds up. Honestly, it is not that much worse now than it was when I had one less than a work old."
Tried this one courtesy of a fellow BA HoptimusPrimeIPA at Brewer's pizza.

"A pint, canned on Dec 29th, and poured into a DFH Signature Glass."
"Brought some home from a recent trip to MSP. There are only a handful of beers that I can say put me in the happy place like Abrasive and Furious is one of them (Zoe, Lunch and Two Hearted Ale come to mind). If you can find this get some.. Rumor is the brewery is moving which I assume will be to a larger facility which will increase their output which will me more beers more locations.."
Poured from a can into a pilsner.
Can (2011)
I got this beer from Penguin3200. Thanks Bill!
"Pours a deep amber color with a meek off-white head. Retention is as expected for a 9% ABV beer, it settles to a splotchy film. Smell is of some sort of citrus, like an apricot or nectarine. Taste starts with smooth caramel malt and some more of that apircot taste. I get some resinous hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly on the heavy side, with enough carbonation to give a playful feel. Overall, a great beer, but not in my top 5 for DIPAs."
Poured from can into a tulip. Pours a great dark orange color with a nice and foamy head
"Tasting from a can on 1/14/12. Canned 12/14/11, poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass."
Poured all 16oz into my Founders tulip.
"I've been hoping for an opportunity to try some beers from Surly for some time, and this one hit it out of the park for me. Golden peach color with a tight white head. Faintly sweet and floral in the nose. Perfectly balanced big hops punch up front, with a honey sweetness playing off the hops bittering. No alcohol notes, other than a little pepper at the finish. Wonderfully smooth for a DIPA. I would put this head-to-head with Hopslam."
Thanks to brydeen. Canned on 12/14/2011. 16oz can poured into a tulip glass.
"From notes, sampled 1/6/12."
Woah; cracking the can instantly releases an obscene amount of hop aroma...oh yeah!

huge thanks to my buddy tom for this bad boy!
Opened this can after a long day at the office! Haven't had this in 2 years and decided it was time to enjoy again.
Reviewing the Abrasive Ale from Surly Brewing Company. Thank you BeerAdvocate user Mid for sending me this one!
"Orange-brown in color, reasonably firm head of tightly packed tan foam. Extensive lacing. Aroma is strong and has a good fruit content. Some pepper notes from Warrior, but fruity Amarillo is prominent. Hops are strong, malts subdued. "
"A - Bright bronze body. Fine bubbled, off-white foam with great lace and nice lace."
"Poured the can into a pint glass. The color was a dark golden amber that looks a whole lot like furious. There was more head retention that lingered on the sides of the glass as I drank it. The smell was pheonemenal. Not only could I smell the ubiquitous hops, but the signature furious malt bill is evident, too. The taste is much more hop forward than furious, but does maintain some balance. This beer rivals sculpin and pliny, but yet is an unquestioned original. The mouthfeel is good. Similar to furious, again, in that it isn't highly carbonated. But that works. First time I've tried this beer, had two cans and will put this up there with the best double IPAs you can find anywhere."
"16 fl oz can served in a pilsner glass, reviewed live:"
"This beer is a nice super drinkable pounder can double IPA, and I've never had one in this format. I love the can art made by ball corporation, many local friends work for them in Weirton, WV. Pours a pale amber copper hue with a light colore billowing off white head, fine even lacing traces the sides of my nonic pint glass. Aroma is full of vegetal, onion/garlic spiciness. I can only guess that there's Summit hops in here with the taste I'm getting. The flavor is nice, this beer was canned on 12/14/11 we're talking super fresh. No abv or IBU info on the can, I find that hard to believe. They so proudly offered up 6.2% abv ad 99 IBUs on the Furious can, why not the abrasive ale. Alcohol is evident especially as it warms, it doesn't ruin the experience it is just there. Overall a very special DIPA in the can, my first experience with this style in that format. Surly is brave, and somewhat abrasive, but I enjoyed this beer carbonation is sturdy and body is full with resinous oils in the mix."
Appearance - Dark copper red
Can to teardrop wine glass. Keeping it classy even if it's an abrasive IPA. Big props to Kurtis for the can. Canned on 12/8/11.

A: A copper colored look with a moderate amount of white head.
Poured from a 16 oz can. Canned on 12/01/11. Fresh! Fresh! Into a Bell's tulip glass
"About an inch of cloud-white foam. Looks a deep copperish-ruby red. Smells absolutely amazing. Deep, deep citrus with tropical notes everywhere. Lots of grapefruit and an underpinning of malt and grain. Tastes fantastic. I remember past Abrasives being more, well, abrasive. This drinks like juice. Fairly light to start and then it slowly coats the palate in an equally-sweet / equally bitter wash, with lots of citrus, but an equal amount of malt. Neither flavor dominates, but rather collaborate to great effect. Normally, this wouldn't be notable, though the flavor is huge. You feel the tide could tip in either direction, but the flavor holds firm and ends in a slightly resinous fade. This is a strong, citrusy DIPA that should not be missed."
473ml can. Caned on 12/01/11.
A great DIPA...obtained in a trade with Woodchopper. Poured into a pint glass from a 16 oz can. Good looking beer. Hazy orange/light copper color. Big off white head that fades to a covering of the glass. Extensive light lacing on the glass.
You had this beer. 
Canned 11/23/2015. Consumed 02/14/2016.
"From an old review Another great IPA from surly. From a 16 oz can pours a murky amber with a clean white head. Smell is of flowers, hops and citrus. Taste is that amazing bitter hop taste that smooths out with with the sweet after taste of hops and some honey taste."
Big Thanks to arvjunk for this
The Abrasive Ale is my favorite overall Surly brewed beer. Too bad it's seasonal.
16oz can poured into a tulip.
A review off of several cans kept in fridge since purchase. Earliest ones were drank as fresh as possible.
16oz can poured into a Victory Golden Monkey snifter. Canned on 3/21/11.
"Rich aroma is quite hoppy with an overtone of citrus, about equal parts grapefruit and orange, and just a little bit sweet. It pours an attractive orange-amber with a very thick off-white head. Strongly hoppy flavor has an evergreen overtone, a fair amount of bitterness, and more than a hint of citrus with just a touch of fruity sweetness. Lively texture is fairly fizzy and leaves an edgy evergreen finish. How can anybody be abrasive after this one? Look for it, trade for it!"
"EDITED on Jan. 15, 2016 with 0.25 increments from 4.72 to 4.62. "
Poured from 16oz can acquired in trade

Poured a hazy copper color with an average frothy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate to heavy complex earthy hop aroma. Medium to full body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish that was long lasting. This is a standout can beer.

A Hugenormous thanks to Torgo for this generous extra.
Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for this can
A: Copper body with a finger of foam. Great retention and lacing.

Poured from a can into a Chimay goblet.
This beer pours a nice yellow orange color with a 1-2 finger off white head. the smell is very floral with citrus and earthy notes. the taste is pretty smooth and crisp with a little less bitterness than I expected. the mouthfeel was medium bodied with good carbonation. overall the beer is very drinkable and the abv is hidden well.
"Beer for a glass, from a can. Poured about half into my Deschutes snifter. This one's got a 3/21/11 date. Thank you very much MooreHopps! Fitting since this is my first DIPA review."

Super excited to try not only my first Surly offering but the Abrasive at that. Thanks for the hook to pepinguy.
"Poured into my ccb pint glass. Golden with a red tint and a two finger head. Aroma is wow, citrus light pine and creamy malts. Simply amazing. The taste completely follows the nose just intensified. Really complex and smooth. Very drinkable, very refreshing. The best dipa I've ever had!"
"Poured from a can, this beer has a pale copper appearance with light haze throughout. The head barely reaches one-finger thickness before settling into a frothy film. The smell is an amazing blast of fresh pine hops, with little to no maltiness. Somewhat citrusy, this reminds me of the smell of Pliny The Elder more than any other DIPA I can think of. "
A - Pours a clear orange copper color with a bing finger of forthy white head. The head fades down slowly to a think ring and layer leaving behind some nice lacing in the process.
Huge thanks to urbancaver for hooking me with this beer!!!

Abrasive is absolutely correct. And I mean that in a surly way.

"Thanks to Spdkilz for this one. Another I've been dying to try. Poured from a pint can into my N'ice Chouffe goblet. Nice golden, amber, mosquito catching color. About a finger of white head with pretty great lacing. Smells of citrus up front, a hint of onion BO funk (in a good way), some sweet malt. Nice bright, sweet citrus on the palate. Sticky funky mango. Very bitter dry finish. This tastes amazing. Mouth is very dried out. Sticky. Little creamy bubbles attacking my tongue. Epic."
"16oz can with canned on date 2/28/11 poured into Maudite stemmed glass, reviewed on 4/8/11"

Pours a hazy sunset orange with a 1.5 finger head that hangs around a little bit.
A big thanks to ncmussell for this beer I have been wanting to try for quite some time. Cheers!
"Can. I remember having 16 Grit from a growler before but unfortunately I didn't rate it so this will have to do. Canned on 3/09/11 and sampled on 4/6/11. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a darker, slightly haze, honey apricot color with a nice, full, sticky light tan head that coats the glass with lace as it settles. Pungent, musky aroma of hops in the nose of the citrus variety; with mainly orange and grapefruit undertones. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. At first sip I was wondering where the hop bitterness was but then BAM! it hits you towards the middle/end like a freight train. Well balanced though with a sweet malty feel in the beginning. Bitterness lingers on but not in an unpleasant way. Does it really get better than this?"

Got this from HipHop1 via trade - Thanks Hollie !
"1/24/11 canning date, drank from a tuilip. The beer poured a clear golden amber with about a finger of white fluffy head. The aroma was fruity - pineapple, grapefruit, with some sticky pineyness. The taste was pungently hoppy. It was very sweet and malty up front, then settling in to a bitterly hopped up finnish. The mouthfeel was smooth and pleasantly syrupy, well carbonated with a dry finish. Overall this was a well balanced and tasty DIPA."

"Shared by Chico1985, notes from Friday."
Thanks goes out to luxbwin for this brew.
"From a can into a chalice, it pours a clear dark amber with a cream color head. Nice lacing is left behind. The aroma is a bold honey or tangerine blossom tinged with the sweetness of peach. Hefty, yet well balanced, in taste with floral and citrus hops leading the way, caramel and a good bite at the end. Mouthfeel is heavy and satisfying as the flavor lingers. Overall, Abrasive is a hell of a Double IPA with exceptional balance and drinkability."
Canned on 2/7/11
"The canned on date has become illegible, but it was likely canned sometime in January."

Really excited to enjoy this. 16 oz. can poured into my newly acquired Surly pint glass. Thanks to TIMMYJ21 for both the can and the glass. Can dated 02/28/11.
Appearance:
"A: golden coppery color with decent transparency (still a bit of haze). An aggressive pour yielded little head that quickly disappeared leaving a thin ring around the edges. It didn't feel overly carbonated when I popped the can, but there are clearly some bubbles rising up from the nether regions, so here's hoping.Decent lacing, if not a bit sparse."

From notes 3-11-11
The beer was served chilled in an Imperial Pint glass. Many thanks UMNbeerhunter! This was a great beer drinking experience.
"Had a tasting of this on 2011-03-05 at the Imminent Liquidation Beer Advocate event at the Bull's Head Public House in Lititz, PA. Had a fresh (5-day old) full can on 2011-12-23 in Columbia, PA and ammended some comments and scores upwards. Had another fresh can on 2015-12-10. So good. This 2015 one is more dank than the last one I had. Had this again on 2016-11-14 and 2017-11-15 in Warrenville, IL"
Matt - Thanks again!
"Can poured into a standard pint glass. Not ideal, but it'll do."
"Thanks, Urbancaver for sharing!"
Big thanks to coenbd for this one

Received from maximum12 as an extra. Always looking forward to trying an DIPA I have never had before. 
Thanks to tbeq00 for this. Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass.
Poured from a can into a snifter glass. Thanks to NuBrewm for sending a four pack to me.
Served in a tulip at Jake Melnick's in Chicago. From notes.
"Received as an ""extra"" from arvjunk, much appreciated"
Poured to my darkness snifter a clear copper with a rush of bubbles creating a large ring and leaving impressive lacing.
"Received in a trade with UMNbeerhunter, and poured into a Spiegelau tulip."
I've been fortunate to have several cans of this and goddamn is this a great beer.
Major thanks to GeezLynn for 134 ounces of IIPA heaven. Reviewed live. 
Poured into my tulip. A beautiful copper color with some sediment at the bottom of the glass. Nice frothy thick white heading that left lacing all throughout the tasting.
Served from the can to a tulip glass
Thanks to Andy B. for the trade
"Was too easy to drink! A solid auburn/golden color. Nice 2 finger head, due to a quick pour... Guess I was too eager to try it... Definitely hugs your entire mouth. A balanced blend of fruity/citrusy hops with a solid malt backing. I'm not sure how long I sipped it, but I know that I'd like another!"
Poured from a 16oz can into a Town Hall Barrel Aged Week tulip. Last beer of the night 2/24/11.
"Canned 2/07/11. I love how cans keep these beers so fresh, this taste the same still as the first one I had a week and a half ago."
Canned 02/07/11

Poured from tap into standard pint glass. 
"16oz can, Boulevard tulip, somehow both the cans I have seem to be missing canned on dates. Thank you, Craig for the awesome trade. "
"Canned on 1/24/11. The first seasonal Surly I've had. Figured I should start taking advantage of living in Minneapolis and give it a try. Also, full disclosure: I'm a bit of a beer newb, and this is one of the higher ABV beers I've had, and the first Double IPA I've had. "
"On tap at Stub and Herbs. Pours a golden tan with a silky tan head. Nose has nice piney hops and bready malts. Well balanced, but not as vibrant as I was expecting. Crisp, clean body. Nice hoppy finish. Far from the original 16 Grit, but a tasty double IPA."
Many thanks to Ottodyer for picking up a 4 pack of this excellent DIPA for me.
Have been wanting to try this for quite a while. Very thankful to Rebis1bear for trading me a 4 pack! 
"After the surprise that was Ivan, I grabbed the only blind can from the box. Canned on 01/04/11 is dot matrixed on the bottom. Surly?"
Pours a hazy toasted straw color with a thick fluffy off-white head that slowly settles.
Canned on 1/14/11 and opened the date of this review.
"A thick IIPA, not at all dry. Beautiful balance, but didn't exactly showcase the hops like I tend to prefer. There are absolutely no flaws in this beer. I tend to see surly as a company that must have tremendous qc in place, think sierre nevada, but smaller and more adventureous."
Poured from 16oz can into Tulip.

"Holy grapefruit pith, Batman! More and more hops! Zowie!"
Got this one in a trade with hopscrazy! Thanks Brian! Really looking forward to this one!
"Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. HUGE thanks goes out to cavedave who included this long time want as an extra in our trade. I was happy to see a 1/4/11 on the bottom of the can not only because it means a fresh beer is waiting for me, but also because 1/4 is my birthday. This one was meant to be. "
"My first review, after a long time lurking and reading other people's opinions. This beer is so good, it's inspired me to take the step. And I don't even like most hoppy beers."
Thanks to spycow for the can!
"Can date is Dec. 27th, 2010. Poured into a pint glass, revealing hazy amber body with a massively tall and thick head. Nice lacing. Smells nice and meaty with hops along with a slight citrus presence and some bitter rind. Standard DIPA smells."
A - Looks like an IPA is supposed to. Slightly hazy golden orange/light brown with a big 'ol two finger head that lasts and puts nice lacing down the glass. A little carbonation can be seen flowing in the glass also.
"From notes - Amazing golden orange color that highlights tiney bubbles that rush towards a puffy white two finger head. This head leaves some spotty lacing as the beer retreats. The aroma is madening, both citrusy orange, lemon, grapefruit and tropical fruits ride a wave of more earthy and piney hops underneath. The flavor is crisp and clean, tropical, citrusy, and sweet withough being cloying. Perfect grain bill, too much crystal sometimes kills an ipa, here it is great, muted yeast charecter, clean. Is it the oat? Chewy and full mouthfeel just shy of too much. This is one of my top three favorit x2ipa's period."
"Big thanks goes out to optimator13 for this one from the Small Aquatic Mammal BIF '11! Served from can into a Surly Darkness snifter. Poured yellow-orange with a two and a half finger off-white head that subsided to a one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grapefruit, citrus hop, bitter hop, and slight wild onion. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, garlic, and mild onion. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. The onion flavor I detected on this one reminded me of all the good memories I have of Gunba. There was an excellent aroma and well balanced hoppy bitterness going on in this one. This is an absolute must try and totally worth seeking out."
"Abrasive. How can something with a name like that be so, so, smooth?"
"Live review of a pint can, canned on 01/04/11. Big thanks to StoutFest for this extra."

Appearance:
"Had this on tap at the Blue Door. Not really an IPA guy, but I wanted to try it."
"Thanks for bringing this one over Chris! Poured from can into NB globe, golden color, slightly orange, small white head that settles to a collar. Smells amazing, huge pine hop aroma, slightly fruity with a bit of malty sweetness. Taste is a good balance of tropical fruit hops, pineapple, with a good malt backbone and a slightly sweet finish. Medium to heavy body and a light carbonation. Overall a very good, balanced double IPA, one of my favorite surly beers."
Tasting notes from 2/2/11. Canned on date of 12/27/10
"Well, I finally got put back in my place. Thanks to Steve and some east coast contacts."
Big thanks go out to accordselux for sending this one as an extra in a trade! This is my first beer from Surly and I'm pumped.
227th review on BA
"Pours a hazy reddish orange with and inch of foam that quickly faded leaving some decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is a mix of fruit notes, orange, mango, pineapple and pine backed by a nice malty backbone. Taste is malty sweet with some of the mango and orange fruit flavors coming through toward the not very bitter finish. Nicely carbonated and medium bodied, this is very easy to drink and enjoy with just a hint of the 9% alcohol in the finish. Nicely done. Can't beat a can."
Another big thanks to jenray for this can.
Thanks to Alleykatking!
Pours a gold color with white fluffy head that fades quickly but leaves nice lacing.
"A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a three-finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a fairly clear, copper-amber color that does show a touch of haze (hop-haze one would hope). The aroma is awesomely dank with hops; an infused mix of bright citrus, pine, tropical fruit and herbaceous dank bud. The bright tropical fruit character mixes so well with the dank herbal quality that it makes me think of some, as yet undiscovered, cross between a tropical fruit and a really ripe, green marijuana bud. Specific aromas of tangelo zest, essential citrus oil, big lychee, kumquat, super-concentrated floral peach, some sort of citrusy almost garlic like note, peppery pine sap and a dank menthol note; up front the super ripe, tropical fruit character dominates, while in the finish the herbaceous, even at times peppery, notes come to the fore. Over time the garlic chive like aromatic note starts to come more to the fore and a spicy, slightly hot note of alcohol also starts to contribute to the nose."
Pours orange... Not quite as dark as furious. A decent amount of white head that dissipate fairly quickly. Smells... Incredible! Hops hops hops... Loads of floral and citrus and pine. Grapefruit is probably the strongest scent. Tastes... Like an incdible hop bomb. Tons of citrus and floral and grapefruit! A lot going on. Holy cow! This beer is phenomenal.
Date: 30 January 2011
Picked a few up in a trade with arvjunk. Thanks! The date on the bottom of the can was unfortunately scratched out so I cannot tell how fresh this is. 
Thanks urbancaver!
"Thanks to cmswoboda for the opportunity to try this one. Served at 49 degrees in a tulip. Pours a translucent burnt red/orange with a latte-like one inch cap. Head eventually dissipates into a solid skim, with swaths and spots of lacing adhering to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Nose reveals sweet citrus notes and a touch of slightly herbal, bitter rind. Taste consistent with nose; however, some tropical fruit seems to be co-mingled in the flavor profile. Finish is slightly bitter, but does not linger. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a slightly oily consistency and a crisp, even carbonation. There's also a slight astringency that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks. A top notch DIPA with great balance and just the right amount of complexity. I can't get enough from this Brewer."
Nice appearance - bright orange-amber with a big white head.
16oz can with about 10oz poured into the cervoise. I don't ever pour out entire cans of craft into a glass because I like to drink them straight outta the can (unless) reviewing. That's how I roll.
"Deep orange, thick frothy white head."
"Freaking Abrasive! Much love to freshmanpour77 (awesome trader) for hooking me up with this one (fresh). Ton of hops up front, carbonation spot on. Tried this by myself and was blown away, tried it with a friend the next go around and we were both amazed. We tried it again for a third time this Saturday next to Pliny (very fresh) and Abrasive was the preference of 3 of the 4 people at the tasting. It is amazing how this beer changes over just a week time with it tasting best the first (freshest). Looking forward to my next try of this amazing beer."
"Poured from a 16oz can dated 12-29-10. Pours clear dark orange with one finger white head. Aroma was impressive. Loaded with dank hops and tons of citrus. Flavor was loaded with bitter hops, but lacking all the citrus (I'm picking up mostly orange here) and a good malt back bone. Abrasive is a good name for this brew as if you don't like a ton of bitter hops than this one might not be for you. Mild carbonation going on. Solid beer but a bit of a disappointment based on other rankings."
Can poured into a dogfish pint.
Another free beer from Sideswipe. Thanks man.
Poured from a 16 oz. can into a tulip. Thanks to busch03 for hooking this up.

"16oz can poured into a Surly Darkness tulip. Can provided by UMNbeerhunter, thanks Joe!"

Big thanks to Quinn and Emily for wrangling up a few cans of this for me.
"upon appearance, the head is thin and wafting but the bubbles get me excited. The smell is citrus, grapefruit heaven that makes me salivate...the hops are overwhelming...my god, can this taste anywhere near as good as it smells...Yes, it can...and even better! My mouth wants to gulp, but my brain tells me to savor this brew ( I only have 4 after all). This will be my first beer of the night for the next 3 nights...I want not to lay waste to my palate with this most exceptional brew...my goodness! Tangy, sweet, and a bitter pounding that makes me want to bless myself w/ this nectar...thou shall not waste abrasive ale. Seek ye the ale that is abrasive and ye shall have everlasting peace!"
"Big thanks to Kegatron for this brew. What a guy...thank you Heath for the random surprise! Canned on 12/27/10 and poured into a snifter. This brew appears fairly clear with an orange coloration and some small particulate sinks to the bottom of the glass. A little more than a finger of fluffy yellowish stained head forms and holds strong in the glass. As it recedes, it leaves patches of lace clinging to the glass."
"Thanks to brewnic. I poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter, deep orange with a 2"" white head, nice lacing. The beer has a ton of pine and grapefruit on the nose. The first sip hits you with lots of pine, grapefruit and tropical fruit in the background. The beer is plenty bitter, as per my wife, and has a lingering piney finish. The body is medium and it has a sticky feel to it. A fine DIPA, worth seeking out."
Canned 12/27/10. Consumed 1/13/11.

thanks klikger for bringing this back fresh. canned 12/20/10
"I had 16 Grit on cask a few years back, had Abrasive canned last year and loved it. Finally reviewing it."
"This is one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, hands-down. The appearance is nothing amazing, a cloudy reddish-gold with a minimal head, but every other aspect of this beer is sensational. The smell is all pineapple, smells about as enticing as any beer I've had. Following up the smell, the taste does not disappoint: it's slightly sweet, citrus and fresh hops with a very minor malt base, in my opinion the perfect balance of flavor for a DIPA. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but the lightness suits the beer very well and adds to its drinkability. It has that stickiness that I associate with fresh hops, though I have no idea what to actually attribute it to. It's insanely drinkable for a beer this hoppy and high in ABV. Despite the massive hops flavor, it's really not that bitter. Because of the light mouthfeel and incredible taste, I could drink several of these."
"Canned 12/20/10, poured consumed and reviewed 1/7/11. Review transcribed 1/8/11."
16oz can poured into tulip glass - 12/20/10 canning date - big thanks to biglobo8971 for a beer that i've been dying to try
"Consumed 1/7/11 Says canned on 12/27/10, which was my birthday! This has to be good. Received in a trade from TheDudeRules, thanks so much dude, can't wait!"
"Pours a hazy, yet clean orange-gold, with a tall tannish-white head that hangs out. Provides a fantastic floral, citrus hop flavor. This beer really invites you in. Spicy, biting combination of big hop with a bit of malt back flavor. Surly Wet was like a cleaner, brighter Furious. This is like a bigger, bolder and spicier Furious, in a great way. Leaves a reasonable bitterness behind, but in a pleasant way - like Abrasive Ale doesn't want to let you go. Moderate levels of carbonation without any syrupy mouthfeel that sometimes accompanies bigger DIPAs. Exceedingly drinkable for its aggressive nature. Another winner for Surly. Do yourself a favor and get a connect for Wet, Abrasive and Furious, all right when they come out. At least for the first two, the experience is just as good as Pliny/Blind Pig, just different takes on the styles. That is really a fantastic beer."
Comes in 1 pint cans. 
A: Nice golden color with a white frothy head that sticks around
Thanks Cory for sharing some of this delicious beer.
"Jesus....had this beer several times but never reviewed it. The appearance is good but not special. A nice amber orange with a small head. The smell is transcendent. Such a ripe, juicy aroma of tropical fruits and pine. Splendid. The taste is the nectar of amazing citrus and tropical fruit hops. Almost like Hi-C Ecto Cooler (in a good way). So delicious and smooth, a bit of malt to hold it together, but not much. The mouthfeel is good. The drinkability is out of this world. So easy to just down this shit like its a fruit juice cocktail on a beach. A world class DIPA. Amazing."
"Much thanks to UMNBeerHunter for providing this one so fresh, just two weeks after the release!"
"This beer pours an orange-red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm quarter inch cap of lacing. The aroma is strong enough that it leaps out of the glass, and can be detected feet away. Mandarin oranges, peaches, grapefruit, hibiscus, and pollen are all present in copious amounts. This is one beautiful smelling beer. The taste is pure hop juice. The bitterness isn't as firm as a lot of other DIPAs I've tasted which allows the hop flavors to show themselves more clearly. All aspects of the aroma are present in the taste with the addition of a nice soft earthiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a great beer that I will surely search out again, and again."
Poured into a New Belgium Globe glass; shared with tribepride and rosen551
"This beer pours a copper color, almost light amber with a white head. The aroma is complex! Very piney with hints of citrus. I love the hop character in this beer. The mouthfeel is medium to medium light, and is very drinkable. For a beer at 9% the alcohol isnt noticeable."

Poured from a can into a pint glass with a one finger head...
Last day of 2010. Great way to bring in the new year. 
Thanks to chewy08rx for sending this extra can from my want list. 
"Two day old Abrasive - you can't beat that. This one pours a nice amber with a good head on it. The smell is very much grapefruit and sweet malt. The flavor a also very much grapefruit/tropical fruit with a little bit of malt to back it up - but that's not the point of this one - it's a hop bomb. The tropical fruit and seet malt keep it light and not too bitter. As it warms the malt pokes out a bit more and a hint of alcohol comes on. It tastes quite a bit like a bigger version of Wet, which is one of my favorites. The mouthfeel is the only downfall to this brew, I was expecting a bit more body to it though I guess that might be expecting everything to be perfect. However, this is a very refreshing brew and not so ovewhelming that I could have 2-3, although the big ABV is a bit limiting. A great beer and probably the most Cali DIPA this side of the rockies."
A- Copprer/deep gold in color decent head that died fairly quickly
Color is a nice orange/coppder color.
Abrasive Ale (also called 16 Grit)
A: Copper-amber body with a thin white head that stays around the edges throughout.
Picked up a 4pack from Blue Max for $15. Canned on 12-20-2010. Served into my Revolution 20ozer:
Appearance - dark orange with a minimal white head at the the top.
A: A nice amber colour with a nice fluffy white head. 
Insanely flavorful IPA released today in cans. Had to get to the liquor store (France & 44th - they had lots) to make sure I got some of my favorite Surly brew.
A - Hazy amber body topped by a foamy one finger eggshell white head. Good head retention with spotty lacing.
"As The CANQuest (TM) goes, I was Furious a short while ago and now I'm going to get downright Abrasive. The CAN's graphics take me back to the USS Fulton (AS-11), and my days as a general Deck seaman, chipping paint, grinding what I had just chipped and painting back over the chipped, ground surface. What a great life! I was in with stone psychos, both in terms of fellow deck hands and leadership. The ship was crazy and I fit right in. It set me on a path from which I have not yet returned and may never at the rate that I am going. A Happy Veterans Day (belated) to all of my brothers and sisters! We may have left as strangers, but we're all family now."
"Poured from the 16 ounce can a deep amber color with a creamy beige head. On the nose, I get a ton of hoppy aromas, pine, orange, grapefruit. On the palate, medium bodied, with a whole assortment of tropical fruits--mango, pineapple, grapefruit--light honey, caramel."
Received as an extra in a trade with a generous BA thanks!
"This beer was great, but I still prefer Furious..Pours a clear orange golden with a large frothy off-white head that leaves nice lacing as it recedes. Aroma is a big dose of hops, including grass, earth, pine/resin, citrus and some rind, along with a hint of caramel. Flavor is sweet on the outset, followed by nicely balanced hops and malt, with spice, pine, grass/earth and more citrus rind and a mild lingering bitterness and some residual warmth. Nice stuff, if not a touch sweet, but still a very nice DIPA."
16oz can into a Snifter glass
"A -- A hazy, golden apricot color that pours into a good head and leaves a nice lacing."
"Appearance: By being unfiltered this Double IPA has a foggy but deep color structure. The body is mostly a dull, orangish gold with notes of light gold towards the bottle of the glass."
Can pour served in a Duvel tulip
Awesome extra from biniek13. Poured into a nonic.
Tasted from can obtained from a trade. Pours clear amber orange with a huge white head that is frothy and rocky with excellent retention. Nose is bitter and citrus hops with a great malt backbone and just a hint of bread and yeast. Flavor is bittersweet up front with some caramelization on the middle along with pineapple and other tropical fruits. The hops come in with light lemon and bitterness on the back. The body is medium with average carbonation and a beautiful tropical fruit and bitter finish. This is a first class DIPA.
"Thanks to bauermj for the trade! 16oz can into a Hopus tulip pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice frothy off white head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is burnt caramel in front of sharp pine hops. The taste is a nice amount of pine hops just in front of a nice burnt caramel backbone, very nice balance with the hops winning out while not entirely overpowering. The beer is medium bodied with well hidden alcohol, quite smooth and refreshing. I must say, this is a very enjoyable DIPA, one I would certainly love to have again."
Poured from a can into a pint glass. It pours a very nice golden amber color. A 1/4 off-white head forms and slowly reduces leaving a blotchy full coverage lacing. No sediment and carbonation visible.
"Can from glazeman - thanks, Scott!"
Thanks again to dzyneguru for hooking me up with all these Surly beers!
"Found this on tap at Stub & Herb's in Minneapolis. It shines clear and amber with a fair white head that quickly fades to a mere ring with very good lacing. The aroma is a pretty intense, sweet grapefruit/juniper hop with a modicum of raspberry malt bleeding through. Strong and tempting. The first taste is pretty in line with the aroma, somewhat syrupy fruity hops with a fair bready malt undercurrent. It still evokes a curious but likeable juniper/evergreen idea in a medium plus bodied brew. Definitely a brew of solid constitution that demands some appreciation but it hides its 9.5% ABV quite well allowing for decent drinkability for the style. Mild carbonation but a smooth, somewhat thick feel that goes down quite reasonably."
A - Hazy dark orange body. Unbelieavable head and lacing.
A: Hazy orange/ brown hue with a minimal but steady head; lacing is good

"Reviewed solo and poured into an East End pint glass,"
"Pour - dark golden in color with some super bright orange and reddish streaks shining through as I hold the glass up to the light. The head is super creamy and about a half inch in thickness. Wow, this looks fantastic. "
Poured from a 16oz. can into a snifter glass. Has a nice orange/reddish/copper color with good head retention and high carbonation. Lots of citrus hoppy aroma with some nice caramel and toffee notes. Very malty taste. Caramel malts take over in flavor with some citrus hops and alcohol in the end. Very creamy mouthfeel with some hop bitterness. Me like!
"Canned sample- pours a glowing tangering, slight haze, minimal head. Nose- ripe tropical fruit rinds, some pine, sweet cookie malts. Taste- hop forward as expected, thick resiny hop feel, spicy and sweet. Malt adds mostly a sweetness aspect to it, as this is all about the hops. Fairly thick creamy body with moderate carbonation. Quite easy drinking which is very dangerous. A four pack would slide down nicely, and likely lead me to being quite abrasive to those around me..."
Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to Buebie for this one.
Golden orange sort of color with a nice tight head. Very floral and has a caramel sweetness that kept wafting my way once poured. even before my first sip a sweet smelling aroma continually came my way. Hop blast upfront. A lot more hop flavor then bitterness. Very flowery tasting-not citrusy or pine like. Oily and sticky mouthfeel that I just love. Very drinkable beer and enjoyable. Abrasive nuthin-smoth as a baby's bottom!
"I got a 4-pack of this from Scoobydank. Thanks, Bill! You were generous enough to send me a growler of this back in the day, and I'm looking forward to revisiting this beauty!"
Golden bronze bodied with a top of dirty linen that stays a bit and laces nicely.
Thanks to Scoobydank for this treat. I love Surly cans the do make my day and the can do an IPA.
Huge thanks to wisconsinality (actually his lady) for snagging this one for me.
A- Pours a clear amberish orange with a nice off white head. Head has fairly descent retention and leaves some lacing down the sides of the glass.

Poured into Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass
"An extremely flavorful hopped IPA with a candied citrus flavor balanced with light grasses and spruce. Still, the bittering is smooth and quite gentle."
"A - Amber colored beer with a bit of red at the edges. Nice fluffy white head, left a nice bit of lacing on the sides throughout the drink."
Thanks to younger35 for this can in a recent trade. Been wanting this for a while now too.
"pours a bright clear copper with very faint cream head. decent retention, no lacing."
"I've been looking forward to trying this, a big thanks to mymrnngjckt for hooking me up. Cheers Kevin!"
"Ditmier asked if I had tried this before... I said no... Bam! A can appears... Thanks Homeboy.... apparently I have some of these coming, but we'll see."
"Pours a transparent amber color with about an inch or so of off-white head, leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of this one is really good--full of hoppy goodness. I get oranges, pine needles, some floral notes, a bit of alcohol, and maybe a hint of malt. Crisp and refreshing."
Many thanks to mymrrngjckt for a can of this.
Presented in a 1 Pint can with an illustration of a sanding disc sparking multiple hops. Nice. Poured lovingly into a Hennepin flute.

"Orange-gold pour with a white head. Big citrus, melon and pine aroma with some sweet toffee and biscuit, a hint of floral character. Grapefruit, bubblegum, melon, honey and pine flavor with some sticky sweet caramel. Oily, medium-full body with moderate carbonation."
"Need to give a shout out to a high school buddy, Bruce, for sending me a fresh 4-pack of Abrasive. Not a BA, but understands good beer."
A: Pint can poured into a Duvel Tulip. Pours an appealing light copper color with an off white slightly orange one finger head. Leaves moderate lacing on the glass.
"Many thanks to kbutler1 for sending a four pack of this my way. One thing I can say for certain is that the last time I had this (when it was called 16 Grit) is that is got me ever some drunk. Anyway, it comes out a clear orange color, without much of a head. Hops can be detected immediately upon pouring, giving off an herbal and fruity sort of hop flavor. I get notes of pineapple, grapefruit, mint leaf, and sticky resin. Very similar in flavor, with the sweetness and bitterness battling it out throughout the experience. In the end the bitter character has the edge. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and syrupy at times in light of the sweetness. Drinkability is great, but like I said before about my first experience with this brew, be careful, as it will knock you on your ass easily. Overall a pretty damned good DIPA. I am glad they decided to can this, as opposed to discontinuing it all together. Cheers"
"Update 6/28/13 - I've had the pleasure of consuming a few cans recently and this is delicious. I actually think a little age has softened the bitterness and brought out some really nice fruitiness from the malt. The bitterness is now not distracting in any manner, but blends very well with the hop and malt flavors. I've adjusted my score accordingly."
"pours out of the 16 oz. can a clear copper colour with a thin beige head which leaves some thin lace. lots of tropical/citrus like hoppiness in the nose...pineapple and mango with an intense, spicy, peppery and herbal like undertone. sweet and sugary malt aroma balances things precariously. the taste on the front end is full of big juicy fruit hop flavours tempered a bit by some sweet munich-like maltiness. on the back end it finishes with that pungent, resiny, hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue for quite awhile. there is a bit of peppery alcohol spice that mingles with the hop spice to make for an intense experience. while it doesn't quite live up to being ""abrasive"", it's intensely hoppy. it has a full, semi-rich and sweet malty body but the mouthfeel is strangely thin feeling for such a high ABV DIPA. therefore it doesn't drink as such, making the the drinkability pretty damn good. "
"Pale peach colored pour with a resounding pillowy white head that rises and falls but leaves a steady, consistent cover across the entire surface of this beer. An absolute barrage of tiny bubbles continually dart towards the surface."
"Poured from a 16oz can into my Dogfish shaped pint glass. Poured a clear copper color with a bit of orange highlights coming through. It poured with a thick and bubbly inch and a half white head, but settled down to a thin covering after a minute or so."
"A: golden orange/light amber w/a slight chill haze. thick, dense lasting creamy eggshell head and incredible lacing coats all the way down."
"Had on tap at the Muddy Pig, took crappy notes as I was trying not to be too rude. Please forgive the shortness."
"Pours a dark, hazy copper with a yellow tinted white head. The lacing and retention is spot on."

Presentation: Poured from a 1 pint 16oz can into a New Belgium globe.
"This beer pours a very clear gold with a slight orange hue. The head is white, I think it is dropping because of the hotel glass it is in. The smell is awesome, orange rind, pine, grassy, a hint of biscuit, when I opened the can I smelt it from about a foot away. The taste is very good, first some orange sweetness, then a little malty sweetness, a slight bitterness, then more piney bitterness, and then a clean almost refreshing ending. The mouthfeel is a bit light, and the ending is kind of refreshing, really not expected in DIPA, but that gives it an exceptional rating for drinkabiity."
"Appearance: all Surly beers are bottled in cans (if that that makes sense?) Purchased fresh refrigerated 4-pack brewery-dated less than a week prior to pouring into a double-walled pint glass. A tad lighter in colour than expected, nice thick tall foamy head when aggessively poured (and how else should you pour something called ""Abrasive""?) into double-walled pint glass."
"Huge thanks Peter!! Poured form the can into a Portsmouth tulip. Pours a clear amber with a nice off white head. Lively carbonation and nice lacing evident. Good aroma- pine, floral hops and some malt. Taste is the winner! Tons of hops- pine resin, some citrus and a bit of mint. Really smooth for a dipa with this much bitterness. Does that make sense?? Tremendously drinkable. I can literally pour this one down my throat. Medium body, slightly slick mouthfeel. God I love Surly's hop bombs!"
"This is what a DIPA should taste like. There are many to chose from, but if you get lucky enough to get your hands on this one you are in for a delight."
"Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Thanks kbutler1 for the 4 pack, you are the man."
"Apparently this is the same formula as 16 Grit. Nose is the best feature of the beer. Great pine and floral hops that don't quit. Beautiful. Taste is more pine and some citrus and floral hops, a reasonable malt and caramel presence that balance it a bit. Good drinkability, but having it in close proximity to Barle3y Brown's Chaos and Alpine Duet make it dwarf a bit. Very good, not EPIC."
HUGE thanks to Peter for this one. Poured from a 16oz. bottle into a tulip.

"A: Pours a vibrant deep orange with an average khaki color head. Good clarity. Good amount of sticky lacing, not as much as the first several cans I've had over the past few weeks."
A big thanks to my homeboy Ben for hooking me up with some cans of this beast.
"A - Pours orange with some red highlights. Frothy, semi-rocky off-white cap that fades and doesn't leave much lacing. Surprising clarity."
"A: Pours a light golden hue. Tall foamy head, good retention, like a lace bomb exploded in the glass."
"Got a few cans of this from kbutler1. Thanks! I was able to try this beer a couple times last year in growler form, pleased to see it available in cans now."
Very excited to try this beer - thanks Matt G. for setting me up with a 4-pack. 
Thanks to Dan for snagging a few of these when they briefly hit the shelves. This is my last one. Served in a Kuhnhenn tulip. Some comments are cribbed from my growler review.
Poured into my Bell's Hopslam Tulip.
"Quite nice looking. A clear amber ale, a half finger of pale tan head formed on a pretty vigorous pour, not bad retention for what it was. Quite intricately laced, with a bit more carbonation this could have been more like eye candy."
Chill hazed peachy gold color. Tall fluffy capping of dusted yellow cream and lots O' lacing in thin holey sheets and some tattered edgings.
"16 oz can into an open-mouth imperial glass. Big ups to Mothman for the trade the night before Dark Lord Day! Thanks, Ben - nice to meet you and swap some great beers!!"
Sipping on this one as I type... poured from the can into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass with some good frothy white head with decent lacing.
"Have I ever mentioned that pwoods is the greatest BA ever? Oh, I have? Well let me thank him again for sending this one unexpectedly. Love you buddy:)"
Many thanks go out to mothman for this one. This was a extra treat Ben...see you at Darkness Day!
"Poured from a 16 oz. can into my SN 30th Anniversary tulip. Received as an extra in a trade with cope0021, thanks!"
"Can from a DLD trade. Thanks, random person! Pours to a nice amber with a perfect white head. Nose is very strong, and full of citrus and piney hops. The taste is a medley of hop perfection. Very fruity, like a succulent mango, robust with flavor but not as bitter as the name ""Abrasive"" would imply. I imagine the folks at Surly loaded up the late hop and dry hop additions to achieve this hop-head's dream beer. This isn't the driest of the style, but I think the lingering sweetness adds something special to its flavor profile."

A: pours dark golden with a nice one inch creamy white head. 
Pours a solid golden color with a nice twinge in the middle- a solid ring around my glass of white head.
A - Clear golden color with white head. I could see a full pint of this on a billboard. The color is so clear and pure I can read through it.
"Pours a slightly orangish yellow, similar to a sunset in the bottom of a glass. The aroma is very stronly hoppy. When I taste the beer, the hop flavor isn''t overpowering at all. Much more subtle than I would have thought under the circumstances. Really drinkable. It goes down as easily as a standard pale ale. This is flat out amazing. If I had regular access to this, I would have it stocked in my fridge at all times."
Thanks go out to mothman for sending a few of these down my way. 16 oz. can poured into my CCB snifter.
"Well I tried this one a while back when it was called 16-grit, but never got around to reviewing it. This time, I am having the canned version, received via trade with guyinchicago- thanks!"
"Poured one into a Duvel glass. Light foamy head disappeared into lace. Appearance is like light maple syrup. Smell is aromatic with pronounced citrus and pine and also a savory umami note. Taste is hoppy pineapple with hints of umami (referred to in other reviews as a garlic note, but I think it's more akin to miso). Flavor profile is complex but quick. Clean finish for this style with minimal hints of caramel. Neutral hops at the very end. Clean and dry. The high ABV (9 - 9.7) WILL catch up with you. My opinion is that this DIPA is even better than Great Divide's Hercules. The reviewer suggests stocking up on this outstanding brew because the production date, as supplied by the brewery website, is April only. Outstanding!"
"A- Poured the Surly pint can into my trusty old Hamms glass, color is a golden orange with a nice white shaving cream head that lasts and leaves a nice sheet of lacing."
"A-clear copper-brown with 1-finger tight foamy head, left very little lacing"
Thanks to my man Doug for this one!
A-Tan colored..
"Pours a slightly hazy amber color with one finger of white head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing. Big hop nose. Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, and other tropical fruit. Not much for malt and the alcohol is not detected. The flavor starts suitably bitter with huge hop flavor. More pineapple and a sticky, resiny pine flavor. Some malt sweetness enters the picture and quickly disappears leaving me wondering if I detected it at all. Anyway, the malt is not overly sweet but enough to carry the hops. Finishes bitter but no sign of alcohol which is quite remarkable. The texture is nothing special but the body is medium and lively carbonated. One of the better brewed DIPAs. Available in cans now so more people will get to enjoy this beer, fresher."
A - Light to medium tannish brown body with an off-white light tan head.
"A: A beauty in a darkness tulip. ¾"" of head tops off a medium copper colored body that has columns of bubbles running up the middle. "

This beer is the former 16 Grit renamed I believe. Great Beer - if it gets warm you can taste the alcohol .... I love the smell and the nice head.
"Huge thanks to skinnyguy for sending this my way. Amber pour with a nice sized off white head. Aroma is grass, grapefruit, diacetyl, and caramel. Flavor is up front caramel malt, butter, grapefruit rind, toffee, and grass. Bitter finish, good carbonation. Tasted old less than a week after release...not my thing."

"Clear copper body. Wispy and light frothy white head. Lace is pretty full, as expected with a hop bomb like this. Aroma is very big on the pine needles pine resin thing. Which is good. Some grassy notes too. A little bong resin to boot. Flavor is all hops up front with a surprisingly subdued bitterness. Oh, it's there, just not as abrasive or raw as I was expecting. Hops give piney and grassy flavors. Alcohol hides fairly well under the blanket of hops. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Solid, if not spectacular, DIPA."
"Picked up a 4 pack of 16 ounce cans this evening, priced at $15.99."
"Tried to quell the urge to hunt this down, but Surly is so masterful with the hops I failed. Picked up a four-pack at Blue Max. Happy to hear this is going to be around for at least a few weeks this spring!"

On tap @ SL Binny's.
pour is a nice off white tan head with a rather clear amber body. nice lace. nose is a nice breadiness and consistent candied pine apple fruit. with agitation a tangerine/clemente/orange juice breaks through. the palate reveals a milder sweet. the scope is still all the fruits but muted by a nice earthy walnut malt in the sweet. works well with the breadiness. very complex and broad beer. a treat.

"I wasn't sure this was still going to have the goods after 2 months plus in a growler, but man was I wrong - taste after taste I was amazed by the terrific smell and taste of citrussy hops, almost lemon like; beautifully balanced, dangerously drinkable, it's been a long time since I've had a beer that amazed me as this one has. I'm very happy to hear they have since made more of this."
Gotta thank my boy Surlyman for this. 
Thanks to faro for sharing this.
"Lots of thanks to Deliriumfest for the trade. It's only now, as I read through the reviews, that I realize that this isn't one of Surly's regular growler offerings."
Thanks to Beerbeagle once again for an awesome trade opportunity! Cheers Randall!
"Superb Double IPA! Thanks very much to RustyDiamond for sharing a growler with me and a couple of other Atlanta area BAs. Pours a dark orange/amber with some chill haze with a fairly nice head given the abv and the fact that it was from a shipped growler. Some nice lacing as well. Slightly spicy hops in the nose and with some lovely citrus aromas. The taste is a perfectly balanced blend of firm, slightly sweet malt, pine, and citrus. Wonderfully fresh tasting and scrumptious hops. Just awesome. Incredibly smooth. I don't know what the abv is on this, but I could drink this all day- or until I fell off my stool. Just luscious."
Sampled from Growler. I never thought I would get a crack at this one! 
"Growler, brought to the Stouts tasting. And I mighty fine IPA it was. Orange/copper with white head. Sweet and awesome hops come out of the glass to start you salivating while you smell the beer. Tasted great, nice and hoppy with an awesome sweetness to really nicely balance this beer. Up there as on of the best IIPA's I've had."

Via growler pour into shaker pint on 1/23/09. Thanks to dashirey for sharing. 
"Pours a dark hazy copper with a frothy off white head. The aroma has a bit of the onion that you get in Furious. The citrus and pine aromas are well blended. The flavor has plenty of malt and hops, and the balance is pretty amazing. Seems full bodied with a sweetish finish."
"Wow, just wow....I got this heavenly beer from the guys at Heritage in St Paul, great people, very generous. "
Sample poured fromb a growler by Matt at Capone's in Norristown PA. Growler courtesey of another very generous patron. 
"Who brings a growler of DIPA to a Stout Tasting party? Skourtis, that's who! Big thanks to Theo for sharing his bounty and thanks to the MN trader who sent this along. I tried 16 Grit twice last night and was fortunate enough to get 10-12 oz. more today (benefits of hosting said party). Poured to a pint glass."
"This is another fantastic Surly offering. Appearance is very good, a nice orange hazy color with a decent head and lots of oily lacing. Smell was quite good, a nice blast of fresh hops- very complex hop character here. Also a slight bit of spice and grapefruit. My one qualm with the beer is that the taste does not blast me quite as hard as the smell. Mouthfeel is great, oily and moves around well on the palate. Drinkability is fantastic for a DIPA."
"Many, many thanks to turdfurgison for his generosity in sharing the growler. Very much appreciated. "
"Terrifically turbid caramel-covered orange with juicy tangerine and mango highlights. The golden sandstone colored head isn't huge, but it oozes quality. The foam is firmly creamy and sticky, leading to both persistence and an extensive array of fine lace. This is a great looking DIPA."
"Poured from a growler gifted from JohnBierman as an extra in a trade (!). I'm finishing my second pint, and I'm seriously loving this beer. John told me it was filled from the bright tank, not kegged first. It could be this is the reason it feels like a cask ale, it has an English ""real ale"" body but with massive American hops flavors. The beer is dark copper colored, clear, with a thin white foam. The smell is wickedly good, way better than Furious which smells a lot more like cat piss (I'm not knocking it, it's just the dominant aroma in Furious). I don't really get the feline urine in 16 Grit, mostly the hops come through as grapefruit and pine sap. The taste is stunning, I really don't know how it could be improved. The hops dominate with citrus flavors but there's a malty sweet counterbalance that keeps things interesting taste-wise. The body is stunning too, very ""casky"". Probably this is my favorite DIPA at this point, and it's really sad that I'll never see it again after this growler dies."
Wow...the other reviewers did a great job with a more technical analysis. All I can say is that this is the best DIPA I've ever had. Big citrusy (orange?) DIPA balancing the malt and bitterness. I swear this beer tastes better because I can't buy another growler.
"From tizzod's last growler...quite an honor to consume over an evening. Surly was ""selling too much beer"" at the brewery according to the Minnesota liquor control board, so its success was rewarded with a ban on free trade...no more growlers at the brewery. How is this American?"

"This Review is of 16 Grit, released at the brewery before the end of growler sales and the recipe/name change. The hop schedule of 16 Grit is different than Abrasive but for some reason the two beers were merged:"
"Like hundreds of other good people, I stood in line for an hour to get two growlers of this fine stuff. Then I stood in another shorter line to get the growlers hand filled by Omar and the staff. I then went home and killed a growler off since I was tired of waiting in line."
"Appearance: Dark orange-red, smallish head, good lacing."
"Cool, I get to be the 10th review. Thanks to kroggdawg for sharing his growler. Frankly, I've gotten tired of imperial this and double that lately, but this beer rocked. It was complex in flavor, yet drinkable for the average hophead and still something different. It seems like most brewer just throw the C-hops (cascade, chinook, centennial, etc) at their DIPAs and let er' rip. This can make a good DIPA, but I've have enough of those."
After ignoring the slew of random white people and parents who bring their children to wait in line 2 growlers were had.
A- Hazy orange liquid that you can not easily see through. Half inch white foamy head that sticks to the glass as you drink it. 
"Named 16 Grit, in honor of his dad's abrasives business, where the brew house is situated. Growler picked up and drank the very same day, fresh as can be. Into a pint glass, pours a dark amber copper color with a nice off-white head, good retention. The aroma is intense, some fantastic fruits popping out, caramel malts hovering in there too. The taste is even better, lives up to its name but drinkability doesn't suffer. The same fruits and caramel sugar are there, sweeter than I'd have thought. The mouth is great, thick, coating, oozing, but not syrupy, not too hot, lovely. Overall, probably the quickest I've ever drank a growler, if that says anything."
"64 oz. growler, filled on 12/27/08 at the brewery."
Growler poured into Bouleverd smokestack series goblet
Picked up a couple growlers at the brewery.
"Filled just over an hour ago, ready to enter my awaiting Surly pint glass. I've been waiting a long time for a Surly DIPA, so glad the chose one as a final shebang for growler sales at the brewery!"
"Love this beer. Just had another 22 oz. bottle. Great color, great hoppyiness and easy to drink. I will buy it whenever I see it at the beer store."
Pine and tropical fruit on the nose. Feel is very creamy. Tons of hops on the fron and back.
"8/1/18: $12 22 oz bottle purchased at Three Floyds Munster, two pours into pint glass. Orange pour, thin white head, heavy carbonation. Strong citrus lemon hops aroma. Very strong dry taste and mouth feel, excellent hops blend, balanced with citrus. Drinks smoother and easier than the strong ABV. Solid mouth feel, bitter, carbonation and dryness holds, Overall excellent offering, worth the trip to Munster!"
"5 ounce pour at 3 Floyds in Munster. Nice dark golden orange colour with fruity aroma - grapefruit, hoppy resinous, a little floral. The taste starts more with a sweet malt followed by big citrus notes then pushing into piney flavours. Full bodied mouthfeel to a well balanced finish - pleasant but not over the top bitterness for a 100 IBU beer. Fantastic."
This is my most favorite beer. It is very smooth with fruity overtone. A beer with a much higher alcohol content and should not be drunk quickly. If you can find this beer anywhere (it's a rarity) enjoy!
It's a good beer. I prefer Dreadnaught by a lot.
"I love a creamy, citrusy IPA and to me this is the premier example. The mouth feel is perfectly creamy and thick with a hoppy, complex nose. It finishes strong all the way through the aftertaste."
Now then! This is the real deal. Pours a nice amber/ golden color
my first BA reivew. This is the beer I've been yearning for months. Was there a bad crop of hops out there or something? This is really balanced. No medicinal aftertaste that seems to have plagued even my perennial favorites this year. Restored my faith. Maybe God is ok with me loving beer after all. Had my doubts for a while 
"I received this beer from a BIF Lloyd Dobler, thank you. The beer is FAF from the grapevine. The beer is 48 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer has a one finger creamy and airy white head. The color of the beer is SRM 10 a medium amber with copper hues. The clarity of is a touch opaque with a few carbonation bubbles. The head has poor retention and no lacing on the glass. "
Thanks to a stalwart BA who gifted this monster to me recently.
"Hazy dark straw appearance with a one finger off white head. Dank, earthy, piny nose that is on the shy side. Maybe as it warms it will get more expressive. Taste mirrors the nose with plenty of earthy, resiny pine along with hints of citrus. Bready malt plays a fairly big role in overall taste. Pleasant bitterness lingers on a long finish. Mouth feel is very creamy. Glad to have finally gotten a hold of this beer - it's darn tasty and deserves its high rating."
GABF 2014
"Pouring from a bomber bottle into a pint glass. This beer pours out slightly hazy, but not New England hazy. It's a golden orange color and forms a half finger of white crown. The smell is dank and juicy with citrus notes. Honey like sweetness coming through as well. The taste comes in with pine at the very beginning but quickly fades into a juicy citrus and then again into the honey like sweetness that it finishes with. Sticky and wet mouthfeel. This is so good, FFF has been doing this good shit for so long."
"wow I can't believe this is at 10.50% really smooth for such a high abv. Very bright, very smooth, good citrus nose on the body. great hop taste. Delicious."
Bright and citrusy aromas.
Poured a hazy dark orange with a dense looking white head.
Tasted from draft. Pours hazy gold with white head. Aroma is citrus and some dank resin. Taste is well balanced with great clean bitter flavor. Flavors of melon and citrus fruit. Excellent beer but I think I like Zombie Dust better.
"L- Brilliant orange with a large, foamy off-white head with little carbonation."
22 ounce bomber bottled 5/10/2017 and poured into a 3 Floyds pint glass and consumed on 5/17/2017.
"Pours a clouded orange with two and a half fingers of off-white head that retains extremely well. Just a little lacing left behind. Aroma is pine, resin, citrus, and lemongrass. Extremely hoppy, but well developed. Flavor profile is resin, pine, citrus, lemongrass, and herbal. Lots and lots of hop notes, which include a discernible bitterness. Bready biscuit malts provide some support. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, grainy texture. Overall, a huge DIPA with loads and loads of hop notes. Not close to bitter free, but still well executed. "
Finally got my hands on a bomber. 22oz bottle. Cannot read the date but I am assuming it is relatively fresh as my beer store buddy just got it in today. 
Appearance - Pours deep golden color with nice thick white head. Streaky white lacing down the glass.
22 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Cannot read the bottle date.
"Enjoyed a bomber dated ""4-11-17"" on April 26, 2017. I also had this on draft recently (undoubtedly the same production run--3F doesn't make it all that often)."
Clear bronze with two fat fingers of yellow-tinted white head that last a good while and leave heavy lacing.
"Enjoyed with Ryan, split from a 22oz bomber into two tulip glasses. "
A 22 oz. bottle date 2-13-2017 poured into a TH tulip glass. 
"Thick, chewy, malty, sweet and boozy. Some pineyness...not the typical characteristics I am a fan of in an imperial IPA. Glad I got to try this but it's not for me."
"Lovely pour, amber with perfect clarity with a small head with little retention"
Amazing DIPA !! Truly world-class. Taste this whenever you have the opportunity! 
Best aroma and taste from an ipa. Best 3 floyds I've had and that includes dark lord and behemoth
"Glorious glorious ... took me back to the first time I had Avery's Maharajah. Funeral is an old school-style imperial with a more pronounced hop bitterness upfront then counter balanced with a wallop of malt on the backend. No tip toeing the line here, an imperial in every sense with one exception: no alcohol burn, just incredibly smooth. Loved it- great work here by 3Floyds!"
"Pours a golden hue color with a i finger eggshell white color . Very tropical smell sweet papaya,citrus white fruits . Tstae follows nose very juicy hops with garden dankness ,melon and papaya, sweet caramel malts in the finish. Mouth feel is sweet and hoppy ABV well hidden lingering bitterness."
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a Three Floyds pint glass.
"First had 6/5/16 at the brewery. This was the third brewery out of eight that I hit on my cross country trip with my brother. This was my favorite from them, it was bright, slightly juicy, floral, and all around great."
"Doesn't mess around, it's on the extreme side of the IPA spectrum. One of the better tasting high abv ales from FFF, just wish it was available in a smaller format. Bomber was good to try once, not frequently."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass the same day it was bottled. Couldn't be more fresh. Pours a beautiful golden yellow with a huge head thato lingers and leaves nice lacing. Smells of pine, pot, and citrus. Dankey. The taste follows. Huge body and mouthfeel. Feels almost like a creamy stout with moderate carbonation. Over all, great IPA. One of the best for the style."
"Bottle shared by Mike last night, thanks man."
Poured from bomber into snifter. Bottled about one month ago (8/10/16)
"From a bomber into a snifter. I drank this fairly fresh, less than 3 weeks after bottled."
"Poured out of a pint bottle into a pint glass. The smell was like a powerful wallop of hops with some fruit undertones. The first sip was even more powerful, you can definitely taste and feel that 10.5% ABV. That is not by any means a bad thing though., the flavors balance the strength admirably. I loved the spritely mouthfeel, it was like a thousand little tickly shocks on the tongue. In all its hoppy, hempy, tropical fruity. greatness, this is an excellent beer, worthy of all of it's high reviews."
"Poured from a bomber into a Goose Island tulip. The pour is quite clear, gold in color, and (if rough) sports an impressive crown of white foam. The nose is nice, but a bit more subdued than I expected. I get sweet notes of fresh bread as well as some lemon."
"On tap at CBC 2016 - day 2. Caramel, apples, pineapple, passion fruit and unripe mango. Delicious beer."
"On tap - piney, bitter and sweet - very apparent that this is a huge beer. Fairly well-balanced beer which can be somewhat difficult to do at 10.5% ABV."
"Had on tap at the brewery. This is a phenomenal DIPA. It's the easiest, smoothest, perfectly hoppy, most drinkable, tropical tasting, hidden ABV, perfectly balanced DIPA I've ever had. As much as I love other beers from FFF, this one is the best I've had. I'm so incredibly impressed. So bummed I missed the bottles because I must have this one again."
FFF Permanent Funeral
"Dark orange color, hazy, piny combined with fruit and bitterness, bold, in your face flavor but they all work well and it is a pretty amazing beer. No sense that its an almost 11% abv."
L: Dark orange. Slight haze
This is 3Floyds (an therefore Indiana's) best IPA. Wish they made it more often and sold 6pks so you could get more than 22 oz at a time. Truly great stuff.
22oz bomber dated late May 2016 poured into tulip.
A - Pours a hazy amber with a one finger creamy white.
A - nice golden to orange/copper amber clear color with a white head that sticks and leaves sparse lacing
Never been crazy enough to stand in line for Dark lord so I have no dog in that fight but this IS the best beer FFF makes. Makes the hype fest known as zombie dust look like crap. Plus this has Citra in it like hype dust. This beer just does it BETTER!
Shiny copper penny colored with a solid inch of creamy off white to beige head on top. Moderate lacing. The aroma is of fiercely bitter citrus hops and light malt. The taste is packed with bitter citrus hops and light malt that barely keeps the aggressive hops in check. There's a massively deep hop burn on the tongue. The mouth is otherwise dry.
"BOD 4/1/16. Clear dark gold / medium amber pour. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention."
Best double ipa I've had.
"I'll start off by saying this is one of the best imperial IPAs I've ever had the pleasure of putting on my palette. Bottled on 01-Apr-2016 and poured into a snifter glass on 11-Apr-2016. Immediately hit with aromas of pineapple and orange zest. Incredible feel along with fruity hop character and almost no bite -- especially for the high ABV. This is all accomplished unlike any other IPA I've tasted. I'll be making the trip back to Indiana for this, no doubt."
"Zombie Dust has a slight edge, albeit VERY slight edge over this wonderful beer. I think the hoppyness is less profound, but yet hits the back of the palette after what seems like an extended amount of time."
"Like all the 3 Floyds a great name and cool label. Poured from a 22 oz bomber purchased at brewery. I was a little disappointed by this one. Pours a hazy orange. Smells of citrus and hops. Taste was a little off, citrus, lemon, lime. Not a bad beer, but not one of the best I have had from 3 Floyds."
"Bottled 2/15/16, poured into a Hopslam snifter. Super cloudy yellow orange, can't even see the carb. Good foam and lacing though. Super dank nose, hops and malt totally in the forefront. Slight zesty citrus note on the scent as well. The taste is a battle between malt and hop. Zesty and citrusy with a surprisingly slight amount of bitterness. Full mouth feel, pretty well-balanced. I'd say it's slightly below Dreadnaught, but an excellent beer nonetheless. Looking forward to trying the two other Double IPAS from them I have on hold at the store."
Poured from bottle dated 2/15/16.
5 month old bottle def not fresh.
22oz bomber poured into a snifter. Bottled on date is 02/15/16.
"One of the best beers I've ever had, I tend to drink it really fast because it tastes awesome! Does not taste like 100 IBU's and 10.5% which is seriously dangerous."
"The beer pours cloudy and golden with a little head and lacing. The smells that I picked up were hoppy, floral, and orange. The taste of the beer is hoppy and floral. The feel of the beer is smooth and it lingers as well. Overall this beer is great, but zombie dust is a little better in my opinion."
Sick artwork on the bottle. Pours an orange-yellow from the bottle. The nose is sweet and piney. The body has a medium sweet maltiness with a faint bitterness.
"In my opinion this is 3floyds' best beer. It is so delicious and has strong fruity flavors (pineapple stands out the most to me). The aroma is also absolutely amazing, nothing compares to this. It is very well balanced and barely seems like it's 100 ibus. Love love love this beer!!!"
Poured at 50°F from a 22oz bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
"This is a beautiful brew with an orange-apricot hue and a dense, uniform 2-finger khaki head leaving spotty lacing."
"Awesome beer and I've had almost all of 3 floyds here in Indiana. Citra hops, malty and nice bitterness all together! If you are a zombie dust or alpha king fan like I am this is a must have!"
"A lot of yellow in this 10% beer, ok ok. Good clarity, just under an inch of head. Good amount of pine flavored hops in this one. I really dig the aroma execution. "
"Surprised of the less than stellar reviews on this one - while it is less complex than you might hope and hasn't perfected the hop-fantasticness of heady topper, I place this in the category just below. I like grapefruit in an IPA and this one is full of it. Fruity and bitter in a great way, I would not trade for this again but would buy the crap out of it locally, or recommend at least trying it once."
Consumed 12/4/15
I thought the three Floyds hype train was crazy after zombie dust. very underwhelmed by zd. Glad I tried this one as its terrific. Second closest beer I've had to north east ipa other than carton 0077xx. 
"Pours hazy golden/slightly dark orange with a one finger head. Smells of grapefruit and peppery hops. Tastes... far worse than I'd have ever guessed. Bitter and hoppy? Sure. Boozy, not subdued at all (in a bad overpowering way), and chalk filled with over peppery/over spicy hops that create an unpleasant mouth-feel. Maybe this was just an awful/really old bottle? Is this totally horrible? No. But it's bad enough I wouldn't even drink a free one if it was offered to me, which is saying a lot."
"Really solid IPA. More than lives up to the hype. What really stands out to me is how easy it is too drink. Not too hoppy or bitter and the grapefruit comes through loud and clear. I think my favorite Three Floyds beer is still Amber Smashed Face, but this is an excellent IPA and I would definitely trade for it again"
"Well, I just dropped a lot of cash on this beer. Was it worth it? No, it most certainly wasn't. Even as a fan of FFFs, I would strongly advise those searching for this beer to stop giving it any deference. While it's good, it's certainly not worth the time, effort, and money to procure this beer. Here goes:"
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 9/22/15. Just bought it last weekend so I wasn't able to try this fresher. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with a couple inch off-white head that stayed around for a very long time. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like citrusy (tropical fruit, mango, citrus peel) and pine hops, along with some bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some candied oranges and dankness. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and a bit creamy with a good amount of carbonation. I thought this was pretty good, I'd like to try it again in the future."
Thanks to Yellek1977 for the trade on this one...
"Bomber. Pours clear deep golden, two finger head fades slowly, great retention and lacing. The aroma is malty, sweet bread combined with some tropical fruitiness. Taste is very malt forward at first with caramel but it doesn't late long. There is a spicy peppery piney resin bitterness that takes over quickly and lasts throughout. Some apricot lingers with the hops. Some alcohol burn there in the end. Mouthfeel is exceptionally full and soft. This is a great DIPA, but very different, understand why it gets such mixed reviews. Full of flavor, but you really need to love a bitter finish to dig it."
"Permanent Funeral was a beer I was after for a long time… Eventually got my hands on one a few months ago and was ecstatic. Unfortunately, I wasn’t all that impressed with it. I didn’t review it at the time as I figured I needed a second go at it before really judging it in case of improper storage and such. I had it again on tap this past week and was able to give it another whirl…"
From the source of course.
"22oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy burnt golden with a fluffy eggshell white head that doesn't fall leaving great retention and very sticky lacing. Looks very good. The aromas are disappointing. Very faint. Smells like an old IPA. Tons of orange and lots of malts. Lots of bread. The flavors are full of citrus and caramel malts. Syrupy. Some pine resin. Subtle spiciness. Some black pepper in the finish. Not really bitter. Meh. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied and very creamy with active carbonation. Alcohol goes unnoticed, although it's sweet and warm."
"Legs on a DIPA--a sure sign of double-digit ABV. Fruity nose, with tropical notes backed up by lemongrass and pink grapefruit. Feels richly decadent in the mouth, with a full body made for swirling around. The tropical fruit gives way on the tongue to the grapefruit and pomelo pith, an intense bitterness somewhat balanced by syrupy undertones. A bit of papaya and apricot reemerges as the beer warms, and a bit of malt tentatively raises a hand to wave hello, but by that point, your palate is likely passed out on Scott's couch."
"Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub. Pours a hazy medium orange with a white head that leaves spotty lacing. The haze fades a it warms a bit, leaving a crystal clear brew."
Bottled 9/22/15
"Look - A beautiful honey color, slight haze, awesome sticky lacing "
"Bottle into a tulip. Vibrant golden in color with a nice snow-white head. Citrus, pine resin, grapefruit, mango, and orange peel on the nose. Medium weight and very, very smooth for being north of 10%. Piney, hoppy resin on the taste along with juicy grapefruit, orange, and mangos. Just an outstandingly well-balanced beer. I can't believe this beer is 10.5%."
"I may have found my new favorite here. Citrus, pine and malt all come together here for a very tasty brew. Carbonation is perfect. This goes down very smoothly for the ABV, and could get me into trouble."
Another GABF 2015 sample 
the line was really long at gabf but they had this and zombie dust on tap so no way i was not waiting. and it was well worth it. smelled so good and tasted even better
"Permanent Funeral September 22 enjoyed September 26, 2015 in a pint glass."
Had from a bomber.
"Pop the top and let the Dreadnaught colored beer flow. Pours a darker yellow, good amount of clarity to it, soft 1/2"" head on it, looks good, looks solid, reliable. Aroma wafts up in yo face, pine is heavy."
The best DIPA I have ever tasted
A delicious double IPA. Subtle citrus flavor at first but expands as it warms. Let this one warm up a little in the glass. Some booziness but really smooth. Prolly the best FFF IPA.
White head with lace. Food retention. Golden orange color.
"This checks all the right boxes. Absolutely big, glorious mango, citrus, and pine to tickle the hop hungry like myself. It carries a wallet but goes down as smooth as a beer half its size."
Just a really great Pale Ale. Probably my favorite of the 3F beers I've tried.
Bottle into snifter.
"The last of my IPAs. Now I can get back to drinking REAL beer. I kid, I kid. 22 oz. bottle into a tulip."
By far one of my favorite beers form one of my favorite breweries. Great Job 3 F's.
"On tap at the brewpub in Indiana. Dry, spicy, malty. Peppery finish. Feels like licking resin. Aggressive, but also one-dimensional. Drinkable despite the 10% ABV and some nice, fresh aromas of tropical fruit and mango.. but really not that interesting."
"Pours medium amber color with only a bit of head after an aggressive pour. Smell leads with grapefruit only a bit more bitter, and a sweet malty flavor comes in next, with a bit of burnt toffee. Tastes much the same way, with a surprisingly mild bitterness that makes me question the 100 IBU measurement, but that always seems subjective to me anyway. Nice rich, heavy mouthfeel lets the flavor stick around for a while, which is totally a good thing, and not too much carbonation so it's sorta soothing as it goes down. Overall, pretty juicy, well balanced, startlingly light for a high-octane pale ale (and thank you for not writing IPA on the label!) whose power sneaks up on you."
"Too malty. High abv is hidden by the flavor, but not my thing really. Glad to try it, but one and done on this beer."
Bottle is one week old and poured into my Hopslam tulip glass.
"Absolutely incredible. Usually collaborations are kind of gimmicky but Permanent Funeral defies all expectations. In my opinion, Permanent Funeral is better than Zombie Dust by inundating your palate with fruitful hops. Furthermore, the high ABV is well masked by the balance of the sweet and bitterness. Cheers!"
"I am a little confused on this one. It's a 100 IBU beer, so I expected tons of hoppy fruity notes on the nose and lots of hoppy bitterness on the finish. I didn't really get either. The nose was pretty basic and the taste was more like an APA. I felt like I got more booze taste than hops."
A clear golden color with a nice off-white head and good rentention. Big citrus (Orange and grapefruit) and pine resin aroma. Flavor follows closely with a nice malty sweetness to provide great balance and smoothness. Finished very clean with alcohol completely hidden. A great big IPA from 3 Floyds.
"This beer smells great; the taste is a little bit less impressive. Overly malty, as is typical of Midwest IPA's, and a bit too sweet for my liking but still a solid brew."
Very good color smell and taste. It's almost to drinkable for the higher abv.
"Big citrus nose followed by an incredible juicy taste on the front end with lingering bitterness in the back. The malt strikes very hard, but is balanced very well by the hop forward taste. Another winner from FFF"
"Pours a sunny yellow color, clear, with a froth, very stable, big head."
Pours a light amber / orangy color. Has a huge hop aroma with a sweet fruity presence. Has a great citrusy fruity hop flavor. Leaves a nice pine after taste and a nice finish. Definitely a great beers.
"Scent of sugar, pine, tropical fruit, citrus and a hint of lemon rind. Flavors of sugar, tropical fruit, resin, lemon rind, light caramel and star fruit. Not bad, too sweet."
Picked up a case of this at 3 Floyds. Bottled 8-12-15 and enjoyed on the same day in my All Day IPA can glass
The look and smell of this are out of this world. Pineapple all over the place. Get a huge juicy taste on the front with some burn on the back (to be expected of a beer named Permanent Funeral). Definitely worth seeking out and trying.
"No bottle date, but purchased 6wks ago."
"Lots of pineapple/tropical fruit. A bit more boozy than I would like, but the texture is divine. Seemed lacking on aroma."
Great flavor and an overall great IPA.
"I must have gotten a stale bomber. Because the majority of reviews I read made this sound like I was going to love this beer.. Citrus, pine, hoppy all of that usually equals a beer I love. This lacked all of that. Instead it was overly malty and stale tasting. I'll have to try this one again hopefully fresher and/or on tap. "
I'm enjoying this very good beer but don't agree with those who call it great. Not even in my Top 5 of 3 Floyds beers.
PF & KBS are the two best beers I have drank.
"Picked this one up at 1000 Liquors during the 2015 AAA National Instructor's Seminar. 22oz. bottle served in a Three Floyds Teku at 47 degrees. Pours a dull burnt orange hue with a hazy clarity and a frothy, 1.5 inch, cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a rocky, half inch cap with textured swaths and bands of lacing present during the tasting. Great nose on this beer - citrus and tropical fruit as well as a hint of grapefruit pith and a slight candied quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, heavy on the malt profile and candied quality with a slight kiss of ethanol towards the backend and a light, residual medicinal character at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to medium) with a slightly oily texture and a mild carbonation. Overall, very good; however, I'd prefer a little less malt to the body and slightly more carbonation. That said, a very nice brew if you have the opportunity to try it."
"I thought I had reviewed this but apparently not. It's going to be biased since I love FFF, and this is my favorite style and has basically reached god status with me."
Looks: light hazy orange with small floating sediments with nice slow head. 
"Super thick, off white head. Plenty of hops on the nose, but the citrusy hops explode in taste. Supremely full bodied, silky, and smooth for a DIPA. Plainly said, just delicious."
One of the best double IPAs I've ever had on tap. Enjoying this on tap at Three Floyd's brewpub.
"An incredible offering. One of FFF best of this style. Hard to find, but when its released. Go for it. Definitely a hop lovers beer to the extreme. I will look for this again."
Nothing I could write could do this brew justice. Go find this one now.
"Juicy, great hops, I expect greatness, as far as hop presence goes, from FFF and this one has that excellent technique in highlighting the hops that you would expect from them. The malt presence, which is more of my personal preference, keeps it from being a true classic in my book."
"reminded me of Tree House Julius as it was juicy as hell. I enjoyed this more than Julius as it carried the ABV throughout the drink. citrus hop deliciousness from start to finish. Pineapple exploded as the brew warmed. Smell was deceiving, as it originally smelled like Malt Bomb and was very deceiving."
One of the best from 3 Floyd's
Look: Great look. Solid orange body the sun cannot even penetrate. Clingy white head. Combination of bubble sizes. The curtains on this one melt very slow. Layers of fine lace. This has to be one of the best looking Imperial/DIPAs I have ever seen. Abner is up there as well.
Nice fresh citrusy hop smell. Grapefruit and dank hops hit you first but are followed quickly by a ton of sweetness. Can think of plenty of DIPAs I would take over this.
"Pours a hazy orange with a dense white head. A pure unfiltered look. Monster citra hop aroma: orange peel, mango, tangerine, papaya. Juicy and tropical. Taste is well balanced with robust hops and bitterness, but a chewy, creamy, bready malt base. The initial wave of flavor is refreshing and spot on. "
22 ounce bottle into both a snifter and teku.
Had on tap several times. A nice fruit-forward IPA. More fruity than what the spiciness I get from Dreadnaught.
This is an awesome beer
A - looks as good as it can get
Nice balance. Malty sweetness and citra hops.
"Why this beer gets 100 on BeerAdvocate is beyond me. this beer tastes stale and oxidized, cloying with the malt, and I drank a fresh bottle! (only 3 weeks old). 3Floyds is just not good with IPAs. Stouts yes, but their IPAs suck. they need to learn how to brew a new age IPA like New England."
22 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.
my favorite DIPA from FFF
"Poured cold into a tulip glass. Bottled on 11/12/14, consumed on 12/19/14."
Intense ipa! really nice fruit flavor with a bunch of hops
3.75/4.25/3.75/4/4.25
Enjoyed at Hunahpu's Day 2015 at Cigar City Brewery.
Seriously the nose on this..
The single best double/imperial IPA I have ever had.
One of my all time favorites!
"I think the label design is actually better than the beer. This is a perfect example of a beer that is overrated because it comes from a trusted brewery. Love 3 Floyds, but there's no way that this brew deserves a Top spot."
"At Huna '15 this was an incredibly delicious IPA. I had this right after drinking heady. Less orange/peach but more body, better aroma, and all around better IPA for my money."
Good into one with a friend last night thanks to a trade. Poured from the bomber into a Teku glass.
If you have it fresh (in my case bottled 6/24/15 and I enjoyed on 7/9/15) this is DIPA perfection.
"On tap at FFF. Beautiful looking beer. Hazy orange, off-white head, moderate lacing. Nose is full of tropical goodness. Taste has strong notes of tangerine and mango, minimal bitterness, and has great overall balance. Love this beer.....possibly the best DIPA I've had."
"I could drink this every day. Absolutely one of the best beers I have ever had. The heavy fruity, citrusy taste, mixed with a light bitterness is what I look for in a IPA/DIPA. You can't go wrong with this one!"
Pours a hazy honey golden orange with quite a bit of solids in suspension with a thin layer of off-white foam.
"On tap at FFF brewpub poured into half pint. Appearance is that typical Floyd’s slightly hazy orange-copper color with an internal radiance that may have been fueled by my excitement that they re-tapped this beer after running out of one of their guest handles. A thin off-white cap remains in place for the duration and leaves rings. Aroma is tropical fruit, pineapple, orange, grapefruit peel, resin, pine, and caramel. Taste is medium citrus hop bitterness trailed by light malt sweetness. Medium bodied, oily and syrup thick texture, average to soft carbonation, finishes dry and bitter."
"I've had this 100 times, whether via draft at Three Floyd's Pub or bomber, and I love it. BUT.... this is the only beer that made me and my dad look each other in the eye and say ""wow, this is the best beer ever"", upon having our first sip together."
"Aroma is outstanding in this beer, lots of juicy peach with some nice citrus, and some really dank pine to it. Flavor doesnt follow through though, very sweet and unbalanced."
"On tap at the brewery w/ a cheese plate, girlfriend beside me, and nowhere else to go on a rainy August night. I don't know if I've ever enjoyed a beer more; perhaps the only instance close to this may have been trying Sip of Sunshine on tap at Prohibition Pig in Vermont - though the awesomeness of that is so much less in your face compared to what you get at 3 Floyds."
"BRUTAL label, love everything about this beer. I'm a floyds fanboy and this is why. Zombie on steroids? Drink it fresh."
22oz bottle poured into can glass
Outstanding brew! Absolutely one of my favorite Double IPA's. Excellent!
"Great tasting, perhaps the best beer I've ever had"
"had on draft at mikellers bar in denmark, great beer"
Phenomenal tasting beer worthy of a world class rating!
Thanks so much to ErikO60102 for hooking me up with this big want of mine! Poured into a Haw River Farmhouse Ales teku glass. Bottleneck says 01/14/2015.
I really liked this beer.
The strong alcohol content gets lost in the awesome hops that blend piney/earthy flavor and citrus. FFF gets it right with a lot of hop forward beers and Permanent Funeral is my favorite of them all
A: slightly dark amber with some cloudyness. Poured a nice white head and very good lacing
"Tasted on January 23, 2015 in a 12 oz snifter from draft at Firkin. Tasted on March 6, 2016 in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bomber bottled on 2-15-16. Tasted on April 21, 2017 in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bomber bottled on 4-11-17. Described and labeled as a pale ale by 3 Floyds. Look is cloudy honey amber with a thick off-white head that dissipates into thin foam and leaves thick lingering lacing. Smell is apricot, grapefruit, mango, papaya, peach, pineapple, tangerine, bitter hops with bread and caramel malt aromas. Taste is a reflection of the nose with subtle bitter hop and sweet caramel and biscuit malt flavors. Feel is medium to full in body that is smooth, creamy and somewhat dry in the finish."
Again big thanks to bstyles for hooking me up with more super fresh bottles!
Wayyy too boozy for me.

FFF third best IPA offering after Zombie Dust and Space Cake Middle Finger
On tap at the 3 Floyds brewpub
yes.... so great.. so fresh... thank god I got this finally
By far the best three floyds has to offer!!
Not my favorite. Too sweet for me
Poured from bomber into Teku glass.
PIG FUCKING DESTROYER!!!!!!! Need i say more?
"2014 vintage, very fresh. Poured light and very good head retention. Loved all the flavors, smoothness, and balance with this beer. Another solid offering from FFF"
Poured from a bomber into a tulip
"Been trying to get this for SO long. Had the likes of Heady, Double Sunshine, King Sue, Abner, etc. Needed this to say I have tried some of the best DIPAs out there. "
"This was pretty good, but I found it overly sweet, and with some downright weird flavors (that I've gotten in other hoppy FFF beers) that I just don't really love. Decent, but I'd never pick this up with the wealth of other options available."
"Essentially this is like an Imperial version of zombie dust. Seeing that ZD is my fave brew ever, I am crazy about this one. An amazing nose on this one and the taste follows right behind. Truly world class."
I am not quite as knowledgeable as some but I know what I like. So do my bartenders Joel and Nick at Bigbys Pour House in Addison Illinois. Most times I walk in and a beer just appears. The past two days it has been Permanent Funeral. the beer is served in a small glass due to the 10.5% ABV. This fine brew does not taste like or go down like some of the higher ABV brews. It has a very nice carmel color and the head lingers a while. While it is a Double/Imperial IPA and I would have not chosen this initially believing that it would be strong and all hopped up it was DELICIOUS!! One of my favorites the past two months. Give it try.
Pours a golden amber. Clear. Beige Lacey for me to finger head. Aroma! A mess of hops. Citrus fruits! Complex taste. Lemon. Oranges. Tropical over ripe fruits. High alcohol. Delicious beer.
I wish I had 365 more of these
Quick review here.
Smoking good
Was able to drink this bottle when it was only 7 days old. 
"Sweet tropical candied hops, so very delicious!"
On tap at the Holy Grale in Louisville
Poured from a bomber into snifter.
"Look: Transparent golden with a finger white head and minimal legs. Mild carbonation. Smell: Big citrus hops on the nose with hints of peach, apricot, pineapple, green apple, and slight honey malt. Smells Fantastic! "
A: slight haze orange Neon glow to it 
"yup, its real, a double pale ale as they call it, and maybe the best beer i have had from the acclaimed three floyds. this stuff is magic, rich in grain base without ever being sweet. almost has the base of an esb, a huge one, but its in that range. the point here though is the hops, and its really hoppy. in the smell i am thinking simcoe, its so bitter smelling, green and leafy and crystalline, like the sticky dankest bud, where the fingers get all stuck like super glue. the nose is the hop equivalent of trimming blue dream plants, no joke. the flavor is less of that, more refined aggression if you will. the hops are woody here, more centennial like fundamentally, but so overdosed as to not be recognizable as their normal selves. the malt does in fact provide a cool balance to all the hops, which was unsuspected. it almost seems light for a second in the middle there, where the hops are more fruity than anything and the grain is at its fullest, but the bitterness returns to thrash the palate in the finish, its really intensely flavored stuff, but well put together. i have gone back and forth on whether or not the hype around this brewery is fairly founded, and this may have tipped me into thinking it is. really unique and enormous beer."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Thanks, Shannon."
This beer is so smooth for 100 IBU year beer and 10.5 ABV. I didn't research this before I drank it. I simply poured my glass full and started enjoying it. I thought it was rather smooth with a slight bit of heat to it that I knew was a higher ABV. I drank the bomber in a little less than an hour. 
"Bottle in trade from Joe. Thanks buddy! Been wanting to try this one for a while now. Bottle dated 8/20/14 poured 9/11/14. Pours very slightly hazy golden orange colored with a huge creamy and fluffy white head. Aroma is big time juicy citrus hops, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, grass, sweet malt and very reminiscent of Dreadnaught (though it's been a while since I had that one). Flavor is big on the dry pine bitterness with sweet mango and grapefruits, some sweet malt backing but this is much lighter than expected. Lingering dry bitterness on the tongue. This seems to bridge the gap of the super bitter and the sweet tropical malty DIPA extremes and comes off very nicely. Medium plus bodied, very resinous, dry finish, with medium carbonation. This is excellent."
Part of a beer share. This brew followed La Cumbre's Full Nelson DIPA. 
Had on draft at La Margarita in Indianapolis. Excellent beer would have given it 5 if it wasn't for the alcohol coming through a little bit. This is my 2nd favorite beer from Three Floyds behind Zombie Dust
"Had this from both bottle and draft, but I just had the bottle last night so I'll base things on that."
Review taken from notes mid May 2014. Bottle was given to me from my friend Matt who attended Dark Lord Day 2014 where he got it from. So it was very fresh.
Draft at Mikkeller
I love 3-F's but I had never heard of this but I figures why not but at $15 for a pale ale I thought it was a gamble. Turns out I hit the full on beer jackpot!
"As you might guess from the specs this is a very big body IPA. It is definitely typical of 3 Floyd's having the same hop and yeast characteristics, just more in this case."
1799th Review on BA
"22oz bottle into pint glass. Bottled in December, drank in June. I wish this was FRESH, but I am so happy I got it!"
Big thanks to chidave!
Holy shit! I cannot how believe how much of a grapefruit bomb this beer is and how light bodied it is for 10.5% ABV! I am sure their must be a good deal of corn sugar in here to make it this light but the way it is used is exceptional.
22oz bottle (bottled 3/6/14) poured into a Duvel tulip.
Poured from a bomber into a Jester King goblet.
FFF are a bunch of wizards. I really love this beer. My favorite DIPA on the market.
"I was lucky enough to purchase a case of bombers from DLD this year. I bought it after a small taste of a guy that was in line at the beer kiosk! Holy moly, this beer is awesome. I really like ZD, but PF is just flat out AMAZING!"
"Had this one on tap at the 3Floyds taproom. Poured a light orange, hazy, with a decent sized white head. Hop-forward aroma, which gave way to a very well blended DIPA. The malt comes through with a sweeter, caramel flavor to balance the slight bitterness from the hops. Overall, well balanced and delicious. Glad I could try it fresh from the source!"
Shared bottle poured into snifter
"Acquired in a trade with oldschool9, thanks bud!"
This is by the perfect beer for me. The smell and the taste is just amazing. I love the thick body for the beer. You can't even tell the high 10.5 abv. This beer is not always available at the brewpub and I really wish it was. Well actually not cause I would go broke cause I would always keep my fride full.
"Dank, dank dank hops in every aspect of this great beer. Cloudy hoppy golden appearance. Hop smells waft out of the glass with pine, citrus and some bready aspects from the malts. Flavor profile follow suit with a huge punch of wonderfully balanced hops and malts. Just a great beer from FFF. Thrilled to have picked up a case."
Served – Bottle poured into an IPA glass 4 days after bottling.
"A-Cloudy deep yellow orange, one finger head that tries to leave some lacing."
Appearance: A glorious gamboge/amber head with an isabelline/ivory head.
"Been anticipating this one for a long time. Appearance is exactly what I want in a dipa, beautiful hazy copper orange. Less nose than I expected, could pick up some grapefruit and pine but not overwhelming. At first was slightly disappointed. Seemed a bit unrefined and bitter. After sitting for five minutes and warming up the citrus starts to come out and evens out. Half way through bottle it was what I had hoped for. Overall a wonderful dipa and worthy of its rating. Definitely not an everyday beer or for faint of heart but one I hope to secure again in the future."
Look: Medium orange colored with a thick white foam that sticks around the glass the entire time.
"Bottle acquired in trade. Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Appearance is beautiful, cloudy, murky orange/amber haze. One-inch thick white, fluffy head which dissipated gradually to persistent white collar, with ample tiny bubbles and lots of very sticky lacing throughout. The nose is incredibly pungent, yielding a malty citrus/mango/banana/pineapple & piney scent. Sadly, the impression on the palate does not quite match the promising nose, as the malts and heat from the alcohol tend to overwhelm. Mouthfeel is nice, full and supple, with appropriate carbonation."
A: Pours a glowing orange color with just a touch of haze. A really nice one finger cream colored head shows good retention and gives some nice lace. 
22oz bomber poured into teku.
The beer comes in a hazy golden orange.
Bottled 4-Mar-14
A-Pours a rather bright copper color. Body is hazy. Head is a coating of white foam. Laces sporadically. 
Drank on-tap
A: Pours a burnt orange color with a three finger white head that dissipates slowly. Very good lacing and active body.
"Fresh bottle (less than a month old) poured into a tulip glass. Track one from Pig Destroyer's album Book Burner playing. The color is a beautiful light orange brown and retained less than a finger of head for a few minutes. Robust lacing. Gorgeous. At refrigerator temperature, I just got a nose full of grapefruit and assorted citrus, but as the beer warmed and the smell developed, I got a distinct sense of pepper to balance out the sweeter citrus. The Diplomat, track five playing. This really does taste like a heavier Zombie Dust, but still feels refreshing in the mouth, which is surprising. It's not heavy at all, unlike track 10, Baltimore Strangler. It's a concise sip: pepper, citrus, crisp finish, all in rapid succession. All in all, an incredible beer. I wish I had picked up more than just one of these when I saw it in the shop. "
Poured from bottle into tulip glass. 
A beautiful looking beer: a slightly burnt bright orange. A nice but not overpowering piney-citrus scent and a big oily mouthfeel. Upfront the taste is intense: pungently hoppy with a grapefruit orange flavor. But I found the finish just a bit bland. Nice no doubt but not as powerful as I expected.
"A - Golden orange hue, perfect color for a DIPA"
A - Frothy white head several fingers high. Great head retention and lacing. Pours a golden orange. 
"What a perfect DIPA! Had it on-tap in a tall pint glass in Perrysburg, Ohio at Swig. Thank you Three Floyd's and thank you Swig. At $9 a pint, I decided to switch to the much less expensive Ballast Point Sculpin after that. Might as well have had a Bud. Just couldn't taste the Sculpin after that amazing hop blast from 3F."
Received this beast from my buddy Scott in person. Poured from a bomber into my Stone goblet...
"Pour is a hazed dark amber with a tight off white head. Nose is piney hops, resin, notes of orange peel, and an underlying grain. Taste is not overly hoppy, a bit of balance with the hops bringing pine and a hint of hop resin. The citrus comes in in back, strong orange and a touch of orange juice. Finish is very dry, gently carbonated with a soft body."
22oz Bomber
A - Cloudy darker amber that starts with a 1/2 finger head and dissipates to a spotty thin foam fairly quickly.
"Poured from a ""bomber"" bottle into a goblet."

Pours out a hazy burnt orange to yellow with one finger of suds that leave lacing around the pint glass. The small bubbles stay with the pour throughout the sipping process.

good lord this is a good beer!
Tap pour into a tulip.
"Had this for the second time on draft at the Three Floyds tap takeover at Tap on Main. I had rated this beer before but was unable to give it a proper review due to the setting. This time I was able to stop and take some notes, so here we go."
"Luminous orange color. Fragrant pine and mango on the nose. This is sticky, gooey, luscious hop business from start to finish. It's humid and tropical up in here -- just like you want a DIPA. The hops bite nice, but the malt rounds things off perfectly. This is extremely well balanced. A delightful beer, but falls just short of the hype for me. It may be the freshness factor: My bottle was 1.5 months old. I would definitely reevaluate with a slightly fresher offering."
"On tap at the BavarIan Lodge - Lisle, IL"
"A - Pours a clean, dark orange color with a robust, persistent off-white head that laces like crazy."
"Smells faintly of peaches and other dark fruits. Mango & grapefruit taste dominate. Heavy malt backbone , which eventually smother the other flavors. Definitely a summer beer, kin to a double ipa in my book."
I used to really enjoy this beer but I don't think these big sweeter high alcohol hoppy beers are my thing
"This is definitely a big beer, but what I really like about it is the strong malt backbone that can hold up to the gush of citrusy hops. This beer pours a hazy orange with a serious head that sticks to the glass leaving behind a gluelike crust as you drink. Big citrus aromas with a citrusy taste held in check by a caramel malt keeping this big beer from wrecking your palate. This brew only got better on the second pour from the bomber. Plenty of hoppy flavor without too much bitterness. FFF hit the nail on the head with this one."
Thanks to GRG1313 for sharing this one at his tasting. 
"Pours a fairly clear copper with a lingering, dense cream head that leaves sheets of lacing as it dissipates."
Poured into an oversized wine glass
12/13/13 bottling date. into a snifter
"This has a super clean and clear facade as it supports a billowing, bright white cloud of foam."
"A: Pours a very clear golden color with a huge white, frothy head. Nice lacing"
"Bottle from Fusebuddy. Arrived on my door step very cold. Sat in the fridge a couple days to thaw any potential slush. Poured into a Prohibition Pig tulip glass. Bottle date 12/13/12, drank on 1/5/14."
Bottle dated 12/13/13. 
"Bottling date is illegible, but I think it’s from the 12/13/13 release. Tulip glass."
"Poured cold, crisp, clean and copper to a 17oz Heady Topper stemless glass with a full finger, short lasting white head, leaving a full sheet of lace to the rim."
A- very clear golden body with great lacing. Minimal head. 
"Not much of a head on a very clear golden copper body but has excellent lacing. Aroma of wet socks, onion, vinegar, caramel and sour citrus. Flavor of tart citrus, vinegar, candy sugar, pale malts, wood and earthy hops. Medium but oily body and moderate carbonation. I have to say I am disappointed. I don't know everything about beers but how is this so highly reviewed? Is it bad, no. Is it amazing? No. Glad I had it, but I will only remember this as being disappointing."
poured 22oz bottle into Teku. Bottled on date 12/13/2013. 
"Poured a rich, deep amber with white head of very fine bubbles, persistent creamy and frothy. Aroma of citrus and piney hops evident even from a distance. Robust spicy tones from hops and malts. Beautifully sweet on the palate, balanced by just enough bitterness...again, piney, slight citrus, over-ripe papaya. Complex malt profile, some aromatic malt, and I swear a hint of rye. Finishes strong, tingling with a pleasant lingering residue that is not entirely bitter, nor sweet, nor alcoholic. Better when 50-55F than cold, IMO."
"22 oz. bottle, with bottled on date 12/13/2013 printed on the side of the bottle. Bravo to Three Floyds for finally bottle dating their beers. Exponentially stoked to finally have this beer, as I have wanted it for a while."
bottled on 12/13/2013. Picked up at the brew pub after the 4 Elf release on saturday night.
"Received in a trade, poured into my Duvel tulip."
"Bottle opened on a ""Piggy brewing night"". Needed a Pig destroyer to start the whole thing!"
"Pours a bright orange color with thick white head. Good retention and lacing. Lots of tropical fruit on the nose -pineapple, mango, guava with hints of citrus - mostly orange and grapefruit. Sweet carmel notes as well. Taste is amazing - bright citrus with some resinous pine that melds into a nice carmel bready malt backbone that finishes slightly bitter and juicy. Even though this beer clocks in at 10.5% abv, there is no overt alcohol warming. "
A huge thank you to Sean for sending me this bottle.
"Appears a glowing orange copper hue with a big khaki tan beige head forming thick with a rocky textured head, fine speckled lacing layers on the sides of my chalice. Aroma is straight up citrus peels, pineapple flesh, and other tropical fruit notes flowing from the glass. So worth the drive to Newark, OH to try the last of their stock of this fine American brewed IPA. I don't know the next time I will see this beer but I will definitely savor this pour of 22 ounces of liquid bread coated hop candy. The flavor is sugar coated raw herbaceous hops, big citric layers, orange marmalade, tropical fruits...mango, star fruit, and hints of passion fruit. Over ripened fruit juice with bready malts bring all the caramelized sugars to the forefront and the big oily hop oils let those sweet candy qualities fade to the background. Mouthfeel is big oily resinous IPA, carbonated well carries each sip effortless down the gullet, to equate to perfect realm of dangerous drinkability. I can't talk enough about how much I enjoy this beer, all of the true hopheads listening go find this, drive 6-8 hrs if you have to, hell make a pilgrimage to the brewery. I might even start listening to metal if Pig Destroyer had a hand in the collaborative creation of this liquid beauty."
on-tap @ the brewery
Serving Type - 22 oz Bottle
"Aroma is not overwelming, which to me means this is not dry hopped with Citra like many other DIPAS. Just hints of citrus, some pine."
"A-amber color just slightly less than clear. Initial 1"" head from a vigerous pour and continual lacing that clings perfectly down for the remainder of the bottle."
Another fantastic beer thanks to totalbangover.
Poured clear dark golden color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Heavy complex citrus and earth hop aroma. Medium to full body with slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy smooth bittersweet flavor with a heavy bittersweet finish of Moderate to long duration.
This is the perfect beer. From the second I poured it you can smell the grapefruit. I split a bottle with my wife (who hates IPAs). She was blown away by it. The best I've ever had hands down. There's no way this is 10.5 abv. There's not a single hint of alcohol in it. Just liquid gold.
"A - looks perfect to me. Deep, clouded copper color color with a finger of dense light tan head. Retention is fantastic, lacing is entirely covering the glass. 5"
"I had this at the brewery in a tulip glass. Holy crap is this stuff good. Total ultra smooth hoptastic bomb. This is the only beer I have had lately that I would compare (seriously) to Pliny the Elder. I would not be suprised if this got onto the top 250 in a hurry. I had 2 of these at the brewery and made sure I had a dozen in my trunk before I left. Dark redish brown appearance, floral hopiness and sweet smell, wonderful flavors abound with a perfect balance of sweet and hop with a long lasting piney flavor that sticks around for a while. I though it held up well in the bottles I have had as well. Tasty stuff folks, get one if you can."
Bomber poured into Spiegelau glass. 
22oz bottle bought at the brewery about a week ago. 30920E0010042 appears to be the bottle code.
22oz Bomber (love the label) poured into Spiegelau Tulip. 
"Had on draft at the brewery last week, and picked up a couple bombers on the way out. The draft version was quite good, but this bottle is extraordinary."
Pours a deep amber color. The bottle was opened then recapped so the head is not there but the serving at the brewery had a nice white cap with good lacing.
Bottle (2013)
"Was thrilled to find a bottle of this at Square Bar in Chicago. Beautiful color, amazing bottle art, but man the taste left much to be desired. An overwhelming bitter aftertaste that did not live up to the hype. For those worried they will never get to try this now retired beer, you're really not missing out."
"A sensory overload of sweet tropical hops against a sturdy malt structure. This goes up against Pliny, Heady and the other titans and maybe it wins. A band collaboration now discontinued and allegedly never to return. Bring it back as Double Zombie Dust."
"Shared by Liam a little while back, reviewed from notes"
"Tap at Paradiso. Pours a clear bright as hell neon orange. Weaker white foam. Weak swathes of lace. Nose is a bit skunky, some prominent cat pee, very dense dried pineapple and dried papaya. Stickier, tropical. Taste is melon heavy, lots of thick mango and cantaloupe. Palate is dense, lightly nutty and spicy. Mild tannic bitterness. Not very buoyant or quenching. But still yummy with a big focus on aroma hops typical to FFF. Noticeable spicy alcohol after 3 or 4 sips. 8/3/7/4/15=3.7"
22oz bottle poured into a FFF pint glass
A - Pours a very cloudy orange with hints of golden color and a one finger eggshell colored head.
"Another beer that looks eerily similar and tastes eerily similar to Dreadnaught. Pours a yellow color with ample clarity, soft white 3/5"" head. Very good aroma, definitely hits the pine scents well, plenty aromatic, they really waft high up out the bottle and pint glass."
A: Poured a hazy burnt orangish-yellow with good carbonation leaving behind a nice billowing white cap and some spotty lacing
"a clean golden/copper pour with a perfect 2 fingers of fluffy white head releasing a great amount of sticky thick lacing. tons of visible carbonation. the smell is straight up citrusy and sweet. tons of grapefruit aroma, west coast piney hops, caramel, honey.. WOW this is amazing."
Really hope they make this again some day. Maybe my favorite mega IPA ever. Went to the brewery on 6/14/2013 and they didn't have any more of this one and I was crushed. Ended up finding a bar that was selling them by the bomber and drank two of them.
Bomber into a FFF teku. The brew appearsa hazed copper color with a yellowish stained froth. 3 fingers atop fade leaving a spotty lace pattern on the glass. More than a finger remains throughout the duration.
A-hazy orange amber color with a nice off-white head and good retentive lacing
Pours a cloudy orange amber color with a 1 finger off white head that retains nicely.
"This beer's basically double Zombie Dust. So, if you like ZD, you'll probably like this. It's got all the tropical flavors you're accustomed to in a citra hopped beer, plus some kind of sweet corn thing going on (sometimes). "
"We crack a bottle, pouring a brew of dusky golden orange into our Great Lakes pints. It holds a two and a half finger head of cakey whitish bubbles, showing great retention as they bubble away slowly like a stew. A thick sheet of lacing is left as it goes. A chill haze cuts clarity, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be active. The nose is just as bright and juicy as you would expect from any of the other dynamite pales they churn out, with crushed citric and grapefruity hop freshness, and floral, nectary, and lightly earthy hops to add sweetness and to balance. Mixing are notes of toasty pale malts, burning phenolic chemicals, raw booziness, potato starchiness, under ripe strawberries, tangerine and pineapple juiciness, sticky honeys, chalky yeast, coppery and light soured candy tartness. With warmth comes a brush of coppery metallics. Our first impression is that this beer is juicy as hell, as you would expect from the nose, but it remains in keeping with the “pale ale” style, with exemplary forwardness of the malts and freshness up the wazoo. As we sip, the taste opens with crisp pale malty goodness, massively juicy grapefruity and herbal hop bite, phenolic plastics and fusel booze, honey sweetness, white sugar, grassy earthiness, and salty pretzel doughiness. The peak comes with light piney resin, orange flesh, pineapple, and mango fruitiness, with earthy and herbal hop bitterness, black pepper grind, gravel, root and dirt, crisp pale malts, milky creaminess, slick metallics, and light sea salts. The finishing wash comes with revival of that boozy punch, massive dried mango sugars, coppery yeast, black pepper, juicy pineapple and tangerine, musky and earthy essence, and mineral. The aftertaste breathes of greenstick resins, barky earthiness, citric rind, corn husk, pale malt and straw dryness, green grape fruitiness, roasted apple sweetness, mustiness, and those airy citric and herbal hops. The body is medium but a bit syrupy, and the carbonation is medium but frothy. Each sip gives soft smack, lip, cream, foam, slurp, and finishing pop. The mouth is coated with silkiness, dripping wet into the softest pucker and light chalky astringency. The abv is surprising, but well hidden, and the beer drinks insanely well."
"pours golden straw color, nearly perfectly clear. appealing white head recedes to leave some lacing. Looks like everything you could want from the style."
"Did Raul do it? Yes he did! Call the ER, Raul might be having a stroke! Permanent Funeral? More like ultimate ecstasy! Well, too much ecstasy might lead Raul to a Permanent Funeral, but for more of this bad boi... woo doggy!"
massive thanks to Sleuthdog for this one!
I had this at Dark Lord Day 2013 and made sure I grabbed a few bottles. I would love to see the good people at FFF make the a permanent fixture on the menu.
"Clear golden orange with a huge soapy bright white head and tons of lace with decent retention. Huge citrus! Bright, vibrant, piney, pungent, sharp hops. Massive citrus in the taste. This one doesn't hide the hops, as expected. It's definitely a hop bomb but it isn't overwhelming. Highlights the beauty of the hops used. Dry, pungent, resiny, delicious. That's all. This is all Three Floyd's."
"Hazy glowing golden orange with a cap of khaki foam, excellent lacing. Smells of mangos, oranges, pine and a little sweetness. Taste tangerines, pine resin, citric pith, papaya, light caramel malt, moderate bitterness, juicy. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, medium weight, very nice. Overall- delicious."
"This arrived via aasher today, just ahead of my birthday. Thank you as always, Al, for the fantastic array of beers! Initially thought this was a Pale Ale but doing a little web searching steers me towards DIPA instead. Putting away my Three Floyds pint glass in favor of a Delirium Tremens tulip. There's a very slight haze cutting through the orange liquid and a frothy cap of white foam sits up top, about 2 fingers tall. Good retention and lacing. Heavy hitting fruit in the aroma with mango, citrus, and some dankness. Not picking up much in the way of malt. Big, biting bitterness grabs on the palette immediately with piney, orange being prominent in the hop flavor. A little sweetness on the back-end could be coming from caramel malt. Definitely picking up on some warming from high ABV with a medium-body and modest carbonation. Thanks again, Al!"
22 oz bottle courtesy of Kyle via some kind relative. Thank you kindly for the opportunity!
"A - Golden. Full finer of frothy white/cream head. Small carbonation rising, somewhat translucent."
Bottle opened on 5.14.13
"A: Straw yellow when back lit, but a soft orange soda color in normal light. The bright white head poured a finger and a half tall in the 3F teku glass. When it receded the lacing coated the edge of the glass with a chaotic patern."
750ml bottle poured into a Three Floyd's Teku. Sent to me by sleuthdog.
"A: Clear, light amber in color. Forms a moderate sized off-white head that reduces down to a thick surface coating and an even thicker ring around the edge. Lots of clumpy lacing. "

"Having quickly become a fan of 3 Floyds Zombie Dust, the chilled bomber of Permanent Funeral was calling my name after beating a late night deadline. Props to DuoBob for the sweet trade."
a-lovely golden amber pour with a one finger foamy white head that leaves a nice and thick lacing.
22oz bomber poured in tulip glass.
"Whoa confusing... I've been drinking this brew and waited for the last glass to review it. I was thinking that this was a pale ale as stated by the label and somewhere in the 5-7% range. I was shocked when I learned the actual ABV, but that's a testament to the balance of this brew. Nice gold pour with dense white head and plenty of lacing. The nose is aromatic with a few varietals of hops coming to the surface, mainly citrus, lemon rind, melon, and pine come through. The taste is fruity and full of delicious hop flavor up front with light bitterness. Tastes as if this brew is hop bursted as the bitterness is well overshadowed by the aromatic hops. Notes of pineapple, grapefruit, and peach join the party with a sturdy malt presence towards the finish. Mouthfeel is moderate with smooth and somewhat creamy body. Overall, quite a tasty beer with absurd balance and drinkability."
A - Solid DIPA look. Golden orange with a little frothy head.
Less than a month old when consumed.
Beer received from Jrbrukt. Poured into a pint glass. 
This beer is perfection. It ha got to be a imperial Zombie Dust. I am three floyds crazy and this is one of there best ever. I carry this beer and went through all 24 bombers in one day at the bar. I can not believe the aroma of citrus and the flavor they put in this beer. There is so much citrus to this beer it is amazing.
Thanks to Casedog43 for this one.
"Acquired in a trade with Duff27. Thanks! 1 pint 6 fl oz brown glass bottle with interesting label art and standard branded pressure cap served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are through the roof given the brewery and its current ratings."
"Crystalline clear saturated orange. Bright and colorful, cheery even. Spindly delicate lace, pretty good lasting coverage. "
"A double IPA brewed in collaboration between Three Floyds, a brewer, and Pig Destroyer, a metal band. I’ve always wondered how these types of collaborations work. The dudes from Pig Destroyer meet up with the Floyds, nodding intently as the brewers describe yeast and hops and whatfor. Eventually there’s a lull in the music or a ray of clarity cracks through the bleariness and someone from the brewery asks someone in the band for their beermaking input. “We would prefer it to rock,” says the bassist. “Naw,” interjects the singer, “we want it to be brutal.”"
22oz bottle.
Served from a bottle into a goblet glass.
Poured from a bomber bottle (some of the coolest bottle art I've seen in a while) into an IPA style tulip glass
Dont normally write full reviews but i had to drive to the brewery and wait in line to get this one so i figured why not.
"Had this on 2013-05-05 in Munster, IN"
Thanks to Weebay for this bottle! Poured in to FFF teku glass.
"A - slightly cloudy, golden, big tall loose foamy head."
"Pours a light pale golden color. Very clear, with a small foamy head. "
"First off, I love how Three Floyds tries to confuse people by putting ""pale ale"" on the label. I am not being sarcastic, I think it's funny and unique. Secondly, the artwork on the label is awesome. I am a huge fan of the genre of metal that Pig Destroyer play...though I am not a Pig destroyer fan. I tend to like Job for a Cowboy, Chelsea Grin, The Chariot, BTBAM, etc., but never got into Pig Destroyer. Now, let's get to the beer. Pours a nice clear golden orange color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is VERY inviting. Lovely citrus fruit and piney aromas. Sweet honey with a ton of hops and just a bit of tropical fruit...mango mostly. Just a hint of malt in the nose. Taste is fantastic. Not overly sweet...just the right amount of sweetness for a DIPA of this ABV. The hops are the most noticeable in this beer. I had a six pack of ZD a long time ago, so can't really compare. Some sticky, malty, honey-ish flavors...but thankfully just a tiny bit. Lovely blend of citrus and tropical flavors...stellar combination of hoppiness. Finish is smooth and kinda dry. Drinkability is very high, as alcohol is well hidden...not hot at all. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky, but perfectly carbonated. Overall, this is a fantastic beer that I wish I could get more of. I would love to see how this one would do if it had been at The Bistro's DIPA Festival during SF Beer Week."
"A- nice golden body, nice white big head"
This is not a DIPA. This is the big brother to ZD. Unreal taste. Classic 3 Floyds taste. Classic citra mouth. A beer to remember. Unreal. But not a DIPA. This is an amped up pale ale. I would not call this a DIPA. The hop character is way fired up. Clean taste like a ZD.
"Pours beautifully hazy bright orange with a two finger head.smells piney, very tropical fruit, some peach maybe. Taste is also very bright tropical fruits, sweet hops, bright citrus, some biscuit, some licorice, and just the perfect hop bitterness, not too much though and a hint of malt backbone (I guess a hint of malt makes it a pale ale for FFF). I agree I don't see how this isn't an IPA but its amazing. Extremely drinkable, nice velvety mouthfeel, very bright fruit and west coast style hop profile. I wish I could get this again."
"22oz bottle from the Three Floyds store (Munster, IN). 10.00. No bottle date but I should hope they aren't selling out of date product at the brewery. Served in a Three Floyds teku. "
Big thanks to yeahnatenelson for this one. Totally did not expect it. Fantastic label art.
"10 oz. poured into a FFF Rastal on March 29th, 2013"
"22oz, March/April '13"
"Thanks to Jonnyhiggs for this one; based on the recent rave reviews, I couldn't wait to try it. It pours a half-murky amber color with gold in some places and copper in others - very wide gradient of color. The bubbly, foamy white head has nice retention and leaves a good bit of wet lacing in its wake, nearly all the way down the glass."
"My first PF, thank you mpayne5! Pours a gorgeous golden orange with one finger of creamy tan head. Holy Shit! What a great smelling DIPA!!! Grapefruit, peach, mango, pineapple and pine needles and faint hints of melon, I could sniff this stuff all day long, and be happy. Taste is very rich and satisfying, a tropical hop explosion, everything I was hoping for and more. A little boozy, but not overpowering. Overall this is another world class DIPA from Three Floyds, I put this one between APW and Dreadnaught. If you can find this one, get it! Three Floyds is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries in the world, and they continue to blow me away with their hop-forward line-up of great brews. Cheers!"

"Purchased 22oz. bomber from Three Floyds Brewpub in Munster, Indiana."
Picked this up this weekend with my friend Wyatt. I always have a great time at the brewpub and their food is always delicious. This beer doesn't blow my mind but I am still thoroughly enjoying it. This beer is right on par with the rest of their products and I'd gladly buy again.

"22oz undated bomber poured into a Bell's tulip and consumed today, 4/10/2013. Thanks to powz87 for providing the bottle in a trade."
Thanks to MK for this bomber
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Half Acre tulip.
"This poured out as a very nice looking clear orange color with a white head on top. The retention was thin but it leaves a really nice lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer gives off a really nice sweet fruity aroma, plenty of grapefruit on the nose here. The taste of the beer is give off a really nice balance of sweetness with a dominant bitterness in there as well. The fruit flavors of grapefruit and oranges really give this a vibrant citrusy flavor. The mouthfeel is great, really nicely carbonated and has a thinker oily feel to it. Overall this beer is awesome, hoping it can possibly become a regular rotation for FFF some day. Definitely try this beer before its gone."

Bottle poured into a Three Floyds teku.
Poured from a 22-ounce bottle into a Teku glass.
"Pours a bright, opaque sunset orange color with decent carbonation and about a finger length head that dissipates to a thin lacing. Smells of pretty bright, juicy tropical fruits like papaya, mango, and pineapple. Also get some citrus fruits like orange and a slight grapefruit. Nice candied sweetness as well. Smells like a big, sweet, fruity double ipa. Taste is amazing. Starts with bright tropical fruits like papaya and mango with some orange juice. Sugary sweet malt is there too. This gives the fruity hop qualities a more juicy-like flavor. Medium is more of the same with some dankness layered onto that. Finish dries out the beer and brings with it a significant citrus peel bitterness. Along with this comes more of the juicy fruits. Papaya, mango, and orange stand out as well as a great candied sweetness. Just the slightest alcohol burn on the end, but no alcohol to smell, which is impressive for 10.5%. A smooth carbonation and oily and somewhat sticky finish. High medium body with a creamy and slightly oily mouthfeel from the hops, but still very clean compared to other dipas at this strength. I have very high expectations when it comes to three floyds dipas and this one meets it and then some. Outstanding beer."
"stopped reviewing but compelled to do this one. clear golden/light amber w/persistent white head and lace. the nose just pops. huge fresh berry aroma-are these some newfangled hops? also some citrus, tropical fruit. none of that overripe fruit/rotten banana thing i hate in some dipas. just enough pale malt sweetness to showcase these beautifully juicy hops. big lingering bitterness but not sharp or astringent. i love me some dreadnaught but went back to pick up bombers of these. please make this available year round. phenomenal!"
Bottle purchased from 3 Floyds on 3/29 and consumed same day.
Picked up a bomber from 3Floyds the day after it was listed for sale.
Poured on tap into a 4 oz. taster at Pizza Paradiso Dupont DC. From notes.
"On-tap at Pizzeria Paradiso DuPont Circle, brewed in collaboration with Pig Destroyer for the NHC 2013 conference, unknown brew date, poured into a snifter glass, drank 3/28/13 over ~one hour."
"Another amazing new three Floyd's offering at pizzeria paradiso DuPont during CBC week in DC. Man this is awesome, can we hold this every year in DC please? "
On tap at Pizzeria Paradiso Dupont.
"this is a beer i have been hearing about and reading about for what seems like forever, so it was awesome to finally get to try it, one of those beers of lore, always wondered how much better than everything else can something like this really be, and the answer is that it probably was considerably better than whatever anyone else was doing with this style when it was first introduced more than a decade ago. now, it kind of just seems like another one. thats not a knock against it of course, it was clearly a pioneering beer and more of a trend setter than these guys probably could have imagined, less clear than what was popular at the time, but certainly not hazy for the sake of it, although this could be credited at least partially with making room for such things. i love the hop complexion, i get the columbus way ahead of the galaxy, its so hoppy that i can almost taste the pellets, the greenness, the vegetal element not just the compounds we desire in the beer. its juicy and its kind of sweet from the pale barley malt too, but there is a lot of orange juice, grapefruit zest, and pine needle character here, very northwestern to me, slick and oily feeling and dense as can be, almost woody like lumber, and with a lot of body too, its a big one for sure, perfectly appropriately named. the bitterness is all after the swallow which is cool, its a long trajectory of flavors. citrus abounds as well later on, a honey taste and richness in the middle, and very good, although possibly not as well refined and distinctive as i thought it would be after all the hype over the years. i think, like pliny or something, that the rest of the field has caught up enough where this isnt as mindblowingly unique as it probably once was, but that does not diminish its excellence..."
"Shared from a growler with Ryan. Pours a pretty hazy orange body. Fresh hops and piney resinous aromas, zesty citrus. On the tongue is delicate but flavorful west coast style zesty hops, piney and citrusy with a light bitterness on the finish. Moderate malt backbone. Smooth and easy, especially for 9%"
"Parking lot share with George...pours a cloudy golden orange color. Nice and hazy! Aroma of pine, subtle citrus are abundant. Taste is citrus up front with mid sip malt and finishes piney. Feel is relatively viscous for a DIPA. I love this! Overall, an excellent west coast DIPA. Very smooth for 9%!"
Bottle Date: purchased a month ago
about a 3 week old bottle drank on 6/6/2017
"Another great Alpine IPA. These guys do an awesome job. Had this one a few months back and it was super fresh, super dank, great piney taste and hops came off with a perfect bite."
"One of the most wonderfully aromatic IPAs outside of the northeast! Alpine IPAs never fail to deliver, and this bad boy (ho!) is no exception! The bottle creeped me out a little bit, but I won't hold that against such a delicious DIPA."
"Probably my favorite beer that I've had from Alpine. Danky pine and citrus goodness, with a good mouthfeel and crisp finish. I now understand what I've been missing, and thankful for them bottling this and for the awesome trader that sent this my way. One step closer to dying happy."
Finally had a chance to try this after looking to get a growler full for years! Small bottle run took place and I got a couple :). Solid offering from Alpine direct instead of the Alpine/Green Flash partnership... :(
22oz bottle poured into a snifter.
"I remember this being kinda boozy. Huge tropical fruit and dank hops. Somewhat thick mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Great, but not amazing like people say."
"Dark ipa almost, dark orange and tan notes create an impressive head that holds its own for a few minutes. Aroma seemed to be somewhere along the lines of citra, summit, amarillo and simcoe. "
"From a growler. Fresh fresh fresh! Hop aromas are pretty floral and fruit-forward. Plenty of biscuity grain detectable. Flavor is juicy citrus and melon fruits and some dank rosewater. Grassy on the back end, seems like a hallmark of Alpine. Mouthfeel is smooth with a distinctive tongue tickle. Way too drinkable for how strong it is. Right up there next to Enjoy By and Dinner."
"On draft at the Alpine Pub. My first time having Bad Boy and it may be the best beer I've had from Alpine. Incredible aroma and wonderful hop flavor, but without overwhelming bitterness. Incredibly drinkable at 9%."
"32 oz. growler. Slightly hazy. Small white head. Thin collar. Smell is bright citrus. Boozy. Fruity and a little bit of apple. Taste is bright citrus. Pine. Astringent maltiness. Maris otter is distinct. Boozy. Low carbonation. Medium body. Very tasty, but very big."
Has got to be the best taste I've ever had in my mouth. Thank you Alpine!
"Look: straw, pretty clear golden yellow. semi thin white head."
one of alpine's best next to keene idea. You would never guess it's 9% considering how smooth and refreshing it is.
tasted it today love it bout to get a growler!
"Best DIPA ive ever had. it is a hop monster but so drinkable, if it was available consistently it would dethrone Heady topper, which in my opinion is highly overrated."
Type: Draft 
Need this again soon! Amazing dry hop that Alpine is known for. Smooth double ipa that starts with an amazing smell and ends with the perfect finish. My favorite double ipa!
"A fantastic big hoppy IPA that is surprisingly easy to drink. Feels like a bigger version of Hoppy Birthday, this beer was a wonderful treat to share among friends."
This beer is served on tap/draught. It has a golden yellow/gold pour with a small white head. Aromas consist of a floral citrus/grapefruit blend. This taste begins as it smells with a piney and bitter aftertaste. A hint of orange can also be tasted. Overall smooth and balanced
Appearance- Received with almost a finger's worth of head which disappears as I write this. The head is pure cotton white while the body is a pale to medium amber which appears as a golden straw when held up to the light. Light lacing as with Alpine's other beers. 
Slight one finger off white head briefly rests atop a golden honey color that is clear as a bell.
"On tap at Alpine Beer Company, Alpine, CA,"
"I'm one of the blessed that lives within a few miles of places like Alpine Brewery, and whenever we hear one of the limited release brews is on tap, we make a beeline, but so far, I'd missed out on Bad Boy. They'd always just blown the keg at lunch, or two hours ago, or right before I got there! But not this time! Bad Boy, Ugly, and Pure Hopiness all available at the same time for MY personal drinking pleasure! So I did...drink...and it was a pleasure!"
A: Deep golden yellow orange boy with a one finger head.
Thanks to Florida9 for sharing this growler!
Served in a stemless snifter.
"A: Clear amber in color. Forms only a smallish white head, even on an aggressive pour that fades to a fairly stable, rocky surface coating before collapsing into absolutely nothing. Moderate lacing. "
"pour is clear golden orange with tons of creamy tan head that lingers forever. Nose is heavy pine with citrus and pineapple notes and a hint green. Well balanced caramel biscuit malt gentle cascades the side of the mouth. Taste follows suit, I was expecting big bitterness but it is surprisingly smooth and clean. Got balance of caramel and biscuit mid palate with sweet citrus up front and loads of piney resinous hop in back. The body is full and creamy with a gentle carbonation and light lingering bitterness."
Big thanks to harrymel for this growler of exceptional goodness!
"Growler at Woodshop 7. Pours clear, vibrant golden with sticky white bubbles. Rich onion and garlic nose with mega earthy Simcoe. Taste follows suit with bitter root vegetables, parsnips, and shallot. Raw and bitter. Heavy orange pulp and peel. Bitter and earthy. Palate gains the lovely Alpine house butterscotch note famous in Duet. Nice, but the Hoppy Birthday was much better. Yum. 7/23/2012 8/4/7/4/15=3.8"

From a day-old growler picked up from Alpine myself.
"Hour old growler pours tangerine and gold into the glass. Neat one inch high head of white froth with good retention. Average lacing, spotty for an IPA."
"Fresh growler from Alpine. Poured a beautiful tangerine orange with a nice white dense cap that left thick curtains of lace on my glass as I drank down. Nose is dank, hoppy, sweet and floral, magnificent on all counts. The flavor profile is extracted orange peel oils, pine, bitter lemon pith and huge hop oils. The mouth is clean, crisp, refreshing and very balanced for the rather high abv. It finishes clean and refreshing, leaving bitter orange peel and pine sap that linger for a good half minute. Excellent DIPA from Alpine."
"This is bar none the best IPA Alpine makes. It was a tossup for me between it and Exponential Hoppiness for awhile but the latest batch ( Week of August 27, 2012 ) turned the tide."
Huge thanks to hamilton23 for this growler. Very much appreciated sir! From notes: 
"On tap at the FW invitational. Came out a slightly darker, light brown dark orange pour compared to their many other excellent hoppy beers. Somehow the head and lacing were pretty damn impressive here. Aroma, usual mix of simcoe and amarillo I would suspect, but since its Alpine, it has that extra deliciousness going for it. Enjoyable musty light onion and sweetgrass almost makes me think about sauvin and summit hops. "

From 03/03/12 notes. Big big thanks to Nugganooch for sending me a growler of this one; thanks Dane! Big want of mine. Poured into a tulip.
"Growler provided by Dan. Thanks, this is sort of a big deal...a top 100 beer that I have never ticked. At the time of this review, this is the #67 beer on the ""Top Beers - Popular"", #11 on the ""Top Beers - Double IPA"", #48 on the ""Top Beers - United States"", and the #19 beer on the ""Top Beers - West Coast"" lists, one of my biggest wants. Thanks Dan. Ultimately this is not the best IPA they make...I like fresh Nelson better. I wll definitely have this again if I find it on draft when I finally make it to Alpine. But as it stands now this was a let down for me."

"Thanks to Chris for this fresh growler... Pours a nice clear gold with a huge head and incredibly lacing... The aroma is a little muted buts its super fresh grassy hops, really nice... The taste is more grassy hops, a touch of alcohol but hidden well for 9%. Very crushable... This is well worth seeking out."
"A: Clear, honey color with a ring of white foam around the top."
Big thanks to Robert Zimmerman for breaking this 'bad boy' out. Har har...
Thanks to mrhirseybar for the hook up. Shared at jackie o's with brad and BAs.
Thanks to Chris for supplying this growler during Eric's visit to Chicago. We played flag football with it in the parking lot of Thai Thank You before Sean stubbed his toe and we had to call it quits.
"Session was growler pours (thank you sleepyhead!) into a standard pint glass. This great looking DIPA poured a light orange, almost honey-colored, with a two-finger, white-as-snow head. There was healthy, sticky lacing with good retention. The nose was wonderful - orange, mango, lemon, pine, floral and citrus hops predominating but some sweetness in the back. Taste was near perfection - tropical fuit and grapefruit with light malt notes. There was the expected (refreshing, not off-putting) moderate bitterness, especially in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, and crisp, even after it warms. There was no hint that this could be 9%, so it's dangerously drinkable. Maybe Alpine makes an OK beer but I haven't had it and this one sure isn't it. Having now had over 150 different IPA's and DIPA's, this jumps easily near the top. Do those of you who live close to the treasure know how fortunate you are? I love this beer AND this brewery! If you get the chance - grab it!"

"Picked up a growler of this for $14. (absolute steal!) at Alpine Brewery in Alpine, CA. and poured it into a pint glass."
Growler of San Diego beer week goodness sent to me in a trade thanks to johndoe8!
"Poured amber brown with yellow highlights that had a thin head and left a little bit of lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was pretty damn piney with floral hops, citrus, slight mango, and a good sweet malty presence. Upfron the piney hop notes stand out nice on the palate alongside citrus grapefruit that help out on the overall bitter bite but also had mango accents and a great malty backbone to balance out the piney potentcy. The brew was medium body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a piney hoppy bitter crisp finish. It drank really good and I felt like it was expo's baby brother."
Poured into my Maui Brewing tulip/pint glass at roughly 45 degrees Fahrenheit.

Drove 80 minutes West to Alpine CA to pick up some Bad Boy... Poured me some directly into a thin snifter glass.
"Had on-tap at the brewery during my visit to SD. Thanks to Pat for the pour and personal tour, what a nice guy! Reviewed from notes 08/15/09."
"Was really in the mood for a good DIPA, and what a surprise, Alpine delivered. Dyan mentioned that he'd had the growler for over a week, which I thought amazing considering how fresh tasting this beer was."
"iowaherkeye on RB sent me a growler of this, along with a growler of O'Brien's IPA, both of which will be destroyed today. Thank you, Joey."
"It is good to live in San Diego where I live so close to places that make very good beer. Alpine Beer Company is one of these places. I have made three worth while trips to Alpine Beer Company and everytime I have gone there I have inquired about the Badboy. It is a beer that should be shared with good friends. This double I.P.A (aka San Diego pale ale) is a beer that brings relief to the strife of the everyday stress. From its wonderful honey color to it's heavenly aroma and beautiful taste, this beer can bring a smile to the most weary face. "
"What can I say? This is an exceptional local IPA. Actually, this style should be called a San Diego Pale Ale, because the double IPA style was invented here. Time to give the San Diego brew culture their due. "
"Third of the West Coast IPA's again from JesseTheHutt, thanks Jesse! "
"Growler shared by largadeer on BA, who got it from another BA in the San Diego area. Big thanks to all parties who contributed toward getting this bad boy (which happens to actually be called ""Bad Boy"") into my mouth. I never mind trying a new Alpine IPA/DIPA, that's for sure."

On tap at Toronado SD.
"On tap at Alpine, I was excited to get a good sample of this beer. It was yellow in color, little head. The smell was kind of brutal hops. The flavor made me open my eyes a little wider between the extreme hoppiness, pungent aroma, and obviously high alcohol content of the beer. This was good and I wish I'd been able to drink a growler of this but you can't do everything especially when there is Duet waiting to be drank."
"A: Hop hazed amber with a huge sticky white head that lasts and lasts. This beer has an almost greenish glow to it, a sign of excessive hopping?"
Big thanks to Dave (d0b) for sharing this bad boy. Served in a Fuller's imperial pint glass.
"Big thanks to Jesse for letting me try this one. I had been dying to give these new Alpines a chance and he made it happen. Served chilled and poured into multiple pint glasses during the day, this one was consumed on 05/29/2009. "
"Pours oily copper with a small white head. Sweet, floral aroma of tropical fruits, grapefruit, and sweet bread. Super-sweet resiny hops up front and throughout. Good amount of oranges, nectarines, and kiwi fruit flavors, but very little pine. Sticky caramel finish."
"On tap at O'Briens.... also on cask, but I thought the tap version was much better, so that is what I'm reviewing."
"A - Pours clear honey, good head, drops to ring, lacing minimal and sudsy."
"A: Pours a golden orange/amber topped with a solid inch of head. Tight laced, but spotty foam lines my glass."
Pours a clear golden into a pint glass with a half inch of dense head. This dissipates in a few minutes yet has a lasting surface film bringing about some scattered lacing. 
On draft at O'Brien's
"Had this on tap at Toronado in August. Pours a dark golden with little head and some lacing. Smell is mostly piney hops with some faint malt in the background. Taste is very dry and a little slick with some fruitiness up front and a long earthy hop bitterness. Very dry and attenuated. This one was good, but a little dryer and one dimensional than I expected. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I thought I would."
"12/26/06- On tap at the Toronado in San Francisco, CA."
"This beer pours a golden yellow color with a thick, fluffy, off white head, with a slight yellow tint to it. The head fades so very slowly, leaving a thick coating of lace."
Bartzilla - ditto on trying it for the first time at Liars on Thursday. Were you that guy down the bar from me?
I had this down at Liar's Club last Thursday. I knew that this wasn't doing to disappoint and I was correct. So amazingly fresh tasting with just hops everywhere. Kind of tasted like a mix of Exponential Hoppiness with some of the florals from Duet.
On tap at the 10th Annual San Diego Strong Ale Festival.
"Beer looks okay, but it tastes kind of like old garbage hops that someone forgot about and tried to use. I was excited to try this, but it was a huge let down."
"Pours golden orange with thin head, nice lacing . "
Appearance - The beer poured a golden yellow color with a white head.
Best part of this beer is the creaminess. Very dank on the nose and finish.

"A: The beer is relatively clear yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high off white head that quickly died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass."
"Drank from a 1 pint, 6 fl. oz bottle purchased at Cambridge Wine & Spirits, Cambridge, MA"
"Thanks to Pipeworks for sending not just their delicious regular beers (Ninja v. Unicorn!), but also plenty of great seasonals. Keep sending & I’ll keep buying. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife. "
"Pours a hazy dark apricot orange with a thick white cap that dissipates quickly but leave great lacing. The aroma is lots of fresh fruit both tropical and citrus, pineapple and mango are most present. The flavor is sweet ripe fruits, honey and a touch of pine bitterness. Feel is very good, smooth and thick, but could use more carbonation. Overall a fantastic beer. Would buy often if in 12 ounce format and priced as such."
"Poured into tulip with a very thick head. Probably 2 inches, at least. Complex smell and taste. A lot going on. The finish and feel is very smooth and features honey. Great IIPA!"
A-a somewhat hazy gold with a fingers worth of 
Pours a glowing golden color with a fresh white head. Smell had dank earthy hops and white fruit smells. Taste was earthy and dank with tropical citrus and passion fruit . A soft mouthfeel made even softer with the honey ABV is well hidden with a little dry pine in the finish. Delicious 2IPA here.
Draught pour at Ironside in a snifter. 
I had to search my memory for another beer that utilizes honey so well... and then it hit me. Duh! HopSlam!
"Pours orange with a thick head. The smell is fantastic, mango, lemon, pineapple, grassy. Taste is tropical up front and then some sweetness from the honey and just a little bitterness at the end. It has medium carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. Overall this was a really nice beer, one of my favorites from Pipeworks."
22oz Bottle
"Pours a semi clear orange, with soft, thick foam."
After having Spotted Puffer and Crimson Snapper recently i find that this beer shows off Pipeworks skills with hops the most. The other two beers hide behind their fruit additives but this beer lets the hops themselves shine. And it is fantastic. This recent version is the best one I have had and may be the best double IPA Pipeworks has made. A unique taste that can't be classified as west coast or east coast. It tastes like Pipeworks and that is an achievement.
A - Pours a mostly clear orange with a nice thick white head.
"New batch from mid-April 2017. Drinks like a higher-class alternative to Hopslam, with plenty of contrast between tropical fruit and resinous, piney hops, rounded out by a honeyed sweetness that provides a nice balance to the bitterness."
A 22 oz bomber with no visible bottled on date on the bottle. Poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
Poured from a 22oz bottle with no evident sign of a bottled on date; into a tulip.
"Slightly hazy golden color with off-white head. Aroma is very intense with lots of juicy hops, stone fruits, citrus and even a bit of vanilla. Taste is quite sweet and fruity at first, gets dank in the middle and finishes with medium bitterness. Medium body with soft carbonation. Overall it's really good but slightly boozy for my taste."
Found this recently while looking for another Pipeworks release. It's probably a bit old and more malty than it was originally - but still a very good DIPA.
"Not much you can hate this beer about...piney and honeyie? as f*ck. Easy drinking, despite the abv. If it's worth $15 a bomber is up to you. Put this in 6ers and I would buy frequently."
"This was really good... My fear, when I see, ""brewed with honey,"" is that the brew will either be too thick, too sweet, too syrupy, or too... ""honey""... This beer is none of that. I found the ""honeyed"" touch to be perfect, especially on my finishes, as if a golden pearl of honey sweetness melted across my tongue. The subtle sweetness and malts of the beer still take the typical big IPA backseat to a massive hop presentation. Citra and Mosaic are probably my favorite hops that I can name and identify, and this beer has both (and Simcoe). Belongs in that category of lean and clean, but somehow still soft citrusy DIPAs I am particularly fond of, and this beer hits all points. Softly plush and carbonated, but with a clean wash of citrus and a taut, bitter close."
Fresh bomber drank on 7/2/2016
"Light golden color with a solid white head. A very powerful aroma, with hints of the classic citra characteristics: intense citrus - grapefruit and touches of peach and mango. Taste is similar. But am I the only one who has found that since Pipeworks opened its new brewery, there's been a slight chemical scent and taste to its beers? I just can't put my finger on what's changed but I used to love all their big IPAs, and now the chemical undercurrent turns me off a bit. The beers are still good yet whereas they used to be great, now they are solid but definitely near-misses. I just don't get the persistent high ratings"
L: Lighter yellow-orange and golden hues with a slight translucent haze and soapy white head
June 2016 - First batch of the Emerald Grouper
"Not quite up to Spotted Puffer's level, but damn is it close. Tons of honey with tropical fruit notes, with a boozy bite at the end. This beer is so wonderfully balanced. Another world class imperial IPA from Pipeworks. I'd almost call this a sessionable DIPA!"
Pours a deep hazy yellow with a thick ring of foam
"Hazy yellowish-orange with a plenty of pure white head. Big hop nose, as you'd expect. Pine, citrus, dank, and get a little of that sweetness from the honey. The taste follows the aroma exactly, with enough malt to balance out the hops and plenty of sweetness from the honey. Nice creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied and medium-high carbonation. Excellent DIPA."
2015-08-27
Juicier version of hop slam without tasting boozy. The honey adds just a tad of sweetness to complement the hop flavors. It's very easy drinking for a DIPA.
"Poured from a chilled 22oz bomber. Golden color, nice head. Citrus and good dominate the smell. Taste is excellent, citrus and pine. I love citra and mosaic hops, and this was well done."
This is hands down the best DIPA I've had from the midwest!
"Bomber poured into a snifter. Pours a hazy gold with a half inch foamy head. Smell has notes of mango, lemon, grapefruit, and pine. Taste follows suit, but with lemon and a heavy grapefruit up front followed by citrus with mango and orange that ends in a nice piney bite. Feel is nice and light, but with an oily staying power. Overall this thing explodes with flavor and has nice complexity. Top notch, though I place it behind Sure Bet in the Pipeworks pantheon."
Really enjoyed this one! Get a beautiful bouquet of honey in the mouthfeel along with a touch of alcohol. Really has a nice bite that keeps you begging for more. Cheers to KevinPitts for sending this my way!
This beer was amazing. Great IPA just a intense hop aroma and great taste.
"Fantastic ipA, tropical fruit nice balance of piney hops, there's a tad but of dryness it's not overly sweet or syrupy at 9.5%. Masterfully crafted would love to have Another."
Pours a clear yellow haze. Smells amazing strong citra aroma on the nose. Taste is strong in citra with a honey bitter undertone. Very delicious and another great IIPA from Pipeworks.
Can.
Pours a rich golden color. Has a fragrant floral hoppy aroma with a bit of citrus. Flavor is hops all the way through. A citrus n pine nite with a nice solid hoppy presence all the way. Really nice beer
"Picture HopSlam, only if it had taken a Tony Montana sized gagger right before being bottled. A honey inspired DIPA on steroids. There's still plenty of citrusy goodness on the nose and taste, but it definitely leans more towards a thick, sticky, resiny IPA. I think the 9.5% is noticeable once the beer warms a bit, but the entire flavor profile works from start to finish. "
Poured a hazy golden color with a medium head
"Pours a nice clear golden with sticky white head, heavy lacing, and some head retention. The nose features all of my favorite qualities of Mosaic and Citra hops. Bright stone fruit notes paired with lemon, grapefruit, mango, and hints of resinous pine in the background. The taste feature a nice balance of bitterness to hop flavor. It is evident that this brew is loaded up on late hop additions and tons of hops come through in the flavor, but with a very tame bitterness. The alcohol content is also dangerously hidden beneath waves of tropical fruit, stone fruit, pine, and an ever so slight touch of honey sweetness. Mouthfeel is spot on, again it hides the big malt bill and drinks like a lighter brew with a crisp finish. Overall, this is a amazing brew from Pipeworks. They are killing it with their latest hoppy releases, looking forward to what comes next."
"Very hazy, barely translucent orange brew, topped with an off-white, cream-tinged head. Decent head size and retention; excellent lacing."
looks nice.. golden and hazy
"What a beauty! Went fishing at my local bottle store and reeled in this little winner. Pours a hazy golden hued, honey color with a pillowy white head. Deep pine, floral and dank notes on the nose. What a treat for the senses - and the taste delivers up to the smell and looks. Overripe mango plays well with the honey here. There is an oiliness that coats the mouth and leaves a warm sweet, bitter aftertaste. Outstanding!"
"22oz bomber poured into a snifter. No batch number on the new Pipeworks labels apparently, but this one was newly released. "
"Honey is the strongest characteristic of the scent, but sap, pine, resin, sugar, mango and apricot come in for a nice balance. The flavor is heavy with resin initially, with grass, sap, honey and pineapple following. Very bitter."
Reminds of a Sosus/King Sue hybrid in juiciness and smooth balance. Honey is noticeable and really tempers ABV. The body and mouthfeel/carb level is impressive compared to other PW DIPAs. Very citrus forward and juicy but not into the bitter grapefruit level. More tangerine with that honey playing a major role.
"One of the best double IPAs you could have. The honey sticks out more than you would imagine. Any pipeworks beer with a fish on it, is something that you should definitely seek out"
"Amazing creation, by an amazing brewery."
Pipeworks best effort to date
Opened a fresh bottle at a bottle share on Memorial Day 2015. Very cloudy and like all of their beers unfiltered and full of sediment. Very tropical and nice to drink. Love the flavors but the look of these beers are not pleasant.
A tad too sweet For my taste.
Look: Hazy golden/orange hue. Great looking beer.
"It's good, but wouldn't go nuts trying to find it again."
"This is 10 times better than Heady Topper. This one tastes like a cleaner, better version of fresh zombie dust. I wish they made this more."
Poured from a bottle into a tulip
These days it is rare an IPA lives up to the hype in my opinion. This one does. Mildly bitter with a wonderful citrus punch in the aroma and taste.
Received a bottle of this yesterday (4/22/15) via trade and consumed it right away. Delicious! Poured into a tall 7venth Sun tulip-style glass.
"Sticky icky malty, noticeable honey, lots of zing in the mouthfeel"
Thanks to mrn1ceguy (Reddit) for this one. Originally planned to share with rudzud but he got his own damn beer!
"Amber/copper color. Nose was Simcoe hops for me, slight honey aroma. Initial taste was straight mosaic. Earthy feel, I didn't get any pine on the nose or taste. As it warmed the honey came through and balanced this out nicely along with the strong malt backbone. I felt the alcohol was hidden very well in comparison to other close to double digit abv DIPAs. Overall, nice DIPA."
thanks to jegross for the trade. Batch 672-676 which translates to a 3/26 bottle date. 
"Pours an orangey color with slight haze. White head dissipates quickly, some lingers. Nice lacing on the glass. Smell is tropical, simcoe, mosaic. Tropical flavor comes through on the taste along with the pine from simcoe and classic mosaic taste. Very smooth beer. Excellent"
"Cloudy gold with a decent head for abv. Very nice smell. Malted honey drizzled over mango. Sweet taste with that touch of tropical. Alcohol is well masked. Nice feel, good carb. Like a bit more from the first time I had it."
1822nd Review on BA
Thanks to AndyEdgar for the trade. 
L: golden/amber color
"A: Raises a good head, slightly tan. On the darker side for an IPA, but good clarity."
Holy shit this be good...
Glad I finally tracked this down!!! Very fruity hop notes! Almost juicy!! Great stuff!!
Poured from a bomber
"650ml bottle, March/April 2015 release, poured into a Pipeworks Teku glass. Enjoyed on 4.4.2015, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
Believe the hype. Amazing IIPA. Ranks with the best.
Fantastic Double IIPA.. Almost too smooth and dangerous ABV... amazing beer
"Batch # 672-676 tasted from a 1 pt 6 oz bottle on March 3, 2015."
"Pours a bright honey amber, slight haziness, with big fluffy head. Nice lacing throughout. Smell is sweet citrus zest, tropical fruit, and light caramelized sugar. Taste is very clean and refined with sweet malt balancing out citrus hops. Notes of honey define this brew, mild bitterness, with less grapefruit or pine notes than one might expect. The balance and feel are outstanding as this big brew is very drinkable. Clean is the best way to describe the palate after sweet notes reside. An outstanding DIPA that rivals some of the best around. One of the best brews by Pipeworks I've ever had. A must get!"
Great hoppy beer with tons of honey on the back end.
Right there with Freak of Nature as my favorite offering at Lupulin Festival
"Wasn't a fan of this offering. Surprised so many high ratings. I am a big Pipeworks fan, but this one didn't do it for me."
"Awesome beer. When pipeworks stays in their lane, they kill it."
"22 oz bottle, thanks Pat."
"Pours slightly hazy, golden yellow with a definite, but light orange hue. A thick head of off-white foam."
"I think this was my first 5 beer. Dank, dank, dank. Just plain hoppy, bold, bitter, big. Slight sweetness with the honey. Just fantastic. Hasn't lost a beat from when they first did it."
"Huge sweet fruity smell. Strong grapefruit, resin taste. Almost oily, creamy texture. Wow! One of the best!"
"Hazy amber orange color with a thick head with short retention, but leaving laces."
"Bright, floral, citrusy, sweet, complex. Beautiful bright orange color; avery drinkable iipa. Drank the sediment on this one!"
"Thanks wtc11 for the trade. Batch 527 - 528. Pours a hazy orange with a thick white head that really lasts. Tropical fruit with a hint of dank on the nose, a great smelling IPA. Not overly bitter on the palate with tropical fruit, hint of herbal and floral hop notes with a good malt backbone - it develops nicely in the glass. Medium bodied with a slick mouthfeel and decent carbonation. Overall, a truly world class IPA, balanced, complex, and extremely drinkable even at 9.5% ABV. A home run!"
One of the best IPAs I had in 2014. The honey adds so much body and just kicks the mouthfeel up an extra notch. Citra hops make this a top notch IPA. Love it.
"This is what I wished hopslam to be, smoother with less bitter bite allowing the honey to show up. Citrus & honey is what makes this beer, not a hop bomb but something very enjoyable to drink."
Serving: 22 oz bomber into a tulip. Bottled 10/2/2014... so 17 days old. 
"22 ounce bottle, batch #'s 672-676 bottled on 3/26/15, into a Pipeworks snifter."
"Excellent nose: mango, ripe fruit. Rich mouth-feel, but had a bit of yeast sedimentation in the bottle and even some hop particles. I'm glad I picked one up this year, but not sure what all the hype is about."
Holy mother of...just wow. This was amazing.
Sweet 527/528
Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a finger of white head.
"Don't have detailed notes about this beer as I drank it on 12/02/13, but I recall it being one of my favorite beers from this brewery, and one of the finer DIPAs I've had."
650 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Batch #258. Someone told me this was re-brewed... I guess not. Oh well.
Second Batch (batch 500 something) is so much better than the first! Without a doubt the best IPA I've ever had. Shiii.....
A - Dark golden yellow with a white rocky head 4
"Pours hazy golden amber in color. A surprisingly little amount of light makes it through the beer for an ipa. Head is about one finger, white and has good retention."
A- muddy (resiny) copper with a fluffy white head and thick lace. 
"This was absolutely amazing. I tried Heady for the first time last night and now drank this one tonight and the aroma itself made me check to see if I didn't open up another Heady, aromas matched up pretty well."
"This is an amazing beer from Pipeworks/4 Hands. Comparing it to all their other IPAs, this is by far my favorite. Great pour with some very good lacing. Smell was sweet and fruity mango and pine. Mouthfeel was smooth and velvety. Taste was an explosion of hops. So many great flavors. It tastes just like it smells. Keeps you wanting more and more. Hopefully they team up again and brew another batch of this, because it's just too damn good to be a one off. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it."
"A: Fairly clear yellowish-orange in color. Forms a large, bubbly white head. Decent retention, but eventually fades to a thin surface coating. Moderate lacing. "
Bright orange and hazy. An inch of white head with generous webbed lacing. 
"22 oz. bottle, with no apparent bottled on date present. Batch #258 printed on the label. A collaboration between the masters at Pipeworks and 4 Hands. Expectations are high, based on this knowledge. Awesome bottle art."
"To me, this was definitely one of the best beers I've had from Pipeworks. Big, fruity DIPA, couldn't taste the honey as much as the floral and citrus flavors that I was getting from it. Sad that it will only be a one time only beer, hopefully they will do some sort of collaboration again in the future. Great stuff!"
"L: Dark gold color with a good amount of off -white head. The lacing is crazy on this thing, it clings to the glass for days."
"Bodhi is only my second of the Top 10 rated IIPAs. I am neither a fan of the style, nor the hype around it."
"Pours a deep amber and a reasonable head, decent lacing."
The best of the 4 beers I tried from this company. Hazy color. Tropical taste. Lots of papya and grapefruit. Finishes Crisp and juicy and overall good feeling
"Bodhi brewed by Columbus Brewing Company, with an ABV of 8.50% This American Imperial IPA pours out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint beer glass a nice golden amber color. There is also a nice white head on top of this brew with a nice amount of lacing. The lacing sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, a slight citrus flavor, with earthy grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Bodhi. So far this is a nice inviting brew, now for the taste. It is rich and bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hop bitterness with citrus flavors. The body of Bodhi is a medium to heavy but not to heavy. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.50% ABV in this brew. It goes down this smooth, the citrus flavors are a nice touch to this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. If you are a fan of IPA'S you should look this brew up. The mouth feel is Hoppy, Bold ,Rich, Clean , Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give Bodhi a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Columbus Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this IPA."
Wonderful balance of malt and citrusy hops. Attractive on the eye with a golden color with white head that rescinds into nice lacing. Remarkable is the mouthfeel - super easy to drink and masking its DIPA qualities. Citrusy on the nose and palate. Wonderful beer.
"A wonderful full flavor , earthy , multi-layered beer. Pours a Beautiful deep copper with a thick off white head. Mostly a deep earthy smell with some citrus , flower undertones . Fills the mouth with flavor but is still somewhat subtle at first taste and isn’t overwhelming . Keeps you curious for the next taste . A great beer"
12oz bottle poured into shaker pint. Super fresh at about a week old.
Bottled on 7/16/18
Old school clear DIPA with a malt backbone. Hops seem subdued in this era of lupilin arms race.
"L- poor as a slightly hazy golden orange color with a very thin, white head that just collects on the ring outside the glass. Has a little bit of carbonation."
"Pours a clear deep gold/pale amber coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells of biscuity malt with hoppy accents of citrus and light tropical fruit: grapefruit, tangerine, mango, and a hint of grass. Taste is a great balance of biscuity, lightly sweet malt and bright, hoppy, slightly zesty citrus and tropical fruit notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lime, mango and and papaya. There is a light resinous quality to this as well, with a hint of grass and pine. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/lively carbonation. This seems like somewhere inbetween an Old School and West Coast IPA, but in a really good way. Great balance of malts and hops, sweetness and bitterness. Not a hint of booze or bubble gum to this, which is impressive given the 8.5% ABV. This actually drinks surpringly easy."
"I had a 4 ounce pour of this in a bar in downtown Columbus. Like so many imperial IPAs, I loved the hop taste, but found the overall quality to be marred by a boozy taste. It's a good beer, but many other IPAs pack as much taste with less alcohol."
Had on draft. Thought it was an incredible World Class beer.
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a nice big white foamy head that lingers for quite a while. Aroma is a bit off - faint pine, citrus, I think the off smell is actually a big grapefruit pith aroma. Big beer here - loads of hops: piney, lots of citrus - orange, lemon, grapefruit. Great balance of hops and malt, nice amount of bitterness the whole way through. Classic west coast style DIPA, definitely a go to beer."
A-Pours a very nice light amber color with a generous head and lacing
one of the best beers I have ever had
"Pours a glowing amber-golden color with a spongy, big head."
Pours an effervescent amber with a thumb of cream colored head. Pretty good head retention & lacing 
"This is a great beer. Similar to thier standard IPA, but more hoppy and much stronger. Can only have a couple and you must go down in abv. Color is deeper yellow. Smell is very skunky. Flavor is fantastic. 12oz bottle Columbus, oh. 16oz draft at Pastimes Pub New Albany Oh."
"Thanks to WesMantooth for this one, from a ninja box during NBS BIF #007. 12oz bottle poured into 10oz fluted tulip. Poured a beautiful, clean, clear, bright golden color with about 1/2 inch of white head that had good retention and light-medium lace."
"Pours a slightly foggy yellow with a finger and a half of white head. Head retention is fair with a few strands of lacing left behind. Aroma is delicate notes of orange, lemon zest, and papaya with slightly more dense notes of biscuit, pale, and bread malts. Flavor profile is lemon zest, papaya, orange, and mango. Biscuit, and pale malts hide behind, but provide a consistent base. Mouth feel is medium in terms of thickness, with a grainy, semi-harsh carbonation feel. Overall, a great DIPA. Lovely hop qualities that are far from overpowering. It's a well balanced beer with great flavor."
"Now that is some tremendously understated label artwork there. I was both excited to try it (hype! I've heard so much on NBS!), and underwhelmed by the appearance so not super inclined to get in to it. It had to be done! Rather than share this one (as I've done with several IPAs I've recently received) I elected to drink this one alone... and I do not regret that decision (sorry/not sorry, share buddies)."
"Pours a clear golden orange, vigourous pour yielded a big rocky head. Didn't stick around too long but left lots of soapy lacing."
12oz Stubby
"Beautiful light golden pour. Great to see a non hazy IPA with such clarity. Aromas faded quickly, but the flavor is the main attraction here. Big hop presence and citrus notes. I bought a four pack of this during my travels in Ohio, and I wish I had bought a case."
L Clear light orangish with tons of carbonation
Great local beer with a great hop taste
"Got this beer from my Dad for Christmas 2017. For a Double IPA (DIPA), the taste and aftertaste just didn't match what I would have expected for a DIPA. Overall only slightly above average."
"Deep peach mango coloring, classic good looking, rocky head. Citra, mango, sweet malts, bright aroma. Taste is just like the aroma with flavors a little subdued. Not overpowering but not mild at all. Getting a little peppercorn along with the citra mango notes. Ends with a mild hop bitterness. Smooth body and right carb. Quite sessionable for 7%, great summer beer."
"Classic golden hue, lively carbonation, head is a little washy & thin. Aroma is all earthy hops - hop pellets, hop cone, musty hop dust - without any other notes to add depth or shading. Taste is starts out with more of that musty chalk, the use of the hops is fairly astringent & dry, grassy / herbal, bitter rind flavors (grapefruit, melon). Pretty one-note, and disappointing given its reputation."
"12oz bottle received via a box from WesMantooth. Dated September 11, 2017."
Bottled 09/25/2017
"A friend got me a bottle. We trade beers. Excellent IPA. Hits all the categories you look for in a excellent IPA. Nice aroma, bitter taste with a nice kick. Next time I visit my brother in Columbus, I plan on picking up a case."
"Thanks goes out to MastaaaGrillaaa for this brew, from NBS BIF#6"
"Poured into pint glass; hazy color, nice head that fell quickly. Modest fruit and hop notes to nose. DIPA is well balanced! Full body and very drinkable 6/3/17"
This is an exceptional example of the style. Well-balanced and surprisingly smooth for an IIPA. The only improvement would be distribution to the east coast.
"Tasted on tap at the brewery. Orange in color with thin white head. Aroma is pine and orange citrus. Taste is citrus bitter hops with some pine at the finish. Very smooth and well balanced. Good body, really sits on palate. I have it several times and continues to be one of my favorite imperial IPAs."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/12/2017. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy medium golden/amber/light orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper, pine, cracker, white bread, light honey/caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper, pine, cracker, white bread, light honey/caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, cracker, white bread, light honey/caramel, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol for 8.3%. Overall this is an amazing DIPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the balanced bitter/drying finish. Extremely vibrant, juicy, and dank hops; with a great malt backbone that is never sweet or heavy feeling. Very smooth and never aggressive on bitterness. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a hazy gold color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that had a decent lace after dissipation. The aroma had some citrus sweet and bitter components, smooth sweet tropical glossing, clean malt, some bitter pine and a light floral pillowy smooth hoppiness. The flavor was bittersweet and pulling the tropical and citrus tastes into the blend pretty nice. Aftertaste blended well between the malts and hops pretty clean. Finish was just a tad sticky but acceptable. The palate was about medium bodied with a good sipping structure to it. Carbonation felt good. ABV felt good. Overall, pretty good DIPA that I could come back to if given the chance."
"Honey color, VERY white head. The nose is HEAVY in hops and in the taste. Very smooth beer that does not indicate the weight of the ABV. This is a great IIPA."
A gift from @SomethingClever – thanks Dave!
A: Pale yellow. One finger head. Lacing lasts throughout the pour. 
"Poured from a bottle dated March 20, 2017"
Bottle dated 030317 into a tulip. 
"Poured from bottle to snifter. Pours light golden color with a white head. Floral smell with fruity/ citrus notes. Crisp feel with tastes of citrus, hops, mildly sweet and bitter. Very potent taste, one is plenty. Overall an OK ipa, nothing special"
"Nice slightly hazy golden color, decent sized inch-ish white head, thins down into a small layer of head. Nice lacing and retention."
"Poured into a snifter from a bottle. A golden color, slightly hazy, with a medium-sized white head. Great lacing in the glass. Big aromas of citrus and some earthy, herbal notes. A little pine and faint malt. The taste followed as expected with a nice balance of citrus, resin, pine, and malt. Not boozy at all with a great feel."
Acquired from CapCollector16 so a big “Thank You” goes out to him. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.
"This may be the best ""west coast IPA"" I've ever had."
"Went to Columbus and got a fresh growler of this. Pours a golden orange with good sized head that leaves plenty of sticky lace. Nose is quite dank with some citrus, but is not nearly as big as you'd expect from such a highly rated beer. Taste is somewhat malty, with some sweetness, along with some solid hop flavor and balancing bitterness. Well rounded and doesn't try to just be a bitter hop bomb. Overall, very good, but would have liked to see the hops pop more on the nose."
Actually voting for the beer was 4.08...
"Thanks to nollie77 for this extra, knocking a long-time beer off my wants list. That’s old school trading there. 12 oz. bottle all to myself. "
"I'm going to make this short and sweet. Best DIPA I've ever had. If you don't try it, you're truly missing out. 5/5"
Opened that bottle and lots of citrus grapefruit aromas poured out. Fabulous citrus taste and just the right bitterness. Lots going on on each sip and a wonderful finish. Bought 2 four packs. Excellent Ale!
"Orange body with a hint of cloudiness and a sticky, soapy bone-white head. Aroma and flavor includes big citrus and huge grapefruit. Feel is medium bodied and slick, really drinkable. Really solid DIPA."
from notes this summer at CBC Restaurant
Great IIPA! Smooth yet just the right amount of bitterness to balance the malt backbone. Very consistent local Columbus Ohio brew.
Double IPA flavor and ABV that's drinks like a regular IPA. Very smooth and easy on the pallette with good aromas and great flavor. Wish we had it on shelves out here
Look: Crystal clear straw gold. Thick white head. Very active. 
I got this DIPA in a beer trade and I love it. It’s very delicious and certainly world-class.
Poured into a teku pint. Label says Bottled On 111616.
L: Gold color appearance was nice
No flaws here. Insanely good beer. So tropical low bitterness so smooth. I know I am going to get roasted for saying this but I really felt it is better about 2-3 weeks after bottling than super fresh. The hops are just so edgy that I like it rounded out a bit. Best beer threes right now. At least that I can get my hands on.
"32oz howler, served in a teku glass."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle dated 8/8/16 into a ""Bodhi"" nonic pint. Pours clear golden yellowish with two fingers of beautiful white head, which very slowly dissipated leaving extensive lacing. "
"The big brother of the outstanding Columbus IPA. Mango and other citrus right up front, hop-heavy in a very good way yet balanced and powerful. I had two - one with dinner and one about 3 hours later. The latter formulates the score of this review, as it's just to hoppy to have with food and get full enjoyment out of it(live & learn). A remarkable DIPA. I was lucky to find this in a Columbus grocery store, and one of the store employees told me that it was starting to show up in force across the city."
Poured at 48°F from a 12oz bottle (bottled on 22Aug16) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Allowed to warm up to 50°F before reviewing. Consumed on 04Sep16. 
Good and very easy drinking DIPA. Not mindblowing. I'd buy again but won't hunt for it.
"Classic-style resin-hopped flavor IPA/DIPA from a bottle graciously provided by BierRunner. Nose has some resin and a hint of floral, but overall a little light. Taste is a classic resin hops with some malt. Not hint whatsoever of the 8.5 ABV -- drinks more like a regular IPA. Very smooth; very drinkable."
L: Light crystal clear golden Amber with good head retention. 
In a snifter the beer was a clear gold color with a small white head. There was a bit of lace.
7/21/16 bottle. Delicious citrus and pine. Malts and hops in great balance. Outstanding beer
"Finally got my hands on two four packs of these recently released C.B.C. Bodhi's out of the three that where available on the shelf. I have been drinking this beer for two years or so hear and there on tap throughout the Columbus area's craft brew inclined restaurant's. This beer is a Midwestern take on a west coast style double IPA from Columbus brewing company in Ohio. Poured out of a twelve ounce bottle, bottled on 07-21-16 so it's been three weeks or so since the vat. It pours a very pale color for a double, almost pale ale yellow with a slighter gold or bronze tint with barely a one inch head. On the nose it smells of grapefruit, pineapple, and a hint of lemon maybe which seems unique. It must be dry hopped as well considering the smell is a very pungent dominating west coast variety of hops that resemble pure pine on top of the citrus notes. It tastes as if the at this point, now obvious dry hopped process makes my mouth water beginning in the tonsil or throat area followed by a rush of bitter hops, citrus, definitely lemony note, and then a very slight warm alcohol taste that is nearly non existent having been covered up by the marvelous combination of citrusy fruit and piney hops. This beer is one of the finest double's I have ever had and I think it may be due to the relatively low abv for a beer of the double IPA style but it is nonetheless a world class double IPA. Columbus brewing company's beers tend to be low in comparison to others regarding abv anyway but all are quite amazing examples of American brewing. This is the best Columbus brewing company beer I have personally ever had and at least a top five, maybe top three double IPA's I can personally get my hands on in the Columbus, Ohio area. Fantastic, world class beer here."
Dank
12oz bottle into a Gandhi-Bot (pre-ban) tulip. Thanks TJ!
"Received in a trade, shared with JLindros."
Thanks to rudzud
Off white head. Golden orange color.
Bottle (from the 7/16 release) into a tulip at fridge temp.
"So much happening in this yet it's very well balanced. Start with the look. Regal white lathery head sitting on top this hazy golden beer. Nose is grapefruit, bitter and a little sweet. Taste is near perfect for a DIPA as it exhibits equal parts grapefruit, maybe mango? alcohol presence and sweet malt. Pretty full bodied with a pretty quick, dry exit. Bitterness and saccharin sweetness linger on the tongue. Very much worth all the run it gets."
Golden yellow with moderate bright white head and sticky lacing.
"64 oz growler. Pours light orange with slight haze, two finger fizzy head fades quickly, little lacing. Aroma full of big juicy hops, flowers and pine. Great balanced taste, light cracker malt with citrus coming forward, like biting into an orange with resiny notes around the edges. Thin to medium mouthfeel, soft and slippery. Excellent IPA, glad I finally got to try it."
"Lighter color than I expected with nice head and lacing. The nose is a lovey citrus with a hint of flowers. It's not a fruit bomb but plenty of fruit flavor balanced by a hoppy finish. Mouth feel is exceptional with very pleasant carbonation. This was a growler right from the brewery so exceptionally fresh. Drink local, drink fresh!"
Fresh Growlerette poured into a snifter. Provided to me by @MilesM123 a gentleman and a scholar.
Pour is a beautiful honey amber. Head of fluffy white foam piling ontop itself. Eventually settles to a subtle haze over the top but daaaamn that lacing.
"Living in Dayton, OH currently, I had the pleasure of driving over to Columbus this Saturday and thought it would be a great opportunity to fill my Howler with Columbus Brewing Company's Bodhi DIPA. This was the second time I visited the brewery, having tried their standard IPA on the first visit. I didn't chance drinking the Bodhi the first time, given it's 8.5% ABV; an hour drive back to Dayton can get a bit monotonous and didn't want to doze off. So I brought my howler with me this time and I'm glad I did, even though I had to wait until arriving home before trying...it was worth it!"
I had it. i don't remember anything about it.
"Look is golden clear with nice bright white head. Smells of tropical fruit and touch of pine. Taste leans to the hops and some sweetness that gives for a very smooth, easy drinking DIPA. Very solid DIPA that I will make part of my ongoing rotation."
On tap at Rozi's in The Cleve.
"Light orange, not much clarity going on. Aroma chock full of tropical fruit and pineapple, very lush. "
Poured from a growler thanks to @Eziel for allowing me to try this. Poured a nice golden color perhaps a little orange haze. The nose is full of all the wonderful hoppy aroma. The taste follows the nose lots of nice tropical fruits with a great piney finish. This is a great DIPA
"This is a really well-made beer. Cheers, @PatrickCT! 32 ounces of 'growl' poured into a HopSlam snifter. Lorna Morgan wearing a sheer gold bra. Next. Snow white head that projects across the glass like a lie detector recipient who's telling the truth. Spotty lacing throughout the glass. In the nose I get a mixture of honeydew, orange peel, faint clove and tobacco leaf. A slight breeze blowing through fresh manicured lawns on a spring afternoon. The taste is where this beer really excels. It's an exceptional balance between citrus, herbaceous and bitter. The feel is clean, and it gives me just enough tongue smack on the finish to make me say 'larrrrrrrrrrrrrge.' Columbus Brewing has something special right here. Give me more, please."
32oz growler poured into a tulip.
poured out of a growler this was a light golden/amber color... was not very cloudy and had a thin white head. 
"On tap at Bagby’s Brewing in Oceanside, CA"
"Poured from a growler - clear golden hue, fresh hop aroma, excellent carbonation and solid mouthfeel...overall a very drinkable DIPA...would search out again."
"By far, hands down, the best Double IPA that Columbus Ohio has to offer. The best characteristic is that the sweet malt backbone is not lost under the intense barrage of American hops. It's a balance unmatched in this region."
another hard to find one for me but luckily found it at great american beer fest. columbus brewing is all but impossible to find here in wyoming. great beer!
"Darker brew than I expected: we often call bright yellow colors ""gold,"" but this is more the color of actual gold. Topped by a good size snow white head with very good retention. Tons of carbonation flying up the center and edges of the glass. Basically transparent brew."
12oz bottle served in a tulip.
Poured from a 64oz growler into a pint glass. Thank you very much Matt for this generous extra. Shared with Emily.
Poured from a growler
Pours a golden lemon color with a light haze. Great aroma of citrusy hops. Huge hop flavor. Notes of citrus. A great hop flavor all the way through. A great DIPA
Half gallon growler from Weiland's. Great piney/resin aroma up front which pairs amazingly on the senses with the initial hop bite. Not overly malty with a smooth balanced finish. Easy one of my favorite IPA's....
64oz Growler shipped to Nebraska!
"The beer is a bright yellow gold color. Good clarity. Medium white head. Good retention. Mild caramel. Pretty big malt sugariness. Pineapple, grapes, orange hops. Fairly juicy. A little danker pine underneath. Taste has a lot of hoppiness. More malt flavor than I’m used to, at least for the wave of newer IPAs. Medium bitterness. Medium body. Finishes fairly dry."
"On tap at the Old Mohawk in German Village, Columbus. Beautiful golden color, incredible aroma of citrus and pine. Taste is pleasant, balanced, no overpowering bitterness. This was my new favorite DIPA from the first sip. Not sure how widely available this is, but definitely not to be missed if you're ever in central Ohio."
"This was as good as it was hyped to be. Super floral, with dank juicy hop notes throughout....wish this was easier to find! I want more!"
"Sampled at CBC and then from growler I purchased. This is spot on for me. Easily the best DIPA I've had, and what I compare all others too. Much more experienced tasters than me put it near the top of their lists as well."
"Love this beer. Can always find when in Columbus. Always get a growler to take home. About the best double IPA I've ever had. Smooth, perfect color, and aroma, and taste to boot!"
"Tropical and citrus fruit explosion. Bitterness is never offensive and, at least to me, drinks as easy as orange juice, with deliciousness that begs for the next taste. A must try for IPA aficionados."
Excellent DIPA. More balanced than you'd expect. One of the better C-bus offerings.
"This is the best west coast DIPA I have ever had. Beautiful beer, tons of tropical fruit on the aroma, and the flavor follows the nose perfectly. 8%+ is nowhere to be found. They need to find a way to package this beer, as I hate having to wait for a trip to Columbus to get my hands on it."
"Pours a light golden color with a white head that turns to a light silky layer and plenty of lacing strung down the glass. Aroma is big time piney, resinous, dank hops with just a hint of tropical citrus and pineapple. The flavor highlights a veritable plethora of bright fresh citrus, dank herb, pine, floral, and resin notes. An incredibly tasty double IPA with a ton of rewarding flavor and really no hint of the alcohol. Sweet neutral slightly toasty caramel grain notes provide a base for a hop explosion. Medium to full bodied with a spot on level of carbonation and crisp finish. Simply put, an incredible imperial IPA with flavor for days. This is one I would always come back to. Thanks to Jess and Karla for bringing the growler, this pretty much stole the show and was the first beer opened."
Searched high and low for this on a weekend trip to Columbus. Found it for $6 a pint at House Beer on High St. Worth the search. Great beer!
"Draft at Gallo's. Shaker. [re-reviewed, bottle 9-26-16 on 9-30-16! DFH Tulip.]"
"On tap at Barley's in Columbus. I had heard great reviews about this beer, but for me this beer did not meet expectations. A very good Double IPA, but there are much better ones."
"Had on tap. The taste is the clear winner here, with plenty of hops bitterness and spice to go with the giant loads of grapefruit, orange, and peach. Highly drinkable, able to get full juicy fruit flavors without losing the strong hops. However, in the feel I could use some more hop textures to break up the sticky sweetness. Smell is not as deep in complexity or hops as taste, but full of pleasant citrus nonetheless."
"Great imperial with respect to aroma and taste, just a step below Creeper"
From a Growler. Could sit and smell this all day. Nice!
From a growler purchased @ Rozi's in Cleveland on 5/1/15. Was really looking forward to trying this and it did not disappoint by any means. Wish I had access to this regularly.
Had on draft in a pint!
"Awesome Beer! Certainly a fan favorite within Columbus, for obvious reasons. If hops aren't your thing stay away! Only downside to this beer is, it's not sold in stores. Great Brew!!"
"One of the best double IPAs I've ever had, lot of citrus and some pine..well balanced"
Pours honey/amber color with a thin white head. Lots of grapefruit/fruit aroma. Taste of grapefruit and orange with a nice hops balance. Mild carbonation with a nice finish. Overall a really good IPA.
Awesome IPA hard to find
Fresh growler. I heard great things but was rather disappointed. I found it meh at best.
I've had this before and I've been floored before. This is a tough style to review - my favorite (and lots of peoples) but one so competitive there are loads to compare it with. Yet this one is pretty hard to top.
favorite beer ever. five words
"Had a bottle at a beer dinner where Columbus was a guest. After an excellent, but milder ESB, this blew me away. My first thought was 'damn, this tastes like Heady Topper.' But it's not a clone, this IPA is a little drier and thinner in the body — more West Coast where Heady is rich and smooth. Anyways, it's giant floral grapefruit with pine and a biting bitter that's incredibly bright and blindingly fresh. A fantastic hop bomb if you can find it."
"Oh, the famed Bodhi. It's funny when you finally get to these uber-hyped beers of a specific fame. The reality of the ride seems to usually be different than what it was built up in the mind."
12 day old growler acquired via trade. Was trying to hold out til the Super Bowl but...
Tried from a fresh Growler fill. Great hop aroma but taste was a little weak on the delivery compared to the smell. Still outstanding IPA with awesome finish!
Delicious ipa! Great brewery! Would highly recommend trying this brewery.
A very good DIPA. Like CBC IPA on steroids.
pretty solid DIPA.... got a growler sent to me.. seemed extremely fresh
"From a growler from Save-On Craft Beer in Mentor, OH. There is not much to say about this beer other than WOW!!! From start to finish this is an homage to sweet juicy, sticky tropical hops with lots of fresh ripe fruit and balancing hints of pine and grapefruit rind. Easy drinking considering the ABV and just enjoyable. I cannot wait till it is bottled or canned!"
Oh yeah! This is good stuff! 
"Outstanding dipa - bitterness is just right with hops balancing and restraining a bright sweetness that keeps things juicy and pleasant. Even at higher abv, it is dangerously drinkable."
Watered down IPA but ok at the local pub
On draft. Very floral bouquet. Hoppy taste as would be expected but very smooth and well balanced unlike a lot of ipas. I'm not a huge ipa fan but this is a terrific beer
Holds it's own against other top Ohio IPAs/DIPAs (Head Hunter/White Rajah).
Fabulous hop forward double IPA. Unbalanced to the hop side just the way I like'em
"Description: Bright, clear pale gold in color, almost like apple juice. A lot going on with the aroma: dank/resin, mango, pineapple, mandarin orange and some pine for good measure. The taste is not as fruity as might be expected from the smell but it's still fruity/East Coast up front, followed by bitter, hoppy, PUNCH! to the tastebuds as it goes down. The alcohol is not very apparent and the aftertaste is smooth and clean. Mouthfeel is fine if unremarkable: smooth, medium bodied and medium carbonation."
"This is a deeply complex IPA. Velvety and smooth with no off putting attributes. Nice golden orange amber body. Head is short and off white poured from a growler. Orange rind and flowery resin dominate the nose. The body is bright and full of citrus as it enters the mouth with first sip. The body is very vibrant for any style, especially an IPA. Crisp, sharp, and electric in character and absolutely delicious in every way. I could drink this brew every day. This beer is the real thing. I really hope they start packaging this beer for distribution."
Look 8/10
"Had on draft at WOB in Columbus, OH. Super dank and resinous both in the smell and taste. I don't think this is the best beer brewed in OH, but it is great and worth seeking out if you are in the area(available draft only)."
"Fantastic. Found it at a tap house near Cleveland and ordered a pint. I was skeptical about the ""best beer in Ohio"" but damn if it isn't at least a strong contender for that title. A beautiful golden yellow with a little head, the nose and taste are very citrusy. Extremely easy to drink, I almost forgot I had a beer in my hand and not a smoothie."
"Aroma - amazing, very pungent dankness, strong notes of pine"
Very good DIPA glad to be able to pick this up in CBUS.
"After a few years of drinking this, I am finally getting around to a formal review. This one is from a growler, as this is the only way to enjoy it at home. For now..."
"Honey yellow color glows from the glass, not much head, lacing on each sip but not strong enough to cling. The smell is ridiculous, I smelled it the instant I popped the growler like it was caged and waiting to bust free. Amazing citrus aroma with strong orange, grapefruit and lemon. None of the grassy or piney notes hops usually bring. Very clean focused aroma. Taste is maybe the best of any beer I've had to date. So delicate with big citrus flavors. Orange, grapefruit and lemon; yeah it's all in there. Light sweetness in the background from the malt that accentuates and just let's the hops shine. Soft mouthfeel, low end of medium mouthfeel and none of the stickiness you'd expect from a beer with 8% ABV. Finish leaves great hop flavor, refreshing and crisp and then in a flash it dries out. This beer is dangerous. Overall this is one of the best beers I've ever had and I hope I get to have it again."
"the thing thats so impressive about this beer isnt its hop profile, as good as that is (its amazing), but its the mouthfeel. there is no evidence at all that this is 8% abv, it drinks like 5%, and the body isnt even all big and sticky and filling, its just delicate stuff, very east coast, very impressive. the hop complexion does rock though, quite lemony but only mid range on the bitterness scale. there is a honey color to the beer but a definite baked malt profile under the hops, which gives balance but not much body and certainly no residual sugar. i like beers like this, that arent what i expect but are delicious anyways. some earthiness to the hops too, not grassy or piney, my familiar descriptors, but someplace in between, plant-like and mildy astringent, but with that lemon thing in there too. its got great carbonation and would be way too easy to get messed up on. my first beer from columbus is nothing short of sensational."
Top of the line DIPA
"This is my first review and I don't think I'm very good at explaining and describing a beer. All I know is that this beer is absolutely phenomenal. I've had a lot of Pliny (the Elder). I've had Heady Topper and I've had quite a few Three Floyds. I know these are some of the greatest IPAs (or double IPAs). And they really are! I love them all (in their own way). But I really do have to say, if there was one beer that towers over them all, then it's this one. From the nose to the taste, it's just brilliant. I could never tire of drinking Bodhi. Columbus and their brewmaster have really done something phenomenal with this beer. I really don't even want to compare it to other beers. I don't feel like it should be a competition. But at the same time, I do have to say that this is absolutely the one I would favor over all of them. For the simple reason that it never gets old. Not too sweet. Not too bitter. Not too malty. It's just right. Glass after glass. With every sip, you'll taste a little bit of heaven. ;)"
"EDIT; I am so happy this beer is back to its usual self. It was off for maybe 2 months, way off. I first noticed it with the 4/17 bottled batch, and a couple after that, keeping me from purchasing possibly my favorite local brew. Had a pint the other night at Mac's because nothing else really sounded good to me, so i figured I would see if it was back to normal, and it IS! Thank goodness! Some of these people giving great reviews of this recently, April-May-June-ish, can't be trusted. I am not 100% sure when this beer got its mojo back, so I am not talking to all of you. Cheers!"
"Wouldn't have pegged this as a double. Crisp, clean, light body and modest bitterness. Not the most exciting hop bill, but well made."
One of the best happy beers ever.
"Lovely lemon yellow in the glass. Passion fruit and mango nose is outstanding. Bright, bright citrus hops and a greasy hop mouthfeel that feels like taking a gulp of an oil spill -- love it."
The beer comes in a hazy golden yellow color.
holy hopps...too much...no way!!
Poured from a six-ish day old growler.
Courtesy of SomethingClever thank you for your earnest effort for me to receive this beer! From notes..yeah I take those.
This beer is simply fantastic. Beautiful color and excellent smell. The hops explode on the tongue and there is little alcohol aftertaste that many DIPS's seem to have. 
"12 oz bottle from a trade with @Gregf51, only about a week old! Split into two mini balloon tulips."
Best beer the CBC has!!
On-tap at the Pint Room-Dublin. 
"This was extremely good, and extremely fresh (being that it was consumed in C-Bus). Nice finger and a half of head, nice translucent body, very nice. Beautiful citrus notes... lemon freshness. Not a huge nose, but nice and clean. Pine quickly invaded the taste, with clean, fresh notes absent from the nose. Surprise. Crisp mouthfeel lacking the sliminess of some DIPAs. Nice brew, even on a day when I may have been a bit inundated by DIPAs! If you are in Columbus, come and try this one!"
"Maybe because I live in Columbus, but this beer is top three of all time. I travel every month on business, try local beer everywhere. This is so choice, if you have the means I highly suggest picking some up. That's all I have to say but it's making me add more words to submit the review. Peace, love, and hairgrease."
"Growler filled with Bodhi on 7.26.14 and consumed hours later, out of a teku. Thanks Joel!"
"They recently re-did the formula and it is way better now. Different yeast is what I heard, not sure what else. Great juiciness and mouthfeel. Like eating a pineapple. Great DIPA. Only wished it was bottle so it would be easy to share the wealth. Get your self some."
Cheers to Bilco for sharing this
"Orange in color with thin white head. Aroma is pine and orange citrus. Taste is citrus bitter hops with some pine at the finish. Very smooth and well balanced. Good body, really sits on palate. Body is a little thin but it doesn't distract. Could drink this everyday."
This poured with a very light complexion of copper or Apple cider like hues. Nice carbonation that fed to a fluffy foam.
"With the embrace of fruit and lupulin that Columbus has with beer, there's really no surprise with the demonstrative IPA that puts both front and center with a host of tropical, citrus and orchard fruit to entice and intimidate the senses all at once."
Served on tap into a snifter glass.
64 oz. growler poured into a snifter.
"To my friend #mps, thanks for the howler. I loved this stuff."
"Huge thanks to Tony for this growler, fresh from the source."
"On tap at The Daily Growler in Upper Arlington, OH."
Drank from a 32 fl. oz. growler acquired in a trade with mps
Also took home a 64oz growler from the CBC brewpub... ~$15/refill. Currently not available in bottles/cans.
Pours a hazy as hell for an ipa golden body and a big thick sudsy white head. Leaves lovely lacing dripping all over.
"On draught at the Lincoln Tap House, Bodhi is hazy pale yellow with a thin white collar that leaves scattered, light lace. The pale, cloudy stillness is formidable."
"Mmm . . . Hard pressed to find a better dipa in my opinion. Of course that'll depend on your preference. I consider myself very fortunate to have this whenever I want it. Pours a golden strawberry yellow, minimal head with some aggressive fizzies clawing to the top of glass. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, peach and mango. Flavors follow close behind with pineapple leading the way . . . Finishes clean and dry, juicy feel and taste. Overall, again, very fortunate to have this readily available. One of the best dipa's around"
64oz growler poured into tulip.
Believe it or not I live in columbus. This is the first time I've had this. Excellent!!
"A: Deep hazy yellow, golden hue."
"Thanks so much to NW2285 for beering this forward! Pours a beautiful cloudy golden honey color with thick, two finger white head. Good retention and nice lacing. The aroma is the finest example of DIPA that I have ever experienced - redolent of grapefruit, pine, and just a touch of dank. Very hop forward on the nose. The taste does not disappoint, it is every bit the equal of the nose, if not superior. Grass, pine, and citrus come first, followed by a mild malt backbone that does an outstanding job of balancing out the mild bitter finish. This is the finest tasting DIPA I've ever had! It's balanced and smooth, the bitterness isn't overdone as in west coast IPAs. It has a medium body with good carbonation. Finishes dry. I can say without hesitation that this is the best DIPA I've had to date, and I'm pessimistic that I'll find one better. Please bottle this Columbus Brewing, please!"
"Growler pour at Woodshop 8 held at The Hermosillo in Los Angeles, CA."
"Fantastic. Heavy tones of citrus and grapefruit, I thought I died and went to heaven. This is the beer that everyone should be making. Boy, you sure want us to write a lot. A good beer is a good beer. And it doesn't take me 200 characters to say that."
My awesome trading partner Colby sent me a growler randomly.
64oz growler poured into a New Belgium globe.
"32 ounce growler from Blacklick Wine and Spirits. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch off-white head that stays around for a while. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like citrusy (grapefruit, mango, lemon peel) and pine hops, along with some bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like citrusy (mango, grapefruit, oranges and orange peel) and piney hops, bready malt/grain, and a bit of floral hops too. There's a good lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink. It drinks like a lower ABV brew would. Hopefully CBC will get around to bottling Bodhi soon. I guess it's been in their plans for a while but hasn't happened quite yet. Definitely worth trying if you see this anywhere, it's always nice to have a local brewery who can make a great brew like Bodhi (and Columbus IPA too)."
Poured from a growler into a Bell's tulip.
64oz Growler from Savor Growl.
Appearance: Arrives with a hazy goldenrod appearance; the massive head leaves sheets of lacing behind
"32 oz. growler filled last weekend, but unopened since then, poured into a NB snifter."
"Pours a beautiful hazy golden color along with a big white head. Sticky lacing lasted well throughout. A sweet malty, hoppy and citrus fruits comes through very nicely in the aroma. The citrus and malty flavors were amazing – fresh hops, tangy grapefruit, and piney. Medium bodied and decent carbonation throughout. Overall, this was a fine example of a DIPA and one that closely resembled a Three Floyds Dreadnaught / AleSmith IPA meets Three Floyds Zombie Dust type of beer. I would love to get my hands on some more of this beer!"
Appearance: pours a cloudy orange with a medium head.
"Growler filled at Save-On Tobacco & Beverage in Mentor, Ohio -- $8.99"
"Poured out as a clear golden color with a thick white head on top. The smell of the beer is loaded with a bouquet of hop aromas that fill the air. The taste of the beer is just about the same, a heavy grain bill to boost the ABV yet enough hops to push the boundaries. Overall this is a great DIPA, would drink again for sure!"
Poured into a Kane tulip from a growler acquired in a trade with bencooper27. Thanks again man!
"The beer pours a cloudy orange amber with a whispy white head tha laces. The nose is a mellow sweet citrus with a touch of tangerine. Potent hops and malt sweetness dominate the hop profile and drink with a perfectly refined, floral/citrus hop profile that leaves a lingering green tea bitterness. Medium bodied, sweet, generously hopped and carbonated, and has a lingering grainy citrus. This is a highly drinkable dipa, which reminds me of rpm. Definitely hit the the brewery when your in town."
A - Pours a light orange color with a thin layer of white frothy goodness.
"Growler received in trade from Bencooper27, thanks for the opportunity!"
Hazy amber pour from a growler. 
"If I could give Bodhi a 6 for mouthfeel, especially for a DIPA style, I would. It's that amazing as far as mouthfeel goes."
Growler thanks to claaark13!
great dipa: poured from a growler
"5 words to describe it: Hazy, Citrus Peel, Resin, Floral, Creamsicle"
"On tap at World of Beer Easton, Columbus Ohio. Look is a golden color, not indicative of the massive flavor profile to come Nose of citrus and pine. Lots of hops but a slight note of malt. First taste is a barrage of hop dominance. Tapering to a malt finish, never losing the strong hop bitterness. Hop heads will basque in this beer. Holds its own amongst the happiest. Full of flavor and a medium resinous mouthfeel. Complexity throughout. Great beer that if you have the chance to try, DO NOT PASS IT UP! Could drink this every day."
Growler
"A - Pours an incredibly hazy golden orange/yellow color with a small, 1 finger, off-white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing."
Received a 32oz growler from itsthepleats. Thanks again my man.
"A truly original masterpiece in the DIPA category. This one stacks up to the best DIPA's in the country. Seek this one out. For me, it's up there with Heady Topper and the Pliny's."

You had this beer. 
"A-Cloudy yellow orange, some carbonation with a one finger head"
From 12/29/12 notes. Huge thanks to jslot38 for sharing a growler of this one; been wanting to try it.
"Had it on tap a few days ago but review is from my growler fill. Pours hazy orange/yellow, with a lacy white head, healthy head for a growler. The nose on this is amazing, piney, tropical citrus, lemon, bready, juicy, crisp, clean, need I say more? Tastes as its smells, great citrus fruit, not bitter like some DIPAs, so refreshing . It's got a great texture, without being ""thick"". The finish is so smooth for a DIPA, and doesn't leave you with a bitter finish, just enjoyable. This beer is not over rated, one of the best I've had. They've been talking about bottling this for a while, hopefully it's sooner than later!"
Thanks to Justin for sharing this one. 
"Big thanks to drabmuh for getting this out to me. Pour is golden with a good, fluffy white head. The nose carries some seriously-dank hops. Seems to be loads of Columbus. Light citrus and pine. Flavor is similarly dank, and aided by a very strong bitterness. Quite good."
"Growler obtained through a trade. Thanks, a long time want here. At the time of this review, this is #15 on the ""Top Beers - American Double / Imperial IPA"" list on beeradvocate.com. Overall this was quite the nice double IPA, probably slightly over-rated from my perspective but really only slightly. I would definitely have this again if I could find it on draft. I love it. The aroma was the best part, smelled like Hill Farmstead Abner."
Thanks to drabmuh for this one.
Shared by drabmuh. Thanks Matt.
"On tap at CBC first as part of a flight, then in a tulip. Because as it turns out, a 2-3 oz pour of this baby is not enough."
On tap at Brew's Cafe
Growler thanks to Claaark13
Have been meaning to review this tasty offering from Columbus Brewing.
Big thanks to inebriatedjoker for this one - poured into a badass Columbus pint that he also sent:
"On tap, served into a pint glass"
Have had tried this multiple times. Thanks to Brian for supplying this for our last couple tastings. From notes.
"Pour(s) courtesy of largadeer at the Solar Eclipse party. Cool mild orange pour, some noticeable haze that is far from a detraction in this beer. Amazing aroma, heavy on the tropical fruit, the lushness of the aroma is so enjoyable, this ain't one of those shitty dipas that just slams you with copper penny bitterness, this is like a lush rain forest of pine tree, citrus and tropical fruit hop medley. "
"On-tap at Columbus Brewing Company, Columbus, OH"
"Growler shared by Ethan, thanks!"
Big thanks to warnerry for sharing!
A -pours a hazy orange with one finger of white head. Decent retention with great lacing.
"Semi-transparent yellow on the pour with a generous white head. Great retention, beautiful lacing. Outstanding aroma with massive amounts of citrus, grapefruit and bread. Big Hop bite with a nice punch on the first sip. Dry pine and citrus follow through the overall body. a very satisfying finish. Clean, hoppy mouthfeel. No doubt that this beer should rate right there with the best of them."
"Thanks, Eric!"
"Screw-top growler received via Growling at the Moon from bb8189. Thanks for the brew, Brian!"

On-tap at the Winking Lizard
Had this on tap at CBC as part of their Hop Odyssey...I. Love. This. Beer. Which why I have had it on tap 4-5 different times at different locations. 
Big thanks to Eric (TurdFurgison) for getting this to me in time to drink before heading to Toronto. Served in a Portsmouth tulip.
Had this a couple weeks ago at Bob's. 
Thanks to Alex through Eric for this one! Poured into Bruery tulip.
Thanks to Eric for always sharing great beer.
Truly thrilled to try what I believe is Columbus's best DIPA.
a huge thanks to mark for the growler of this one. this trade kinda fell into my lap and i really could not say no. opened last night to keep it fresh i really devoured this one!
"thanks, seth! 64oz growler into imperial pint glass."
Glad to try this before it runs out. Growler sampled on the date it was filled.
"I tried this beer while visiting my parents in Dublin, Ohio at Matt The Millers Tavern. I was expecting the Uncle Rusty i loved so much last time i ordered their hop odyssey. When the light gold glass was put in front of me i was a little disappointed. All of the was over when i took the first smell. citrus prevails with grapefruit some pineapple and a little pine. the first sip put any remaining reserve to rest. pale malt is discernible in the background and is well balanced by the hop profile which is similar to the smell. sweet citrus and pine start, medium smooth body with a bitter finish, just how i like an imperial ipa. I'm not usually one to pay too much attention to lacing but this time it really stood out. I cant make up my mind which i like better, uncle rusty or bodhi. both are incredible if you ever get a chance try any of the hop odysseys, you wont be let down."
Pours a nice crisp clear golden yellow. Lots of white frothy head. Very pretty.
Part of the epic tasting at jackie o's with brad and crew
Mobile review.
"I was lucky to find this on cask at Bob's Bar. Glad to see it available again. This beer is light golden color with a very fine haze, and a thick frothy layer of white stuff. Huge lacing too, thick sheets of bubbles dried onto the glass."
"Ahhh Bodhi reappears for the 2nd Round of Hop Odyssey. I didn’t have a chance to try this the first time around, so I’m pleased to see it."
"A- Pours a hazy golden orange with a bright white head. Head has pretty solid retention, turning into a ring of bubbles around the edge and leaves some really nice layered lacing. "
"Ah, yes. I finally get to try Bodhi. For a while I feared that this one would never make a reappearance. Thank God for the Hop Odyssey redux. "
"This one stole the show at the 2009 Micro Brew Festival. This is my number 1 DIPA it has it all. The smell is like your in the middle of a pine forest. The taste is what a hop head would expect from a double, grapefruity citrus heaven bomb, yet it still holds a balance. It's in no way over the top like Ruination it's just a thing of beauty. I'm so lucky to live so close to CBC if only the rest of the country could enjoy this brewery... On second thought that might mean less for us locals, scratch that!! My only beef with this beer and a few of the other CBC offerings is that we never know if they will be back in circulation again. Long live CBC!!"
Poured into a pint glass on 9/12/09
I was lucky enough to try this 'special' draft (that is what my waitress called it). I'm hoping that they keep this one around...
"2015-2017 were definitely my favorites. However, the 2018 was missing some of that honey flavor I’ve grown to love"
On draft at a local beer bar. Hop bombed and not floral at least not like Two Hearted. The addition of the honey threw my palate completely off. Will stick to Two Hearted.
One of the best double ipas out there hands down. I have literally spent hundreds of dollars on this beer when it drops every year. It has been available an exceptionally long time this year to my plesant surprise. Love it!
perennial fav. look fwd to it every year. wish i could get the mini keg
"Had a can of this 2018 vintage for the first time a few months ago and was not impressed, despite the high ratings. I decided not to review back then, figuring maybe I was just missing a DIPA boat because I'm really more a stout guy. It's really hot outside now, I like cold IPA style when it's hot, I saw the beer store clerk had this stashed in a cold hiding place, so I bought it for a second try. "
Hoppy as it gets but very well done
"under appreciated with many years of the latest & greatest next double ipa. Pours a nice deep orange. The smell is full and complex of hops, citrus and malts. Tastes like it smells and a bit of the strong ABV%. I think Hopslam has more than held its own against the wave of new IPA/Double IPA."
"Canned in January, but I don’t expect for this to have fallen off much as a DIPA."
"Canned Jan. 10 2018, drank April 21, 2018."
"Picked-up two cans in trade from Blackacolyte26. This brew is not distributed where I live, so first time trying. Very nice brew, does not at all seem like 10%."
"Pours a amber caramel color. The beer gives off the aroma of grapefruit and citrus. Tastes of strong citrus, hoppy, and overall smooth. Nice lacing left behind."
Not sure what all the hype is about. I paid $24 for a six pack and absolutely hated this beer. I’m not into the overly hoppy brews and this one is nothing short of that description. I’m sure beer nerds everywhere are reading this gasping because I’m downing what most consider a well rounded dipa. I just don’t see what all the fuss is about and how this overly expensive beer flies off the shelf when there are much cheaper and better options available
"Canned on date on the bottom of the can. Quite a pungent aroma & taste on this one. This Reminds me of the newly revamped Dogfish head IPA's. That high abv is hidden perfectly. This is good, but not up to the level of some classic west coast IPA's. Cheers! B-"
Pours relatively clean golden orange with nice thick foamy head. Nose is very faint with light bready malt and some floral and earthy notes. Maybe some grapefruit peel. Im not really getting much to be honest. Taste up front is grapefruit subdued by some malt backbone. Followed quickly into mid palate orange with some noticeable alcohol burn. I get some subtle honey but thats probably bevause im looking for it. Rather clean end palate with lingering burn from the booze. Mouthfeel is nice with adequate coating of the palate. For all the hype i expected more. This seems to be an average beer with nothing that really stands out. Nothing i would seek out and although nothing is offputting and the balance is there the sky high ratings confuse me a little.
"Drinking a 6-pack just prior to the 60 day mark, so it is reasonably fresh. Pours a relatively clear copper orange with medium head that leaves good lace. Nose is not as big as I expected, and has some dank pine and citrus. Taste is more orange rind and some caramel. Obviously a big beer, but holds it well for 10% abv. Overall, I liked it but don’t get the uber high scores here."
I had this at the brewery right after having Two-Hearted Ale. It blew 2 hearted out of the water (obviously) in both taste and happiness. So good!
Full of flavor!! Wife won't allow me to drink ipas anymore!!! Excited to explore different styles of beer
"Appearance: pretty looking beer; nice, cloudy orange color; thin white head that dissipates quickly"
Just don’t dig it. Tried it a coupla years now and don’t get the hype. The sweetness of the honey adds a cool mouth feel but smell and taste are bleh to me.
"L - Copper color with two fingers of fluffy, dense white head"
High enough ABV starting to get that alcohol taste bleeding through on finish
"Poured on tap at a bar in Tempe, Arizona."
"Appearance: Pours a beautiful, clear, orangish copper with a 1"" dense head and modest lacing"
"Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Golden yellow with a nice white head and lacing. Fragrant citrus smell with a bit of cinnamon. The taste is very interesting with grapefruit, cinnamon, honey, and maybe a bit of strawberry. Nice beer!"
"Poured from a can into a 16oz glass cup. Packaged on 1/17/18. The initial smell when poured into the glass was overwhelming notes of hops, pine and honey. The beer had a nice two inch head and body is a dark amber. Taste is amazing for a double IPA you can't really taste the booze and it's hard to wrap my head around this beer being 10% ABV. Overall this beer is my favorite beer that Bells Brewery releases every year and will for sure pick up another 6 pack when this one runs out."
Great old school DIPA. Doesn’t hide the alcohol as much as some newer beers. Nice creamy texture. Worth buying a 6 pack once a year but now wish they sold them in 4 packs for less.
12oz canned 1-15-18
"Gifted a can and now enjoying in a snifter. Crystal clear, deep amber color with 2 finger head and sticky lacing. Smells dank with aromas of daisy flowers, pine, booze, yeast, and a hint of menthol. Burnt orange rind, honey, caramel, bitter hops, yeast, and boozy flavors. The sweet and bitterness are well balanced and will linger for sometime. Real smooth carbonation with a creamy texture. Very nice!"
Me likey
Poured into a can glass.
A nice hoppy yet balanced DIPA. with some of the sweetness from the honey providing some nice support to the malts to counteract the bitterness upfront. A little bit boozier than I would like but you can't argue that this is a good beer.
"Bottle picked up back east. Nice looking pour, inviting. Smooth, slick, slippery, resinous hops, ABV hides well, but watch out. Sticky finish, excellent DIPA"
"I’ve drank this beer numerous times, but it’s not until I try a fresh can from across the country that I feel the need to rate this beer. Here is my best shot."
"Pours yellow with decent head. Leaves a remarkable amount of lacing down through the glass, making it obvious where the glass emptied down to on each sip. Smell is citrus and floral notes, and honey. Taste is similar but hops come through more clearly. Feel is a touch dry, but this seems to be balanced a bit by the honey. Still, the dryness lingers. Overall, solid beer, nothing less than I’d expect from Bell’s. Not quite worth the hype, maybe, but a good beer."
A: Beer pours a golden orange body with a thick two fingers' worth of head. Large amounts of lacing and head remain behind while drinking. 
"Very good DIPA. I am certainly impressed. That said, I've had better for the price. Not my favorite that I have tried, but I would put it at #4, under Hoptimum, Double Jack, and Unfiltered Enjoy By. Probably the mildest in flavor of those."
"One could immediately tell that Hopslam was meant to be a quality beer- the taste and aroma is there- but unfortunately, I think Bell let the 10% alcohol content interfere with the taste. The beer's profile yields a little ""bite"" that becomes distracting as the brew is consumed. A little more smoothness would push this beer into the 4.1-4.3 range."
"I know that this is a really highly though of IPA but I have to be honest, to me after trying it several times it feels like it's overrated due to the once a year release schedule. I have had IPA's I really much prefer and this one has a tail end of tastes that just do not work for my palette."
"A new favorite. The 10% alcohol is hidden behind a complex and beautiful array of hops, citrus, and honey."
"My 400th rating and what a deserving brew. Golden and hazy with a slight receeding white head. Stoney and sweet nose that isn’t as prominent as I would have thought. Much more malty and alcohol tinted than I would have thought with medium bitterness but pretty decent. Thinner with ample carbonation. I give this props for the 10% but Imperials have moved past this in terms of flavor, nose and look for sure."
Appearance:
Beautiful deep rose gold color with white cap.
"Although this doesn’t scream HOPS, it still has good flavor and good balance. The honey is a nice touch and helps smooth out the alcohol of the double ipa. I don’t think I ever tried this beer at its peak hype, but I’m always looking to try it out every year."
Courtesy pour from Justin at Industry Public House! Nicely balanced all around for all IPA. Definitely a good one for a warm day... Our any day for that matter!
"The real deal. A beautiful Amber with a razor thin head belied a deep bitter with pine nuts and grapefruit hints, not overly citrusy but an excellent blend. The alcohol was hidden but hope stood out. Hop heads should go for this bad boy."
"Certainly very enjoyable beer here. This is a west coast ipa through and through. The hops are leafy and earthy, with a nice burn. The mouthfeel is terrific, super creamy. Very good."
"Fresh-smelling citrus, tropical-perhaps pineapple, with a touch of pine. Hazy golden amber with a tall slightly off-white thick head, that fades slowly with plenty of lacing. Smooth initial taste, plenty there providing a body under the hops - perhaps the honey?, citrus, middle is a bit bitter, with a strongly bitter finish and aftertaste. Very well balanced with plenty of malt supporting the hops and very slightly sweet from the honey. Moderately thick mouth feel. Bitter with a moderation from the malts and honey in the finish, eventually transitioning to a bitter lingering aftertaste. An excellent ""old school"" DIPA with the extra smoothing and sweetness added by the honey. Well worth the reputation and the price."
Poured from a can into a pub glass
"Maybe my rating makes no sense (all 4.25 with a 4.50 overall), but this is such a damn consistently good beer. Very old-school, though, for what that's worth."
"Pours a reeeeally pretty clear dark gold, nicw thick foamy head that dissipates after a few minutes but covers the glass with sticky lacing. Smells pineapplely with some pear and green apple, i barely detect the honey but its there. Taste was a lil mehh for me as there wasn't much to make it stand out from many others. Really well balanced but there's no explanation point anywhere that brings the hype. Grapefruit and pine, but not too bitter or astringent, not too sweet either which i find a problem with a lot of dipas. No honey taste for me. Mouthfeel was spot on though, you knew you were drinking a hefty beer on abv but still extremely smooth and perfect balance between crisp and sticky. Overall great beer but will probably be the last hopslam i buy, way too pricey. Price analogy: If two hearted and hopslam were in school, two hearted would be the kid that put their time in studying but went to the bar every night, got laid and still got an A; hopslam lived in the library 24/7 and got an A+... id rather chill with two-hearted."
Canned 1/16/18
Strong but smooth finish. A tad sweet
"This beer is drinking swell this year. 1/2 finger of head in a pint glass, tight bubbles of foam around the edges. The beer smells wonderful. This has always been a particular strength of Hopslam. Smells like pineapple. Taste is a little more bitter than would be ideal, big pineapple on the back palate. Hop bite is real. Don't expect your wife or girlfriend who drinks fruited Berliners to enjoy more than a nip of this Light to slightly above light feel. Not a problem for the style."
Great golden look with large foamy head. Nose is a bit light but great tropical aroma. Delicious balanced taste. Citrus and hops with the honey keeping the bitterness in check. Wonderful DIPA.
"I've purchased this beer yesterday, it was canned on January 18th. It's a well balanced beer, the foam head is very similar to two hearted ale and the honey addition give's it a good bittersweet felling at the end of every sip."
One of the most overrated and over-hyped beers of all time.
Really enjoy this year’s more than last year’s. But who can say (given that it was just available yesterday in Savannah) ? #thefresherthebetter
"Simply put, the best beer on the planet"
Flavor profile is quite similar to many DIPAs out there. The touch of honey matched the beer very well though and didn't come through too strongly.
"This is an exceptional IPA! I have never experienced the smell or the taste of any other IPA, compared to this one to date! You will not be disappointed!"
"1/16/18 canning, arrived in South Carolina around 1/25"
"2018 batch. Excellent! Brewed with honey, but not overly sweet. Leaves a really nice, kind-of-a-sticky-sweet aftertaste under the back of the tongue. I don't like overly sweet, or fruity brews. This did not disappoint. Drink straight outta the can. If I could actually find my snifter I would've used that. You will not be disappointed. Grab some while it's available."
"Just a really really good double IPA. Strong grapefruit flavor, piney aroma"
A nice smooth but strong IPA w/loads of hoppy flavors - wish it was not just seasonal.
Had this last year but not as fresh-I got this years MUCH fresher at 8 days old. Amazing citrus/malt aroma. You can tell it's a 10% beer-def a little boozy even for a DIPA. One of the few DIPAs' I've had that 'blooms' nicely as you get to the bottom with no skunk at all. Another winner from Bells.
"I assumed this beer was overhyped but I was wrong. Let me start this by saying I do NOT like IPAs and do I did not expect to like this. Pour is a really nice light golden color with a good head that recedes but lingers throughout. Honestly the smell is my least favorite part of this beer because it reminds me of straight up pine. But the taste... man it is delicious. And to reiterate, I really, really do not like IPAs or even most light beers, but this stuff is exceptional. It’s the perfect balance of bitter and sweet. The hops are definitely really prominent but it’s also got a really smooth, sweet wave that’s predominately honey with a bit of that pine scent coming through. I would never guess this is a 10% beer either, which only adds to the overall greatness. It feels great in the mouth, light and smooth and easy to drink. "
"A bit let down from this. I don’t see this being a borderline world-class brew. Although it is very well balanced, Hopslam is missing something for me. "
Canned 1/9/18; drank 1/26/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"Beautiful golden-amber color with a nice inch or so of foam after pouring it into a pint-glass... I have had it on draft and from a can both recently, and it is just delicious... Beautiful hop aroma and taste, but oh-so-smooth with that malty backbone... Love it!"
Pour from a can into a pint glass. Amber color with fluffy white head that held on. Nice lacing. Excellent hop bitterness and strong notes of honey. Really enjoyed this one.
"Very enjoyable DIPA!! I love DIPAs and this deserves a high rating! I have crystal Spiegelau IPA glasses, but will leave the details to others much more qualified. ;-)"
"Looking at this honey makes me think about hazy shit being like the millennial girls not knowing how to dress like a woman. It sure don’t smell as fresh as the new ones, but it comes heavy with the dried cutie mandarin bubble gum smacking. Honey get a little funky and bitter by the end, but that’s okay. That’s what got you started."
"Good head, creamy, 3 finger. Body is a gold amber with a strong dark orange mid body. Smell is of hops, pine, maple, floral, as well as tropical fruits such as pineapple, peach and even some serious sweet notes. Its hard to pinpoint these sweet notes of taste due to my virgin IPA tongue of only two years, but this one is giving off a strong essence of sweet. The strong booziness is there, but not as recognizable as you would surmise. The taste is definitely similar to the taste in exception to the sweetness. Fantastic IPA for its first round, would buy again most def and definitely deserves a second or even third try. Cheers!"
Its living off it's reputation
"Pours a slightly clear but mostly hazy honey gold with a small white head. Smells of hops, citrus, and malt. Tastes of very bitter hops, a light sweetness, some malt, citrus zest, and lots of pine. Medium-heavy sticky body with medium-light carbonation. Overall a very tasty DIPA but kind of overhyped."
"Very big beer here. Balanced very nice between the hop load and the big malt load. Alcohol hides except when it warms. Exceptional with one issue, the price point. There are better out there for the price."
"Quite fresh, can date of... looks like 1/8? Not super legible."
Very well made beer. Amazing citrus smell as well as a great citrus taste. Also a very sweet beer but not overwhelming. Booziness is prominent but not in a bad way. Try it if you find it.
"Really good, smooth tasting iipa. 10% abv goes unnoticed. $18 a six pack just seems a little steep. I've had better for cheaper."
"Love this beer! Drank out of an imperial pint glass and poured from the 1.32 gallon mini keg. Two finger head that settled down to a thin layer after a couple of sips. The lacing is crazy, this beer left the inside of my glass looking like it was covered in soap suds. On the nose I am getting a lot of sweet floral notes as well as a bit of piney resiney goodness. On mouthfeel I am getting a surprising creamy texture and the co2 hits at the end. As to taste this beer is perfectly balanced, full bodied with enough bitterness to cut the honey which I was a bit afraid might add a bit too much sweetness. I’m getting a lot of citrus stone fruit and pine on the finish. I must say this is an excellent beer and wish it was available year round."
"12oz canned 1/10/18 poured into a Hopslam snifter at fridge temp 10% ABV. The beer pours bright honey amber in color with sticky off white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and island leaving substantial lacing. The aroma is sweet caramel, citrus and pine. The taste is sweet caramel and honey flavors moving into sharp and clear piney bitterness. The booze in the aroma and taste comes out as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and somewhat dry in the finish. Overall, very good. All of these classics have a hard way to go compared to recent DDH bombs. Very enjoyable as an annual treat."
Not really worth it @$18.00 a six pack of cans .
"I give this a high rating only despite the hops, not because of them. The flavors are wonderful except for the hoppy pine and bitterness. "
"1/16/18: 12 ounce can packaged 1/10/18 @ 15:51,purchased at Jewel Osco on State ($15.99 six pack + tax) poured into standard pint glass. Copper Orange pour, two finger head, Nice hops aroma, not overwhelming, balanced by pine, orange and malt. Hops much stronger / dominant in the taste area. Some balance with the pine, orange and malt, but the hops kicks all other tastes asses. Excellent firm mouth feel, bitter and pleasurable, texture firm, smooth going down. Nice kick you don't realize as you first begin drinking. Love this type of beer, this one is an excellent offering, glad I finally was able to snag with other cans anxiously waiting to join the first. Well done, Bells!"
"A beautiful foamy hoppy opaque orange body as it pours into a Backwoods Bastard Snifter. Aroma is of orange and pine with some subtle honey malts. The taste is of orange rind, honey malts, and pine along with tongue piercing hoppy sensations."
"The best DIPA available in Michigan and possibly anywhere. I see a lot of negative comments about this beer and can not understand why. Maybe I'm unable to locate ""better DIPAs"" here in Michigan because they're not available here? If you want to change my mind please suggest a better DIPA and I will give it a try. Also, before making such comments be sure you've tried this beer fresh, under 2 months old, because it goes bad very fast!"
I like it a lot
Totally drinkable 10% DIPA. Dangerously smooth.
This is one of my favorites that I always look forward to. Poured from a 12 oz. can into a pint glass this yields a clear golden colored beer with a solid finger and a half of light tan colored crown. The smell is dank and resinous while the taste brings in the sweetness of the honey to really make a great brew. Wet and sticky mouthfeel. I love it.
A really good blend of hops and malt with a kick off honey to add just a little sweetness to balance the hop bitterness. Love it.
The name is appropriate as the presence of hops in this brew slam the taste buds. It's pretty high in alcohol which is fun sometimes but it's just slightly too bitter to experience for this kind of enjoyment. It's very well made from a great company and I do recommend it as something worthwhile to sip once in a while if you're a big fan of hops.
I thought this was good but there are plenty of dipa's available year around that are on a par with this one.
Poured from a 12oz can.
"Incredible IPA! Tasted from bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy gold with white head. Excellent aroma of oranges, grapefruit and flowers. Taste is bitter but incredibly balanced for a double IPA. Citrus and floral tastes with a mild sweet honey tastes. Very smooth and drinkable. Dangerously good with that high of an ABV. I definitely approve."
The most recent release was not as good as the last few. Normally an exceptional beer.
Dark cloudy straw color with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is mild hoppy with fruity accent. Taste is also a mild hoppy with fruit and a slight honey taste.
Nectar of the gods. The fact that it always comes out in short supply around my birthday makes me a very poor (and rather fat) man at that time every winter.
12 oz can poured into a Duvel tulip. At this time the beer is probably not anywhere close to its full potential as I bought and drank this can months after the package date! I was just happy that the store still had cases of it so long after production.
"She pours a light golden color and leaves the same colored body. A half finger white foamy head appears and lasts for about a half minute. Light sticky foamy lacing appears. The smell has a ton of piney hops (holy hops, Batman! - could there be any more in the smell?), citrus, and some light honey (more so as the beer warms). Light caramel and a slight malty presence comes in later in the beer. The taste has a large amount of bitter and sweet between the previously mentioned flavors. A bit of spiciness comes through as the beer warms. On the palate, she sits about a medium with nothing sharp on the tongue. This has got to be one of the smoothest DIPA’s I’ve ever had. The 10 % ABV is hidden very well, as I almost feel like I could pound this all day, very sessionable. The aftertaste is piney and the finish is sticky and bitter. Overall, big wow from me as this is an exceptional beer for its style and for me."
"Not many brews can have a mouth-watering taste, and have over 8% abv. It's practically a state holiday when Hopslam comes out each year! This beer is truly amazing. I don't say that without cause. The honey taste is sweet, but the underlying IPA bitterness really adds to the overall complexity. There's a series of events for your taste buds to experience with this one. This year's price was around $20.00 a 6 pack. I'm not a wealthy man, but I bought 8 where and when I could find them. It's worth a trip to their brewery, as well. They have several world class beers, and I don't see them slowing down. If you're truly a beer ""snob"", this one will put you on the edge of your seat! Enjoy!!"
"A - White airy head, light amber/orange and murky with active bubbles."
Pours a very nice honey color. With a little bit of head that fades rather quickly. 
Unique can data: 17142 PKGD 13:50 012317 130655
"Liked the second one better than the first, great hoppy flavor and the honey is just right. Nice Aroma and mouth feel. The Hoppiness is hidden some by the honey but the overall taste is great."
"This is my first time trying hopslam, and it didnt disappoint. The look is a slightly hazy pee yellow (yeah I went there) with not much head or lacing."
"First had poured from 12-oz. can, stamped on bottom, ""PKGD . . . __/12/17,"" gift from friend, into tulip. Not fond of honey in beer, and always a bit doubtful of Simcoe, but the odd elements of this beer add up to a sweet but highly drinkable big DIPA."
I thought this one was absolutely delightful and not as much of a hop bomb as I thought and loved the fact that it was in cans and a 6 pack at that. The smell and flavor of this beer were absolutely delightful and a little more than ordinary. If I did have a complaint about this one was the flavor was great but nothing world class like I thought it would be but other than that I thought it went down smooth and relaxed and was easily 94/100 for me.
"I'd say something about the color, but as I poured from can to glass my eyes immediately crossed. The aromatics on this beer are remarkable. Nice DIPA here, pushing all the right buttons on the taste and smell. Slightly honeyed citrus and highly sessionable. Great dry/rounded finish."
"First off, this may be the most overrated beer on the market. I used to love it, but something happened when Bells decided to can it vs bottle it. The current rendition has light head though does leave nice lacing. The golden color is slightly hazy but pretty clean. "
This is a fantastic DIPA. Dangerously smooth.
"A truly exception DIPA with incredible balance. Of course, year to year it can have some variance, since it's a seasonal release. But, when it's a good year, it is OUTSTANDING. The right blend of ""fruity"" hops and back end bitterness (tiny amount). This is a ridiculously smooth drinking IPA."
Really nice hops. They add hop oil fir a nice finish. Very well rounded and stood up nicely to duck confit. At farmhouse with Daniel 2017
Great beer. Would like it better if it was a little less piney and a little more citrus
"Highly overrated, this was a total malt bomb."
"Pours a dark golden color with a big fluffy white head and a lot of lacing. Smells very piney. Taste is piney hops with an earthy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light. Overall, good but not oh my god amazing."
"Maybe I'm missing something, but this is another beer that I'm not sure how it got rated in the BA250. I've only had the 2017 release, and have heard that prior years have been much better, so this is only the 2017 review."
"Hopslam is a great IIPA, and I'm not a huge fan of the imperial (sweeter) styles of the IPA. What I do respect is their balanced use of honey in this sucker - bittter, fresh (when fresh of course), great citrus-floral impact, good mouthfeel. Will never be my favorite, for sure, but glad I bought a sixer of it when it was out a few weeks ago. SOLID."
"This review is for 2017 canned hopslam, consumed less than 14 days after bottling. Sadly, I am reviewing this year, as this beer was a real gem in the past. One of the interesting characteristics of Hopslam is the noticeable differences year to year. Unfortunately, I found the 2017 Hosplam to be astringent, boozy, and uninspiring. As usual, it is very hop forward, but only in bitterness. I found this year's Hopslam to be unbalanced and leaving an after taste of alcohol like a cheap Vodka. Thankfully, the beer does get better near the end, but hardly worth the wait or price. Temperature variations do not seem to provide any appreciable character. If I had to guess, I'd say mass production has led to the sad state of a beer that was once (for me, at the very least) so sought after."
"ok so i finally had one, much more west coast style to me, very much alcohol in flavor and i know it was 10%, look was more of an amber, clear with a good head and retention, smell did not hit me over head, taste was clean not much citrus and was able to feel the honey presence. feel was a proper carbonation. i would have another sure, did not knock my socks off. was able to secure one can poured into a beer snifter."
"I have been fortunate enough to find Hopslam on tap for the past few years. Always tastes a little better to me from a tap. Tastes more like the Imperial IPA that it is, than when poured out of a can. But, I would never pass it up in any form when I'm lucky enough to find it. "
"A great double IPA. Complex taste that comes from a great hop profile. Aromatic and pours with a nice head that lasts. Smoother rather than crisp, this beer is going g to seem a little boozy. But then again it's a 10% beer. Extremely good."
Poured from 12oz can into tulip. Canned on January 23rd 2017. 
"Had this on tap in a goblet at Mellow Mushroom in Sunset Hills, MO. Beautiful fairly clear dark orange. Remarkably drinkable IIPA is right on the mark. 10% abv and I could not tell it, sweet not too hoppy taste. Easy to see how this beer is so sought after."
Very smooth with an great finish. Also packs a punch
from fresh canning / 12oz
"First pour you get hit in the nose with flowers, pine, earth, a little bit of orange and citrus. Small amount of head that settles somewhat quickly. The taste follows, like drinking flowery citrus. Somewhat dry and oily, not overly so, a touch of malt lingers with tons of hops. The same flavors persist and not much changes. Not much evidence of alcohol heat. Not my favorite hop profile to be honest, and not very complex, it gets old quickly and you want something else."
"Poured Super Bowl Sunday from 12 oz. can; thanks Total Wine! Aroma (not overpowering) of pine and citrus, slightly dark straw color with small amount of foam. Taste is out of the park good; the honey tamps down the hops and that's the main taste, but again not overpowering some malt body and some alcohol. A dangerous 10 % beer, would not recommend having 2 or more at a time for sure! A wonderful example of a double IPA and for me, a top 10 commercially made best beer on earth! Round up score to 4.65!!!"
"Enjoyed this freshly canned. Looks different from your stereotypical DIPA, pretty light bodied with a gold-like hue. Tastes much lighter than expected, most likely due to the honey undertones, and lacks the super hoppy taste that most DIPAs have. Surprisingly refreshing for a 10.5% beer and doesn't have the dry mouth feel to it that many heavy hitter DIPAs have. Overall this is a very good beer, but quite uncharacteristic of a DIPA. I'd certainly drink another one, even though I definitely prefer a West Coast style DIPA over this beer."
Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass.
As good as Good People Snake Handler.
4 weeks old from a can. Excellent example of an old school Midwest IPA: heavy malt backbone with little to no hop aroma or taste. This beer is a huge disappointment if you enjoy Double IPAs.
"Transparent orange in body with white frothy head. Aroma of citrus, fruit skin, grass, and pine. Tastes of grass, apple skin, citrus, pine, booze. Rather light in body for a big IPA."
Just a
"I think the name and logo are what disappoint hop fans like myself. The color of the beer quickly tells the story, with a golden honey brown appearance that indicates its nature. Though it leans a bit sweet and boozy, it is a good, well-balanced DIPA. It is just more a Ballast Point Dorado than a Heady Topper, and as a result not something I'd recommend if you are looking for a hop slam."
Incredibly complex and delicious flavor. Low carbonation. The honey is noticeable and it is a bit too sweet for my taste. It is also very alcoholic and the alcohol aftertaste comes through. Can only drink one at a time.
Nice clear copper color pour with a good amount of head. The honey makes for a nice change in the finish.
"From a 12 oz can (packaged on what appears to be January 23, 2017) into a tulip."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Stamped can date runs over the bottom lip and is difficult to read, but looks like 1/17/17. From the 2017 batch either way."
4-13
"Had in Syracuse, NY. Nice flavor and not too heavy for a DIpa. Recommend to all heavy IPA fans"
"3 week old can from a friend. This falls very short of my expectations given how much people talk about it. The nose is grassy with heavy malt, no real floral hop flavor at all. The flavor follows suit with so little hop flavor for such a big ipa its embarrassing. I get minimal honey flavor throughout, minimal bitterness. "
L: Brilliant bright copper orange with a creamy white head and some nice fingers of lacing on the glass.
so fresh . I would rate it perfect if it weren't for the honey addition
"Pours a dark golden color, very hazy with a medium white head on top. Can smell a lot of hops along with some citrus. Very hoppy in taste with a sweet after taste, very well balanced."
Better this time then the first time I had it.
"First time enjoying this much hyped (but deserving) beer. Bought a 6-pack at Belmont Station in Portland, Oregon. I used my go to Avery 12 oz tulip glass to assess this beer. "
"I been looking forward to trying this brew for a long time, & until this week nobody ever had it in my area....so you can imagine my surprise when I walked into my local grocer & they had several sixers on the self! I HAD to get it!"
"Excellent beer! Taste is very hoppy with a balanced lingering sweet/bitterness due to the honey. Doesn't taste boozy at all, in fact I wasn't aware of the 10% ABV until after I drank it. Goes down very smooth, easy, and is awesome. I would definitely buy again!"
My first Hopslam so I can't comment on how it's changed over the years. Poured into a pint glass.
"On one hand, I really like Hopslam. It's an odd bird though, it kind of challenges your expectations. It goes down like it's 5-6% ABV, when really it's twice that. Not sure how they do it, very impressive. Some honey sweetness and hop bitterness that is melded together perfectly into a beer that is very craveable."
First time trying this beer...
Been on my hit list for some time now. I was able to find a case at my local beer hub and I grabbed it all up as quick as I could. This IPA doesn't disappoint ... it's a must try .
"2017 from a can. Pours a deep amber with minimal head. Nice lacing. Smell is of sweet malt, slight bitter grapefruit and pine. Taste is exceptional. Grapefruit bitterness, malty and honey sweetness, and some piney bitter dry finish. Nice warming from the alcohol. A little boozier than I remember. Excellent."
Finally happy to get a sixer of this one.
"This is an outstanding beer. There's just a hair more honey sweetness than I like in my IPA, but the citrus and piney tones balance it nicely. It really is a world class IPA. Enjoying tonight on draught in MI, home of Bells."
"Pours a copper orange color with about two fingers of white head that clings a little to the glass. Smells of malts, honey, floral notes, and citrus. Tastes of delicious. Very smooth, just a little hop bite to it, heavily citrus flavors, orange, mango, a little pine at the end, and a solid malt backbone to bring it all together. Well balanced brew. A little pricey for a six pack, okay maybe a lot pricey, but worth it."
"Pours a hazy gold with good foam and lacing. The smell is so nice, loaded with hops, sweet honey, pine, citrus. The taste is very very smooth, this is an IPA that I can really get into, very smooth hops and even pine bite, just a really well balance beer with nothing over the top all just working perfectly. I have to say this is one of my favorite IPA so far, just smooth and well balanced. The finish is mild and clean, very pleasing tastes and leaves you wanting another sip. Very nice beer."
"Much more floral than I remembered from a few years ago. Sticky/chewy, thick head, and the honey is odd to my taste buds but adds to the overall feel. The booziness of this beer is perfectly balanced out by the floral character and piney bite. It's solid to me mainly because it's a 10%er that doesn't lose much of its softness to the alcohol. It's big without being overwhelming. Awesome brew."
"Nice light color which doesnt usually scream the amount of hops that are in this one but it definitely packs a bunch. They honey really balances it out and I was happy to randomly try this in Charleston, SC."
12 oz Tulip
Clear golden bronze with three fingers of off-white head. Leaves heavy lacing. 
"Poured from a 12 oz can package date 01/14/17,into a Cigar City spiegelau IPA glass."
"Pours a dark gold, nearly amber, with a thick creamy head. The head was quite large in size, but fell quickly to form a thin white cap, slightly thicker at the edges. lacing is everywhere with this one. Completely clear, with a small amount of carbonation rising to the top. As always I get tropical fruit with these DIPAs, but the addition of honey makes this a real treat. I get undertones of grass, it's floral, piney, and bitter to go along with the fruit."
Look: Golden bronze in color 1 inch white thick head
"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this before. Orange to amber in color, moderately opaque. One finger of fluffy white foam with good retention. Aroma is floral, earthy, citrus. The taste follows, some citrus and pine from the hops. Big floral, herbal, earthy flavors. Medium-full body, moderate carbonation, creamy. Moderately bitter finish, with slight alcohol heat. Very good."
"Pours deep orange into a tulip, two-inch white head, spotted lacing left behind. Smells of pine, resin, fruit woods, dried citrus peel. New leather and and iced tea mix. Taste is malt forward, followed by bitter (almost acrid) hops. Very strong black pepper on the tongue, almost overpowering. Nice mouthfeel, fine carbonation, smooth. Taste just doesn't do it for me, left with just a harsh, burned flavor to me. Will try again, though."
"First experience with Hopslam today. Big first taste, nice finish. Not alcohol forward like some 10 percenters. Starts strong and gets better in the glass. Deserving of its accolades."
"Canned 1/11/2017. Poured into snifter glass. It pours hazy golden-amber with one full finger of foamy, bright-white head and lacing with nice retention. It smells of sweet malt, honey, peach, and pine. The taste is a wonderful blend of biscuit, sweet malt, bitter hops, honey, and sweet fruit. Rather than one taste at a time, it seems to all happen at once. It's absolutely delicious! This ale is medium-bodied with with a rather thick, creamy feel, with pleasant carbonation, and a punchy 10% ABV that gives it substance. Overall, this is superb DIPA, equally appropriate for casual drinking or paired with a good meal. It absolutely deserves its stellar reputation and world-class rating BA rating."
"This classic pours a golden orange color with a two finger head. Smell and taste are citrus, honey, a little pine, & sweet malt. Everything melds together well for a nice smooth double, easy drinking for 10%."
Beautiful clear pour with a moderate persistent head
Very well balanced. Awesome hop presence and great to drink!
"Slightly hazy, deep orange in color. Foamy head with streak lacing. The aroma is stone fruit, butterscotch, caramel malt, and orange zest. Citrus, fruit, and floral notes in the flavor, along with some sweetness from the honey and malt. Grapefruit and some herbal qualities kick in after the initial fruit taste. A bit of hops bitterness in the aftertaste, along with some alcohol vapor. A very good beer overall."
"Fantastic brew. Pretty pricey, but worth it for an occasional indulgence I guess. Looks like beautiful golden goodness, smells and tastes like the name says-hops. The honey rounds out the bitterness to make a purely smooth beer."
10oz draft pour into a snifter is a bright gold colored body floating a thin and tight white head. Lacing is consistently spotted.
Unconditionally so smooth. Iam a iipa man and indulge daily....so sad i can't get it year round. Absolutely put together perfectly. Any body disagrees aint true to the brew. Peace
"Poured into a Teku. A clear amber-orange color with a resilient and lasting foamy white head. The aroma was full of pine, earthy notes, oranges, and muted bready malt. This was very drinkable for such a big beer - citrus up front with a nice mix of dank, resiny flavor and pine needles. The malt is there and the slight sweetness balances against the warming on the finish."
Wrecking ball
"Just purchased a couple of sixers from Green's in ATL for $35 and change. Thankfully they had it in stock after the other two big stores sold out. I was debating whether or not to buy some this year. In Illinois one can buy as much as one wants,but here in GA one is limited to a six.I took my Boo with me, so she could buy one for me. A few years ago The Slam was special, but now with the proliferation of DIPA's it's just OK. It's extremely balanced and crushable for 10% ABV, but it's not what it's used to be for my tainted buds. I've been ageing them regardless of what the brewer suggests. Bell's still kicks ass."
Very unique beer in a good way. Need more.
"Gold in color with small white head when poured from can into pint glass. Smell is citrus, hops, tropical fruit. Taste is hops, pine, honey, grapefruit pith. heavy mouthfeel. Very good DIPA but not worth the cost of $19.99 for the six pack. Over hyped for sure. To be fair, I've not had other years variations."
Nice hoppy & honey flavor. Good stuff!
Golden peach color.
"Pours a nice clear golden orange, produces as a small off white head that fades away leaving a ring and a nicely laced glass."
Fresh 2016 can (within a week of shipment) poured into a pint glass.
Love it. Every year this brew helps me through January in Ohio. The honey makes it special. I get more of a floral aroma than citrus. There always seems to be a slight menthol taste to it that I really like. It drinks so smooth and that 10% is awesome.
"Got this as an extra in a trade a while back. Always cracks me up when I get a top 250 as an extra! Anyway, this was very good. Glad to know that Bells is distributing to spots in the northeast now so I may luck into it on the shelf."
"Pours a clear gold with orange. Medium, white, lasting creamy had"
"Although gifted with plentiful hops, this is a balanced IPA that hop heads and just flavorful beer lovers will enjoy. I had this on draft, and consider it more refined than Bell's Two Hearted. Wonderful aromas of citrus and herbs, creamy mouth feel and a clean finish."
"Great, look forward to it every year. Dangerously smooth and easy to drink, goes straight yo your head."
Dated: 1/2/17
"First had 2/27/14 at home. I've been lucky enough to get my hands on every years version since college. Although it's not my favorite DIPA, it is one that I will repeatedly go back to. The honey makes it enjoyable."
Very nice shelf hop beer. Was great to try it. Nice hop aroma. Nothing too crazy or complex going on here. Just a nice straightforward IPA. Little boozy but not to crazy.
Had it poured from a 12 oz. can. 
"A heavy dark golden appearance, very thin head on the top 1/5"", retreats quickly. Aroma pushes the honey pale malt edge, for being called hopslam, there is ample sweetness evident. Dry hopping with Simcoe I don't think you see that every day? "
A great DIPA
Just damn good beer.
"This big double IPA definetly has a Midwest swagger to it, the alcohol does linger a little with this big beer, the honey comes through amazingly and balances the beer very well, you definetly get malts and hops big time throughout the beer, I suggest pouring and letting it open for a minute or two with this big double."
"This was once a great beer, not the same the last few years, still very good, but if you had years ago, not the same"
"A real asskicker of a beer. Alcohol sneaks up on you and is deceptive as it disguises itself as the beer is slick and floral. Delicious, layered undertones make me wish I had a second can to fully judge and decode this beast."
"Hopslam is a great beer. I have only had it on tap. The problem with the beer is the scarcity. Vendors purchase the beer and hold it ransom to the highest bidder. A good test for the beer to really see how the masses like it, is to increase production. Once the market is saturated see how the beer rates against the competition."
So good. Loved it.
one of the best beer I never tried it before special the honey one was crazy goog thank you for make this kind of beer
"Consume don May 25th, 2016. Poured from a can celebrating its 4 month anniversary today."
"poured from a can, packaged 1-27-16."
"A little bit disappointed with this one. With all the hype I thought it was going to be something out of this world, but honestly, it didn't really delivered what I would have expected from a world-class beer. Still excellent, just not sure it deserves such a high rating."
I can see why this is a hoppy beer drinkers favorite. Golden Pour with a one inch white head. decent lacing.. Piney citrus smell and taste. Great smooth finish! can't wait to finish these off.
"Not crazy about this beer, yet I buy it every time its released hoping my mind will changed. Very similar to Founders All Day IPA and Centennial. Nothing about it really stands out to me. Its a good IPA, but not worth the hype in my opinion"
"As someone who isn't a hop lover, this beer wasn't THAT bad. There were hints of vanilla and oak, so the beer was surprisingly well balanced, with oakey notes and vanilla. The beer was a golden color."
Bright gold and clear in appearance. Obviously a very strong hoppy flavor. Also some note of vanilla and oak. Full bodied amazing beer. Would definitely order again.
Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter.
12oz can poured into tulip glass:
Very good DIPA. Slightly malty taste but smooth for a 10% ABV. 
This is the pinnacle of the hop cone ! Starts with big flavor hops citrus pines intertwined like dancing leprechauns ! Warms you slowly easing you into your hoppy place . This is a great beer ! 
"The beer is very good. The truth is is too clear and too malty for me. I have acquired a taste for cloudy, unfiltered beers like tree house and tired hands and I feel like these beers are behind the curve a little."
Finally got to try this beast of a DIPA and it lives up to the billing. Total hop bomb yet deceptively smooth.
Someone sent this to me from Ohio and drinking it was a great experience. I poured it into a goblet from a can.
"Pours a slightly orange hint of golden yellow with a magnificent off white head that settles to a thin foam on top of the beer and leaves plenty of lacing throughout the glass. The aroma hits you first: floral and citrusy, with grapefruit and pine and orange marmalade and some jammy berries. Flavor is grapefruit and mango and pine, all topped with heaping amounts of honey and hawaiian rolls. The sweetness of this DIPA is surprising. There's a decent amount of bitterness, but nothing like a typical west coast IPA; similarly this beer lacks the juiciness of the new 'New England' style IPAs. Instead, it strikes out on its own path. Onward."
2016 from a can to a tulip glass
Poured at 51°F from a 12oz can (packaged in 20Jan16) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Consumed on 05Apr16.
Canned 1/27/16
"Has 2 left, figured I would drink and rate it. Poured into a snifter, can version."
"L- deep yellowish orange, hazy. Thin white head, heavy lacing."
"2017 update>>>>>>Well, I have gone through nearly 200 cans of this fine beer this year and I do consider myself an expert on Bells Hopslam. Great beer, always has been. Keep it real Bells because your Hopslam junkies are loyal! Still have a dozen or so but they've taken a back burner to ""Mars"" the latest Bells offering. i have managed to find about 4 cases of this fine beer and I look forward to Bells next!"
Poured from 12 oz can into shaker pint glass.
"A big thanks to the founding father of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. It's great to have a local, in person, trader. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of piney hops, some citrus. Taste is piney, resin, light malts, medium bitterness, alcohol is well hidden. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good beer, but I was expecting to be blown away. I have had better DIPA's."
Appearance: slightly cloudy / hazy. light orange and gold colors. pretty sexy pillowy offwhite head.
A 12 fl oz can with a canned on date of 15th January 2016 (at least as best as I can tell since the dating machine misprinted onto the lip of the bottom of the can). Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.
"Potency thy name is hopslam. A little bit of hops, a little bit of malt, and a lot of alcohol. I'd prefer it if the ABV was toned down a bit to let everything else stand out more, but as is it's still a nice imperial IPA."
"I've been a California red wine guy for the last 8 years, and have started getting into beer again after 20+ years over the last 2 years or so. Fittingly, I've trended towards Imperial Stouts and everything bourbon-barrel aged. Significant amount of hops has been a bit too extreme for my palate. I've trended towards more & more hops lately, and the most forward-jumping progress has been what I tasted in Hopslam, which is appropriately named. I was struck by the balance of the beer, which despite it's overwhelming hops punch allowed me to at no point being overcome by the bitterness."
"Canned 2 months ago, poured in snifter. Pretty clear golden orange appearance. Finger white head that doesn't go away with great lacing. Smell is pretty intense orange zest, honey, and overall very citrusy. Taste matches the smell, but a little more malt foward. Hoppy resin comes through with a hint of citrus. Quite boozy, but ethanol doesn't dominate. Overall a pretty big beer and doesn't disappoint."
"It's great to see a Michigan beer on the top charts. This is a very solid beer, but not the best of the best. It doesn't have the flavor profile of a TreeHouse brew, or the complexity of a HT or Hill Farmstead, but a super alternative. Definitely worth trying. I would agree with the BROS' rating of 94 on this one."
Can dated 10-6-15. Boston shaker. At 16 bit video arcade.
"Pours slightly cloudy, deep amber in color with a well retained one and a half inch head and excellent lacing. Smell is floral,citrus fruits, and honey. Taste is that of ruby red grapefruit, mild hops, honey and a slight bitterness. Very smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Overall an excellent beer."
"On tap when down in Nashville. Pours a hazy orange hue with a cream-colored head. It left behind a few rings of lacing. The aromas have a nice honey scent with some floral, pine and lemon. The taste follows suit with grapefruit, blood orange, melon, citrus, caramel, and honey. The beer is really smooth and finishes clean. Overall this is a great beer and worth seeking out if you have not tried it yet. Cheers!"
"Smell is orange citrus, pine, and honey. Taste mimics the smell fairly closely - citrus, pine, orange blossom, nice malt backbone, and the sweetness from the honey cuts the hop bitterness well. Slightly boozy with a syrupy or oily mouthfeel. I don't think it's worth the trouble that some people go through to get it, but definitely one of the better double IPAs I've had."
12oz can. A 10% alcohol - double IPA where the boozy alcohol taste is no where to be found. I get a lot of fruity flavors although the can says honey on it. This has tremendous flavors with a mild bitter after taste. Dangerously drinkable which has you wanting more.
"Bought a 6 pack of cans from Consumer's Beverages in Kenmore NY, Feb 2016. Poured into a Duvel tulip at fridge temp."
"Billowy white head that leaves a moderate amount of lacing. Sweet candied citrus smell with slight hop undertones; not as effervescent as most IPAs this gravity. Warm alcohol burn with grapefruit, orange, and sweet honey flavor that gives way to a boozy aftertaste on the swallow. The feel is where Hopslam truly excels though; medium-light oily slick mouth feel that is exceptionally smooth and refreshing."
Not much honey flavor but a big flavorful DIPA. Get again
"Really lovely beer. This may be the the IPA for non-IPA drinkers. A hint of bitterness, a hint of sweetness, amazing floral aroma. I am glad to have this...easily on the list to have again"
Business trip took to me to Chicago. I took myself to Binnys.
Had on draft. 
Unreal
This seasonal beer has a warm alcohol taste and mild hop flavor. The hop bitterness rises up to meet the sweet honey and malt however the beer doesn't dry out enough for my preference. Excellent head and lacing. Very clean and crisp. At 10 ABV you want to pace yourself with this one!
Light straw color with an off-white frothy head that sticks around the whole time. Lacing slides along the sides of the glass and the aroma of sweet hops rise up. Pine and floral make up the nose with slight citrus and sweet honey making itself known in the taste. Solid bitterness cut by the honey offer up a smooth DIPA that hits the spot and the head!
"All the talk about this, really excited to have found it on tap at my local bar here in Gainesville. $8 for a snifter later, and here we are. This beer is exactly what it says, a ""slam"" of hops. This beer is so crazy packed with hops, piney, and floral. The alcohol is warming toward the middle, boozey. Sweet like honey toward the end. Really good."
"Rich and aromatic. But this is no fruit bomb, it's all pine and resin with a dash of honey to cushion the hop slam. Dark gold color and a nice viscous mouthfeel with bitterness all around the edge of the tongue that lasts a good 30 seconds."
Poured from 5l mini keg dated 1/28/16 from deciccos in Ardsley. 
Pours a rich orange/light brown with a nice white foamy head.
Fantastic IPA. Packs the punch of a double but without the overwhelming bitterness. Well balanced with a very pleasant nose. Fantastic hoppy taste in the front end.
IPA ... A little bitter for my taste
"L: Pours a mostly clear deep gold with a hint of copper, with a nice lasting white head. Good foam retention and great lacing."
I patiently await this release every year around my birthday. Sooo good.
"Good DIPA, hops hide the alcohol"
Big but balanced (as opposed to Big Butt Balanced: totally different--if not equally cool--condition.)
"Very nice DIPA. You really don't notice the 10% alcohol. Not as hoppy as some other DIPAs, but nicely balanced and very drinkable."
Finally got my hands on a 6pck this weekend. Lots of reviews so I won't say too much. This beer gets a lot of hype but lives up to it. Absolutely great stuff. Just as good as last year's in my opinion. Just wish it was a little easier on the wallet and waistline!
16 oz draft poured into a Budweiser pint glass of all things.
"I do not think this is a fair review because of my taste in beers, but I do not get what all the fuss (and the premium price) is about. It smells good, but was so alcohol forward could barely taste the hops. I prefer the APA and milder IPAs where you can actually taste hops and not get overwhelmed with the booze flavor. Doesn't taste like beer; would rather drink vodka. Glad I was able to buy as a single can, was only able to finish 1/4th of it. As a general disclaimer my wife liked it."
2016 vintage poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.
"Pours a nice, bright deep orange with some haze and about a finger worth of head. Aroma is not as pronounced as I was expecting, yet hop notes are present along with some malt sweetness. Taste is one huge hop bomb with a really nice malty backend that balances it all out nicely and the feel is perfect for a double IPA."
"Pours a clear deep gold or pale amber producing 2 fingers of off-white, moderately lasting, frothy head that leaves a nice coating of lace. Aroma is almost equal amounts of grapefruit & resinous pine, backed by caramel malt, a hint of honey, with orange & pineapple well defined in the mix. Taste is caramel malt, orange, grapefruit & pineapple swimming in a sea of pine resin. A hint of honey. Very bitter finish & aftertaste. Incredibly balanced for such a hop heavy brew. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied, rich, smooth & thick with moderate carbonation."
One of the best ipa's out there. Get it if you can.
"Poured into my favorite glass, my Lost Abbey stemmed tulip, canned on 1/28/16. Pours a perfect bright orange with a 2 inch sticky white head that leaves nice lace behind. "
Can Date: 2/1/16
great beer. hops very present here i mean the logo says it all which i love!
Nice head. Nice hops to a light honey finish.
"Great IPA. Chorus and passion fruit aroma. 10% ABV kick with a very drinkable ipa flavor. Love it, but can't afford a case"
"Finally had a chance to try this one and the wait was worth it. What more can I say that has not been said a million times before about this beer? The one thing I will say is that I was worried this would be a little too sweet for me, but not at all. It's just about perfect"
"Canned on 2/1/2016. Body is a nice bright golden orange color, slight hop haze with a good amount of carbonation streaming up towards a tightly packed off-white head. The alcohol legs post up immediately along the sides of my snifter. Upon first smell, I got nothing. Swirling the glass opened the beer up a little, but I was still hunting for what I was smelling. Sweet caramel malts, honey, candied citrus, spicy pine, apricot and faint tropical notes. Good mouth feel on this one; an initial spritz of carbonation makes the beer feel light but it transitions towards a chewier consistency. A nice sweet citrusy flavor throughout with a nice lingering aftertaste. Not overly sweet and doesn't feel bitter at all. On the taste I get a lot of honey comb, grapefruit, canned clementines, caramel, pine, a sweet maltiness, and spicy herbal hops. Never really understood the hype for this one."
12 ounce can poured into a snifter
This is as good as advertised. The look and feel were as expected. Smelled delicious.
"12 oz Can dated 012016 @ 17:06, tasted 022416 @ 18:36"
"Poured into a tulip glass. Amber hue, slight cloudiness and a nice format head that left white lacing on the glass between sips. Aroma is mellow... Honey and hops. The taste...wasn't blown away at first but by the 3-4 sip this Bree starts to shine. Beautifully balanced, a touch honey sweet and extremely drinkable... Like sessionable. Damn good ale I finally had the chance to try"
Look - A glowing golden honey color. Hazy in the glass. 
Overly carbonated pour that makes a 3 finger head. Dark honey color.
This was a nice Double IPA. 
"Pours clear golden honey with small white head, smells of citrusy pine slight florally sweetness from honey, tastes of pine and citrus with florally honey and slight alcohol bite, mouthfeel is smooth medium bodied, carbonation is moderate, finish is lasting and bitter."
Cans! Also first time.
Great brew
Aftertaste is so so
My first Hopslam. Very well balanced with a hint of honey on the backend. I got it on draft a day before the retail release. Very good ipa.
"A very enjoyable, well balanced beer. Pours a fizzy golden orange but carbonation is normal. Head lasts a while for such a high ABV. Lots of grapfruit and melon on the nose. Is a little sweet but still crisp and relatively easy to drink all things considered. Bitterness is there but balanced. A pleasure to sip on. The hop flavor is citrusy and a hint of honey and melon. Not super hoppy or dank like more modern DIPA's. I think I'll take this over ruination 2.0 or some of the hoppier big IPA's running around lately."
"look - looks delicious, golden color with 3 inches of white head."
"Pours - cloudy orange copper color, massive white head that seems will never go away great lacing one of the best looking pours I have had."
This is my second year drinking Hopslam. About time I did a review.
"Consumed 27 days after canning from a tulip glass. The pour was a mild hazy tint with golden/orange color. The head was very light, white, and lacy. Absolutely great hop aroma. First sip was a delicious hop taste. Overall, most favorable dipa to date. Perfect citrus notes."
"Well, I had to fly to Puerto Rico for two days worth of business meetings to finally have a chance to try Hopslam. It was worth it. I took a Taxi to La Taberna Lúpulo and asked if they had Hopslam...""on tap or a can?"" is what I heard in response. I begin to tear up."
"12 oz can. Pours bright orange with slight haze, the finger fluffy white head, fades slowly. Big fruity hoppy aroma with sweet malt touch. Delish balanced taste of juicy fruity hops, honey sweetness, nice malt backbone. Bitterness comes in at the end, mostly citrus peel with a bit of pine. Medium creamy soft mouthfeel, touch of alcohol. Very good DIPA, just like I remembered it."
Great fresh aroma and a clean honey plus citrus taste. Excellent.
"Pours clear, orange-brown in color with one inch head. Taste is wet hops, orange, citrus, and hemp. Super tasty, nice mix of bitter and sweet. Worth every bit of hype. This is a delicious IPA. Do not taste the alcohol. I could drink this all night. Right up there with my favorite beers from a great brewery. I will fight tooth and nail to find this next year. Just an amazing beer. About as good an imperial IPA as can be."
Hoppy and good.
"L: nice orange body, clear, off white head with good retention and lacing"
"Caveat - this beer stuck being compared with my Tree House score last week, and Julius in particular -- perhaps not fair."
"finally landed a 6 pack of Hopslam. I curbed my expectations as i felt it was going to be a bit overhyped but was still really excited to try it. pours clean and golden. smell is malty and sweet like honey, hop character is there as well. taste is very sweet up front with hop bitterness on the back. does a very nice job of hiding the 10% but this beer failed to live up to my expectations. glad to have tried it but for how difficult it is to grab and the price tag i will likely pass in the future."
"Very easy drinking DIPA. I get more spiciness than sweetness. Superb full-bodied feel. Not as citrusy as I'd like, but still a decent amount of hop punch. Solid."
"This used to be one of my favorites. I'm having trouble grasping whether my palate has changed or whether this beer has lost a little bit (as it becomes more mass distributed). Still a very solid IPA, but hard to understand the price tag associated which is north of $20 for a six pack. "
Great - but the boozi-ness overpowers the hop flavor a bit
"I finally had my first Hopslam at George Keeley's in NY, NY! They got it two days ago and were almost tapped out. I made it just in time and had two of them. Here's what I thought."
A: [4.00] Very transparent orangish color. Forms a big 2 finger head of dense white bubbles. The can lists the ABV (10.0%) and there is a born on date (01/28/16).
L: Nice golden amber with a head that sticks around.
"Hop Slam is a refreshing XXIPA. Be careful it is smoothness, aroma, and overall mouth feel will make you want to drink the six pack, however it's ABV is 10. Great unique beer!"
"A- dark, hazy golden pour, maintained white fluffy head "
Fanfuckin tastic
"2/1/16 can poured into snifter glass. Crystal clear dark amber liquid with a solid head and good retention. Aroma is piney upfront with light floral and grassy notes in the background. A quick swirl reinvigorates the head and releases sweet notes of honey and malt. The aroma is big and hoppy, but not overpowering. It's meant to be enjoyed, not to knock you out."
Juicy
"Pours a beautiful hazy honey sunset, topped with fluffy off white pillow that sinks slow leaving scattered lacing. "
Poured out of a 12 oz can into a tulip glass. 
"Pours crystal clear amber with a foamy white cap of head that retains well, some lacing but not much."
"Light golden appearance thick head. Smells of light hops and a little honey. Taste is pretty subdued. Certainly doesn't wallop you with hop flavor. Pretty nice to have that subtle hop flavor. Not a fruity hop, more a flowery, grassy. Nice sweetness from the honey. Taste of the alcohol in there. Overall, glad to pick up a six pack this go around. Pretty decent beer."
A - nice golden orange amber color that's clear with a good white head that sticks and leaves nice lacing
"Pour: 12oz can poured into a tulip glass. Appearance: Golden orange with thick white head. Aroma: Hoppy grapefruit and citrus notes. Subtle alcohol notes, but not overpowering considering the ABV. Doughy malt notes appear over the intense hops. Taste: Straight forward hoppy and slightly malty. Warming boozy effect on the way down. Surprised at the subtleness given the ABV. Aftertaste: Balanced and warming on the back end. I very much liked this one and was amazed by the drinkability given the ABV."
Revisited 1/23/18 
Delicious and aromatic. Grapefruity but not intense
"Poured from a can dated January 12, 2017. It pours a golden amber with two fingers of white head. There is excellent lacing. The smell is sweet, hops, honey, malty, and everything. It's not like most any other IPA. The taste is sweet, bitter, hoppy, pine, and citrus. Very nice, smooth mouthfeel. Overall an outstanding beer every DIPA fan should search out. There are very few, if any, beer out there like this."
"Pours honey orange with decent head. Aroma is ""hoppy"" but i think the simcoe that is not my favorite aroma. Hops and malts pretty balanced and i do get a little honey, but just underwhelming flavor profile. Finishes a bit boozy too. I generally am pretty close to the average rating for top beers, this is a rare outlier, bit disappointing for a top 200 beer"
Another great beer from Bells
Poured from a can into a tulip glass
"i am having this years hopslam after my first taste of hop juju, maybe not fair sampling after such a great ale as hop juju. last year i had hopslam on tap on opening day, was far better on tap than bottled or canned. no big surprise. i was kind of disappointed last year after that experience. but still a great ale."
2 cans will get you going!
"Hopslam is somewhat of a unique animal. Honey isn't typically part of the mash for an imperial IPA, but it seems to work here. The honey does more than lend a large amount of easily fermentable sugar, the flavor and aroma of clover honey comes through when drinking it. Head was pretty substantial upon the pour, a mix of medium and small sized bubbles, bright white, topping an amber colored and lightly hazy liquid beneath."
"Poured hazy light orange with one finger white head that had good retention and lacing. Scent was subtle pine, citrus with sweetness. Flavor was a pine, grapefruit, with noticeable sweet malty character with lingering boozy after taste that didn't overpower. Good, not worth chasing trucks for though."
HopSlam pours a lovely light shade of amber. It's pretty clear with a smooth and tightly knit yet large foamy head resting on top. It has excellent retention and lacing.
Clear orange with a white head and spotty lacing. Smells sweet and dank with the faint scent of honey. The taste is malty sweet with honey and really nice bitter hops. Really nice beer.
Look: Semi-hazy amber-orange with a few bubbles a tight white creamy head that leaves sheets of lacing.
"Fairly good double ipa. Big malt backbone. Bitter, gritty finish (you can feel the amount of hops on your teeth). This IPA tastes dated (I had a fresh glass on tap). It isn't very fruity, tropical or dank. I guess this is east coast vs. west coast. I would have to say that east coast / midwest, at least Michigan is falling majorly behind west coast IPA's, esp. California. I can think of a dozen better IPAs in California off the top of my head."
2016 can poured into tulip glass. Love that smell.
"Have been getting this for years now and i have to say it is CONSISTENTLY ONE OF THE BEST DIPA EVER BREWED, PERIOD! Worth the $ and i'm happy to see its getting more distribution as the years go on. Everyone should try this! Solid 5.90"
"Pours a clear honey colored yellow with a full wispy head of small bubbles. Smells of honey and pine with some tropical fruit. Taste exactly how it smells with an alcohol finish. The beer is crisp and delicious. Overall I love this beer, but the price is over the top. Oh well once a year."
"Simply incredible. In the world of double IPAs, Hopslam is a king. Hop forward, balanced, and insanely drinkable despite the abv. This is a must try if you have never had the pleasure. Tropical, piney, and grassy hops dominate. The honey provides a slightly sweet and smooth finish. Just an amazing IPA. Get it if you can."
Appearance: Crystal clear golden orange that pours a two finger pearl colored head. Very nice lacing down the glass.
"Just came across this elusive elixir for the second time. This time I had it from a can, last year I had the bottle. This stuff is amazing. Hoppy, strong, and subtly sweet; very drinkable. Bells in general is hard to come by in the NY/NJ area but I found it at Press 195 tonight in Bayside Queens! Salud!!"
"APPEARANCE: Golden to orange. Finger+ of off white foamy head. Small amount of tiny bubbles rising. Nice, thick lacing down the glass."
"Sampled on 2/11/16 from can dated on box ""1/8/16"" from pint glass. Aroma: initial aroma dominated by pine hops and hop resin. Aroma develops to reveal moderate malt sweetness (Carmel) and bubble-gum fruity (pineapple, pear, tropical fruit) hop aromas. Appearance: moderately clear with light cloudiness. Copper color. Good head retention with 3/4"" just off-white head that persists for 5+ minutes leaving film that persists. Heavy lacing. Flavor: moderate malt sweetness combined with high levels of hop flavor - clashing. Balance is hop forward. Yeast characteristics of ""clean"" American ale strain. Finish is moderately sweet and persists. Hop flavors of pine and sweet fruit (bubble gum, pineapple, tropical fruit, stone cherries). High hop bitterness. Mouthfeel: medium-heavy body. Medium carbonation. Very slight alcohol warmth. Moderately creamy - coating mouth. No astringency or acidity. Overall: high levels of malt and hops and alcohol muddle flavors. Consider lowering dextrinious malts, mash at lower temp to reduce sweetness in finish and allow hops to be expressed. A fair attempt at a difficult style that has fierce competition. Cloying sweetness and lack of standout hop aroma and flavor don't make me a fan. This beer seems to have quite the following, perhaps I got a bad can?"
Used to love this ! But idk ? It seemed to lack the aroma of hops and the aftertaste seemed flat almost metallic . Not sure if it was because of it being in a can ? Idk . I wouldn't pay 17.99 for a 6 pack of this again. Its definitely way overpriced .
Poured from a can.
"This beer pours a hazy golden copper color with a huge, pillowy off white head. The retention is amazing and there is tons of spotted lacing. Smell is subtle yet complex. Orange and grapefruit along with floral and a slight bit of pine in the hop department and some sweet and caramel malts. The taste is similar, but one person's balanced is another person's muddled, and to me this seems a bit more of the latter. Also a bit on the sweet side. Feel is medium to full and really coats your whole mouth. Overall a nice beer, but I'm a little let down. The hops really seem like they would be the star of the show from the aroma, but instead of the malt just kind of cutting out the bitterness, they really kind of weigh down the hop flavors."
"L: clear, golden yellow with a huge white foamy head."
Poured from a 12 oz. can into a tulip glass.
"Finally got some Hopslam now that Bell's is in TN. Pours a beautiful golden-orange color with a nice thick off-white head that slowly dissipates. Smell is of fresh hops, but not overwhelmingly so. Flavor is less hoppy than the smell, due to the combination of sweetness from the honey and the slight tinge of warmth from the higher abv. Mouthfeel is good, nice blend of carbonation and not-too-thin substance. Good stuff but not mind-blowing, for me."
"I'm sick of all the ""beer know it all"" that are too cool for school. It's that good...I collect small batch to large batch and enjoy all good beer. But like anything else...when something gets hype and becomes too mainstream, everyone wants to find something wrong with it. It's fucking wonderful...enjoy and find something else to bitch about."
"Been looking for this bad boy ever since I joined onto BA. But being that I live on the West Coast, it's almost been more of a myth than an actual beer. Now that Bell's has expanded West, it's time to give it a try. Will it live up to the hype or will it pale in comparison to other amazing west coast hop bombs?"
From a can during this year's production. 2015/16 Hopslam.
"Pours amber orange with a one finger head. Nose is pine and citrus. Taste is much the same with pineapple and orange being the dominant flavors. Feel is excellent, rich and full. Medium carb. Alcohol is hidden well. Overall, a very good DIPA. My first experience with Hopslam. Feel is where this brew excels. Though I'm not convinced it's worth the hype it receives given that IMO there are other DIPAs as good as this and more readily available."
"On tap, fresh keg. "
Poured from a can dated (02/01/16) into a pint glass
Excellent
"poured the color of golden honey, with a solid head. i would have said that not knowing there was honey in here, but it helps."
"Ok, so I feel this beer is getting a mixed result. I love IPAs. I love double IPAs. I enjoy the easy drinkability, the flavor profile, and the hop characteristic of the style. This beer is far and away one of the top doubles I have ever tasted. The look is a dark amber color and the smell is citrus and pine. The taste... so this is where I have to pipe up. Some people hate the sweetness that the honey entails. I love it. It cancels out the bitterness that the hops bring but doesn't stop from the citrus profile that the hops in this double are known for. Again, I love it. It is not the double IPA that some might think it is. It is not hop forward like most in this style, but it adds another layer that most don't have. It is one of my favorites. The price point is a bit high but for a once a year release, I can't stop picking up a couple six packs. This is one fantastic beer. I can understand how some might hate the sweetness, but for me, this is a top 10 beer of all time easy."
"From a 12 oz can, pours clear. The color is...well...honey-colored. Huge 4-finger pillowy off-white head lasts long enough that I'm getting impatient to drink this sucker. Plenty of lacing. Smell isn't huge, but has a lot going on: grapefruit, orange, pine, ripe melon, honey, some toffee malt. Taste gets all that in there, with some sweetness battling it out with bitterness, and the bitter wins, and rightly so. Rich mouthfeel. Great beer."
"Finally got a chance to try the acclaimed Hopslam, and was not disappointed. Look is a copper-ish golden, surprisingly clear given it's unfiltered canning state. Giant, pillowy, white head that lingered throughout its consumption, leaving a sticky film all the way down the glass. Smell is equal parts sweet and dank, with heavy tropical fruit, pine, citrus, honey and clover. First read off the tongue is sweet honey and burnt sugar, with bittersweet grapefruit and pine following, huge biscuity malt and toffee rounding and balancing things out. The flavors come in waves and then abruptly end with just a moderate, pithy bitterness in the aftertaste. Wonderful. Feel is silky and thick, syrupy and coating. About as perfect a IIPA texture as I can imagine. Really awesome beer that's worthy of the hype and very memorable in a crowded category. Happy to add this to a short list of special release beers I'm willing to go searching for each year."
"Pours a hazy, golden amber with a foamy, good sized head on top. Plenty of lacing left behind. Ripe mango and hops make up the aroma. The taste is a fantastic subtle battle between sweet malt, citrus, and honey, and piney and floral hops. Absolutely superb contrast between the two. Mouth feel is exceptional. It coats the mouth, while still remaining smooth and easy to drink. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. I now wish I had picked up more. "
"pours vibrant golden out of a 10 day old 12oz can. strong creamy head. strongest side to this beer is the powerful ripe mango aroma which does not fade. the body is not as malty as some have said, in fact quite balanced for 10%abv. as beer warms up it continues to drink pleasantly. flavors are mild pine, rum, sage and honey yes. the hoppy finish lingers. paid close to $5 for this can, pricey, but this one was worth the wait."
This seems much maltier than I remember from past years. Very dark color. Hops are very forward and changes as it warms. I remember there being much more honey in past years. Feel is average. I think I might sit on a couple of these for awhile to see if it changes.
"You can really smell and taste the honey as this beer warms up. Last year I could really tell the 10%, but this year it's barely noticeable."
Thank you ThisWangsChung!
"Lovely deep orange, Two and a half fingers of fluffy long-lasting head. Smells of citrus. Delicious citrusy taste with some honey. Taste lingers well. Exceptionally smooth and creamy as it goes down, with no indication of the high alcohol content. Wonderful!"
Finally got to try the infamous Hopslam. 12oz can poured into a tulip. 
It's good; don't get me wrong. But to me it is rated on this site a lot higher than it should be.
Probably the best DIPA that I've tried so far. It is a crime that this beer is only seasonal and very limited. Hopslam is a pure hop joy! Because that it is limited and seasonal you'll probably would only drink it super fresh. All other DIPAs should be judged by this one.
Poured from can into pint glass-
"L: crystal clear, somewhere between a russet, gold, and amber. "
"Pours a murky dark orange with a one finger, creamy head. Citrus hop smell with pine and malt smell. A wonderful, dank pine and citrus hop taste with nice malt that allows for bitterness to win. Definite honey on the back end. Bitter funk resonates up the nose. A good, dank IPA."
"One of the best DIPA. Smooth, fruity, sweet"
"Pours a beautiful amber color. The head is three fingers high and slightly off-white in shade. While not the densest texture-wise, retention is pretty good. TONS of lacing sticks to the glass, literally tons. "
"Wonderful color, creamy deep foamy head smell very complex taste and feel very balanced very very good beer!"
"January 20, 2016 enjoyed February 6, 2016 in a Hopslam tulip. "
"Poured from the can, Hopslam is a nice burnt orange with sticky white head that lasts til the bottom of the glass. It is much hazier than I remember; there's no seeing through the glass. The aroma has medium ripe mango, pineapple, and sticky, resiny pine backed up by a seemingly strong malt backbone with low caramel notes. It doesn't exactly leap out of the glass but definitely smells nice. "
"Been drinking this since 2006, always one of my favorites. I, for one, feel that it has been fairly consistent year after year, and it surely never lets me down. Lots of new beer drinkers think it is all hype, but other than in a few new beer drinking circles, and a buncha threads on BA around January, this beer really doesn't get that much hype. Sure it sells out quickly in some areas, but that's just because people like it."
great floral smell. goes down smooth. hint of honey. Bell's has yet to disappoint. It's pretty clear why they are considered a world class operation.
"Poured from can into 13 oz snifter, nice light amber color. Nose is decently hoppy and piny, just a slight hint of tropical sweetness. Taste is really average, like a semi sweet semi bitter IPA, am very thankful this was a two can limit at my local bottle shop. This beer is not worth repeating, especially with the astounding array of better option available. The definition of a hype beer!"
"Very good beer, not as hoppy as some of the IPA's here in California but one that I will trade for every year. Nice balance to it and I love the subtle honey taste I get. Cheers"
Lovely little beer
"Not my style, but this is a worthy one to try"
"Pours a hazy and dark amber color, with a moderate-to-large head. "
Slightly hazy gold with abit of clarity. Thick off white head with the very heavy lacing. 
Poured from 12oz can into Hopslam tulip.
"Poured on draft, into a tulip."
"Canned 1/17/17, sampled 1/26/17. Pours a slightly hazy light orange, with a substantial white head that leaves lots of lacing. Aromas and flavors of pine and citrus are balanced perfectly by a solid malt presence, which is subtly caramelly and sweet. Good mouthfeel for the style, not too thin. Pleasantly bitter, no alcohol bite despite the high ABV, clean finish without any lingering sweetness. Insanely delicious and drinkable. Don't expect a palate-destroying hop bomb and appreciate this for the outstanding DIPA that it is."
"Well, I'm back after another hiatus, and boy I have to say, its great to be back! Tonight, I am drinking Hopslam, by Bells Brewery (a favorite). And I have to say, this beer truly does live up to its reputation. A wonderfully balanced Imperial IPA, I would recommend this brew to anyone interested in the style. Pouring a beautiful, hazy, and golden with a slight orange tinge, this beer comes out with a solid head that never really dissipates, lacing is medium and just right. On first sip, a heavy aroma of alcohol shines through, only to be subdued by loads of citrus, resin, and malty goodness, citrus becoming more dominant as the beer warms. The real star here is the total balance of the flavor profile, deliciously hoppy and sweet, with notes of honey, pineapple, grapefruit and rich resin, with a sturdy malt background to carry it all forward."
Updated taste from 4 to 4.25 on 1-31-17. Usually I consider this okay at best but this year felt a little more appreciative of it (though I still think it's hyped and blown out of proportion).
Just an exceptional specimen from bells. Warm golden color with grapefruit nose. The honey sweetness is perfect to balance the hops. World class all the way.
"This beer pours nice and is hazy in the glass. The smell is fantastic, I could tell it would taste good. Tasted very good for a double. The beer is definitely over hyped and a bit pricey for a six pack, but I am glad I got to try it this year."
It's what I rate every other beer against
"Before I had tried this beer, I suspected it was over rated. It pours with a nice head, but as an unfiltered beer it is hazing in the glass. The aroma is good, but unexceptional. So far, not impressed. But the taste, the mouth feel and finish really bring it home. An excellent beer that does not feel like 10% ABV, and in my opinion deserves the accolades."
"I've never understood the hype, it's an okay Double IPA, but the honey ruins it for me. It adds an almost unnatural sweetness and really turns me off from the beer."
Re-rating as my outlook on this has changed over the years.
"First time drinker of Hopslam, and came into this one looking forward to a well regarded double. This can was packaged 1/19/2016, so 13 days old and pretty fresh. I let the can sit out for 30 or so minutes to serve around 45-50 degrees. Drank from a tulip glass."
Very fond of this beer as it was the first Double IPA I tried back in the day. But with some others on this site I think that it could use a little tweaking. Why? Because my palate has shifted and so has the market.
I was lucky enough to grab a sixer of hopslam on 1/28/16 from Crown Liquors in downtown Chicago. The beer was canned 1/21/16 and I tried my first on 1/29/16. Very smooth and balanced with sweet undertones presumably from the honey and bitter finish. Truly well constructed since I had no idea it was 10% ABV.
Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter.
"2016 release poured into a IPA glass. Aggressive pour which lead to about two fingers of head, but diminished quickly leaving a nice alcohol lacing. The aroma is intense sweet citrus with a slight alcohol note. Taste pretty much follows the nose with bright citrus. Perfect balance of sweetness from the malts and honey. Alcohol is definitely present on the back end along with an astringent bitterness. Overall I can see why this beer has been hyped for so long. I don't think it's the best DIPA I've ever had but it is definitely very tasty. If you haven't had this beer and have the opportunity to try it, definitely pick yourself up some."
"Not a hoppy lover,but the 1 time hoppy smell went away and it is a truly awesome beer"
Hopslam
Been drinking this since 2008 and every year I like it less and less. Back in the day there was nothing like hopslam and I loved it. The last few years it was way to booze. This year it seems rather bland to me. I don't know of it has something to do with it being in cans this year or what. It's not that is bad but there are so many other choices out there now a days that are cheaper and easier to get. I'll gladly drink the six pack I bought but those who are tring for the first time might be a little dissapointed. Way over hyped in my opinion.
"I've been fortunate to find this beer on several occasions; even lucky enough to grab a six-pack once. It's a high-quality beer for sure. Maybe not quite worth of the hype and difficult trying to attain, but certainly a great beer. Very juicy, hop forward beer; a classic DIPA. While I wouldn't go out of my way if I was someone who still hasn't had it (you'll likely be able to stumble across one eventually) I will not shy away from picking some up each year."
"A: A beautiful amber cloud, a burt orange color with a warm inviting hue."
Look:
One of the best beers out there.....
"This is what got me into the IPAs and Double IPAs. My absolute favorite IPA, unfortunately, not available where I live, but I will always remember the taste and flavor! Love this brew and look forward to hunting it down and finding some more!"
"Solid double IPA. The honey adds an interesting flavor, but ultimately not my bag."
"12oz bottle. Pours a deep, cloudy honey with a 1-2 whitish foam head. Smells of citrus and honey. Taste overwhelms at first with honey, which slowly gives way to resinous hop (a hop character that complements the honey palate particularly well). Mouthfeel is slightly thicker than most DIPAs. Overall, very unique for the style. Thicker and sweeter than I would have anticipated. Probably not a beer I'd line up every year to get, but a solid, fresh take on DIPAs."
"Mellow for 10%. Can taste the honey. Floral notes in smell and good hopiness. Bottled last year and uncapped today, 9-10-15. Would like to try a fresh bottle from the next batch."
the beer was awesome! The hoppiness was excellent and perfectly balanced. Nice floral/citra smell..much better than I expected. enjoyed till the last sip.
"Pours a pure golden color. Has a huge floral aroma with sweet notes. Flavor is hoppy all the way through. Has a nice floral notes with a touch of maltiness and a honey backbone. Overall flavor is amazing, I can't get enough"
"I'm trying to think of a more over hyped beer I've ever had than Hopslam. I dont get people going nuts over this beer. 99 is a joke of a rating for it. Its a sweet, boozy, thin mess. "
"From notes. Slightly hazy golden orange color with a thin white head that disappears quickly. Moderate aroma with nice citrus, pine and sweetness. Flavor matches with the citrus and pine resin balanced nicely by the malt body and sweetness. Not as bitter as expected. The honey was a nice subtle addition to the malt sweetness. Just a little too much alcohol coming through and breaking up the smoothness."
"Hopslam is a great seasonal IPA that really hits me in the IPA heart. Fragrant, juicy, and a little sweet. At 10%, it'll get the job done if that's what you're looking for. Also, this beer can be held onto for a little to see how the hops fall off and the malt takes over."
"This is absolutely one of my favorite beers. When people say that some beers are extraordinary, I get skeptical. How can a beer be so much different than all the beers in it's category. The answer: I have no idea but this beer does it. Every flavor that most IPA's would have this beer has it multiplied by 5. The taste has such a bite and such a fresh pull that it just makes you happy. I love it."
Paid $5 for a bottle of this a few years ago and got another bottle as an extra recently. I was expecting one of the best IIPAs in the world but was very very disappointed.
Took a little road trip to get as its not delivered to NJ. Was glad I got some but was not blown away. Very good but not amazing. Tasty and easy to drink but a step down from some other IPA's IMO. Would drink it again if I come accross it but will not seek it out.
"Asking a beer lover their favorite beer is asking a music lover their favorite song. This beer would be ""Can't you hear me knocking?"" This is the first beer I had of that caliber and I look forward to it's release every year."
Overrated beer
"12oz bottle. Bottled 1/8/15 (only 13 days ago) Appearance: brilliant clarity with a golden/orange color and a thin white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma: A punch of citrus with notes of orange and peach, with an underlying grassy, piney base. Taste: Really rich and sweet maltiness, almost candy like, with definitive citrus flavors. Resinous, strong hop bitterness slowly builds and comes to a crescendo after the swallow. Mouthfeel: Light to moderate body with a low carbonation and a hint of alcohol warmth. Finish: Bitterness and dryness grows after the swallow and lingers with some resin on the tongue. Overall: Very light and balanced for a double IPA, with the richness of the malt standing up to the hops. This causes the bitterness to slowly increase as opposed to an abrasive punch in the face. Aroma is complex and inviting. Great IIPA."
"Looks and smells a little better than it tastes- not as complex as other double IPAs. Two or three note, not ten. But still a good beer."
"A very tasty IPA, but it's hasn't got the smoothness or hop profile to keep up with the other greats. If I put this up against Artaic, another honey IPA, the hop slam gets blown away. It's really good, just packs a bitter punch with a heavy malt profile, two things I personally don't look for in a great IPA. I would drink again though and as I mentioned, it is tasty."
I look forward to fresh Hopslam every year. Love the way the honey adds body to even out the hoppiness.
"Was expecting it to be much better. Similar to other Bell's brews I have had, just does not have the flavor I was expecting. Just mainly a hop flavor, no complexity."
"Great beer when fresh. Like the hops/honey combo. Expected more hops, but still happy with it. Worth tasting every year."
"This is an amazing beer, well worth the wait, however they do vary year by year. last year's hopslams were very alcohol flavored, the previous year hopslams were 5 across the board, and worth the absurd price. this last year's hopslams were a bit too alcohol flavored, and not crazy hopped enough."
Sweet honey notes balance out the massive hops nicely. Fantastic beer.
Not as good as i was expecting
This beer is amazing! One of my personal favorites. Too bad it is so hard to get.
"A: Hazy orange, hardly any lasting head, spots of lace."
Bottle poured into a BarrelHouse Brewing Co pint glass
"Amazing hop flavor with a slight honey taste on the back-end. Smell can be slightly off, but flavor and feel are on point. Probably the best Double IPA you can get. Limited release makes it all the more special. My father in-law sends me a 6 pack or two every year, he lives nearby where its brewed, and it is always a treat."
"I drank this one a while ago so I don't recall enough to give a thorough review. All I know is that this beer, while great for what it is, isn't quite my cup of...beer. Hoppy as hell, yeah, but more bitter than I like. Like, almost aggressively bitter. Don't get me wrong, judging this objectively, they created a genuine hopslam and if I were ever in the mood for an IPA that was that intense, it would hit the spot, but I prefer my hops more spicey, citrusy, floral, and less tongue-shredding. There's some honey in there which gives a nice malty balance when it's needed, but it's too little, too late. I'll buy it next year, but maybe just a single bottle rather than a whole $20 sixer."
Great tasting beer. You don't even taste all the hops so it mellows it out. very good
Bell's Overrated Honey Bomb AKA MALTslam
"From the bottle, I was not impressed with the first sip. After that it improved significantly."
2012 version. At the time it was the best beer I'd ever had.
"Great summer DIPA, grapefruit notes and flavor, great alcohol finish"
Look: who cares. It is a double IPA it should be cloudy
It seems like this beer is getting a little worse every year. Still a good beer but not how i remember previous years.
One of my favorite beers. Bottled in Jan 2015. Aroma is wonderful in those beer picking up the hints of honey. The aroma is outdone w/the taste though. This is such a smooth beer with the infused honey. This is also a potent beer at 10% ABV. I drink a couple of these and I'm feeling good :)
"It's a good brew. Wishing it had more sticky icky, hop reisen to it. Noticing a shift between yearly product. A slight lack of consistency."
Lives up to the hype. If u can find it try it. Took me 2 years to find it.
Not as impressed as I was hoping for. Hype for this was not what it delivered.
Glad that I tried Hopslam!! Great feel and look; the taste is excellent !!
From the tap on May 2nd. Not as fresh as I would like. Still excellent beer.
"One of my favorite beers hands down. The hops come through but don't completely over power your pallet. The honey really adds a wonderful sweetness and along with the malt rounds the beer out very nicely. If you're looking for a well balanced imperial IPA this is a great one, if you're looking to be overwhelmed by hops this isn't for you. I'd drink this any day over Heady Topper."
"Roughly 3oz pour at a beer festival. It was good, hoppy, and everything that should be expected from a double IPA, however I don't think it quite lives up to the hype. It's nothing extraordinarily special. Is it a good beer? Yes, undeniably so, but is this something I would take off work early to snag a few bottles of? Probably not."
"I have a lot of ""favorite"" beers. But this one tops the list. I would be a happy man if I could drink this every day."
"Bottled 1/10/15, so roughly 3.5 months old."
"Really excited to try this one but unfortunately the bitterness overtakes the honey for me. I feel that the flavors didn't really mesh as well as I hoped. Obviously I'm in the minority here, just my opinion on this one."
About 3 months old prob have better review
Awesome. One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Love the big hop hit and subtle sweet honey follow-up. Crap...only 2 left from this year's batch :(
Amazing. Simply amazing. If your into DIPA and hop bombs this is a must buy when it's out.
You don't want it to end!
"Overhyped, plain and simple. At around $20 a sixpack in the RVA area, I was disappointed."
"Definitely a tasty and unique IPA, but only good fresh from my experience."
Great beer just hard to get even in Michigan
I love getting this beer when it comes around. Perfect subtle honey taste.
Poured cold into a tulip glass. Bottled on 1/9/15 and consumed on 1/27/15.
Way overrated and nowhere near the hype. Had 2 of my 6 pack and gave the other 4 away to friends. To each their own. But there are much better beers at a much better price point imho.
Bottle poured into chalice.
2016 Vintage not as smooth as I remember but still a good mouthful for an IPA. Highly carbonated bubbles just streaming up in my glass. I didn't detect the sweetness other claim they taste hides the 10% ABV to good........ which dangerous if you're driving. A rather good IPA.
Couldn't get a whole lot on the smell but the hop taste was certainly there deceiving me. What an amazing beer for a 10% IPA I can't wait to get more of this next year. The honey makes this beer brilliant!
"Good beer if you want to get drunk, not if you want to enjoy getting drunk"
2016 version from a can. Poured an amber color with just over a fingers worth of foamy head that laces the glass. You get a lot of hop dankness in the smell as well as some breadiness and floral notes. The flavor is all hops combining pine and citrus with the right amount of bitterness. The feel is medium with good carbonation. I had this for the first time last year and now that I live where it is distributed I will continue to look for it each year. This is an amazing beer that deserves the hype.
I was very excited to try hopslam but was not blown away ..Think there is why to much Hype I wont go nuts seeking it out next year
Meh... seemed overly sweet. Good but there are better.
This year's Hopslam is great!
Perfect hoppy beer that will slam you.
2015 Hopslam was awesome. Had a bottle that was 6 days old. Super hop aroma with a touch of honey to finish. 
Limited time only and I couldn't drink enough to satisfy my needs! Love this double IPA. I wish I could have this year round. But I understand the availability of the outstanding Simcoe Hops!
"Prominent honey taste. Not terribly bitter, but has a citrus bite. Well balanced, delicious."
I honestly was worried the hype would kill this beer. But it's a beautiful beer to taste. 10 minutes after pouring the bubbles are still rising. The aroma is very nice and fresh. It tastes so balanced and feels oh so crisp. An amazing IPA.
Full IPA flavor with light bitterness yet smooth and pleasant aftertaste.
Personally not hoppy enough to justify it being so sought after
Way too hoppy for my liking
"This has to be a got to get when its out, I buy it and drink it..no holding this one."
Nice kick taste of honey and citrus
First dipa. Very grape fruity
"A bit boozy but the honey helps balance that out, has sort of a toffee, caramel hint to it on top of the citrus, piney you expect in a IPA"
This beer is simply one of my favorite beers.
"12 oz bottle packaged on 01/11/15 poured into a snifter. A perfectly balanced DIPA, glad I finally got my hands on a bottle."
Probably the best APA I've had. Great flavor with a nice finish.
"Lots of caramel, toffee and vanilla on the nose (aside from the standard IPA pine and citrus). Far maltier than I expected. Balanced. Very impressive."
Delicious. Wow the flavor just delicious.
"For all of the hype this beer gets, I do not get it. I have had a lot of great beers from Bell's but imo I would pass."
Too boozy for my liking. Not well balanced.
Look: Amazing head and amber.
"Big mango and dank/sticky pine resin notes, fresh/wet grass, honey aftertaste. Medium/full body with very little alcohol taste considering the 10% abv. Great balance, leaves nothing desired."
Don't get the hype. Think the field has passed this one.
"I am rating this partially as an experiment. I have 2 bottles: One bottled 1/17/14, and one bottled 1/18/15. I'll note the differences here, and give the 2015 (fresh) a rating."
2017 12oz can
good beer. has a nice sweet smell with a good off white head. tastes pretty damn good with a slight alcohol presence in the aftertaste. well worth a try
All im goin to say. It blew my mind.
"Always good! Nice aroma, good body, a bit bitter, not overly malty."
2017 batch
A: Warm orange golden. Reminiscent of apple jelly. Head did not last.
This years batch did not wow me.
Amazing taste. The honey really covers up the boozy back taste.
Gold draft pour with off white head into 10oz snifter; great lacing. Sweet honey glazed biscuits and some floral hop notes. Malt balances well with hops to hide alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and honey tongue coating. Genius in a bottle.
At craft beer factory tasting.
comes off as one note. not a fan.
A-pours a nearly transparent yellow/gold color(might be some chill haze) with a white foamy head with good retention
"I had it from a firkin first and from a traditional tap next. The review is from the tap. Having the two really made me appreciate it a little more. The first few, on other occasions, I felt as though I was trying to like it more than I actually did like it. Tonight is the first time I understood the hype."
Thanks for the extra Chris.
"Keg release at the World of Beer, it wasn't as exciting as I was expecting."
"This beer is strong. It has that nice hoppy sting, scent, and aftertaste. A tremendous brew from a tremendous brewery."
"Smells incredible. Tastes very good. All the rage? Nah, but worth a try. Huge citrus and floral nose that stays with initial sip. Sweeter than most, but not overwhelming."
"We were only able to get 1 case of slam in at the shop, and after setting my sixer aside the other 3 were sold before hitting the shelf. First time for me from the bottle, but it tastes just as fresh and pine-citrusy as draft. I love the mouthfeel, really into the carbonation and tight bubbles. Astounding dipa!"
Great beer but it has too much sweetness from the honey added. Comes through too much.
12 oz bottle poured into Dog fish head IPA glass. bottled 2-2-15
"Picked this one up in a trade and its my first one ever. Poured into a nonic with a pale, orange color. As it warms I get a boozy, piney and citrusy aroma. The taste is spectacular. Bursting with hops and fresh citrus, some grapefruit notes. The addition of honey is more like an after-thought, but lends a nice balanced sweetness. As it warms on the palate the alcohol comes through and leaves a pleasant mouthfeel. Its slightly carbonated and dry. Overall, it's a wonderful DIPA. Hopslam lives up to the hype."
Pours a darker orange and golden color. Smells like sweet citrus. Taste the honey for sure. Nice and thick mouthfeel. Super hoppy. Delicious. Lucky to have had this one the last two years. Another world class beer from Bell's.
Golden orange with lacing. Faint and pine citrus on the nose with noticeable honey. Sticky sweet. Good malt flavor. Will want to try again with a fresher bottle. Think it was missing some of the intended hop punch.
The color is the best thing about this brew -- an intense gold. Smells tropical. Easy to drink. Refreshing.
"This beer looks like summer. Always a nice treet when hopslam comes out to break up the snowy months but I've always kind of wished bell's would switch around hopslam and oracle on the release schedule. Smells like pine, peaches, citrus, and honey. Tastes of fresh floral hops, stone fuits, pine, and honey. Drinks incredibly balanced and smooth and there is just of malty honey sweetness to balance out the bold hop profile but not get sticky sweet or syrupy. Crisp, refreshing, and super drinkable for a 10% hopbomb."
"Bottled on 1/20/2015. Sampled and reviewed on March 3, 2015."
"Unfortuately i've had this beer on two different occasions, one incredibly fresh, one not so much, both disappointed. This beer just hasn't had the the flavor to stack up against other great DIPAS. Very drinkable though."
"Initially rated the 2015 Release at 4.56, and that was the first time I had it. Wanted to re-rate and review it, as I am really enjoying this years more than last. Perhaps it is because I'm heavier into stout season this year and this is a welcome relief to my palate, perhaps it's cans vs. bottles, or perhaps it really is just that outstanding. I had two six packs, both canned on 1/21/16. Much better when poured into proper glassware – a Hopslam snifter that I got last week in anticipation. Pouring it opens it up, softens it, but most importantly, allows the juiciness to step forward. Golden orange and cloudy, strong carb and lacing. Beautifully strong hop nose. I opened and poured the first one the day I got it home and the hops hit me from two feet away. Incredibly well balanced. Hoppy and bitter, but plenty of citrus zest follows with the accompanying sweetness of the honey. Mouth filling creamy feel. Extremely well done. I will miss you, giant hop. See you next year."
"Never poured into a glass so idk about look. Who cares about look anyway. This is just some immaculate...erm...stuff. Last year I held this in very regard, challenging the best of the best. Made it a point to secure a case this time. I've never had it's like. Call it a double ipa or whatever, the sweetness of honey makes this beer shine. February is a great time for those of us who look for non-winter-warmers, and hopslam is just that. Can't wait til july to have one outside. A question I always ask to beer folks is...'if you were on death row, and got to pick your last meal and the beer to go along with it, what would that beer be?' KBS, heady, etc. are the typical responses. Give me Hopslam. It is my #1."
"Re-reviewing after having this a few times. This time was out of a mini-keg. Pours amber-honey like. Head was white, but a slight hint of amber. The lacing was minimal. Hop nose is heavy as is the hop flavors. The creamy hops subside quickly, but then bite the back of the tongue. This is a great beer. "
Totally worth the 20 bucks for a 6 pack!
"Clear, orange color pours with three fingers of head into a tulip glass. Nose bursts with pineapple, tangerine, honey, and pine. Taste is sweet citrus and honey up front with a bitter hoppy backbone and boozey finish. Mouth feel is sticky sweet syrup. I really enjoy the sweet, malty fruit character of this one, but I lose that a bit on the finish. As it warms the carbonation fades and the malt starts to overpower the hops. Getting more candied sugar and warm booziness. Its lacking a little in hop bitterness, but a really nice sweet IPA."
"Flat. May not be normal, but mine did not look good in the glass. Taste was too sweet. Mouth feel, again...flat. Thick and heavy... not enjoyable."
"Poured from bottle into tulip glass, gives a finger of head that settles quickly to a small cap and lots o' lacing. Gives a golden-orange glow, little carbonation. Floral grapefruit and tangerine, some sweetness (maybe the honey), malty. No hint of booziness. The wife, who hates IPAs, takes the first sips and is liking it. No piney flavor for her (what she hates) and some booze on the taste, readily apparent it's 10%."
"I didn't get the honey and I felt like the hops overpowered the citrus. This was still really good, but not my favorite."
"Had a bottle at JP Henley's, oh my god, everything I could have imagined and more. This one very much lives up to the hype for me"
The taste is very sweet and boozy. Too much alcohol taste and too sweet for a dipa.
I finally got my hands on this. 
Poured from a 12oz can into a speiglau IPA glass. 
"A: orangey gold, clear"
Pours a slightly cloudy light copper with little head. Suprisingly malty at the nose. Very piney and resiny with a nice balance of bitterness and sweet. A+.
"Bitter without body. Piney without character. Underwhelming to be nice. Can't judge fairly being from SoCal with everything else we have access to, but you can tell t's an attempt at being something it aspires to be. Hopslam is overhyped and glorified Stone IPA...maybe even closer to a Sierra Nevada pale ale."
Many thanks to Charlie for the bottle!
"Sweetness from the honey, and a punch from the hops makes this one of my annual favorites. If your a hop head this is a must for you to sample."
"Whole different beer on tap. Most things are, but the discrepancy here is amazing"
"L: Orangey, less than finger of head which quickly dissipates. "
Look: Pours a nice clear golden color with a good fluffy white head that leaves good lacing
"I had this on tap tonight,and everything checked the boxes except for the high ABV. Great beer thought.Must Try!"
"Beautiful orange/amber brew, just slightly hazy, topped my a humble snow-white head. Fantastic retention, and a nice line of lacing."
A very good beer but doesn't quite live up to all the hype.
Expensive but MAYBE worth it
"Doesn't live up to the hype, stone brewing enjoy by 3.14.15 blew it out of the water, however it is a delightful beer. I will drink it again next year because it is plentiful around me, but I will not go out of my way for it."
One of my favorite beers.
Believe the hype! Nothing better than having my expectations surpassed. I was a bit underwhelmed with the carbonation... A tad more would have added another dimension to the drinking experience. 
Type: Draft
Very clear and well filtered. Beautiful flavor. Very light for such a high alcohol %
"A good ipa, just not for me. Im beginning to see Im partial to west coast ipas. The aroma was heavenly though!"
"APPEARANCE - 3FH that lasts, light, clear, amber."
Good but not the best. It smells better then it taste. It feels a little chalky on the mouth
"I have had this beer for the past three releases 2013,2014,2015 from cable beverages in Bardonia New York. And i must say after drinking atleast 300 different ipa's in the past 3 years that this beer is completly over hyped. Yes its a solid dipa they hide the alchohol but there is something missing maybe it lacks a floral nose and a nice citrusy flavor but in my opinion i have had no name dipas better than this beer. For example the beer is just bitter nothing else not alot of malt to balance i think pliney the elder and heady put this beer to shame."
Love the strong hoppy taste. Very fragrant in a great way.
"Over the past few years, I have encountered triumph and heartbreak when attempting to obtain an extremely hyped beer that was only available in limited quantity. After stalking the twitter feeds of local beer stores, I was able to confirm the exact bottle release for the 2015 Hopslam Ale at Green’s Beverages located on Buford Highway in Atlanta, GA. After practically colliding into a light post and almost running over a homeless man, I parked my car and sprinted into the store. Looking left then right, and not noticing anything out of the ordinary, the cashier grudgingly pointed to the back wall where there was a line of several people quickly forming. As each six pack was handed off to another enthusiastic beer lover, I grew more and more anxious, and my hands began to perspire. When it was my turn, I hopped to the front of the line with glee, only to hear the store associate bark, “That’s it. No more in this stack.” My mouth dropped, and just as I thought the nightmare had just begun, a pack of Hopslam was placed into my trembling hands. Let the games begin!"
"Suprisingly smooth. It went down a little too fast, it left me wanting more at the end of the glass. Great beer"
"Not as much hops as you'd expect given the moniker. Most of it comes in at the end with a lingering grapefruit bitter, though by no means something that is abrasive. Upfront you get mostly the sweet honey and candy flavor, even some burnt sugar leading into the fuller hop profile at the end. One of the easiest to drink double IPAs."
Every bit as good as I expected after waiting six years to get my hands on one. Cheers
"Grabbed a 6-pack of this from local Safeway; cases were just stacked on the floor between the fish and dairy coolers. The beer poured a very nice, brilliant copper hue with slight haze. Smell is a nice blend of citrus with no hint of the alcohol bite; slight hop presence. Mouthfeel is wonderful, full impression. The taste is an interesting transition from citrus, to malty, honey, then to Vidalia onion, and finally to lingering blend of honey and hop bitterness. I think this might be the fullest spectrum of flavors across one beer that I have encountered to date. You certainly don't sense the 10% that will hit you full steam about 3/4 of the way through the glass. I love me some DFH 120 minute IPA, but for the price, I think this is the winner."
"Despite the hype, I buy a case each spring when I can. Yes, it's pricey, but once a year is good for me. One of my favs"
"Hides the ABV well. Great smell. Nice sweet finish. Overall an outstanding DIPA that I will enjoy time after time, whenever I can get it."
Not bad. Def not worth rushing to the store before it is sold out. Solid but Overhyped
Hypeslam'd
"This is an amazing ale. However, do I think its worth the hype no not one bit. Its has an amazing feel and the taste is great. but i really want more honey in the taste. I think you get that honey thickness and warmth in the feel but not in the taste. It looks like any IPA, idk why its even a qualifier. Smelled like an IPA."
Such a smooth DIPA. For 10% it's crazy easy to drink. Not the flavor explosion that the other highly rated doubles are but I'll gladly drink this again.. and again... and again.
Wow.
"I have to be quite honest, this is an ok IPA. I enjoy it and will drink again if I come across it in season without the fuss over where to get it. Not one of the top IPAs in the world by any stretch of the imagination though. Not even better than two hearted (not even close IMO). The hype is probably a result of the market being flooded by incredible IPAS in the last 5 or so years. This was probably the best around ten years ago, but now its being past over. My negative statements about this beer are not intended to make a claim that this is a BAD beer, IT IS GOOD! It is not however one of the best beers, or even IPA's that I've had. In any case I'll give a bit of a review as well."
"Pleasant to drink, however, not what I was expecting based off of the high demand. Taking into account the price, I can't see myself searching this beer out to drink again."
Most over rated beer in the us
"Bright golden beer with a thin head, sits in the glass with a bright shine waiting to be drank. Light, crisp, sweet body. Taste of fresh lemon grass, honey comb, butterscotch, pine, and orange peel. Alcohol is present on the nose but the smooth taste covers it nicely."
worth the hype for sure
"What a great welcome to the Beer Advocate community. Berg77 generously gave me 2 bottles of this to try along with a plethora of Iowa Beer Distro tips and info. I knew Hopslam would be good, but I was beginning to think that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype. "
"Yes, people will say this beer is overhyped. Maybe so. However, this is a very well balanced DIPA. Honey gives it a nice balance. Definitely worth seaking out once a year."
"Well balanced for a DIPA, still not my cup of tea."
Finally got ahold of some thanks to a buddy. It was good but didn't come close to the hype for me.
Best I grav IPA I've had. Thick mouthfeel and a sweet finish. Very unique!
"Golden in color with maybe a half inch of head. Good lacing around the glass. Smells like citrus, grapefruit and some pine. Taste is grapefruit up front with sweetness in the middle and a hoppy finish. Mouthful is medium with decent carbonation and a bit of oil. Overall it is a really nice dipa. The hype around this beer is probably overstepped some which drives the price but it is worth trying at least once."
Wow the balance and that hit of honey at the end! A must try and worth the effort in purchasing.
Amazing. This may be my favorite beer this side of Pliny the Elder. It is hoppy but not just for the sake of hops a good balance.
Absolutely splendid brew. Beautifully balanced.
Pours a Light Amber leaning towards copper with an off white head. 
"12oz bottle poured into tulip. Hazy orange liquid topped by a finger of ivory head that settles to a clingy ring. Streaks and dots of lacing are left behind. Aroma is pineapple, grapefruit, bread, citrus zest, a bit of honey and some alcohol. Taste follows the nose, with a beautiful sweetness up front that is abruptly replaced by a mellow lingering bitterness and some wafting booziness. On the full side of medium body, creamy but sadly not as sticky as I’d have liked, medium foamy carbonation, drying and boozy on the finish."
"Not sure about the hype...that being said, this is a very good IPA! Having followed a Stone collaboration Green Tea IPA, I honestly can't tell much difference in taste. But then again, what does that tell ya?! It tells me Hop Slam is on-par with the best-of-the-best!"
2015 vintage. Pours amber color with 1 finger off-white head. Nice lacing on the glass.
Look: Deep copper red pour with little or no head that never really dissapates and leaves a nice light lace on the glass.
"This lived up to the hype for me. Bottled 1/10/15. Into the Spiegelau a clear, golden, super carbed beauty with a finger of pure, white head. Could smell it from the table. Bright astringent pine, grapefruit, solid nose, but not overpowering. Hint of honey and booziness after awhile. Sweet on the front of the tongue, followed by solid pine in the middle and a classic, big bitterness towards the end... mellowing into a nice honey sweetness. Grapefruit/citrus came out a bit more for me as the glass warmed up. Solid mouthfeel, refreshing but not run of the mill... I expect that the honey added some of this aspect. Totally worth the hype. Our great local bottle shop held us a few. Well worth a trip, and a try. Exceeded expectations."
2015 bottled January 10. (Better than last year.)
why is this $17 a six pack got lucky and got this in a Kroger Pick 6
"Not a bad beer and it is very smooth. It's just way to sweet for me, especially compared to the far superior IPAs and DIPAs on the market now. Overhyped..."
Loved everything about this beer. I'll be tracking it yearly.
"Had it on tap yesterday. One of the best. One of the original ""crazy hop"" beers. But, it isn't piney or grapefruit-y or other sometimes too intense hopped-up flavors. The honey is there, and the hops have an actually kind of cool and mellow flavor considering the name. A thick, nearly syrupy brew with fine carbonation. Beautiful flavor. Excellent. I have had it bottled, but the tap is the way to go, less foamy and more silky."
Lived up to the hype. Just not as much as I expected
"I'll preface this by saying that I don't usually like sweet IPAs. Now that I've said that this stuff was delicious and well worth the purchase. It doesn't crack my short list of favorite DIPAs, but it's close and I can't wait to finish off the six pack."
"Look - Golden in color, quite see through at first and when held up to light. 1"" foamy head. Excellent looking beer. Some lacing left, but not as much as you would expect with the super-foamy head."
"Best beer of 2015, so far"
"Is it literally the best beer ever? No. Is it worth the hype? Yep. Well worth getting if it's practical for you. Kinda reminds me of an even better Jai Alai, but with honey instead of hints of orange."
From a single into a Bell's snifter
"Nothing wrong with the nose; piney and almost mango-ey, like the best WC IPAs I've tried. Honey immediately noticeable in taste and texture. Unlike any IPA I've tried, honestly, but reminds me of the fruitier SD IPAs I've tasted (without going malty). Can't quite put my finger on the aftertaste; almost tart, but not infection. Like a DFH90 w/o the malt. Booze definitely present in nose and taste as it warms. Piney but sticky sweet; wouldn't go so far as to call it resinous like a Rip Current signature, though. Glad I finally got to try... Not quite the IPA the 100 rating led me to expect, but an awesome, fun (dangerous, shareable) beer that isn't anywhere close to what ""HypeSlam"" claims had me worried it could be. All in all, a great beer, and a good IPA."
Smoother than previous years. Dat lace doe
A trade gift from the resident hophead at work. Only ever had Hopslam on tap in the past.
A-Golden amber with 1 finger white frothy head.
Amazing ipa. Floral and fresh. Wish it was available more often.
My first exposure to The Hopslam. That's a Buckeye's Tribute! Well done Bells!
A wonderful experience. Top notch IPA!
Poured Hopslam into a Belgian Tulip.
"If it gets better than this, lead me to It! Taste and feel are incredible smooth and the smell is spot on. Cannot say enough good things."
"All I can say is Wow. Great overall IPA. Just hoppy enough without going overboard. Just enough citrus without making you feel like you're sucking on a grapefruit. Good color. One finger head. Worth the wait. Glad I got my hands on some this time around. Some say a little pricey, but compared to domestic beer at a bar, I'll take this all day long."
Nice amber color with a foamy off white head. Lots of carbonation in the glass. 
I was very skeptical if this beer was worth the price. I've gotten 12 dollar 4 packs before but a 25$ six pack seemed outrageous. I was wrong. I wish I would have bought a case. 
"Very good IPA, easy drink ability, hard to get and expensive ($25), worth it, if you can get your hands on it."
Everything it's suppose to be. It is what I thought it would be. Go ahead and SLAM one!!
"Really, an excellent beer. Not the powerful citrus aroma I've come to expected from the Two Hearted IPA, and the honey takes a slice out of the piney hops as well. These aren't exactly complaints, either. Great change of pace. I've had a bottle and draft pint in both Traverse City and San Diego, and I'm happy to report the beer met Bell's standard of quality in both parts of the country."
"All aboard, next stop hypeville. I wanted so badly to love this beer, I absolutely love bells. The color and aroma were nice, but for my personal taste the hop profile did not support the maltiness that was present. I expect some sweetness and malt given the abv but not at the expense of the hops. Oh well, still glad I was able to try it."
"So here it is. Hopslam. Never tried before, but I get to try a 12 oz twice (due to a bottle limit, which at $5 per, may have been a good thing). Poured into a tulip glass. Bottled, or packaged, 1/9/2015."
Perfectly balanced double IPA . A must try if your able to get it . At 18$ for a six pack ..... Worth every penny!!!
This beer really lives up to the hype and it's certainly worth the price. I'll be buying a couple more 6 packs in the coming weeks.
"There's a lot of hype about this beer. A slight let down. However the feel is great, still a bitter IPA worth drinking"
Tried this about a week afte bottling And my God was is delicious. Tons of resin and citrus just the way a DIPA should be. This might be my favorite DIPA.
"Well, I finally stumbled upon some ""Hypeslam""."
A bit boozy.
"One of my favorites and extremely difficult to get ahold of, well worth the effort tracking it down!"
Very smooth for a very hoppy beer
Great beer. Slight citrus at the front of the palate with a full thick malt driven mouthfeel and finishes floral and piney. Overall i really enjoyed it; however I did find it to be slightly cloying. I wasn't expecting such a heavy malt presence in an IPA. My local distributors get very little and limit sales to one bottle per customer. This is the first year I was able to get my hands on it and scored two bottles from two different stores for $10. It's tasty but not worth the hype there are plenty of other shelf DIPAs that I enjoyed more.
"You must love Hops to appreciate beer, of thats your thing then this beer is for you!"
"Too sweet and not as happy as I thought. Good, not great"
"Quite good. I had this for the first time last year, as i was just starting to explore IPAs. It was too hoppy for me then, but I'm able to appreciate it much more now. The question is always whether it's worth all the hype. To some it is. Overall, I do like this beer, but I can get the same or more enjoyment from some beers that are less expensive. It is definitely a nice treat."
L (4) -I like the orange/amber color of this. Kinda almost looks 'citrusy.'
This beer is definitely overrated.
Very crisp and slightly sweet DIPA. Not what I was expecting but it's good. Mouthfeel is the best part of this beer. Taste is honey and caramel malts with light hoppy notes coming through in a resinous finish. Not as hop-forward as I would have expected. Very good but if I want a DIPA this usually isn't what I would reach for. Still good and very drinkable. Not worth the crazy hype though.
"i think what this comes down to is the west coast vs east coast iipa thing. this beer, in my book, is the best example of an east coast iipa. the hops may star in the west coast version, but the malt plays a much bigger role here as compared to a west coast iipa. the hops are big, piney and resinous. but the malt is sweet with a huge mouthfeel and just delicious. i love both styles, but this is one of the best."
"Incredibly hazy, literally looks like honey. Honey, floral, hops, bitter, sticky mouthfeel, a little boozy.it's good but with all the other DIPAs on the market it wouldn't be my go to"
"Finally reviewing to back up my rating. This beer pours a fairly hazy orange with a large head. The aroma features grapefruit peel, tangerine peel, pineapple, mango, and a bit of caramel and salt. The flavor lead with a blast tangerine peel, followed by just a touch of honey sweetness, and background notes of pineapple, guava, and mango. The mouthfeel is full and very fizzy. Overall this is a sensation beer. My love for it may be irrational, but I do not care. Yum."
I tried this once long ago and I figured I would review it now with a fresh one.
Damn near perfect. Biting pine and honey.
As good as advertised...believe the hype.
"2015 vintage, poured into a snifter. I get some of the honey in the aroma. Beer is overly bitter and malty. If this beer was a little lighter I would like it much more"
"Very complex, the honey overtones are pleasant with a whiskey-like flavor that blends the various hops together. It's a good sipping beer."
"FINALLY got a chance to try Hopslam after missing out on it the last couple years. All I can say is that is DEFINITELY lives up to the hype! Such a complex, delicious, hop bomb. I wish I could find it more often. Highly recommended."
"This has been hoppier in the past, but I'm going to let it slide this year. This is the only IPA that really delivers for me, aside from Palate Wrecker. If I could take this beer to bed, I'd divorce my sweet, MPDG wife and live happily ever after even if it means I don't get any more hand-knit orange socks. All jokes aside, (are they jokes, really?) this is pretty much my go-to, so it's a good thing my local beer spot has me on speed-dial and saved me 6 cases. "
Outstanding all around. Surprised that the honey doesn't come through for me but really nothing else about this brew that wasn't excellent!
Goddamn this stuff is awesome.
Went with the hype and spent $20 for a six pack. Expected to be underwhelmed. First sip almost brought out my O face. You know what I'm talking about. Excellent all around.
Too expensive... Plenty out there in this category just as good
"A great DIPA, lives up to the hype. Very refined, not in your face tart like many IPAs. Has a lingering sweetness from the honey. Very smooth consistency with fine carbonation like a great champagne. Bouquet is very fresh, but not very floral, and aroma is not the highlight of this one. But the taste is so smooth I can't believe its 10% abv. Very impressive beer and you can just tell the quality is special."
Dont get the hype here. It is ok... Nothing special.
Good in its time. Too much other great stuff out there now for me to call this beer amazing.
"I had this once or twice last year, but my first of this year was much better than I expected or remembered. Booze is completely hidden for such an ass-kicker, smell is sweet and citrusy in the bottle. Taste is balanced with hints of honey and a smooth finish. Really this is a superb brew and I wish it was just a little easier to track down in NY (I've scrambled around to 3 or 4 places this week to grab 5 bottles - hopefully more coming soon. A buddy of mine was able to grab a 6 pack but most stores are selling them 1 or 2 bottles at a time). Worth the effort once a year!"
"When I read ""made with honey"" I expected a sweet, heavy drink. What I got was a well rounded crisp flavor that was light on the tongue. The honey accented the hops exquisitely creating a balanced flavor with a nice slightly sweet, citrus flavor, without an overpowering after taste."
Great beer. Great taste. You must drink it
Into my Whole Foods Pint.
"Great beer, but as far as double ipas, I still prefer Snakehandler."
"This beer lives up to the hop hype. It makes me want to slap not only my mama, but your mama as well. The taste is out of this world."
"Unlike the fruity double IPAs of the West Coast (particularly California) the genius of this beer is not IMMEDIATELY apparent. At first, yes it is good, a lot of bitterness up front, sweet from the honey and the malt. As it warms (and I would advise to drink this from the start at room temperature. Don't even chill it slightly) so much pops! The fruit is pineapple and it appears at the back end of the taste like right before the beer goes down your throat. And then it stays and says what's up! Then from there, yes GENIUS. It's like I'm listening to a symphony and hearing for the first time all of the intricate parts and timbres. Same with this beer. It's like an intellectual beer. I'm constantly thinking about what I'm tasting and what flavor combinations are there. Highly recommend for those that appreciate the more subtle things in a German beer. This might be the Double IPA for you. Worth the hype."
One of the best IPA's out there!
Just got 4 and I can't wait to finish them. Love it
"Smells like hoppy citrus goodness. But the taste isn't anything like the smell. Initial taste is hoppy with a hint of over ripe loquats. For being 10%, the alcohol is well hidden. I don't really know what the hype is about but it's good, not world class but good"
"Apricot/amber, very clear. Boozy, sweet DIPA with some alcohol heat balanced nicely by very piney hops. It's not a crushable beer, meant to be sipped clearly. Reminds me a bit of Sixpoint Resin. I enjoyed it quite a bit, even though I tend to like cleaner malt profiles and less booze in my IPAs. Glad I sought it out."
Well worth the wait and hunt of finding it.
This beer was pretty good.
"Pours a medium amber in with a half inch head that dissipates quicker than expected. Very sweet floral nose with notes of honey, light vanilla, and mild hops. Taste is refreshing piney hops with honey and bright citrus. Nice balance overall and very drinkable. One of the better offerings by Bell's"
"Best double IPA I've had. Refreshing and with no alcohol bite, it's very drinkable for 10% ABV. The sweetness of the honey comes trough in the finish without being overpowering. Extremely well-balanced. I'll be looking for more."
"Landed one six pack last year, but with some additional legwork and recon I landed 15 bottles this year. This is truly one of the Godfathers of craft beer. What's so awesome about this beer? It's not the most hoppy or bitter, but it is fucking unique. Does not really taste like anything else I have had. Funny, when u bought this brew it looked very clear. After two days in my fridge it poured a beautiful cloudy golden. I taste the honey for sure. Phenominal shit."
"It was okay, don't think it lived up to its hype"
Bottle poured into Nonic Pint glass.
I've been slammed. It's delicious.
"A: pours a rich pretty orange, minimal head, prominent lacing"
"BOD 1/10/15. Pours a clear honey gold with just a hint of garnet. Good head volume, lacing and retention, especially for a 10% ABV."
"This beer is the perfect balance of hops/malt, with a name like hop slam I was scared that it would be way to ""hoppy"" but the beer itself tasted amazing. At 5.99 a bottle... It's not worth it, but definitely a great beer."
So smooth with great hops!
"Not worth the Hype. Had high expectations, but was underwhelmed. It did a good job at hiding the 10% ABV, but that was it."
"Had the chance to try it both on bottle and on tap at Bells on the same day. It's markedly better fresh on tap, the nose has distinct citrus & tropical notes. Some of that nose was lost in the bottle and the malt sweetness and the bitterness dominated. Still, a good beer nonetheless. Felt like the 2014 batch was better though."
"First time distribution this year in San Diego, CA. Seond time trying. I honestly do not understand the hype on this beer. It is mediocre at best. No hop nose to speak of and a cloyingly sweet finish. It DOES have a nice appearance. Had a Bear Republic Apex immediatly after and it blew it away. There are so many more easily attainable beers out here in Californa that leave this in the dust."
One of the best finishing beers around.
"Dark Amber tinged orange color with a quick fading white head that leaves some spotty lacing. Grapefruit fills the aroma with some sweetness, floral and booze. Taste is bitter red grapefruit with a touch of honey adding some floral character and a sweet but unobtrusive malt bill. Resinous and light pine in the finish. Nicely carbonated gives a pleasant prickle and helps the bitter edge and finishes semi dry. This was great but far from the best DIPA I've had and not quite up to the big hype surrounding it."
Bronze color. Huge foam upon pour that fades quickly. Smells dank and like grapefruit. Similar flavor that lingers. Very good!
"I like strong beer that hides the ABV and this one is as good as any. Smells and tastes like its namesake, but less boozy and less sweet than the honey and ABV would lead you to believe. One of the best IPAs out there."
"Very enjoyable, not worth the hype"
Canned 1/9/18 Hops are strong and the honey is there and so is the alcohol. Like all Bells products it is exactly as advertised. Beautifully crafted and not for the faint-hearted!
"Thin, quickly dissipating head. "
Very decent DIPA and good example of style
12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Poured one with a good friend.
Bottles dated 1.8.15 and enjoyed out of a Hopslam glass between 1.15 and 1.25.15.
Five day old bottle poured into a snifter. 
"A: A bright, vibrant, clear golden orange, with about 1-2 fingers of slightly tan head. An average amount of carbonation can be seen rising up the beer."
"Served on tap; appearance- beautiful frothy head, excellent retention. Smell- hop, hop, more hop. Some citrus. Taste- as advertised, plenty of hops with some nice honey balance, finishes with grapefruit. Mouthfeel- this defines this beer. Very smooth and easy drinking, you completely forget the ABV and the alcohol is hidden. Overall- an excellent, solid dipa, falls slightly short of the hype, but nevertheless has one of the best mouth feels I can remember for a dipa."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/8/2015. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Some light booziness shows up as it warms. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon/orange zest, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and robustness of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding double IPA style. All around awesome complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Noticeable hiss when the bottle cap is popped open. Pours a deep golden color that reminds me of the honey that is added to this beer. Seems thick. Pale cream colored head that is one finger thick. Heavy, sticky lacing left behind once the head settles. Tiny bubbles rise in a continuous stream from the bottom of the snifter. "
Great incredibly smooth IPA. Pretty on point
Wish it wasn't seasonal because its a great IPA!
"Serving: 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. Bottled on 1/10/15, making this 11 days old. "
Bells knows how to make an IPA
Awesome beer! Wish it was brewed year round!!
"I've had the 2013, 2014 and now 2015... I think I like the 2015 much better than 2014 and little better than 2013 (from what I can remember freshly having in 2013). I didn't really enjoy last years version, this one seems smoother and more refreshing than last years. Would recommend trying. As beer starts to warm up the honey flavor really kicks in."
One word.....Amazing! A hop heads dream......this is a treat!
Bottled 01/08/15 Poured into a Sam Adams glass. 
Ok-it's rare. As a Michigander we look forward to getting it. All I can say is it's emotionally and tastefully- quenching.
One of the best IPAs I've ever tasted.
"Awesome! Just awesome. Best smelling beer I have tried. One of the best tasting to boot. Citrus, and especially grapefruit, to me, give this beer a fantastic aroma, and leaves a more than pleasant taste on the palette. Most likely due to the added honey, the bit of sweetness balances the bitterness well. Fantastic beer."
Great IPA. One of my fav
"too sweet, where are the hops? aroma was nice and floral/hoppy, but the name of the beer is a misnomer on the taste."
"Slight hazy straw, luscious white foam. Ripe pineapple and cantaloupe, boozy back, lemongrass. Glorious mouthfeel and body."
I have to have five words. Heaven.
Aged a year! Insane! Intense honey finish!
Disappointing compared to other DIPAs on this list.
Definitely a must try ...a bucket list for your tastebuds.
Seriously punch the inside of your mouth with hops. Label is an accurate representation.
"Too boozy. Too sweet. Too expensive. Very disappointed after finally grabbing some of this, although I would try again if I could have it on draft,"
"The best beer I've ever had, period. Oh the hops, how I love you!"
Poured from a bottle into a tulip
One of my top 5 favorites.
An old favorite. Have to add a caveat that I had this beer nine months old. Here goes:
Thanks to snaotheus for this opportunity. Poured into a snifter from a bottle on 2/24/14. Packaged date of 1/16/14.
A: orange tints. Gold to amber. Loose bubbles. 
Very hoppy. I haven't had this in a few years.
"Nice malty, hoppy midwest DIPA."
"I'm basing this rating off when it was fresh. Unfortunately, I feel like this beer has declined greatly year after year. 5 years ago, off the chart, now, I'm not sure I'll even buy it next year. Too bad, it used to be a great beer!"
Would love to try this one again. The bottle I had shared from was well past its prime and the hops had definitely faded. Honey was still present and was balanced well.
Bottled 1.17.14. Drank 9.25.14. Poured into a tulip glass.
An ornery brew that I sure wish came around more than just once a year.
Picked up a case as it was going fast. Definitely one of the best vintages I've had. 
"From a freshly tapped keg, hops, hops, hops in the aroma and flavor balanced with liberal malt and alcohol. As the keg ages the hops die down and the malt moves forward. Find a fresh keg and drink your fill. Its a beautiful beer - brilliant gold, medium body, medium carbonation."
"Too sweet for my palate, though still tasty"
"A: golden copper, urine"
"Hands down one of my top 5 favorite beers. Not necessarily a huge fan of X2 IPA's but this double will always be at the top of my list. Beautiful and rich in it's golden color with an aroma hand crafted in hop heaven. The honey in this beer is what makes it so memorable. Very well balanced in it's citrus notes and definitely not as strong as it's percentage hints that it should be. Not such a popular beer in the south, but when it is around it never lasts long. Another score for Bells Brewery!"
"Finally get to try this one. Have been looking forward to it for awhile. Golden hazy color. One inch fluffy head. Malty sweet aroma hits you first. Then the hop smell comes through. The flavor of this is very well balanced. Grapefruit, caramel, hops. The honey makes a nice touch of sweetness.This is a very good beer. Only complaint is it is just a touch too sweet. I would like a little more of the fruit to come through and a little less sweetness, then I’d give it a 5."
A: Golden Color with a medium white head
The honey flavor really adds and rounds out the beer
"In my top five list and probably the one I would order on death row! Great balance of hops and malt with the sweet kiss of wild honey. Caution, after the second draft your legs will not work! Add this beer to your bucket list."
"12 ounce bottle, dated 01/09/2015"
12 oz bottle poured into tulip glass. Pours a dark honeyburst color with a medium sized white head that has great retention and lots of lacing.
Look- pours clear golden orange with one finger white head
"Pours a bit lighter than what I like to see in the style. Still a beautiful golden orange, with a healthy dose of head on lacing. Little tiny carbonation bottles flowing from bottom to top, lively."
"Appearance: Clear, golden orange color with a very thick, persistent head and heavy lacing. "
Too much honey felt like I needed to drink a gallon of water afterwords. Honey overpowered the hops. Big and boozy. Lot of people like it but way too sweet and bone dry for me.
"This is a very good beer, although I actually think I like the 2 hearted from Bell's better."
Poured into a tulip glass from a bottle dated 1/28/14.
Don't pass this up if you see it on tap; I bet it'd be amazing...
2014 Bells Hopslam
Poured from a bottle into a snifter at around 45 degrees Fahrenheit
"Poured from a very fresh bottle shortly after this year's release into a tulip glass. The aroma from the very start just has a bitingly bitter smell to it. This beer is bitter for bitter's sake, which isn't really my thing. I've tried it a few times, and I just can't seem to enjoy the abuse to my tongue (as indicated by the artwork on the bottle). The malt is evident through the sip, but almost completely overwhelmed by the hop bitterness. "
"A: Pours a clear, golden amber with a thick, slowly receding white head."
12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass.
Hopslam (2014)- the first Hopslam release I have had. I heard last years was better but anyways...
"Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle, served in a Sam Adams pint glass."
Fresh 2017 cans in California.
Hoplsam is an IPA from Bell's Brewery in Kzoo MI
Heard alot of hype around this beer. Many comparing this beer to PtE. Not even close. This doesn't touch PtE so quit it.
"Obviously a very hoppy beer. Can smell and taste the hops instantly. Opaque golden in color with a good size head. Hints of both citrus and wheat could be tasted in this beer. Very high alcohol content, but almost can't taste it due to the other strong flavors. This beer was a smooth beer to drink. I enjoy hops but this beer just had too much for me."
Appearance: Orange/amber color (closer to red than a typical IPA) with a medium head and some lacing. Head retention is fair.
"Appearance: large head-more than 1 inch (closer to 2), copper/amber, orange golden color, nice lacing after a few drinks"
Poured into snifter 1 finger of off white head
This beer is 10%ABV. Golden clear honey in appearance. Served in a snifter. A hint of fruittiness in this beer but lives true to its name and is extremely hoppy - HOPSLAM. Drinks very smooth for a beer with 10%ABV. I would certainly reccomend this beer to any avid beer drinkers.
"When on-tap and poured, this beer has a fairly large head. If you've had Bell's Two Hearted Ale it is very similar to that, but with more of a kick. With an ABV of 10% you can definitely taste the alcohol in this beer. It is a great beer if you are looking for a high alcohol content beer"
12oz bottle bottled on 1/16/14 poured into a tulip glass.
AS far as an over hyped IPA goes this is the tops.
This beer came to me a few months ago and I finished all six relatively soon after. It was a slightly sweet dipa with the honey noticeable in the front end of each sip. It was very strong at 10% and a little boozy but I really enjoyed it. I wish it was easier to get because I would buy it often.
"Poured from the 32 ounce growler, two weeks after purchase and fill. Served 38F into a sanitized, rinsed and dried tulip snifter. Purchased on take out draft in 11230. "
"What can I say about, Hopslam that hasn't been said before? This beer is amazing!!! I've tried; 2011, 2012, 2013 & 2014 & I must say that 2014 is the best! It has a huge mouth feel without all the bitterness. The hops are huge, the citrus flavor is there & it's a huge DIPA!!! I LOVE the Oracle but Hopslam is hands down one of, if not the BEST DIPA's out there!!!"
Poured into a pint glass via bottle
Poured from a 12oz bottle to a pint glass.
"Ok, I know this review is in spring but for a winter seasonal, sue me. Wonderful pour with a frothy head bubbles throughout. Golden amber tint to the pour. Smell is a bit of citrus but you can't avoid tears from the hoppiness(good thing). Taste almost mimics the smell extremely hoppy finish with a citrus undertone. Sits on the tounge well. Overall a great beer and I am glad it lived up to the hype."
"This is beer is sweet,tasty, not heavy, but a bit complex. The style is very different from West Coast style IPAs. It isn't too dark or overpowering, very drinkable, yet strong. I am going to be trading for more of this most excellent beer. It's too bad I cannot go to the corner store to pick up more of this beer..."
"appearance; straw/ golden, medium carbonation, very thick, sticky white head that retains well."
"At the Flying Pig in Malvern, PA."
Bottle poured into 16oz Ball Mason jar.
A: Very sexy yellowish/orange color with a meringue like head that hangs around for a while.
Good gawd! Get dunked on by this hopslamming ale; the smell is of a hoppy meadow in the Elysian fields and the taste is similar to a bulldozer shoving a inordinate amount of pines citrus hops and a motley of other refreshing ingredients onto your palate where they accommodate one another instead of duking it out.
"When I first sipped this beer, I thought ""What's the big deal about this beer?"" It could of been my palate from drinking other beers, but when I took another sip and let it sit in mouth for a bit... thats when I really tasted the beer. "
A-	Has a clear dark orange color with a white fluffy two finger head that dissolves quickly. The head leaves chunky lacing all the way around the class 
"2-28-15 update. On tap in Ardmore, PA at Jack MsShea's. Such a treat before the NMO show at 23 East."
"Light amber in color with a fairly hazy profile. A quarter inch thick off white head caps off the top. Brussels lacing. Aroma is an intense aroma of citrus hops with notes off mango,passion fruit and pineapple. The mouth is very sticky and dry. There's an intense rush of citrus hops that doesn't let up. The light malt backbone does keep things from getting out of hand. The fade still has an intense citrus hop burn."
"Hazy dark orange color. Honey comes out in the smell more than previous years. Mouthfeel is perfection: sticky, cloying, and full bodied. Taste matches the nose with hop/honey balancing nicely. Overall still a notch above other Honey IPAs and most DIPAs in general. The beer is a beast."
"Update: Cracked open my first bottled Hopslam this year. ...and my second, and my third, and fourth and .... "
"Pours a gorgeous cloudy amber with a half finger of white head that sticks around for a while. The nose is huge on orange, but also includes lemon peel, tangerine, pineapple, and sweet malts. I get a pine needle taste up front before the bitterness is reduced by sweet orange, papaya, and pineapple, and then washed away completely by bready malts, leading to an impressively balanced and coherent experience from the beginning of the tongue to the end. Drinks smooth with a medium body, and hides the alcohol content well."
Expectation failed to become reality. I've heard over the years it has gone down hill. With a name like Hopslam I expect to be slapped in the face with hops. It was very mediocre in that department. I got 2 bottles through trades. 1 FRESH and 1 aged a year. The aged one was more pleasant to drink as a complex 10% beer. The FRESH one was just not worth what I heard they sell for upwards of $20 a six pack (or more). Too many better beers out there to waste that kind of money.
"It had been a while since I had Hopslam - probably five or six years. Living in Chicago now, it was easily accessible, so I have sampled it many times this (2014) season. First off, I am not sure whether it's a difference in this year's batch, or whether my palate has changed, but this beer does not strike me as deserving of its name. ""Slam"" isn't the word that comes to mind - more like a big wet kiss. The nose is boozy and dripping with fruit and honey. The hops are present in the mix, but this beer is extraordinarily well-balanced, and has a sweetness to each element - nose, body, and finish - that really appeals to me. "
Date: 3/23/14. Bottled on 1/17/14. 
A: Deep amber-orange. A little bit cloudy. One finger off-white head.
another awesome one today! thank you Mike! 
"Smooth pour nets a one finger head of tight white bubbles. Amber in color with great clarity and lacing that renews with each turn of the glass. Head retention was minimal, I could have been more vigorous with the pour."
Got a six pack in trade.
"A friend picked this one up for me on a strong recommendation from my beer guru. Excellent appearance, not to thin, with a great head that clings. Smell is also outstanding. Not as much punch to the nose as some IPAs but other than that perfect. Very good taste but a little to much bitter hanging on for my taste. Surprised me when I looked up the ABV, did not seem near that strong, much easier to drink then that which gives it big bonus points overall. Overall an excellent beer that I will want to try again."
Glass Used: Tulip
"Received in a trade, and glad I got the chance. An excellent beer overall. For me, Not the most attractive on the nose, but not unpleasant. Honey and a little citrus. Not much bitterness which would have been nice to offset the sweetness. An original tasting beer, so I score it highly in taste for originality. The 10% alcohol is mostly masked, although sometimes I feel it tastes vaguely of a fruity cocktail. One to try."
Bottled on date of 01/21/14
12 oz. bottle poured into a NB snifter.
12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip. This was bottled on 01/28/14 so is about a month and a half since bottling.
Hopslam pours a clear yellow/orange with a moderate sized creamy white head on top. The foam fades slowly leaving a thick layer of lace on the glass.
"Not uber fresh, bottled January. ChurchKey in DC. From notes."
Poured from a bottle into a tulip shaped glass. Dated 1/10/14 so it's exactly two months old. I'm guessing most will say i need to have it fresher but this is the best i can do here in New Hampshire.
Poured into Dogfish spiegelau glass. 
"On tap at 1702 in Tucson, Arizona, served in a pint glass. "
12 oz bottle in a pub glass
"Nose is medium strength, more dank spectrum than fruity. Taste is sharp hoppiness, mixed dank with some fruity notes. Honey is very present, much more than I was expecting, and I don't particularly care for the sweetness it contributes. Wanted to really like this beer, but the honey and the hop profile were both disappointing. Very smooth for a 10% ABV beer, though."
Had been looking forward to this beer for several months and was able to find it at a Whole Foods in my area. The store kept this beer in their backroom with strict limits per customer. Now I know why.
"Ahh . . . Hopslam, the beer everyone loves to hate. This beer is like The New York Yankees of craft beer (you know what I mean). Smooth silky feel, great hop flavor, subtle malt and honey backbone. It's still a fantastic dipa. Stop hatin' playa !"

Acquired 12 oz. bottle via trade; poured into tulip glass
"A - Darker amber than most IPAs, with some cloudiness. Poors with a decent head that receeds."
"Oh man this is a good beer. My friend texted me and said "" you better get over there and get some Bells"". "
Appearance: Clear / Golden with a 1/2 finger head poured from a 12 oz bottle. Lacing dissipates relatively quickly.
I had to review this beer after trying it for the first time because I am not a hoppy beer/IPA guy but was blown away by this superb beer! Tried it in a sampler and promptly ordered a whole one.
"Picked up a 12 oz. of this brew at my local establishment, Civera's in Drexel Hill, PA. This came highly recommended by fellow beer drinkers. Let's see how this matches up."
"Ap - Light amber to gold. It depends on the lighting. Like all Bell's beers, it's unfiltered, yet it isn't cloudy, or hazy. It's a little bit cleaner looking than Jai Alai. The head is an off-white fluff that clings to the glass."
Removed old review with poor information.
"Served in a bottle. Pours clear amber with creamy head and lazy bubbles, ample lace. Aroma is of sweet flowers and sugar, first taste is nicely bitter balanced near perfectly with a honey candy sweetness that gives you a nice hint of sweetness but quickly subsides to flowery bitterness that finishes crisp with a sweet dry balance that makes your mouth water for more. Very ample on the hops without being just bitterness or flowery overtones. A delicious and quaff-able ale."
Bottled 1/16/14. Another gem from my friend BigStein88.

"Wow, I got very lucky last night and was able to find a case of this!"
My thanks to my trading friend JohnParadee for this wonderful bottle.
Props to Kevin from Sleeping Giant Brewing Co. for hooking me up with this gem.
"I waited, waited and waited some more for this beer to hit Florida, it had two release dates set back here in Jacksonville before finally quietly hitting shelves this past Wednesday. The hunt for this beer was a good rush from wondering ""When will it be here?,"" ""Will I be able to get my hands on a 6pack?,"" to, ""I see it down the aisle!,"" ""It's in my possession, I have it! The day is mine Trebek!"" It was alot of fun just scouting and finding this beer."
12 oz. bottle poured into a footed Belgian tulip
12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.
"Best beer ever. I look forward to its release every year. A little limited in the Philly market if you want a whole case. Shangy's in Emaus always gets it, but it's first come first serve and sells out in one day. How long do these comments need to be?"
"Absolutely only of my all time favorites. There are many imitators out there, but HopSlam has a very specific and unmistakable balance - a perfect blend of bright, bitter, and hoppy notes."
A: Amber gold with an off-white head that leaves a beautiful lattice of lacing. Excellent head retention. 
"The price for this beer just kills me. Great beer, but others are almost equal for close to half the price."
Amber golden color with a thick beige head with low retention but leaving a constant ring.
"2014 edition. I had a 12 ounce pour ($8) at RFD in Washington DC. Time to find out if this is the real deal, or ""Hypeslam""."
"Picked this up the other day while looking for a different beer. Saw the $18.99 price tag and figured it had to be good. It was. the touch of honey is just great, such a nice beer. Very smooth and not overly hoppy. very satisfied. I think its only a spring beer so better get it when you can."
"Milky golden visual with strong effervescent bubbles releasing honey first aromas, with citrus undertones and the promise of a hyper hoppy IPA. This is a top notch IPA but the level of hops does not meet expectation the hoppy notes are mitigated by the sweetness of the honey. Smooth mouthfeel from start to finish, would highly recommend but for the hop head you may have happier options."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc. - Hopslam Ale, poured into a DFH Spiegelau IPA glass."
Its now been 3 weeks since Bells started distribution on Long island and ive been able to get 2 six packs already at 20$ a pop. Alot of complaints from the local beverage distributors about the lack of Hopslam ie (1 case per delivery) of course i always have a reservation on all the hard to gets though. 
"Look - golden amber pretty cloudy, had great head that went away. 2nd time I got it in my ukeg and it looks fairly cloudy but mostly clear with a slightly stick lacing."
"I was lucky enough to taste a couple IPA's before having this Hopslam and I could see why it was so coveted and pricy. This beer is a very refined IPA, with a beautiful yellow color, a nice smooth taste, not overly bitter and psychotic like some of the more hoppy IPAs, but still hoppy enough to have a distinctive fragrance. The nose was not overpowering, it was very delicate, and the keg had been tapped 12 hours before. The mouth feel was really good, it is a beer that feels uniform. It is overall a great Imperial IPA, definitively one of the better IPA around East."
"Pours about a half inch of creamy white head. Leaves a nice lacing in the glass. In the nose I'm getting a nice caramelized malt back bone and of course HOPS! I'm mainly smelling pine but I do detect some honey. In the flavor, I'm getting the bready malts again. Although there is a ton of hops, this beer has a really nice malt presence. The hops hit hard mid-palate on, and then the honey comes in to make the ending bitterness very pleasant. It feels smooth and goes down way too easily. Be careful with this one.."
"A: light golden orange in color, semitranslucent, average head keeping about 1/4"" of lacing around the lip. "
"Pours a clear orange color with a frothy white head with short retention. Excellent lacing, especially along the edges."
Was very excited to try this beer but unfortunately a big let down for me.
"Bottled 1-17-2014, poured into a 16oz, Odell Brewing branded snifter. (My first Hopslam...ever!)"
12 oz. bottle poured into a Burley Oak snifter (bottled on: 1/21/14)
"Almost clear, burnt orange color with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Smells of resinous hops, citrus fruits, and a touch of honey. The combination of all the flavors from the nose blend so well together on the taste. All the flavors shine across the tongue and leave a nice aftertaste. Medium body, smooth through with little carbonation. A nice balance of bitterness and stickiness lingers on the tongue and lips. Deliciousness all the way!!"
"Thnx Kev!! Saw the bottle leftover in my fridge and had to make sure it was left behind on purpose. In my opinion, a bit overhyped. Doesn't take away from the fact that it's still a solid dbl. just took my last sip and that 10% just became ever so evident. Worth the try if you can find. Cheers!"
You had this beer. 
"Served in a tulip. Fresh bottle date of 01/17/14, poured 02/2/2014."
"Bottling Date of 1/17/14: Pours a slightly hazy gold color with an absolutely massive foamy 2 finger off white head that was full of bubbles and faded slowly, so slowly that it looked like time stood still – this was one of the longest lasting heads I’ve ever seen, dissipating very slowly and leaving amazing sticky lacing coating the sides, rings as it goes down and a layer on top. Could be the best looking beer of all time, as this defines what an IPA could and should look like. I had 2 bottles tonight and the pour and look was fantastic after both pours. "
"Straight pour from a 12oz pry-off bottle to a teku glass; bottling date of January 21, 2014 printed in black ink at the bottom of the back label (“12634 PKGD 01/21/14 A”), making this bottle one month old exactly at the time of consumption. It only hit stores here maybe three days ago, so it could hardly get any fresher. "
"Pours a golden honey color, creamy head that fades with nice lacing"
"Can't say that I've been excited to try a beer in a very long time. I had Bells years ago when I knew people out in Michigan but this was one of their offerings I never found when stomping out in Great Lakes Country. When I found this at Top Hops last weekend, I was a bit leery of the $20+ price for a sixer but so many people on here raved about this beer that I grabbed two (one for friends) and lugged them home through the snow/slush/ice back to Jersey. After finally giving this a go, I can say that this was overpriced by a bit but certainly good, and a welcome change from the West Coast ""hop bombs"" and the Dogfish Head beers that are rated so highly."
Appearance:
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass at fridge temp (41 F). 12586 PKGD 01/16/14 A. Honestly thought I'd never get a chance to try this. This could be a total letdown, with the amount of time I've spent wishing I'd happen across it."
"Walking home from a hard days work. The sun is showcasing it’s vast array of colors on the landscape before me. Making my way to the stoop of my trailer, the main concern is to get out of these shoes. Plopping down to un-suffocate my feet, they decide to show off a few new blisters. About time for some new boots, I suppose. "
"On draft. Smells great, with lots of citrus, grapefruit and stone fruit. Lots of hops with generous bready malts, great balance, a highly drinkable and refreshing DIPA that packs a nice hoppy profile with a bit of a caramel malt touch in there. Great stuff."
Had this one both on tap and bottled. Reviewing a bottle as that is what I have now and is obviously freshest in memory. 
Bell's Hopslam 2014
A: Right there where an imperial IPA should be. Nice orange color with a super fluffy being near egg shell white.
A:
"Hands down my personal favorite. Picked up a case as soon as it came out for the season. Pricy but worth it. Pungent citrus, pine notes. Nice citrusy aroma (somewhat diminished by the honey as mentioned in an earlier review, but it does not take away from the overall experience). The addition of honey and a good amount of malt really balances the flavor, making it a very drinkable DIPA. Trying to make the case last into summer but I'm not sure it will be possible. I just can't keep my hands off this one. If you can find it...buy it!"

For the Review I am drinking a 12oz bottle poured into my favorite goblet.
"Jan. 4 bottle, into a CS snifter"
"Bottle dated 1/21/2014. Picked up a couple of six packs as it came off the truck this morning, promptly put it in the fridge when I got home knowing I would be unable to let it sit. Tried it for the first time last year, and was blown away by it to the point that I was able to acquire 1 1/2 total cases from my local store, which proceeded to disappear over the following 5 or 6 weeks. THis year it had a reputation to live up to. Poured it into a Piraat glass immediately after retrieving it from the fridge, which in hind sight was a mistake. This needs to sit some and warm slightly prior to drinking, initially it was lacking in smell and taste, however it became clearly evident over the course of the first bottle that a slight warming does wonders in both areas. Poured a solid two fingers that quickly disappeared leaving a slight lacing on the sides of the glass which continued as the level was drained away. Again, very little was noticed in smell until it warmed slightly. One thing immediately noticeable was an acidic taste on the back sides of the tongue. This was rapidly followed as the beer warmed with the smell of grapefruit and pine tempered apparently by the honey, so it never developed the strong tastes typically associated with the type. Alcohol was never apparent in the quantity indicated, so as I remember from the previous year, it snuck up rather rapidly by the end of the first beer. Color was a nice golden orange, somewhat on the thin side versus heavy you would expect from a high ABV beer. I do think the 2013 version was slightly better, however that should be considered from the perspective the 2013 was a first time tasting, and therefore quite a high pedestal, and I have noticed a similar trend with other releases I have tasted. All in all, this is still one of my favorites. I am definitely looking forward to my other case I should have in another week or so."
The beer comes in a hazy deep orange amber color along with a large white head.
Brew date on this bottle was 1.2.14 and poured it on 2.17.
"Been enjoying this beer since 2006, first time reviewing. Bottled January 21st."
A - Light orange to amber in color. Head was a nice white foam that quickly dissipated and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.
A-a clear light amber color with a fingers worth of white head that sticks to the glass
"A- Semi hazy, rich amber color. Poured a creamy 1/2 finger head. Nice trailing and lacing."
A: golden ale with a slight haze and white bubbly head that left some lace behind
"12 oz bottle, dated 12/27/2013. Pours a beautiful opaque orange with a good head and moderate lacing. The smell is sweet with honey and there is some moderate citrus notes. The taste is sweet up front but really balances out with the hop bitterness. I get a good amount of the honey and then juicy grapefruit. The feel is smooth and there is minimal lingering bitterness for me. I also don't really notice any alcohol despite the ABV. Overall this is an excellent beer that does a great job balancing the hops and sweetness. I wish I had it on-tap or at least a fresher bottle, but this beer still does not disappoint."
"I've been eyeing this for some time on the BA top 250. The name jumps out at you so I've been eager to try this. Bell's just arrived in NY this week, but this is a hard one to get. Stores are telling me it's flying of the shelves, even with a 6 pack limit. It's name is catchy, and very accurate."
A - Amber color with a white foam head. Settles quickly. Some lacing is noted. I see no carbonation.
"Been a long, long time since I've had a Bell's beer. Used to enjoy the THA on a daily basis living in NC, but here in NY we did not get Bell's beer. Until this week. I walked into my beer shop, saw THA, and right next to it, a 6 of hopslam. I couldn't believe my eyes. However, its a 3 bottle limit. Still, I'll take it. Here goes nothing:"
Picked up a 6 pack from my local ABC liquor for 17.99$. Total wine wanted 21.00$ (highway robbery). I must say I felt stupid for paying so much for this beer but had to try due to the hype. Man am I glad I took the leap. This beer is quite possibly the most complete and tasty IPA I have ever had. Smell is floral with hints of the honey it's brewed with. Taste is complex with the usual mango and grapefruit hop flavor. Mouthfeel is great. Slight bitterness which I like but fades quickly leaving a great aftertaste that leaves the palate wanting more. I feel guilty drinking this beer as I feel like it is liquid gold. So glad this lived up the the hype and feel like I want to spend my life savings on more (kidding of course). Currently drinking and if this isn't heaven idk what is. Damn good brew!!!
Packaged 1/21/14
"Appearance - great amber color, very appetizing. Medium head that settles relatively quickly and remains on the perimeter of the glass with mild coating. "
"12 oz brown bottle with typical Bell's style label and logo artwork. Dude slammed with actual hops. Not the greatest of labels, but what's inside has made this a classic design outside and in. Poured into a authentic Bell's American Pint glass. "
"Two tulip glasses over 90 minutes, with and without food at the Federal TapHouse in Harrisburg, PA."
"Pours very clear light orange color with big bubble 1"" head. Head holds on really well with nice lacing. Smells very hoppy with nice floral aroma, and also pick up some nice citrus. Taste is citrus and hop with great heat form the alcohol. Also taste honey which I think gives is a smoother finish than some other dbl IPAs. Mouthfeel is complex with big bitter form the hop and citrus to sweetness form the honey. Beer is silky and well carbonated. "
Bought a six pack at weis for $18 lets see if it was worth it. Let sit 30min befor I poured it. Poured into a standard 12oz 
On to the Aroma!
"I had rated this a 4.25 when I first tried it years ago. Now in March 2017 this just doesn't hold up to the current IPAs. On tap into a tulip, average IPA at best."
"Edit on Aug 27, 2018 - At this time I have had 185 different double IPAs. There are a number that rise the top (Pliney the Elder, Double Trouble & Devil Dancer, Enjoy By & 120 min and some from the Veil), but after some contemplation and rereading my past reviews, I have decided to make Hopslam my number one DIPA and rate is as a 5.0. Maybe one day I'll get a taste of The Younger and reevaluate."
Been looking forward to this one for quite a while. Glad I could get a pretty fresh couple of bottles...this was bottled on 1/17 today is 2/11.
Poured from a 12oz bottle packaged on 1/28/2014. My buddy and I went through a lot to get this beer (he really was really captivated by the hype) and I'm excited to try it. 
"Pours a hazy amber with a thin, white head. Little lacing. Lots of hop resin, tropical fruit and biscuit aromas on the nose. Honey notes on the palate with nice hop bitterness. Very dry. Some heat from the 10% ABV. Super smooth with a medium body. Nice level of carbonation. Overall, Bell's Hopslam is unlike any other DIPA out there, well crafted and balanced, it's definitely worth seeking out!"
Poured bottle dated 1/17/14 into New Belgium globe
Poured into Snifter- Hazy/gold with a three finger head
Ahh the famous Hopslam...finally managed to track down 8 bottles of it between two stores. 
"A- Light amber color, caramel, high carbonation, almost champagne-like with all the bubbles. Great lacing. A couple turns of the glass brings the head right back."
Pours a slightly amber or more dark golden color with a nice head that is thin and creamy and left nice lacing. 
Overall I thought my bottle was forward with the alcohol in the nose and in the taste. Once getting past that the beer is very tasty with orange and some more tropical citrus on the nose and in the taste. The honey gives the mouth feel a little bit of a thickness but is overall pleasant. On an overall basis I want to try this beer on tap to see if the alcohol forward ness is limited to this batch. Very good beer.
Bottled 1.17.14. Poured into pint glass.
Poured into pint glass- orange/gold with a one inch quickly fading head
Poured from the bottle into my Spieglau IPA glass... Best Christmas gift ever. Thanks Sis!
"There is one of the best beers in the world today. Unbelievable aroma. Citrus, pines and a touch of honey really have your palate craving it. For the amount of different hops it is made with, it is pretty unbelievable how smooth of a beer it is. Bell's Hopslam is simply one of the best beers in the world."
"1-3-14 Batch side by side with the older one. I got these both in a trade, so I'm not saying that I have the world's most refined palette here or anything, I just picked the one that had the least amount of oxidation."
"While this is an excellent tasting beer from the bottle, it is enhanced by drinking it from the glass to capture the aromas. The scent and smell of this beer coupled with it's hoppy yet smooth taste, makes this beer both delicious and enjoyable. Highly recommend!"
"Bottle to glass. Honey color with clumped lacing. Sweet honey floral, citrus and pine aromas. Taste is sweet up front and carries huge floral and citrus hop notes. The finish is long and bitter and a bit boozy/spicy but the bitterness is never overpowering. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy with prickly carbonation. Getting Hopslammed is reminiscent of a sweeter, amped up Jai Alai. Goes down dangerously smooth."
Appearance: a deep orange color. fairly hazy and almost opaque. a small off white head that leaves a weak lacing
P: Pours a golden apricot body with a swirly micro bubble tornado in the middle. Capped with a thin creamy white top with sudsy lacing glistening from the sides. 
"Pours a beautiful hazed orange amber with a creamy head of off white foam that lasts and leaves rings of lace. Nose is resonant with hops sweetness. At first it's tangerine, then a bit of grapefruit, some pine. but then the floral overcomes anything you can name and these hops become pure perfumed lightness. The malt is a breaddy scent with a bit of earthy honey. Orange blossoms. No alcohol on the nose. Taste is very sweet. The honey is thick or so it seems and the malt is rich. It has a fruitiness form the tangerine and grapefruit but it's very dry and so it's earthier rather than juicier. The malt becomes like a soft sugar cookie on the nose and on the palate. It's almost chewy. There is a faint herbal that becomes stronger as you drink. I was waiting for a biting, bitter, tongue bruising like the label said but I found the bitter to be a bit more than moderate. As I am finishing the glass the juiciness is coming forward more and the scent is becoming a bit more tropical. The alcohol is only a hint on the very back end of the swallow and in the warmth as it finishes. Mouthfeel is creamy, sticky and full-ish. The aftertaste fades and all that remains is the bitter, the pine and the hop floral sweetness."
On tap from Colts Grille on 2/7/14.
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, copper-gold coloring with a slow flow of carbonation and a frothy, low profile, bright white head that clings all over the glass, and slowly settles into a filmy surface coating as you drink. Aromas of deep, rich, bitter, resinous hops all over the nose, with a subtle sweet caramel backbone, and a blend of tropical fruits that include pineapple, mango, and grapefruit. Very balanced and very rich nose. Flavors are tropical fruit forward, rich and sweet, with a blast of citrus tart and bitter to follow. That's a lot of fruit on the palate all at once, but it is perfectly balanced by the pungent, dank, piney and grassy backbone, rich in resinous characteristics. This goes from fruity to forest green in a flash. Wow. All through this, there is a subtle sweetness of caramel darting in and out. Great tasting brew. The aftertaste has some pepper spicing and stronger floral notes, but it's still all hops. Smooth and robust in mouth, leading to a smooth, clean, slightly drying finish. This is amazing."
"I love you Bell's but the DIPA category has caught up with you. In 2007, I had my first taste of Hopslam and it was a religious experience. But seven years have passed and while Hopslam is still a standard bearer for the category many have joined the ranks. It's a great DIPA but in my opinion no longer the Holy Grail and just last week I paid $22.00 for a six pack which I suppose isn't crazy given the going rate of so many over-priced bombers? Again, still very, very good but no longer ""I'll search for it for weeks."" I'm in the Chicagoland area and for me, that DIPA is now Three Floyd's Permanent Funeral!!! And for Bell's, think Oracle DIPA (only available in MI) but really, really worth the drive but call first....summer release."
"This is the one beer you want in the ""desert island"" scenario, if you like HOPS. Caps lock is on for H-O-P-S as the grapefruit flavor is only rivaled by Fresca or an actual grapefruit. It is between the eyes HOPS and it trounces other hoppy brews."
"Even after all these years, hopslam is a must buy every late winter/early spring. The aggressive hops with the sweet subduing nature of the honey is a winning combo for me. On tap of the bursting of hop aromas, and wonderful dipa flavors, it is extremely drinkable. Going to get one out of the fridge tonight!"
"Appearance: Golden orange (?) That is what comes to mind. Hazy, unfiltered. 1/2 to 1 finger off-white head. Heavy lacing. "
"Bottled on 1/17/14, consumed on 2/6/14 - making this bottle just 20 days old. . . . This arrived in the Albany area for the first time ever just two days ago (6-pack was $18.99, nearly $21 with tax and deposit). Reviewing my 2nd bottle. . . . "
"Poured from bottle into chilled DFH pint glass. Beautiful amber/orange color. Short but fluffy white head, which quickly dissipates to this white collar. Lots of minuscule bubbles and excellent sticky lacing throughout the experience. On the nose, the initial scent is a lovely pink grapefruit with floral hints, followed by sweet papaya (must be the honey). On the palate, the flavor profile replicates yet intensifies the olfactory sensations. Nice full mouthfeel -- not chewy per se, but ample and all-encompassing. Virtually no alcohol burn. The finish is long and sweet, yet balanced -- meaning that there is enough malt and alcohol present to extend the finish, without any of the elements (the sweetness from the honey, the pine from the hops, the malt, or the burn of alcohol) overpowering or dominating the experience. Just a long, steady, well integrated finish all the way through. Hard to believe that anyone could actually plan for this to happen -- seems more like a coincidental miracle of divine artwork than anything designed by human hands. All in all, a tremendous experience. This beer is truly unique. I've certainly never had anything else quite like it."
"Served in a Sam Adams special pint glass. The aroma on this is wonderful with a bright mandarin orange, sweetness and orange blossom honey. Deep gold color with large white persistent head. Flavor is slightly sweet up front that fades to a bitter hop-flavored middle and off-dry finish that borders of astringent. Some orange sweetness and hint of honey with a light grainy character as well. Some alcohol warming. Overall this year's is very well balanced and easy to drink, way better than I remember it. Not just the hype apparently!"
"Tasted like I was at a party and someone poured Jim Beam's American Honey into my IPA. Overly hyped, would drink again though. "
"A - Wonderful as expected. Little less head, probably due to the higher abv."
"A: Dark golden, cream colored head."
Bottle > Chimay Challice
"Color is honey gold, and I can see some gossamer of unfiltered goodness in the center of the glass. This isn't the best tasting DIPA I've had, but it might crack the top 3. The charm for me is in the honey - it's such a great and unique spin. After my first bottle, I smelled the empty glass some time later and it smelled so much of honey. It's really present in the flavor as well, it's great. I can just barely detect the alcohol on the first sip and after that it's gonzo - THAT'S what makes this beer so impressive from a technical standpoint. This is also the beer that taught me what it means for a beer to have a creamy mouthfeel - I could just let this one roll around on my tongue for days."
I don't get it. Bitter with a cardboard like after taste.
A: pours a beautiful orange/ amber color with a small amount of head that disappears into a Lacey remnant.
"I look forward this ale every year and while the appearance and pour hinted of its usual, solid taste and finish, I was very disappointed with the batch this year."
"A: A finger+ head of bright white head formed with the appearance of soap bubbles, fine ones on the bottom and larger mixed sized resting on top. The beer is a woody dark orange color with great clarity, no sediment, just a consistint stream of bubbles rising to the top."

But it's drinkibility is dangerous at 10 percent.I try to get a keg every year but no luck yet.maybe next year.just tried 2014 version not real impressed not much smell or taste really boozy I've had way better ipa's for less money it's over rated I don't know what they are doin different very dissapointed
"Appearance- Pours dark golden slightly hazy with a foamy head that disappears quickly, leaves small amounts of lacing at top of glass."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, packaged on 1/11."
"OK, and with this, I'm officially done with Bell's."
"Spent most of the weekend trying to secure a few six packs of this year's release of Hopslam. I let it sit in the fridge a few days before giving it a whirl. Poured a hazy golden color typical of American IPAs. Smell was terrific with the hops overtaking everything else which is expected. Front end was fantastic with the abundance of hops and bitterness. Thought the back end was a little too sweet for me but guess that is where the honey comes in. It was great to finally try this beer since I have heard about it for quite some time. I expected a lot more from this beer and that was probably due to the hassle getting ahold of it and the hype surrounding Hopslam. Overall it was a great IPA, one that I could drink regularly. It wasn't the best IPA I have tried but it was certainly one that I would order. Not sure if the $18.99 per six pack and the hassle acquiring the beer were worth it in the end."
"The amount of trouble and dollars i went through to get a six pack of this particular nectar generated high expectations. Hopslam is good but not great. In my experience, the honey impartment blurred the hop intensity. Mouthfeel is spot on and the 10% is hardly noticeable. Kudos for this. That a brewer can generate this type of excitement: double kudos. For me the beer not only doesnt live up to the hype, i can probaly find two or three readily available brews at a more approachable price that deliver more. But i can also see how this appeals to many afficianados due to its subtleties and present hoppiness. Could probably be a great introductory example for those who want a big sweetish Iipa on occasion. Maybe i am just cranky that i had to monitor a beer store's twitter feed to score some of this ..."
Serving Type - Bottle
"Picked up a sixer from Whole Foods in Wexford. That was the limit. I remember really enjoying last years batch, though I only had two bottles, one of which was not ideally fresh. Freshness is not an issue here. Bottled 1/16/2014. "
Finally getting to try this legendary DIPA from Bell's. Will be fun to how it stacks up to some of my favorites in the style. Enjoyed out of a 12 oz brown bottle with a bottling date of 12/27/13 and poured into the IPA-specific glass from Speigelau.
12oz bottle poured into Mr. Pint Glass.
A: Hazy amber with small white head. Very nice lacing.
Served from bottle dated 12-27-2013 into tulip glass.
"A- Light to medium copper tone, similar to the color of cream soda. 1/4 inch head after it settles. Definite retention of foam on the side of the glass. Medium carbonation appearance based on the amount of bubbles ascending from the bottom of the glass."
i really don't get the hype about this beer. every year i get a few and just think its ok. way too boozy. smells great tho.
"Can't really see the color too well through the brown bottle but it looks clear and golden. Smells like pine and citrus but quite sweet. First impression taste-wise is an abundance of resinous hops, but it quickly becomes sweet (not overly so) as the honey flavors emerge in the backend. It's a flavor combination that works really well, but six-packs are pretty pricey and hard to find from what I understand so I don't think I'll be enjoying this one as much as I'd like to."
"Man, when this stuff hit Ohio this month, it sold out within 6 hours at many locations. During my hunt it was the same story - ""We put out 80 cases at noon and it was gone by 530"". I finally found it at Jungle Jim's. What a great beer. The 10% abv is well hidden behind the taste."
"Pours a sun golden yellow orange in color, with lathery 2 fingers of straight white foam."
2014 - 4.5
"Bottle poured into a tulip - Bottled on 1/16/14, enjoyed on 1/24/14"
This might be the best IPA I've ever personally tasted. 
A - 3.75 - Orange amber color that's pretty clear with a 1/4 white head that leaves sparse lacing
"Great beer. Best after or during a good meal, at 10% take your time and you will get a warm relaxing buzz. I'm not a beer expert by any means, so excuse any misuse of jargon, but it seems like the honey balances out the bitter hop flavor. Properly poured it will have a good head so when you take your first drink make sure to get some on your upper lip, especially if you have a mustache; you will get to taste this amazing nectar all night long."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper/gold color with about a finger’s breadth of pure white, bubbly head. The bubbles linger for a few minutes before settling to confluent patches of large bubbles around the surface of the liquid. Scattered strands of lacing decorate the glass. The aroma is of grapefruit/orange citrus, honey, cane sugar, wet earth, a bit of lemongrass, and subtle white pepper. It tastes of various citruses - primarily grapefruit and lemon rind - alongside a predominant honey flavor. Cane sugar, grass, and some earthen/peppery hops round it out. Mouthfeel is lively, but slightly more viscous than many other DIPAs, perhaps due to the honey. It has a wet, resinous finish as the bitter hops linger; a bit of warming alcohol is noticeable right on the end.. Overall, the honey adds a unique dimension to this big beer that hides its alcohol very well. The honey isn't entirely to my liking, but it is a very well executed beer none-the-less."
"Way overrated, I just don't enjoy malty IPA's."
"Pours out a dark amber with a one finger white head with great retention and nice lacing. Smell is pretty fruity for what I expected. Some really nice guava, grapefruit, a tiny bit of pine and maybe a little sweetness from some malt. Taste is fairly fruity with basically what is in the nose except more nice and fruity. Mouthfell is thick for the style. Really a nice beer. Been a while since I enjoyed it."
Pours a nice golden with a good head and strong lacing.
"Serving: On tap, 12oz in a snifter"
"My heart swells each year when I see the new six packs of HS on the shelf. My other love, Mrs. Vanbeer, feels a little left out of the parade. However, she likes the beer too. But I am not the jealous type, except when she drinks ""my"" beer."
12 oz bottle drank 5 days after date on bottle(can't remember date?)
poured 12oz bottle into snifter. Bottled on 1/2/14
Bottle stamped 01/03/14 poured into a DFH IPA glass.
A: Pours a golden/orange with a one finger white head that dissipates slowly with nice lacing.
"Not as bitter as I thought it would be, probably due to the Honey. Bottle poured into a snifter glass. Bottled 10 day ago (1/11/14). Great fruity smell, very smooth. Almost a little too malty for me, but not really. Hopslam met all my expectations and then some. CHEERS!!"
"So finally, after a year of waiting, I finally have a 6-pack of the much-hyped Hopslam at my house. I love DIPAs, so I had high hopes for this."
Bell's Hopslam Ale
Bottled 12-20-2013
"A - This has a golden orange color, with some opacity, a moderate head that fades fairly quickly but which remains to coat the glass with nearly solid lacing."
"12 oz. bottle, with bottled on date 12/27/2013 printed on the back label, so this is some pretty fresh beer. At long last I have acquired a six pack of Bell's Hopslam, after missing out in the past."
"Pours a beautiful copper amber with a generous head that quickly dissipates to a lasting tan lacing. The aroma on the ale is pure hops. Tons of citrus, grapefruit, lots of pine and dare I say a hint of coriander. It sips medium bodied and coats the palate in a very pleasant way. The flavor is all hops (as expected and anticipated). An ample amount of pine and grapefruit. Super bitter and dry with little to no balance. But this is the intention of the ale. Balance is not a need, necessity, or a want from an ale like this. It is all about the hops and this one delivers. Super bitter, but fresh and florally. Not a hint of the high abv. It's not a balanced ipa but it is Every thing it is meant to be. Not an ale I'd want to down daily but most certainly one that I'll look forward to enter every year."
"Huge astringent aroma of pineapple, mango, pink grapefruit and some peach. There is a bit of resin as well. Some nice malty sweetness - I assume due to the honey. The taste explodes of astringent tropical fruits and some hop resins. The body on this is perfect for a big DIPA - medium-full, rounded, and coating. "
"2016 batch on draft. I think Bell's really needs to put some thought into how to fix this beer. Hopslam's quality, in my opinion, has degraded year-over-year. This tasted like sugar water with hops added. Overly sweet, with off malt flavors that paired poorly with the hop profile. Kind of a mess, overall."
"Picked up a fresh six pack from my bottle store today. Poured from a bottle into my Founders (I know, I know...) tulip glass. Aggressive pour yields a solid 1 inch head that lingers, and lingers... Slowly dissipates leaving excellent lacing sticky to the glass. The color? This is what this style should be, a hazy orange gold tint. Big up front hop kick in the nose with solid boozy smell behind. Exactly what I wanted. Taste? I can only imagine what this is like on tap if it's this delicious out of the bottle!! Very similar to Doom, without Doom's overpowering alcohol kick. Loads of piney bitter hops, held in check by the honey to balance them out. For a ten percenter, this is a very drinkable beer! The sweetness of the honey is the perfect balance to the hops. This beer takes the sting out of a cold bitter Michigan winter night. Damn good beer!"
"After living in Michigan for a year now, we FINALLY have our hands on this. It has been a top “want” for a while now, oh yes. So we crack a pair (12/27/13 PKGD, so you KNOW that bad boy is fresh), pouring into our oversized tasting snifters. It appears the color of burning rust. It puts up a solid two finger head of eggnog colored cream that slowly sloshes around the glass and up its sides. This holds well, depositing beads and pinheads of lacing in no real organized or uniform fashion. A chill haze cuts clarity, but no sediment is noted once this dissipates. Carbonation appears to be light. The aroma sings of the fruitiest, most tropical and nectar-laden juicy hops one can find, with sugary twangs of bubblegum esters, clean honey, herbal mint tea, fleshy kiwi, mango, pineapple, pomegranate and guava fruitiness, Muscat grape, lemon rind, and dried apricots. The malt bill is fresh with notes of pales and caramels, otherwise bolstered by singed rye graininess, grappa booziness grape stem, distant earthen mineral, black pepper, pine bitters, and phenolic clove. Our first impression does not necessarily match the line on the back of the bottle, but we do feel that with just a tiny flick in one direction, the bitterness, which is paradoxically held at bay by the sweeter side of the hops, could tumble and roar to the tune of a west coast beat. As we sip, the taste opens up with bitter grapefruity and floral hops, resiny pine, foam packing peanuts and cardboard, splashes of vodka booziness, black pepper and cumin spiciness, raw honey and honeycomb sweetness, chlorine bite and lemony cleanser bite. The middle peaks with lemon zest and wet juiciness, cherry flesh and skin astringency, further bittering thickness of piney, herbal, and soapy hops, potpourri florals, bubblegum esters, cloven and lightly plastic phenols, cornmeal, clean pale malts, and white sugar sweetness. The end washes with dank herbal, floral, and nectary hops, with rumbles of booze and high potency vanilla extract, cocoa butter chemical bite, water soaked rose petals, lavender wax, roasty caramel and sweaty pale malts, apricot, tonic water bitterness, and cottoned soapiness. The aftertaste breathes of orange bitters and blossoms, vanilla bean, steely vegetal greens, mineral, pine sap, green grassiness, mushy graphite, peppered boozy spice, soapy and citric hops, heavily bittered plastic phenols, malted toast, and tiger balm. The body is solidly medium with full fringes, while carbonation is medium to high. Each sip gives nice slurp and smack, with comparably nice froth, cream, and foam. Finishing pop is crisp and sticky. The mouth is left coated, lightly tannic, and astringently chalked along the hard palate and tongue. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks nicely, but is slowed due to its warming and thicker qualities."
A - Pours a beautiful hazy orange with a one-finger foamy white head. Nice amount of lacing.
On tap at Logan's Alley in GR. Statewide barrel release 2014. Too bad America can't be here too. 
"The original and still the best hoppy beer available. A beautiful orange-golden appearance with hops, citrus, honey, and pine on the nose. Taste is pine and grapefruit with honey and sweet malt to balance out the bitterness. Booze barely makes its presence known. 2014 is a great batch!"
Served in a 12 oz glass at Bells 1-11-14
"A- A nice two finger head hangs around for a while before giving in and leaving a tight little crown. Plenty of lacing. A rich golden amber color. Not clear but mostly sunny, no clouds around here today. "
"A: Dark honey/copper color, with an off white head."
Too boozy. Too malty. Too old school. I remember when this beer was in the top 20 when I first started using BA. This brewery has just flat out failed to keep up with what I'm looking for in an IPA today.
12 oz bottle poured into a wine multipurpose chalice.
"Poured into a delirium tulip. Pours a nice healthy copper color with a light creamy head. Slight sense of carbonation. Strong smell of hops, honey, passion fruit (maybe). "
A: Golden orange with two fingers of white head. Nice lacing.
This was bottled in January 2013. 
A - Rich orange-gold with minimal head. 
"Like so many of this style, good but overrated. I feel that Two Hearted is a vastly superior beer."
Actually got this beer in Florida of all places.
A: A nice true Orange with a mild/moderate head. 
A- Pours a hazy dark golden color. 1 1/2 finger white head. Laces like a dream
Pours a perfect orange color with just a little head. Good lacing that lasts a long time. Smells as good as any ale I've tried. Very hoppy with a lot of citrus. Tastes even better than it smells. Smooth as can be with a great taste of hops and citrus with just a hint of honey. 
A: a beautiful orange with the perfect amount of head. 
This is a delicious beer for hop-heads.
Appearance - nice rich yellow color with some subtle orange.
"FLAVOR, FLAVOR, FLAVOR!!! Great front, and back taste for your taste buds. A Double India Pale Ale style beer, with a overwhelming hop aroma, grapefruit and just a taste of honey. This beer is very sought after by everyone in the industry, so make certain to keep informed by your local distributor of it's arrival. (Most places will not make reservation for it, and will run out quickly.)"
"Hopslam is great beer for a hophead. I have had it since 2010, every year but I must say that if you cellar it for a year, the hopiness calms down and the semi-sweet overtones of the beer are more dominant. "
"Pours a peachy orange color with about a finger of white head, lots of carbonation. "
This 'IPA' is the Best I have had. I am actually drinking it as I am writing this. I usually wait to write a review. This will make your taste buds jump for joy. Very Hoppy. If you have a chance to try this it is a must have. The smell is pretty weak. Not so much of a smell at all .
APPEARANCE
Appearance-
"Aroma is very dank hops and a hint of honey. The flavor is grapefruit, fruit, hop resin, malts and a very bitter finish."
2008-
A: beautiful light amber with a big fluffy head. Lots of tight carbonation bubbles coming up from the bottom on this one.
"After not having this beer for the past four years I was a little hesitant to dish out $20 for a six-pack, but I was pleasantly surprised. The aroma was just awesome! Floral with the sweet smell of honey and hops. The taste did a great job of masking the alcohol content."
A twelve ounce can packaged 01/03/17 poured in a Hopslam tulip glass. 
"Ah! Hopslam. Just saying the word makes my mouth happy. We all know about this elusive bastard and the kerfluffle surrounding it. Let's start by looking at the label, which seems to depict some poor schnook being crushed by a giant hop plant. Yeah, I get it, it's heavy shit and such. This is a visual that brings to mind domination over the individual, who is overwhelmed by something more powerful than himself. "
Clear Vibrant Tangerine. Creamy white head with decent retention. Beautiful Frosty Laces.
"Pours a semi clear amber/orange hue, nice soapy 1 finger white head."
Poured fresh from the can into a tulip
"Bottle into pint glass, about 5 months old at time of review "
"This is one of my favorite beers ever. The flavor is huge but not as big as it gets, more subtle than many Imperial IPA's. Reminds me of laying in a dew saturated field of wildflowers. Wakes up my entire olfactory system and excites me for the next sip. Not very ""bite-y"" and I love the floral notes."
"pours a dark, murky tangerine with a medium head that poofs. nose; simcoe hops, pine, & grapefruit pith. taste; sweet malt, citrus hops, grapefruit, mango, & honey. sweet and citrusy mango hangs out strong on the aftertaste. medium+ carbonation & mouthfeel. unfiltered AND unpasteurized - definitely lends a thicker, starchier mouthfeel. a touch sweet, but well-balanced considering the abv (which is decently tame) and hop bill. i hate that this beer isn't widely available, so every time i see it, there's an availability/pricing game to contend with. hoppy, juicy, a touch sweet. a must-try for ipa fans. excellent."
Serving Type: On tap
"Copper in color, a little hazy, foamy head. Not much on the nose--mostly suds, with a hint of pine. First flavor that hits is the booze---I can really taste the 10%. Strong malt backbone, some piney hop bitterness, a little honey on the finish. I don't really get the acclaim for this beer."
PLEASE START MASS PRODUCING THIS!!
"What a great beer, so, so sad this is only produced 1x / year. They need to follow suit with SN Hoptimum and produce more regularly. Lots of citrus, piney, little malt, hoppy, and just a hint of sweetness to balance out the bitterness. Certainly one of the top (if not the top) IPA/DIPA out there. I stock up on this every year to drink through spring and take camping in the summer. It's a great way to wind down an afternoon and set up an evening of big beers. We've put it up against Pliny's (fresh on fresh), and Hopslam wins out every time, hands down. "
"Top 3 IPA's I ever had. So full of flavor, yet very drinkable. I love to taste the hops but not be overwhelmed and this seems like the perfect combination of hops. It does not taste like there is 10% alcohol in this beer. The flavor is addictive and makes me want to keep sipping."
Appearance: It has a nice hazy golden/orange color to it. It has a nice thick off-white head that dies down moderately and leaves some nice lacing.
"12oz bottle into a yankee pint. Bottle in January. Not optimal freshness, but it'll do."
From 12 oz bottle poured into nonic tulip glass
Poured into a snifter
Another great brew from Bells. Poured into a pint glass. Golden to dark golden color. The aroma of hops filled my nostrils. The toaste of hops and fruit filled my mouth with great delight. The taste and aftertaste were completely smooth to me. Another great brew with great fan fare. Worth trying. This beer is so popular that we have customers ask for it by the case
Hybrid on tap from notes and bottle split btw 2 low balls collaboration review with Carol.
Very strong beer and not one that you can drink every day (if you want to be productive). It has a nice look to it in a pilsner and the aroma is rather fruity to me. I do really appreciate the strong taste. The beer lets you know you are drinking a good hearty ale. I do enjoy Hopslam just can't drink it that often nor have too many in one setting.
Bottled: 01/16/13. Drank 04/14/13
"Appearance - Golden in color, medium thick head that doesn't linger, highly carbonated"
A very special thank you to GAELIC for trading me the Hopslam. He also so sent me some other North Carolina Beers that I am looking forward to trying.
"So for whom the AbBBp is named for is who must be thanked prior to writing this post. Not only did he send us the sixer, but I also had the pleasure of sharing it with another AbBBp member, ole Ne. "
poured into a chimay chalice
"with all the hype around this I wanted it to floor me just like heady did, and just like the younger did, but it didn't. I mean, its a great beer don't get me wrong, but it didn't stand out to me as something worthy of the absurd praise its received. the pour is a nice hazy honey color with a creamy white head with fine retention, beautiful. the nose is oily hops, high alpha semisweet fruity hops, with some pollen character from the honey and a subtle but complimentary yeast strain. the flavor is boldly hoppy, both bitter as hell and oily sticky danky. its a beer with plenty of motion, moving from a fruity sort of vibe to a really gnarly bitter bomb. the sweetness of the honey is hard to pick out, and the alcohol is shockingly well hidden. you would never know this was 10% abv until you drank 3 or 4 of them and it walloped you! great mouthfeel with groovy carbonation and a fuller medium body. there is a great resinous feel left after the swallow. overall an outstanding imperial ipa, one of the better ones ive had honestly, but it just didn't blow my mind the way it has for others."
"A: The beer is hazy pale yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that only died down a little, consistently leaving a thin head covering the surface. "
"A: Honey with a slight amber tinge. I see suspended fine white particles, and a couple larger dark ones. 1 finger slight yellow head, nice lacing. Medium low carbonation evident"
"Hopslam lives up to the hype. i have had the last three years and they are always good. One thing I noticed this year compared to others however is the fact that it is 10 times better on tap. You pull a lot of the honey on tap, but hardly get any of the honey out of the bottle. I have also tried old Hopslam and this is not a good beer after age. Best when fresh"
"I love this American Double/Imperial IPA, or whatever you categorize this as. Its awesome just the same. "
"2014- 4.25: A famous beer on the line of Great Lakes Christmas ale. Only coming around once a year, this is the only beer where I really enjoy the hops. My favorite of all the Bell's beers and I really like Bell's. Good flavor, good color. The only drawback of this beer is the price. Last time I saw it at the store, it was 17 dollars a 6 pack"
"Pours a nice orange/straw color, with pretty small head. Smells like mild citrusy hops, with a certain tang to it. Smell is not as strong as I would have expected, but good. The taste is much like the smell, but less delicious hops and more booze and bitterness. Mouthfeel is perfectly good, but overall, I was surprised by this beer. I'm surprised it's got the high rating that it does, as while it's good, I'd put it below almost every other DIPA on the list. I'll have to try again in case I got a bad/old bottle."
"The appearance is a shade between golden and copper with a thin layer of head that quickly dissipates but leaves some lace behind. There are hops and a floral essence in the nose, but it is not terribly impressive. Flavor-wise, there is the presence of malt, citrus fruits and, of course, hops. Without a doubt, the hoppiness is not on par with the finest DIPAs out there, but this offering certainly gets more hoppy as one moves down the glass."
I waited 40 days (lent) to drink this and holy Jesus this is amazing! 
Pours a bright golden orange with a one and a half finger creamy white head with good retention and moderate lacing.
"Pours a clear amber with 1 1/2 finger head that stays for days. Smells of citrus and pine. Tastes very balanced between hop bite, sweetness, a piney after taste. Laces like it was Brussels. The most drinkable 10% I've ever had. You can bury me with a case for the afterlife."
First time from a can and brought cross country to me by a friend.
Poured from a 12oz bottle to a sampler glass 6oz
S - overwhelming scent of roasted pineapple.
"A: poured from a 12 oz bottle (bottled 1/15/13) into a snifter, beautiful orange amber with a white foamy head that lingers leaving good lacing, slight haze"
Poured into a large wine glass. Bottled Jan 9/2013. Served out of the fridge. Acquired in a trade from FrostyWG.
"Thanks to my sales rep Chris for this. Smells fantastic, anticipating a glass from my server."
"Poured into a pint. Several months old, not fresh."
Bottled 01/15/13
"Tried this on Tap as well as bottled. I find that this beer varied a fair amount each time i tried it. I thought the fresh bottle I tried (less than a month after bottling) was the best quality and certainly had the strongest hop aroma. The Tap version seemed very very bitter with less sweetness in and balance, and the bottle i tried two months after bottling date was still very good but lacked the huge nose that i really liked on the first bottle i tried. "
12 oz bottle poured into my lost abbey stemware glass
"The famed Hopslam. Traded for some last year, and loved it. Was a bit let down this year, the hype for it is a bit too high in my opinion. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Abandon Brewing tulip."
A- hazy golden/orange color with a thin white head
Bright brass with trailing white film.
"One of my favorite beers. The thing that has always stood out to me about this beer is the hints of honey. It is such an easy drinking beer, but the taste and layers of flavor are so complex that by the time you start to put it together, you take another sip and realize that there are even more layers. One of my top beers!"
Beautiful! Pours dark golden and clear with about 1.5 fingers of light golden foam. Very fine and soapy lacing. 
Pours a light brown to yellow with a thick head. Good lacing. Aroma is strong hops - mostly pine with some floral. Flavor is consistent with the nose - sweet up front and piney bitter on the back persists well. Maybe a hint of honey sweetness present on the back end. Great beer.
I received this fresh but took a while to review it. Down to my last one of the case. 
"12oz bottle, thanks to Rifugium and pdeepak for the bottle. Into a Southern Tier tulip."
This was a very good beerb that started me into realy trying many kinds of beers for the first time and it is bad that you are unable to get it when you want it. I use to be a normal bud light drinker but never again. I really enjoyed the smell with the taste. I would love for this to be more available. I have enjoyed many of Bells brewery beers.
"I've been wanting to try Hopslam for a while now and was excited to finally see quite a bit of it in KY this winter. With allof the hype surrounding it, I went ahead and picked up a case of it. After trying a few of them, I'm not disappointed that I stepped up to the plate right off the bat. So, here it goes on my initial reaction:"
"Bell's, a quality brewer with National appeal. Bottle and cases were in scarcity in Philadelphia most of them selling out in a day or two from most places that were only allocated a few cases to begin with. I myself did not purchase the brew, but acquired from a friend. "
2013 bottle less than 1 month old. 
Poured into a pint glass. 
"Poured strong from a bottle into an oversized wine glass, but little head. What was there made up of tiny beautiful bubbles with little streams supporting underneath. Nice opaque light copper color."
Horray I got to try this fresh. Pours a light orange color with a golden red hue through out. Crystal clear with a fizzy head. Limited retention.
12oz bottle served in a tulip
"This has to be one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Yes, I know it is a double IPA but I categorize all of them together. Had it as part of a sampler with several other beers and what I love most about this beer is that although you get a strong sense of hoppiness, the honey quickly dissipates any of the lingering bitterness that is usually left by such IPA's. A must have if you are ever at the brewery, try to save as much as possible. Currently aging an '11 and a '12 together. Looking forward to when I can try them next year!"
Pours a beautiful crystal clear golden honey color with a creamy off-white head. The lacing on the glass is thick and sticky almost like icing!
"Bottle to tulip. Golden orange, crystal clear, quarter inch of eggshell head that dissipates after a minute. Strong pine notes in this edition with some floral background, perhaps a tiny hint if citrus. Medium/heavy mouthfeel, syrupy pine hops hit the pallate hard upfront with a slight malt backbone. Bitterness comes in late and lingers a bit. Overall it lacks the citrus notes and balance of the 2012 vintage. Good, but in my opinion this year doesn't earn the high rating it has on the top 250."
Poured into my new belgium tulip.
"A: poured into a snifter and the color is a dark golden color with a very frothy creamy off white head with tight bubbles, it almost looks like the top of a root beer float, The lacing on the glass is so sticky and thick that i let it sit for a minute or two. I reached in with my finger and rubbed some off and it was almost like cotton candy on my finger..It appears to be sweet,sticky, nectar given to us only by the masters at Bells."
"What can be said? I'm an IPA guy, and this is my second favorite beer. Being seasonal, I'm shocked to find it, let alone a case of it. It drinks easy and hoppy at first, but finishes with a strong alcohol bite. Being a DIPA, I would expect nothing less. Took a vacation to Michigan just to hit the the triangle of breweries and Bell's was both my wife and my favorite. They do not disappoint."
Original Review: 2/2013
"It's a good DIPA. I felt it was a little sweet for my taste. I enjoy the more bitter bite from others. It has a nice grassy smell, a little citrus as well. It has a nice pour and a good looking head. It is full bodied with a nice smooth finish. I don't feel it's worth the $18. In general I would rather have a Fathead "
Hopslam once a great beer...now a bitter disappointment.
A: Golden color with about a 1/2 finger head when poured into a pint glass. Nice lacing down the glass and you drink the beers all the way from top to bottom.
"A: Pours nice gold color, with moderate head and little lacing."
"A: Golden Orange, Opaque"
Glass: Samuel Smith's Nonic Pint.
"Absolutely one of my favorite beers!! honestly can go good with anything, but you are better off enjoying this beer by itself. it has so much too offer, such great combination between the yeast and malt's making this an outstanding brew. you can put this on my list of top beers."
This was a 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.
"Poured a nice amber into a tulip glass, bubbles can be seen rising and a very slight off white head formed. The scent is of floral grassy hops, pine and grapefruit, with slight hints of honey and cat urine. The cat urine scent became more pronounced as the beer warmed but was almost pleasant in an odd way. The taste was excellent. Bitter pine begins each sip, going into more bitter pine mixed with grapefruit and ending on notes of bitter grapefruit pith. There is also a nice presence of malt, though it is overwhelmed somewhat by the hop profile, as well as nice hints of honey that are present throughout each sip. The mouthfeel is pleasant, with a slight carbonation, but not enough to dull the tongue to the hops or make drinking the beer difficult. There is also a slight stickiness but not as much as in some examples of the style. The mouthfeel aids the flavor of the beer and does not detract. Overall this is an excellent DIPA, by far one of the best, with an excellent hop flavor profile, well worthy of the title hop bomb. Yet it also is well balanced and avoids the pitfalls of being too hoppy. A beer to try and to enjoy."
"I am a fan of IPA's. This one is a DIPA which I have had a few but this one is really good. But from the beers I have had from Bell's this one is no exception. I love the 2 hearted ale and this one builds upon a similar paradigm, its just a bit more adventurous. When I drink Bells it makes me think of Hemingway and this one is no exception it should be like For Whom the Bell Tolls really, when you open it it smells of a pine forest, much like the novel. But it goes into a tropical citrus character. I was getting pine, but also grapefruit and pineapple from the aroma. The color was a nice golden ale typical of the color scheme for this style. The taste was much like the smell a good bit floral from the hops, but not bitter really. I know the label says that it is strong, but I felt it was really well balanced considering the amount of hops and IBU's in a DIPA. This is a great cooler weather beer, perfect for spring or fall, although it will not last that long. It was pricey but was worth it and just be careful the 10% will get you. Enjoy this one if you can find it!"
"What can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said. Everyone knows it is perfect, wish they made it more often. I paid $22 for a 6 pack but since it is 10% alcohol you can't really complain about the price. I am glad that we were able to find some in my small town. Has a great smell and a big taste, I can't really describe it other than hop heaven"

A: Excellent crystal clear orange color with a thin white film of a head.
Draft at Wine World. So excited!!!
"lucky enough to have found 2 bottles of this at my local brew store, one for me and one to share with my pops. hope it lives up to its billing?"
"No need for me to repeat everyone else's review in detail, just summarizing that yes, indeed, Hopslam is unbelievably good. Absolutely lives up to expectations in every aspect. Had to hold myself back not to drink all six at once, which would have been funny given its ABV (key takeaway is that you don't taste the alcohol)."
Just in general summed up this beer reminds me of Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty when he becomes god for 7 days. Bell's Hopslam is one of the most well rounded beers I have had in quite a while. Its very easy to sum up in word AMAZING!! for the everyday IPA drinker!
"Drank through my half-case so quickly that I nearly forgot to do a review, so here goes."
Poured from a 1/23/13 bottle into a ::gasp:: shaker pint.

"A - pours a cloudy yellow orange color, with more light yellow colors on the top and getting darker as it goes. maybe a fingers worth of white foam. tiny dots of lacing rest against the glass. "
Poured from a growler into a pint glass
"It pours a hazy amber with an off white head with excellent retention. The lacing is splendid. It holds for a second or two and then falls uniformly back into the brew. Very nice to watch. The aroma is very much filled with citrus and resinous pine, along with a floral sweetness and a detectable malty backbone. The taste transfers from orange to bitter grapefruit, but then the bitterness just about disappears to reveal malt with a nectar like sweetness. The finish comes back with a bitterness stronger than the introduction. The mouthfeel is excellent. Thick and rich with a delicate kiss of carbonation."
"Wow... Wow... Did Raul just get himself a diet Stone? Mild aroma, thin-ish textures on the tongue, and a taste about as inspiring as a Kardashian having a baby. Raul was stoked on getting hooked up on this through a trade, but for now he will be looking forward to Zombie Dust."
2/7/13 Bell’s Brewery | 2013 Hopslam | 12oz Bottle
"Can dated 01/16/18 into pint glass. Pours a bery attractive deep amber color with a substantial and persistent eggshell-white head. Initial impression is a very tasty citrus, nicely balanced by biscuit and light caramel malts, fading into a resinous pine-y bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel and carbonation are perfect. "
Poured from bottle into a standard 12 oz. beer-stein:
"12 oz. bottle from six pack purchased in the greater Washington D.C. area, poured into a 16 oz. pint glass, dated 1/15/13, drank 2/6-7/13 over several hours."
"Presentation: 12oz brown pop-top with awesome label and cap. Bottled 1/9/2013, so I'm having this at just under 4 weeks of age. Poured into my Founders snifter to celebrate being offered a job. Thanks to Russ G. for gifting me this bottle. Cheers!"
"Had a week old Fresh Slam, I gotta say the nose is gone. His brew used to fill the room, this years batch has no delivered that."
"I'd agree with a few other reviews that I have read off the top. This is a well balanced D/I IPA. Problem, every take on an American Double/Imperial IPA calls for a heavy Hop forward brew in smell, taste, and bitterness; none of which apply to this brew."
"I'm not usually a fan of IPAs but this was definitely an exception. I got this from peabody's fresh collection at only 5 days old!! The color was a nice clear golden/amber and the taste and smell were both very crisp. The extreme hops are refreshing and will ""hopslam you right in the teeth""."
"I don't get it...First year I've tried this phenom. Its a good beer, don't get me wrong, but for the hype I've heard, a real disappointment. solid offering from a top notch brewer, but not an event beer. Talked with several others tonight trying the same tap and got exactly the same response; ""Its good, but not as good as last years""."
Thanks for the trade beerborn!

Bottled on 1/23/13 very fresh
Appearance - Beautiful crystal clear copper. I poured it pretty conservatively so there wasn't a great deal of head. Nice lacing.
Big hoppy and malty. Heavy beer. Not very hop forward in the aroma. Sweet. Enjoyable still but not even close to the drinking enjoyment level of hundreds of IPAs being made these days.
12oz. bottle poured into a room-temp pint glass. The bottling date is 1/23/13.
"Had never heard of this beer until now. As I understand it is a limited brew, I will continue to order until it runs out. I have to be careful as the 10% ABV knocks me in the dirt pretty quick. With the aroma and taste, it goes down smooth with a pleasant linger on the pallate, which makes it very easy to have too many too quick. There is a nice hint of citrus. Just right."
"Hopslam FINALLY became available at my local beer emporium, so I forked over $14 (!) for a six pack. Did reality meet the hype?"
"Purchased from my local grocery store in a [expensive!] six-pack, Bell's Hopslam is an exciting seasonal tradition for West Side Michiganders like myself! "
"Pours a HUGE, dense head with resin all over; very persistent with thick lacing. Surprisingly soft aroma is floral and hoppy...but unexpectedly subdued. Hazy, golden-honey color. Starts almost tart with a lot of citrus hops. There is a very noticeable sweetness. I'm REALLY surprised noticeable the honey is. It builds to a medium hoppiness which becomes more of a citrus/pine bitterness in the finish. "
"i got one bottle of this, and split it with the wife. pours a nice golden. its clear with a white head. the smell is odd, organic and pungent. the flavor is very full, piney, but not as bitter like a lot of ipa's. its like they bottled all that bitter flavor but made it drinkable. the finish isnt harsh at all, you can really taste the honey at the back. im sad i couldnt get more of this, and im sad i gave half of it away. bells makes pretty good beer, but honestly this IS something special."
Bottle.
"On tap at Bell's. Pours exactly as you'd expect from a quality Imerial IPA, dark orange with a great at hoppy citrus smell. Taste is worldclass. Hits you with a hops out of the gate and remains on the tongue evenly throughout the entire mouthful. Extremely smooth and hides the Abv very well. The hoppy citrus taste does not linger too long which makes you want more. This is an extremely relaxing IPA that you just want to take your time with. Last note is that this may be the first beer I truly can say on tap is hands down better than the bottle. Not to say the bottle is bad, it's more of a comment on just the incredible freshness straight from the tap, and in this case straight from the brewery. This is the best IIPA I've had to date."

Been wanting to try this for a couple of years now. Still can't get a bottle but got a growler filled today! Time to see if it lives up to all the hype.
"A: Fairly transparent, with only the slightest haze preventing clear sight through the glass. The beer is a medium shade of gold, with a very thin white head. A few pecks of bubbles stick to the glass, but no real lacing."
"I was finally able to get my hands on some Hopslam, for the first time ever. I called almost a dozen local stores before I finally tracked it down at a sleazy supermarket/liquor store/discount cigarette place. Anyway, side poured from the bottle into my Boulevard pint glass."

"Have had this a few times in past years but never got around to reviewing this. Bad oversight, as this is a GREAT DIPA. Pours a cloudy orange with plenty of carbonation evident and a two-finger head that gradually gives way to a foamy coating. Lacing is perfect evidence of each sip. Nose is overwhelming citrus (especially orange, grapefruit and lemon), but hints of honey are there as promised. Taste: The one disagreement I would have with Stone is that his is NOT a ""biting, bitter, tongue buster,"" although elements of each descriptor are there. I find it actually much better balanced than that, the honey backbone probably doing the most to sorta' tame these very wonderful hops. Taste is at first dominated by the citrus but this is so beautifully balanced by the honey and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium, and aftertaste is a sweet bitterness that is not overly cloying. Certainly, there is enough bitterness and dryness to satisfy DIPA fans but this is a VERY refreshing and crisp end to a very special beer. Come on, can't SOMEONE do this ALL YEAR? I LOVE this beer!"
"I would have given this beer all 5's, but with a beer touting the name ""hopslam,"" I would expect it to be a little more bitter than it was. It did have a curiously sweet taste to it, and would definitely drink it again. Nice job Bell's."
"Since this was my first time tasting this beer, I tired to go into the first bottle with an open mind; ignoring the reviews I had read on BA."
Bottle dated 1/23. Consumed 1/30
I just had the 2013 release of Hopslam I was not overly impressed this year. Appearance and color where the same as other years but the aroma and taste were lacking compared to last year. I will still look for this on draft where I think it is much better. I must note that I did think the beer had a good flavor and my less than perfect review could be that my tastes are leaning more to hop forward beers and I would say I found this beer more balanced than I remember and not the Hopslam that I remember.
"For a beer that's called ""hopslam"", the bitterness was less than expected. Since it is brewed with honey, it is a fairly smooth pale ale taste. Smooth is a dangerous characteristic since its 10% ! Overall a very good beer, I'd like to try it on tap."
Bottle into Schlafly tulip
"Served on tap as a ""super premium"" at Papago Brewing Co in Scottsdale. Looks perfect, tastes perfect (the exact amount of honey sweetness to balance the hop bitterness), smells perfect. No bitter aftertaste and the 10% ABV is fast becoming the sweet spot for high alcohol ipa's that don't go too far overboard (I'm looking at you 120). Like April Fool's Day, July 4th Fireworks and hanging out with the guys on Labor Day for our fantasy football draft it is something I look forward to every year that rarely disappoints."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a nice opaque orange with a small white head, but nice lacing. Smell takes it away, lots and lots of citrus and piney hops, the smell just permeates the room from the time it is poured. Tastes of citrus and piney hops, and nice malt, but the honey taste helps to tie it all together and make it smooth. Beer has a bit of a fizzy feel, but for a beer with 10% ABV, goes down really smooth and is quite sessionable (and dangerous because of the high ABV). Overall, an excellent beer."
The initial smell of this beer was amazing! This is my first time tasting this beer so this should be quite the experience. Just the bottle artwork alone made the anticipation hard to bare. 
A - Beautiful golden copper with nice carbonation and white head
"Maybe it was the hype surrounding this beer, but I was overly underwhelmed with this the first time. Being bottled on 1/23/2013 and only 6 days old."
"From a bottle ($9) at Holman & Finch, Atlanta, into a snifter, bottled on 1/15/2013:"
"On tap at 3 Squares in Maple Grove in MN. Pours amber colored with 1 inch head. Nice retained lacing. Smells of sweet malt and fresh, but not sharp, hops. "
"A nice brew, but not the best of the best even though I had to go behind the counter at total wine to find one. Biggest weakness is the taste doesn't follow the nose because it is a bit too sweet and dumbed down by something, either the honey or the malts or both. Not as ""biting"" as advertised, does not live up to the hype surrounding it, but still tasty and drinkable."
"Love love love BEll's Hopslam Ale! To me, the combination of the honey with the hoppiness creates a perfect balance in the taste. It is smoother than Two-Hearted, for example, and the overall richness of the flavors makes this a top-tier brew for me. The look is a nice golden hue with hints of amber (again, balance is evident). The smell is not enticing to me, the feel and, again, taste more than make up for that. I love this beer; you should,too."
"Love the IPA, my favorite. I let this chill in my freezer because i was in a hurry to try it. Cooled it to 46F. (Get a laser temp device, they're cheap and accurate). First impression on tasting was the hops, of course. The citrus and carmel sweet came after, but the hops didn't let go. I was impressed by the 20 proof factor, but wondering about how much taste that would hide. Actually, the crafting of this brew made the alc content undetectable. Yep, this one will sneak up on you. I compare this with other IPA brews that have the same flavor but with half of the kick. The head seems to go kinda quick, but with a flavor like this one, I'm good with that. Be careful with this one, young man."
"bottled 1/9/13, poured into a pint from a 12oz bottle"
"Perfect beer to me, one of only two IMHO. 1/4 bbl Slim kegged on 1/27/2012, tapped today 1/28/2013 at my house - cannot get much fresher than that. Beautiful nose, pine forest and grapefruit rinds. Significant carbonation pops the scent of hops into the room, but settles quick clinging to the glass. Complicated mouthfeel, I know it is really bitter, I can feel it at the back of my tongue near the throat where it says grapefruit/lemon but the rest of my mouth says sweet honey and more subtle fruits like peach or that weird fruit pomelo. The final taste is bitter, but not particularly dry (because I am salivating for the next sip?). This is 10%ABV? Hides it very very well under that soft bitter bubbly."
Overall one of the best DIPA out there get all you can while the supply lasts. I had my last one in early January a year after i got it. still good. Now I have about 4 cases to ponder over the next year. unless someone wants a bottle or two. A must seek out or travel to get some.
"Pours cloudy orange with one finger white head. Head dissipates to thin cap leaving nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of peaches, honey and orange blossoms. Flavor is sweet and citrusy with bitter finish. Medium body with light carbonation. Perfect balance of rich malt and bitter hops. A very refreshing easy to drink DIPA."
"Bottle dated 1/10/13. Light tan head, creamy, sticky lacing, and good retention. Aroma is - bitterness, snweetness, big grapefruit, mango, and pineapple, pine, honey, citrus, caramel malts, and hints of bready malts. Just an assault of hops and sweetness on the mouth. Tropical fruits, pine, citrus, mixed with honey and and light caramel and bready malts. Wondeful. Medium-heavy body, creamy consistency, medium carbonation, and a somewhat crisp finish."
Thanks to Shelby at Chuck's in Bowling Green for saving me a sixer when there were only 3 left!

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. Acquired in a trade as an extra from jmich24, thanks bud! Bottled 1/3/13."
"Pours a hazy copper color with fluffy, off-white head. Not much lacing. Can definitely smell the sweetness from the honey but the smell of piney and citrusy hops quickly takes over. The hop presence in the taste is huge and hits you right away with pine and citrus. The high abv is hidden well by a subtle sweetness that I would guess comes from the honey. the mouthfeel is sweet, sticky and thick. "
Appearance: A beautifully clear golden orange color. Some delightful carbonation bubbled throughout. About a finger worth of head on the pour. Lacing left with each drink which made an awesome cascade down the glass. 
Re Review 2014 batch
"EDIT: Updated for the 2013 batch. The bottle is about 10 days old, courtesy of pokgye. Thanks, Jason. "
Looks a copper color with a smooth even head and excellent lacing across the glass top. Smells of a strong hoppy pine and citrus. Tastes sweet but strong hoppy bite. Medium bodied and smooth. Overall this is an outstanding double IPA that hides its alcohol level very well. Be careful drinking this delicious beer.
"This has got to be one of the most powerful beers that I have ever tasted. I tried a Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale (which is a beer that I enjoy) afterwards to compare and Hopslam made SI Celebration Ale seem/taste like a run of the mill Brown Ale. Hopslam is an amazing beer all the way around. The flavors are full and robust to say the least. I hope to drink some more this weekend at the Beer Dabbler in St. Paul, MN."

Poured from 12oz bottle
Incredibly fresh. Credit to Bell's. 8 day old beer. Poured into Bell's tulip glass. Nice bright white one finger head. Lightly orange color. You can smell the hops immediately. Light citrus scents hit your nose then your palate prior to a light bitterness. Almost a sweet bitterness. You really get the carbonation and fresh hop flavor in the mouthfeel. You get a slight smell of the alcohol but it certainly doesn't taste if 10%. Be careful. It is just that good.

12 oz. bottle poured into a Founders snifter. Bottled on 1/2/13. 
"This beer is absolutely fantastic! Got lucky and someone was able to pick up a 6 pack for me before it sold out. Clear gold with a slight amber tinge. Thick head that looks like a soft fluffy cloud. Leaves solid consistent lacing. The smell is a sweet, fruity, and fresh. The taste is a light citrus, melon fruitiness to mid palate bitterness to sweet honey on the back of the palate. The finish is crisp with a sublte lingering bitterness that is pleasant. This is really well balanced, and 10%??? I couldn't tell."

"I just tried this beer out of the bottle and really enjoyed it. The name says it all. A hoppy beer with attitude. Even though you can strongly taste the hops, I can't believe that is has an ABV of 10%. A great tasting beer that I would love to try on tap."
A - Pours amber with a thing white head that disappears quickly. Leaves spotty lacing.
Date on bottle 01/03/13.
"beautiful looking beer, poured aggressive, got a massive head that dissipated down to a 3 and 1/2 finger. beautiful orange, golden where light shines through. This beautiful beer smells honestly like a fruit cocktail cup. Fruity and delicious. first flavor is wildflower honey, apricot, peach, sweet orange, little bit of alcohol in the flavor, finishes with grapefruit in the back of my throat. very delicious."
"This beer is very dear to me. I first had it last year, in both draft and bottle format, in that order. As I recall, at first I liked Hopslam on draft more than I liked it in the bottle. I was actually put-off somewhat by the super fresh bottle I had, just after I had it on draft. After a few weeks, my case obviously depleted but over time, the bottled beer really changed quite a bit, read, it got better after a few weeks. At the time I was aware of the freshness concern with Hopslam, but for me it tasted better after lets say, 2-5 weeks, and after that I ADORED it, could not get enough of it, and then it was gone. Fast forward about 11 months. Received word that Bell's had bottled Hopslam on 01/02/13, and pretty randomly decided to drive about 8 hours to Kalamazoo to buy some for me and my friends, mostly because we did not want to wait the three or so weeks for it reach out area, A, and B, we were/are not sure how much we will actually be able to purchase here. So I went to Bell's and got plenty for me and my friends, a case a piece. Anyway, this review will at some points refer to my recent experience at the Eccentric Cafe, but for scoring purposes, relies solely on the experience I am having right now with a 9-day old bottle of Hopslam. At the Cafe, over a period of two days, I probably had 5 12-16oz. pours of delicious Hopslam. It appeared hazy/foggy, and tasted and smelled unfuckingbelievable. "
"Pours dark gold with a small head and a moderate amount of lace. A small cream colored ring remains around the top of the beer. Good clarity. Lovely aroma; pungent hoppiness; resinous, slightly oniony; some citrus and pine qualities."
"A-Clear yellow orange, not much carbonation, two finger head that leave behind some lacing."
"Had this on tap at a Bell's event in Lansing, MI at Crunchy's 1/9/13 and had bottles of it 1/8/13, so I don't think there could be a fresher review of it compared to other years I've had it."

"I really like this beer and in general it fall into my, I can't wait for this one to be released category every year. Very hop forward aromas and heavy sweet mouth-feel. No doubt the use of honey help boost the alcohol by volume to it's advertised and impressive 10%. As usual another great beer from Bell's!"
A: lit golden color with a lingering head and visible carbonation. Solid legs

"Amber with a decent white head, didn’t last long. strong grapefruit and thick hop aroma. Flavor is strong piny hops, grapefruit, coconut, pineapple...more hops. Finishes thick, decent burn from the abv. Very good fresh and I'm glad this is a yearly release. Wouldn't want to see this on the shelves year round."
"Had on tap at Bell's Brewery in Kalamazoo, MI, also many times out of the bottle. Pours a golden, light-amber with a moderate amount of haze to it, micro particles sift through the brew upon which a two-finger, creamy, light beige head rests and leaves nice amounts of fuzz on the glass. The aroma of this beer hits your nose mid-pour. Up close, things begin to get magical. Humongous citrus aromas; grapefruit, pineapples, tangerines, lemon zest - a wild, sweet, fruity explosion crowds your nostrils. Mild resinous, pine, and hop aromas make their way in as well - after all, this is HOPslam. The nose is absolutely brilliant and does nothing but get you excited to finally bring this one to your lips."
12 oz bottle poured into a snifter and a wine glass. Bottled a mere eleven days ago.
"Poured this Imperial IPA from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a amber color, produced a nice foamy cream colored head, nice retention and off the charts lacing left on the glass. This ale featured an aroma of floral/citric hops, clover honey and malted grain. Medium in body, this IIPA starts off a bit thin/light, and then packs a punch! Sweet malted grain, honey, and an explosion of citric hops. Hop filled finish, strong taste of alcohol. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel- One of the most drinkable IIPA's i have ever had. You could actually have a few of these in one session. Shot out to my boy the St. Charles Whisker Biscuit for bringing me a bottle of this beautiful libation.. I have been Hopslammed! Prost!"
"355 mL. Pours a translucent light orange with a fluffy, off-white head that settles down. Not too much lacing. Aromas of wet hops, some tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange peel, white sugar. Taste is beautifully smooth and not too heavy with lots of grapefruit, citrus hops, orange blossom honey, and some butter. Rich and slightly oily on the palate but finishes clean with a quick spicy and acidic bite akin to ginger. Very easy to enjoy. Overall very well balanced for the amount of hops dumped into the vats. 10% abv is masterfully hidden. Awesome. 1/27/2009 9/4/9/4/16=4.2"
A - Hazy orange tangerine body. Pure white head with nice lace and retention.
"A: Hazy yellow pour with a few fingers of white head. The lacing sticks to the glass, and the retention is fine."
"Honestly, I don't know what I like more about this beer, the taste or the aroma. There is something about the bitter hoppy scent that I wish I could capture in a candle."
Hazy golden nectar and thin head. 
"A: beautiful, golden color"
"Finally, I get to do a full written review of this incredible brew. Pours a nice honey color, with an inch foam head, beautiful lacing. The scent is wonderful, well balanced citrus, hops, and honey. The taste is, oh my, incredible. This is definitely one of my top beers, for sure. It hits hard, but is perfectly balanced in such a way as to not reveal much alcohol taste at all. Honey, hops, and citrus dominate the taste in a wonderful array on the tongue that is neither too biting nor too quick to leave, it unfolds on the palate revealing the complexity of the hops. If you can find this, don't hesitate to pick some up."
"On tap at the Eccentric Cafe, served in a snifter."
"Every year I wait for this to come out and whenever it is gone, I am very sad - and eagerly awaiting its return! This year I was able to get a case, but last year we got the mini kegs too. This is my favorite American DIPA, period."
"Out of bottle, poured into a pint."
had this on-tap at the Eccetric Cafe at the Bell's Brewery in Kalamazoo MI. I didn't realize it was available this late in the year. 
"Bottle date of 1/25/12, so nearly 5 months on this one. Poured into pint glass."
"Appearance: Wow, this is a gorgeous beer. The color is a deep, rich gold, almost approaching an amber/copper color that is reasonably cloudy. The cream-colored, three finger thick rocky pillow of head that crowns this beer is the icing on the cake; though it does eventually subside into a much more manageable one finger, the foam takes its sweet time crawling down the glass and leaves a bit of lacing in its wake. This beer also sports some alcohol legs, though they are not very obvious, which is surprising at a massive 10% ABV."
12oz bottle poured into CCB snifter. Bottled 12/29/11
Bottled on 12/29/12
"Got this at IP trade, but the bottled on date is December 2011. I've decided to post my initial reactions and then revisit this review when I'm able to get this fresh. (Because it was old, but still pretty damn great) "
"was expecting more hops than sweet honey in this one , but still one to drink again when i get a chance, lets say that i wanted more from this beer. like more bitter finsh considering the name.it kind of reminding me a little like lucky 13.alt from laguntias"
A- Golden transparent body with a thin bone white head.
"Aroma is slightly grassy and floral with hints of honey coming through. Pours a nice light orange color and white head. Taste is pretty amazing, I'm not typically a grassy hop person, but the balance of hops they used, the floral notes went really well with the honey and sweet caramel malt bill on this one. Fairly bitter but expected and I really think they nailed the malts on this one to give it a complexity you don't get much with some DIPAs, mouthfeel is a little less drinkable as it's got a good amount of body to this beer. Great beer overall."
IPA and balance.
"Nose of pine and resin, slightly floral with a sticky sweetness backing it up. Tastes of heavy hitting pine hops up front backed up by orange-lemon citrus bitterness all balanced by a honey sweetness. You get a nice warm tingle deep down inside from the alcohol, but none of the boozey heat in the taste. This lives up to all the hype I've heard. Fan-freakin-tastic."
"Low and fading head, moderate lacing, scent of hops present, with a strong organic chemistry lab/pine campground presence, not really strong citrus to dominate. Color is a rich, slightly fogging copper orange typical for the style. Tastes fruity, malty, slightly sweet with strong, sustained hop echo, but nicely counterbalanced by all the flavors. Some presence of alcohol evident, but not really prominent...a bit more drinkable (going faster) than other DIPA's. Mouthfeel is substantial, with moderate to heavy, active carbonation. Another delicious one from Bell's and recommended again."
12oz bottle served in a snifter.
"Comes out of the tap a pretty clear, dark amber with a fine-bubbled off-white head. Aroma is monumentally hoppy, promising a serious IPA. Flavor is hoppy in the extreme, making this beer taste like a liquid pine tree. There is just a hint of honey sweetness that nicely offsets the firm but not fierce bitterness. Texture is rough and tingly, leaving behind a strong fizz. Recommended to all hop-heads."
A: pours a light orange to deep yellow. nice shade of gold with an ample white head with decent retention
Once again poured from bottle into pint glass after work. Bottled 6 months prior.

On tap at Bell's Kalamazoo Eccentric Cafe:
12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. 
Received an extra in a trade. Unfortunately though this was bottled on 12/29/11. Poured into a Duvel tulip.
On tap served in conical pint glass on 4/30/12 Also had bottled on 4/20/12
A- Slightly hazy golden orange with an egg shell white head. After a little while the head becomes patchy with moderate amounts of lacing on the glass.
"A cloudy, deep golden colour, Hopslam looks like honey. It has little carbonation and can appear almost sludgy depending on the angle. No head ever forms. The highlighting is dulled too, despite that it is light enough to allow moderate transparency. "
"This beer goes off the shelves fast. There's like a Hopslam cult or something. 6 packs sell in DC for $24-$30. I got a case of it passing through Donora Pa for $58. That was after calling at least 100 places to see if it was in stock. I first tried it when I bought 2 bottles of it on Ebay for $30+$10 shipping. Crazy. Great beer tho! Def one of my favs! A very comparable beer is Hoptimum, by Sierra Nevada. This is the 2nd year for it and it's starting to sell like Hopslam. Hoppy beer is addicting!"
Poured from a 12 oz bottle | 
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into an SA glass. Freshness, or born on date listed on bottle. Pure golden amber with one finger head that receded into nice cap. Full lacing down the sides. Smells like a freshly harvested bale of hay from a flowery field. A mouthful of grass and resin is the first hint that fades into pepper. The taste is wonderful! Medium-bodied with medium carbonation, just a hint of alcohol which is not bad for a 10% abv beer. Searched far and high before I finally found this beer offered. It met all my expectations! Truly one of the best beers I've ever had! RB!"
This is by far one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Awesome
"Bottle dated 1/10/12 poured into a duvel tulip. Pours a clear dark orange with a 2 finger white head that shrinks to cover the top. nice lacing. Aroma is pine, mango, pineapple, apricot, and more tropical fruit. Flavor is pine resin, grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, mango, and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium and somewhat sticky. Alcohol is invisible. Amazing beer."
A: bright golden straw with a finger thick white head.
"IMO. There really isn't too much to say about this brew than as follows. This is the best IPA that has ever touched my mouth. You folks that are stating that it doesn't live up to it's ""hype"", obviously like an IPA that is way different than my likeing. All is good though, it has everything that a good beer has to offer. WELL DONE Bells. You guys hit this one right on the head while crafting this masterpiece. It's making my mouth water thinking about it."
"Pours a copper color with a rather creamy looking white head, carbonation is evident. Very slightly opaque as far as clarity goes. Head is retained until the end. Smells almost as hoppy as the name implies; more earthy and spicy notes than floral. Malt aroma is almost undetectable, but overall a rather appealing smell. Flavor is very hop forward as expected, almost too overwhelming on the tongue to pick apart. Finish starts with pronounced bitterness, followed by a not unflattering pine resin(y) taste accompanied by an almost barlywine-like malt flavor with a bit of alcohol in the nose. Lacks balance in my opinion. For a beer that looked rather over carbonated after pouring, I have to say the mouth feel was great. Good viscosity, and definitely not over-carbonated. I realize with a name like hop slam, that some intense hoppyness should be expected. But more goes into a great beer than a ridiculous amount of hops. I've had quite a few IPA's that did a much better job of showcasing the hops used. Anyway, hop slam is alright, nothing great though."
Sampled at local tap bar.
"Poured into a snifter from the bottle, the beer was a beautiful golden color. It gave nearly an inch of head which quickly dissolved into beer. Immediately, the aroma is noted as a hoppy pine scent that melts into a certain sweet scent. The balance between the sweetness and the hops in this beer is remarkable. Initially sweet with the honey making its presence known, the punch of the hops knocks that flavor out of the way. Even long after the swallow, the hops linger on the roof of the mouth. A strong pineapple and a hint of peach are evident in the hops, but the pine flavor is most noticeable. Not a lot of carbonation is present which helps the taste to linger. The aftertaste is dominated by the warming sensation of the alcohol. This is not to suggest that the aftertaste is without flavor. The pine continues in the aftertaste with a certain hint of sweetness. "
"I was excited to find this on the shelves while I was visiting Minnesota, but though it is a tremendous DIPA, I'm not sure it's quite worth the hoopla. (Though I would still recommend tracking it down and trying it, if you can!)"
You had this beer. 
"I had been waiting to try this beer for a very loooong time... Unable to get it in Virginia, because of the speed with which the few cases that did show up here, sold out. A friend left me one on the porch Tuesday whilst I was feeling a bit ""under the weather"". I cracked it open that night with dinner, and all I have to say is ""WOW!"", it was well worth the wait and the hype. If you are a true hophead, then you must get your hands on this."
12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 
"Aroma: Bold fruit and American hops. Bittersweet grapefruit and just a little pine. Very resinous. Some clean pale malt in the background. You can smell the hops with your nose about 12"" above the glass."
Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a light orange with about a finger of white head. Aroma of citrus and honey. Taste is about the same. Medium bodied with a somewhat sticky texture. Lively carbonation and a long finish. Overall, pretty good. I would gladly drink again in the future."
"Received in a trade, Thanks Chris!"
A: Darker than bottled; no lacing and the head was merely a sheet of bubbles. This is of course normal for casked beer if I understand correctly.
Reviewed from notes. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Russian River pint glass. This bottle is only eight days old!
Bottled 1/9/13 poured into GI tulip
"A: Pours a bright gold, a little darker and bolder than a mead."
Served in a pint glass at Mellow Mushroom in Charlottesville. From notes. Reviewed 9 July 2011.
"Was grateful to have had this beer. The hops are beautiful in the aroma and in the taste. What's even better is how the hop profile changes as you drink this. The front is of great hops; grapefruit and pine. The hops quickly fades and becomes quite mellow on the finish. The honey comes through after, but its not as prevalent as I hoped."
Wow.... This has got to be one of my favorite DIPAs. Thank you Rogee for a bottle! 
A-pours a pale golden yellow with a generous amount of foam that lingers
"Had my first Hopslam on tap at a BW3's in Troy, OH and fell in love. Have had a case purchased and delivered to me each year after since I can't get it easily in VA. Pours a beautiful orange/gold color with a bit of a haze and a nice fluffy head. Smells wonderful if you're a hop-head. The taste of this stuff really puts it on top of my list of favorites. Taste is super hoppy and citrusy and then the honey sweetness settles into the after-taste. But, remarkably smooth for a big beer. Mouthfeel has a nice cling and coat type feel on the inside of the mouth so the flavor lingers. Easily my favorite DIPA/Imperial IPA and quite possibly my favorite beer."
"This is a great beer! Hopped to the MAX. It was recommended to me by one of my beer loving customers who knows I love hoppy, high ABV brews. It is a bit on the pricey side but I have to admit, it is worth it. In fact I recently bought a hoppy homebrew kit to replace my purchase of this fine brew since the local store is now out of stock."
"Purchased a six pack of this beer a few weeks ago and drank four since. Really really nice and smooth. I was surprised that this beer was 10% ABV. Really enjoyed this beer. Citrusy, big, big! HOPS!! Pours a nice golden copper. A had one ice cold, one slightly chilled, and one at room temp. I think this beer is best with a slight chill. Too cold and you lose some of the smooth flavors in this beer. If you can find some, grab a few and enjoy!!!"
Bottle into Duvel tulip. Acquired via trade. 
"Nicely done dipa from bells, really only case each year I travel El to make sure I can get 2 cases....poured from 12oz into 32oz Steelers frozen glass mug, little finger of head and decent lacing. Looks like honey but bubbles like beer! "

"Exactly what I expect from a true IPA, hops, pine, bitterness! Wishing all these IPA wanna be craft brewers could taste a few done right. Next to Cigar City's Jai Alai this is an excellent brew."
"I picked up a 6pk of the infamous Hopslam at Woodman’s in Beloit, WI in early 2011 for $14.99."
The acclaimed Hopslam has arrived and me more then welcoming the end of the Hopslam season I've finally gotten my first taste!
This beer pours a light golden orange with quarter inch of head that hangs around for a minute or two.
12oz bottle poured into tulip.
Absolutely amazing beer! Can't say enough. Now I know why every time I walk into a bar they make it a point to tell me they have Hopslam in bottles. Heard it went out in Kickbacks Gastropub in less than a day! On the top of my favorites list right behind Sweetwater IPA!
"Truly a world-class beer. For 70 IBU, 10% abv, is this exceptionally drinkable. Scrap that- for any beer, this is exceptionally drinkable- assuming that you are an IPA fan. Resinous, chewy (did I really just say that?), bitter but not too bitter, malty but not too malty- Bells got it right once again. The biggest selling point here is not that the flavor is exceptional but, rather, that such a big beer can be so easy to drink. Pair it with a glass while dinner is cooking; this one is great on its own."
IF YOU LIKE HOPPY BEERS THIS IS A REALLY AWESOME SMELLING BEER! THE NAME SPEAKS FOR IT SELF IT IS EXTREMLY HOPPY AND IT PACKS A PUNCH MEANING IT DOES NOT TAKE MUCH TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THE BEER. I JUST LOVE IT CAN NOT GET ENOUGH. ONE OF THE BEST BEERS I EVER HAD.
EDIT:
"poured a hazy orange/yellow with a very small amount of head. smells very sweet like candy but with a hint of bitterness rising from the hops. taste is bitter, but sweet enough to balance it out (until the bitterness of the aftertaste kicks in!). definitely taste the sweetness from the honey, a fruity banana taste to it as well. a bit heavy on mouthfeel - a little too rich and creamy for the weather right now (70 and sunny outside), bitter but smooth going down. this is a great iipa, of course it's way hyped by beer geeks which makes me a bit turned off, but after giving it a try, it was a great beer. i wouldn't call it the best for its style, it could use a bit of work on the appearance and the smell (not too many different things going on there and not a great deal of hop aromas either)"

"This was a really, really good beer and I and really like IPAs so I may tend to rate this style a little higher than most. One of my top beers on this site though is Central Waters Double IPA so I made sure to have a Hopslam and a CW DIPA back to back to make sure I could compare to the Hopslam to the ""gold standard"" (for me at least) of IPAs."
"Here goes nothing, as I'm sure everyone has already got enough info on this brew - "
12oz bottle pkgd 1/10/12
"Contrary to other reviewers, I think this beer does live up to it's hype. Poured from a can into a pint glass. The aroma hits you as it's being poured. Sweet hoppy goodness. Floral, maybe minty, slight pine. Dark golden in color with nice two finger head and nice lacing. Taste is incredible. Slightly sweet hops and even with my dying taste buds I can taste the honey and it is perfect. The bitterness lingers and is just right. Mouthfeel is perfect. Smooth slightly oily with perfect carbonation. Certainly not a hop bomb but an absolute must try for all hop heads. Way too easy drinking for 10%, Hopefully I'll be able to score some more next January. "
I had this beer on tap and I don't know what else to say other than I think that this is one of the best IPA's ever made. I reviewed this as a bottle but honestly that didn't prepare me for how much better it was on tap.
"The beer poured a slightly hazy medium gold and produced a one finger high bubbly white head. It dissipates fast, but leaves good lacing."

Served on tap into snifter. Waited a long time for this one.
Reviewing from notes:
"I am not typically a huge hops fan, but I am trying to gain exposure to a number of different hoppy beers to find one that is for me. Hopslam was definitely enjoyable: The initial gut punch was enjoyable and I could definitely taste the honey. By the end of the bottle, my mouth was just too tired, though. Maybe I just wasn't ready for it yet, I'll try another one in a few months!"

Poured from a bottle into my DFH signature glass.
I paid $8 for a 7 ounce snifter. And then I bought two more. That is kind of unheard of. But this is pretty much the best I've had. Amazing citrus beginning combined with the perfect combo of Hops and Malt. My favorite bar is out of it and I'm disappointed I'll need to wait until next year.
"12 oz bottle into a wine glass, bottle date 1/26/12. Thanks jegross2 for the bottle!"
"Pours a clear honey gold with little head. Pretty typical for a Triple IPA. Very Grassy, piney hops. Sweet honey kissed biscuit with an alcohol tinge at the end. Very dank. Hop resin sums up this beer in two words. That's nearly all you need to know. Sweet, chewy white bread malt turns bitter grassy, then very alcoholic bitter aftertaste. Lingers very plasticky, band-aidy in the mouth. On the syrupy side, very dry finish."
"For me, Stone's Ruination had been the creme de la creme for a long damn time. It was my go to sixer when I needed something that was a notch above the competition in the DIPA category. "
"Pours a golden honey with a subtle haze that clears with some warmth. Finger of white head comes with a vigorous pour. Decent, spotty lacing. Typical west coast IIPA on the nose - big on the citrus and mango, backed up with some pine and subtle malt support, more boozy than some. Leans more towards fruit on the tongue with less herbal/pine hop presence. Fades off into some soft booze notes, and a tiny sting on the back of the palate at the very end. Mouthfeel is as expected - medium everything. Appropriate for the style. Overall it’s a good double IPA. I wouldn’t say it’s worth the hype and the price but it’s good. EDIT: Just got a sixer with a 2/10 bottle date - a month fresher than the batch I reviewed initially. Much more interesting. The honey is a bit sweeter and better incorporated. I’ll adjust my numbers somewhat, but not too much because I don’t feel that any beer should suffer that much from 4 extra weeks in the bottle. I’d probably seek this out year after year if I was guaranteed the fresh stuff."
Huge Thanks goes out to thecheapies for providing this fine beer. Thanks Mike!
"Thanks goes to C2H5 for this. Bottled on 1/26/12, consumed 2/29/12. "
Served in a 10 oz chalice glass
A: A gold color with a slight chill haze and a thick off-white head that laces the glass.
"Pours a bright orange into my Bruery snifter. A finger of creamy white head. Smells delicious - citrus, honey, light pine and other fruity sweetness. Taste to match the smell. Much less bitter than I expected, with a creamy mouthfeel that must be attributed to the honey. A delicious, deceiving DIPA...easily one of the smoothest-drinking beers in its style. Thank Buddha I have a few more in the fridge, courtesy of some buddies back east."
A-Has a very thin head that dissipates rapidly with audible carbonation. Then leaves it looking a little bit flat. On the plus side there is some nice lacing. 
A: Pours a very nice copperish orange body with a thin white head that quickly fades.
"Bottle dated 1-26-12, part of a sixer."
Thanks to coppcw08 for sending this in trade. One of my bucket list beers just got crossed off...
"I hesitated in purchasing a 6 pack due to the $18 price tag. Then one day was lucky enough to find in on tap at the Gahanna, OH Old Bag of Nails Pub. It exceeded my expectations. While not quite on the level of Pliny the Elder, as a hophead I found it very good. So much so that I shelled out the $18the very next day"
A - Golden clear body with orange hues. Moderately small white head with good lacing. Head recedes quickly and sticks to edges of glass.
Bottled on 2-9-12. Poured into a tulip glass.
"Pours a clear golden copper with a caramel ice cream head. Prevalent grapefruit nose that alternates to a malty aroma as the head fades. There is little head retention. Some lacing on the glass. The beer involves the entire palate from the beginning. A nice, smooth, malty, grapefruit and pine on the front of the tongue, with a simultaneous pleasing floral scrubbing on the back. This jubilee fades into a pine finish that ultimately yields to a pleasant and surprising citrus perfume, which flavors the alcohol warmth that escapes into the nasal passage. Why isn't this the number one DIPA in the world??"
Served in CCB snifter
"Brewed with honey (for a little sweetness) and hoppy as hell (for a lot of bitterness). I saw that in the description of this beer. Another description on the bottle is ""a biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale"". All that is true and says it about as well as I can. The appearance is a true honey color and laces very nicely in the glass. I'm not sure but I think this brew is filtered and I think if it was unfiltered I'd score it a 5 in appearance and it woudl also boost the taste score as well. The hopslam is a giant of goodness! I'm docking it a little on taste because we can't rate drinkability anymore. This is not a real drinkable beer."
"Tasted side by side with Heady Topper...yeah, my life is hard."
Poured from a 12oz bottle into an Over sized wine glass. 
Big thanks to michibrew for this one. 12 oz. bottle dated 2/1/12 poured into pint glass.
"Beautiful amber colored beer. Being such a Founders man, this beer is very similar to a Double Trouble, but with a hint of sweetness probably from the honey this is brewed with."
"Smooth - the honey takes the edge off the hops. Effervescent, but with small bubbles - not overly carbonated. Really delicious double IPA - one of the best I've had. Expensive for a weekly beer, but is a really excellent treat. Interested to try cellaring a couple to see how they age."

"I can only say AWESOME first time taste. Beautiful copper color yet cloudy. Not much head but what was there lingered a bit lacey. I bought a 6 pack and will cherish the other five, bottled on 02/09/2012, just wish it was a bit less expensive. I couldnt really smell the honey but did pick up a bit of sweetness on the taste after it lingered on the tongue. Cant wait to drink the rest."

1. Damn.
"Batch number 10914. Bottled 1/26/12. Grapefruit, grass and pine dominate but it's the sweet backbone that sets this apart. It's beauty is that it can be so satisfying in bitterness but shows just the perfect amount of molasses/malty sweetness that it justs tastes amazing. Great making of 10% abv. How could you not look forward to its release every year. Earns its reputation each and every time."
Poured from 12 oz bottle into CBS snifter.
"A: Poured a half finger head that settled rather quickly. Beer is a bright molten copper color, "
Pours a deceptive gold with a hint of amber; moderate to low head. 
Had two bottles poured into a pint glass
Pours a slightly hazy burnt orange color with a one finger head which gives way to skim. A moderate amount of lace is present on the glass. The aroma is of piney and floral hops with the citrus hops coming over the top and dominating. The taste starts out with a piney and floral hop taste over a sweet malt backbone. The citrus hops come in and steal the show with a slight honey presence at the end. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a very solid dipa. The flavors are well blended.
"Bought a 12 FL OZ (355 ML) bottle of this from Lukas Liquor in Ellisville, MO for $3.99. Poured from the (almost) Key Lime Green labeled bottle w/ giant hops that apparently killed a man into my 0.3L La Fin Du Monde Tulip Glass. Has 10927 PKGD, 02/02/12 A (bottle on date). Fresh!"
A - Rich orange color with a perfect head
Bottled on 12/29/11
"Tasted side by side with Heady Topper.Color is an amazing deep sunset orange, absolutely beautiful looking beer. The nose is mind blowing, smells like a walk through a honey coated orange grove, amazing citrus/ honey nose, incredible. The taste is what is blowing me away, huge tangerine,mango,pineapple,and grapefruit all gently kissed with just a hint of honey, omg I love the taste of this brew. The mouth feel is perfect, bright carbonation that leaves the pallet bone dry and refreshed. The fact that this is 10% abv is a testament to the brewer,this is so balanced and refreshing it's scary. Please start distributing in So Cal guys....please ?"

"Pored in Boulevard Tulip Glass, bottled 2/2/12"
"When I had this last year, I regarded it as the best beer I'd ever tasted. But I've had a lot of good beers in the interum, so I'm tempted to see how this holds up. OOH, the excitement!"
"Appearance is a golden orange with a bright, white head."
Appearance: No head when poured into a very clean glass. Golden in color with light lacing left behind. Smell/ 
Found at Discount Liquor Waukesha with a bottle date of 2/9/12 (5 days old @
A: Pours a hazy amber color with minimal lacing around the outside edge of the glass. Translucent enough to see bubbles rising up from the bottom and coming to a rest at a small patch of bubbles in the middle of the brew.
"On tap at Sava’s in Ann Arbor. Served in pint glass. Aroma has traces of both the sweet honey and the in-your-face pine citrus hops. Elements of grapefruit and a hint of cat pee (citra?). Clear amber color, with a small head. Looks like candy. Beautiful golden orange pour and perfectly clear. Big head and punches you with the aroma as it pours (have also had bottled). Taste follows the aroma perfectly. Grapefruit, pine, zesty citrus, and some sweet honey. Nice bitterness up front with a punch of hops going down as well. Lingering honey citrus pine on the palate. Very drinkable, despite the 10% alcohol. Light to medium body with medium carbonation. A must try for anyone who fancies themselves a hop head. I look for this one every winter. Wish it were year round. Out of the bottle this is excellent, but on draft this thing hits a whole new level. I find a bit more of the mellow honey sweetness on draft and more floral aromatics--but excellent both ways."

Hopslam
Had a fresh pour of this at Tilia in Linden Hills.
This is most likely my favorite beer. I have a case and have had it on tap 3 separate times this year so I think my review is well rounded. 
"On-tap at the Oasis Micro-pub in Rockford, IL."
"Pours a hazy golden amber with a slowly fading white head that leaves stripes of lacing all down the glass. Smell is absolutely jam packed with citrus hops, complemented by a floral aroma. The taste comes through with an absolute blast of hop flavor. Citrus and floral hops all over the place with a nice bit of pine coming through as well. The malts and honey come together to form a softly sweet backdrop for the hops to shine. It also lends to a silky, smooth mouthfeel with lighter carbonation. The tropical hop aspects linger longer than the bitterness with a sweet hop finish. I usually like my DIPAs dry as possible, but this beer, as far as I've found, is one of a kind in the way the soft sweet malt flavors blend seamlessly into the intense tropical, citrus hop flavors."

"So I finally get to try the famous Hopslam! Thanks to the generosity of my brother and fellow BA member, I was sent a bottle from Louisville, KY. Thanks so much Bri for the beer! Love ya bro!"
"2012 Hopslam pours golden-amber, with one finger's worth of white foam that leaves a little lace. A symphony of piney and citrusy hop aromas blast the nasal passages as hints of pineapple, orange, and grapefruit blend beautifully. Sweet malt flavors intertwine with tropical fruit and honey tones, little to no alcohol warmth in the sweet and sticky finish. Medium-heavy body with medium amounts of carbonation make this brew dangerously easy to drink."
Thanks to Ehammond1 for sharing 4 bottles of this
"bottled on 01-26-2012, consumed 02-10-2012."
"a thick creamy three finger high head slowly recedes to a frothy off white cap, leaving massive amounts of thick clumpy lacing behind. a clear orange copper colored body just looks delicious. smell is very floral with citrus, honey and pine. caramel is also present. taste is near perfect. big citrus notes with a touch of honey and just the right amount of pine to keep it from being too sweet. along with the caramel there appears to be a little pepper on the back end. mouthfeel is a full creamy body that goes down easy. good carbonation and the right amount of spice from hops make this alive on the tongue. another punch of citrus hops before the long dry finish that leaves you wanting more. overall this is the beer that all others of the style try to be. many come close, but none achieve the well deserved hype of hopslam."

Review from 2012-03-20
Received two six packs of HopSlam from grinnellj. Thanks again for the trade!
"Please mind this review as it will be more of a narrative then notes. Eighteen months ago, I would not go near an IPA, I couldn't stand them. Then one day I had A Lil' Sumpin Sumpin and my world change, something clicked. I can drink any IPA, for example, I now love Stone Ruination."

Finally getting to try my first ever Hopslam courtesy of BarrytheBear! Thanks again Barry for your generosity! 12 ounce bottle bottled on 1-26-12.
"A: Thick, frothy, white head/green head. It laces very nicely."
"On-Tap at Liberty Tavern in Arlington, VA and served in a tulip glass."
"A: Thick, frothy, white head that stays for a while, good amount of carbonation, appealing golden color, lots of nice lacing"
Aroma here was pretty excessively sweet at first....fruity with the honey definitely showing. A nice tropical hop note comes in afterwards though and begins to dominate the nose.
"The specific hopslam I came into contact with has a really boozy taste. This doesn't taste anything like it did last year, which is pretty sad, I was looking forward to this. Heady topper takes this to the cleaners. If you haven't tried heady topper, get your hands on it."
This bottle's a little over a month old. Poured into a nonic.
Bottled on 1-6-12
"This is one of the most inconsistent beers I have ever rated. I liked almost everything about 2009 and 2010, except the honey aroma."
12 oz bottle from 12/30/2011
"Pours a orangish color with an inch of dense, foamy, yellowish off white that has good retention. The nose is sweet and citrusy. I get notes of grapefruit and mango as well as sugar and peaches. It reminds me of peaches and cream. The flavor is very similar to the nose. I get notes of sweet, citrusy fruit, sugar, and whipped cream up front with a mildly piny, bitter finish. The alcohol is well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, well carbonated, and a little warm on the finish."
I had Hopslam in a shaker pint.
Received via a trade. Bottle date 12/29/2011. Enjoyed on 2/8/12. This isn't on tap at the brewery but I don't think a month after bottling is enough to really mess with my overall experience of this beer.
32oz growler from CBX. Poured into a Bell’s tulip...
Thanks to kenatbeerswap for this great beer!
"One of the best beers I’ve ever had! Had this on tap at Red’s Alehouse in North Liberty, IA. Copper color pour with white head and tons of lacing. Floral, citrus, pine, hop smell. Bitter start but a smooth hoppy almost creamy finish. Easy drinking beer and highly recommended!"
Bottled 1/26. Reviewed Feb. 7.
was served from a tap at Valley Tap
Thanks to my buddy Jimmy2282 for this one.
"12 oz. bottle. Bottled 12/30. My first year having the hopslam so I can't compare it to years past, but I'm a big fan of the Two Hearted. I have had a few bottles of this, all from the same batch. The ones I consumed earlier seemed somewhat boozy, this one really hit the spot. Not sure if my palate was off or what..."
"On tap, Lancaster PA."
"Pours out a nice dark yellow with a finger, white head with good retention. "
"Looks the type. Almost orange, very darkish for an IPA. Some coppery notes. The head is bright white and looks slightly creamy. Dissipates quickly to a thin layer of bubbles, then sticks around. "
12 oz bottle with a bottle on date of 1/26/12. Have had this beer many years running but never reviewed it from the bottle. 
A: pours a brilliant copper orange with good amount of head.
I had out of a 12 ounce bottle. Deep yellow/orange color. It has a nice foamy white head that leave a good deal of lacing. There are lots of little bubbles that continuously stream up the side of the glass. Nice hoppy scent.
"A- Pours a brilliant copper/orange, medium haze. 1 finger head that dissipated fairly quick. Good lacing."
Bottled 01/09/12 and consumed about a week ago. Tulip glass. Thanks to mdfb79 for this!
"February 3, 2012. Grabbed the last bottle from the Foodery here in Philadelphia. They said they were saving it, but they let m have it. Can't thank them enough!"
"I received this one in a trade, drank fresh. This one didn't live up to the hype for me.It has an incredible smell, best part of the beer for me. Did taste good, but a little too boozy for me. I realize it is high abv, but alcohol not hidden well enough."
"A little mid-afternoon hopslam never hurt anyone. Picked up the other day at 1 for the Road, in Wexford, PA. Thanks!"
I got this bottle from a trade with Schustar. Thanks man for sending this delight to me.
Bottle (2012)
"Bottle into tulip, dated 1/09/12."
Poured from a bottle dated 1/26/12 (bottled on) into a pint glass. Pours a translucent pale orange-yellow with an inch of white head on top. Head dissipates fairly quickly leaving a very thin layer on top of the beer and some thin lacing on the glass all the way down. 
"Served in a snifter, 45 degrees."
A big thanks to Ehammond1 for sharing this. 
Bottle from 2012.
"Pours a golden yellow color. Small lacing around the glass. Smells of fresh floral aromas, no smells of any fruit. Upon the first sip, a strong hop flavor kicks in. This is a hell of an IPA. Very hoppy. A few seconds after the first sip, a pleasantly sweet honey flavor kicks in. A few sips in, the honey sweetness masks the hoppy bite and settles really nicely. Becomes sweet, and very smooth. This is a great beer."
This beer is bitter!!! Holy cow most of my friends hate it but I love double IPA's. The hops start off strong with some mild citrus tones and then mellow out as the beer continues through the palate until the beer mellows out to a nice even experience. I bought two six packs of this because I know how rare it is and it did not disappoint. A perfect example of a double IPA and I can't wait for next years batch
"Pours beautifully with a nice very light colored head. Beautiful light orange color that accentuates the citrus and tropical fruit scent emanating from the glass. Orange, mango, grapefruit, pine...it's all there in the scent. The taste is HUGE and follows the scent. The mouth feel is very good though not as viscous as I had imagined it would be. This is a BRUISER in every sense of the word. Excellent. No wonder it get such rave reviews. Glad I stood in line and I am thankful for my 4 bottle allocation. I didn't think it possible that I would find an IPA that beat 2 Hearted for my taste. I just did. Outstanding effort by Bell."
Bottled: 01/09/12; Poured in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.
"Appearance: dull copper, good lacing after every sip, looks likes it's time to drink"
"Lucky enough to get a 6-pack of this, ridiculously expensive though at $25"
A - Great light head. Nothing too much - just right. Color is a golden amber - fairly light in color - almost makes me think of a barleywine

thanks to jyoungsbcp for this!
This was a good one to add to the list of tried. Definitely a must for anyone wanting to explore IPAs and DIPAs. Very overwhelming flavor and I would not recommend to the faint of heart or stomach. This is a very strong beer and one to be aware of such beforehand. Nonetheless a worthy beer and one for any real connoisseur to try. Good luck!
Thanks to Rutager for this one.
"I'm one of the few that wasn't head over heels for this brew, and the reason is very simple - Hopslam has a very strong mango flavor to it, and I don't care for mango. That flavor even comes through in the smell, which I confirmed from another person before I poured it out of the bottle. "
"Surprising taste with the alcohol hidden. This is an excellent DIPA! I picked up a case and have enjoyed each beer. Pours a nice head and has a good aroma. The beer tastes excellent! I could down these one after another, it's that good. Just a great offering from Bells!"
Big thanks to mattboyer182 for this beauty.

scored a few 6ers at Sam's Quikie in Durham. $16.99 a 6er... not bad considering what others have been paying. Thanks to Sam's for not screwing their customers. Bottle date 1/9/12. one of the coolest looking beer labels out there. Poured into my Busy Bee Cafe tulip. sitting here about to watch the bobcats/76ers game tip on the boob tube. we'll prolly get killed. go bobs though.
"Note: This review was a re-post from my former account, jmkratt, which was hacked and I lost all my reviews...sorry for the redundancy."
Got a pair of 6 packs and ready to dive in! Bottle on 1/10/12.
"So here goes...having had it a dozen times...here is my attempt of the infamous, hype-crazed Hopslam..."
O.K. here we go:
"Right when cracking the bottle the room filled with the scent of fresh, raw hops. Very grassy and floral in nature, these were used as fresh as possible, and as young as possible, and probably dry hopped up until literally bottling the beer. There is no other way to describe how this beer smells other than how the Borg from Star Trek would describe it: It is perfection."
"Finally got a 6 pack of this. As a West Coast person, I'm very excited to finally try this. Bottle date of 1/9/12. Poured into Bruery tulip."
by far the best beer i have had in awhile. i debated picking up a six pack for myself however with it being so limited i let our customers have at it :) luckily we have the best customers ever and one was kind enough to hand a bottle over as i was instructed to enjoy and soooo i did. not bitter at all definitely something to sip on and enjoy to the very end
Major thanks to brkstoutfiend for the trade!
Sampled three bottles from a sixer in Michigan bottled on Jan. 9.
"Second (re) review Friday nite after my cheesteak and my sharp cheese you know what drinking my last 2 hopslams this beer doesn't have much going on tonite at all, kinda bland and tasteless, doesn't pare well with dinner at all. Give me a celebration all day, yea that goes well with everything. "
"FINALLY. My first EVER Hopslam. DaveHack sent me this as part of his box from Poker BIF 2.0. For this special occasion, I'm also Christening my Hill Farmstead nonic pint glass. What a pair. On with it..."
yeah Hopslam! i had to do all kinds of regrettable things to get 6 of these. packaged 1/9/12. 
"Growler purchased locally ($18.00), tapped yesterday, filled today. Remainder of what was shared with Wednesday tasting group. Poured into tulip glass. "
"getting ready to enjoy my first one of these ever, have heard many great things about this beer and being a hop head i hope it lives up to the hype wow 10% abv we will see love the artwork"
"Pours with a nice white foam that dissipates to a ring that slowly laces the glass. Clear amber/orange color. The smell is an great combination of fruit and hops. Taste is all hops. Sort of a citrus, orange peel hop flavor. The 10% alcohol is well hidden. Mouth feel is medium with good carbonation. Overall a great beer."
"Bottled 1/9/2012, so only two weeks old."
First Hopslam ever. Bottled on 1/06/12
"Bottled Jan. 9, 2012- Just at 2 weeks old at the time of review."
"It pours a dark straw, honey color with a nice finger of white bubbly head on top. Nice cloudy texture, but no noticeable sediment or hop residue floating in the glass, a bubble or two rising to the top of the glass. The aroma is great, big citrus character, grapefruit, lemon zest, some pineapple, and a nice amount of pine makes its presence known. Alcohol is definitely present, tingles the nose ever so slightly, a faint biscuit aroma is there as well. Bitter hops greet your tongue right off the bat, grapefruit is there, big pine notes, much more pronounced than the aroma leads on, a big sweetness from the honey comes through that plays well with the natural sweetness from the higher levels of alcohol. Faint biscuit is again at the finish, but this is a bitter hop monster, but that dash of sweetness really helps this one, it goes down so easily. Very crisp body, much bubblier and zingier than the appearance leads on, yet still has a big wet punch to it."
"There might not be much to say about this that already hasn't been said, but why not try. Pours quite nicely, beauty orange/copper color with a soapy 2 finger head that leaves minimal lacing. Smells of pine and just a hint of honey. Solid taste and the honey counterbalances the hoppiness quite well. Great mouthfeel with a nice aftertaste that lingers forever. I am damn impressed. Hope to have a DIPA battle between this, Pliny the Elder, and Surly Abrasive. Its gonna be epic."
Poured from a bottle into my Jackie O's tulip...
Poured into a Bells Hopslam tulip. Pours a nice hazy golden brown color with some orange tint. Decent white head that evaporated quickly with consistent lacing throughout the entire session.
"Super-fresh Hopslam pours a slightly hazy beautiful bright golden-orange. Small but dense off-white head leaves fat, sticky lace rings. Amazing aroma of clean bittersweet citrus bursts out of my Piraat tulip. Up close, there's a nice mix of tropical and citrus fruits, resiny pine, and candy sweetness. ""I say this with a staunch record of unblemished heterosexuality: It's fabulous."""

"Bottling date on the label reads ""12/29/11""."
"Okay this brew is awesome. The hops are there in the front, middle and end. The alcohol is present but not overwhelming at all. Such a smooth brew. I truly wish this beer was a year round brew. One if not the best DIPA's out there. This brew is worth tracking down and enjoying."
The local shop finally tapped their keg after sitting on it for 2 weeks. So glad they did because it was delicious.

Poured from a 12 oz. capped bottle (PKGD 12/29/11) into a pint glass.
"A - Very light in color, very transparent. "
"The color is orangish, it's a little hazy and has a lot of carbonation. The head was one finger and white and didn't stick around for very long."
"Enjoyed this one 11 days after the bottling date. Appearance is a nice golden honey color with a large off-white head. The smell is absolutely the best I've experienced to date - a cacophony of citrus scents that is intoxicating. This is where this beer really stands out. Even my wife, who hates the smell of any beer, said ""That's the least-offensive smelling beer I've ever smelled"", which is quite an endorsement for her. The taste is not quite as powerfully citrus as the scent would lead you to think, but grapefruity bitterness comes through big time. There is enough of a malty and honey sweetness to provide some semblance of balance. Very nice mouthfeel adds to the experience. Outstanding."

I was so excited that Hopslam was available, because some of the forums I read said that Hopslam wasn't coming out until the first week of February 2012. I bought a six-pack of Hopslam at the Martin's Grocery Store in Stevensville, Michigan on 1-20-12."

Bottled on 12/29/11. Consumed on 1/14/12. Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium tulip. Beautiful unfiltered hazy honey color. Nice head and nice lacing on the glass. The nose is very pungent. Notes of grapefruit and pineapple smack you like an oily fist.

"A- cloudy orange/yellow, looks amazing"
Big presence of malt. Almost to the point where it crossed the line into a barley wine. 
"Pours a hazy honey color into a standard pint glass. Virtually no head to speak of. Smells similar to heaven- with mango and grass. That's the smell that comes to my mind on a Monday afternoon at 3 o'clock. Modestly rich and completed by a simple bitterness. I believe it is worth the praise it gets. Have been waiting for this for a year. Bought it at the Binny's in Bloomingdale. Is there a ""5"" out there? Can't say for sure. As someone used to say, ""If God made anythig better than this, He kept it for himself.""DL"
A - Pours a nice amber color with a one finger width head. 
"Had this beer about a week after it was bottled. This is a beutiful amber colored beer. Single finger of bright white head, The taste was full of hops upfront and a nice honey dipped grapefruit after taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and medium carbonated. If your a avid beer lover you have to try it, and if you call yourself a hop head, its a must have every year."
"Had this and Founders Double Trouble the same night. No real comparison. Hopslam delivers the hops for sure, but the balance was not right. Its not smooth whatsoever; the hops seemed to generate a heat sensation and other off flavors that weren't quite right."

"I have a higher tolerance than most, but this beer has to be one of my top 3 of all time. I just picked up a case of the batch bottled on 12/29/11, meaning it's approximately 13 days old. All else considered, I honestly can't imagine anything else I'd rather drink at this point of the year. Very strong, but a flavor that I love and have become accustomed to after about 6 years of drinking various IPAs. Fantastic Winter brew, and it honestly puts me on point for going out for any occasion. I've had 7 of them in the past 3 hours(equal to 14 Budweisers), and can somehow think and speak clearly and concisely. "

"Reviewing the infamous Hop Slam, an imperial IPA from Bells Brewery, Inc."
Poured out a 12oz bottle into a Petrus Tulip.
"I haven't hardly reviewed a beer since the new ""rate a beer"" thing came out, but I felt the need on this one. Bypassing the normal etiquette of things here. This basically tastes like a hoppier version of gumballhead. Huge nose on it, however, the taste is very wheaty, grassy, with lots of hops, just like gumballhead. I'd be curious to taste them side by side some day. I realize this is classified as a DIPA, however, the wheat stands out, the hop finish stands out, and it reminds me totally of gumballhead. I will say this is very good, however I will also say this is severely overpriced and overrated."

"Im a huge fan of this beer and I find some the first day it's available in stores around SE Michigan each year. For 2014, that was Friday 1/10. This year's batch is disappointing. You know how the citrus and pine fall off as Hopslam ages? Well this batch (on day 1) tastes like a typical June Hopslam. Its still a great beer, and I will continue to enjoy it while it's out but Im not feeling like I need to hoard it as in the past. No problem, more for everyone else!"

"as the previous reviewer, had this from a growler, purchased at The Fridge in Lancaster, PA today."
"Had this on 2011-01-06 in Columbia, PA in a growler from The Fridge 30 minutes ago. Had this again on 2015-02-26 from a bottle in Columbia, PA. This 2015 batch is excellent in both aroma and flavor. I raised my Smell rating by .25 and left the rest the same. Had this again on 2017-01-23 and 2018-01-18 in Warrenville, IL from a 12oz can. 2018 observations: Plenty of this here in Chicago. Packaged 3 days ago. Tasty. Malty. Light honey. Light dank. Moderately bitter. At 10% it drinks like a Pills. Old school. Others surpass this but still fun. Dropped taste from 4.5 to 4.25. "
"I was never much of an IPA fan, but then I walked into Dutch's. I have always been a fan of Bell's, and wow, I was Blown Away by this beer. The flavor was amazing the subtle hints of honey just made me instantly fall in love with it. It is my favorite beer. Bravo Bells!"
thank you jamie for this one.
"appearance is a dark amber orange with a small head (when poured right). Has a nice citrus smell well as a good sharp hop taste, but not too strong. It might have a little higher carbonation but of course this comes along with higher alcohol content. But who cares about smell and appearance, this is one damn good beer and may accidentally get you drunk, FAST."
I just love this beer. On Tap at Dickey's in Fort Wayne.
Bottle opened by my friend and fellow beer collector Ryan B. 
"thanks to Chi81 for this extra. batch 10093, which was brewed in January 2011, so definitely past its freshness, but I heard this might still be tasty. poured into my stone snifter"
You had this beer. 
This hop-forward brew is big on all accounts.
Unicorn tears!!!! God juice... Smell is outstanding on this one. Taste is a floral boquet of the finest melody of hops. Mouthfeel is orgazmic. Overall this feels soo good it hurts. I fell in love with this brew... Too bad its only around for such a short time. Can't get enough of this gem.
"Pours amber orange gold with a mega foam white head. Leaves behind gobs of lacing. Nose is hops, citrus fruits, maybe some honey. Mouth is light to moderate, crisp and snappy. Not nearly as hoppy as expected. This isn't a hop bomb beer, but just a really great tasting hoppy beer. So maybe the name is a little misleading? Or maybe it just means it has hops in it and you will want to slam them down one after another? Regardless, good carbonation trending to the high side. Hops are more of a subtle bitterness that linger. Taste is floral hops, citrus fruits/lemon and some honey. Not nearly as much honey as I feared though. I normally don't like 'honey beers' but this is a huge exception thanks to the subtle usage. At 10% abv I can honestly say this is the most dangerous beer I know of. I could literally drink these one after another they are so smooth. Not a noticeable alcohol taste at all. But after a few, you can feel it and you know the bottle label was telling the truth. In the very small group that I consider perfect beers. My only real complaints are it is tough to get and wicked expensive."
This is an extremely powerful and potent beer that is also highly enjoyable. One of the craziest beers I've ever experienced. Great hop taste and balance. High alcohol content isn't extremely noticeable while drinking. It's unique and highly flavorful. Definitely recommend it.

BA review #800!
From the bottle to a tulip. 
Orange amber body with no head but lots of sticky icky lacing.
"12oz bottle at the Oak Cafe in Wyandotte, Michigan."
Appearance:
Served from 12oz bottle.
A - Wonderful Orange color with a huge head. 
What an amazing beer. This like PtE must be enjoyed fresh. If its over 2 months old its just not the same. 
A - Beautiful golden orange color with a very nice head.
A-A beautiful orangish golden color with a nice two finger head. Head retention is evident as well. Simply goregous
"Appearance: Beautiful orange color. Very clear and inviting. Nice two finger head, with not too much retention. Looks fairly light in comparison to higher ABV beers like this one. "
Technically this is a braggot rather than a DIPA. 
"A - Golden yellow/orange, decent amount of nice white head"
2011 vintage enjoyed in August. Poured into a tulip.
12oz bottle with no bottled on or freshness date on it. Love the label though!
"Bells’ Hopslam DIPA, 10% abv"
"This is what got me started on DIPA's/IPA's. I still have several 2011 cases, kept cool and the quality has not gone down, it still tastes wonderfully fresh, though I do have one or two daily."
"One of my favorite, if not my favorite, beers of all time. (2008) Oh man... there is a market out there for silly hop-infested beers for the wacky hopheads out there, but when something like this is so perfectly and deliciously balanced, it deserves supreme credit! (2009) Got some of this years batch... simply AMAZING. Huge grapefruit and fresh hop aromas and flavors. Man, this stuff is great."
A: Beautiful golden color nice 1or 2 fingers or so of head disperses a bit quickly but very nice lacing. 
"On tap at Bell's Tap Takeover at Mellow Mushroom in Charlottesville, VA."
Grabbed a bottle from Big 10 East on Jolly Rd. Everybody claims to have the Hoppiest. Beer. Ever. We. Shall. See.
Thanks Channan for bringing this bottle.
"Vibrant gold in color, white head and lacing. Moderate carbonation."
Appearance: Slightly hazy orange with very little lacing.

This is my first beer review so excuse the format...
BIG thanks for Schmoopsbeer for giving me this one as an extra!
"reviewed from notes, 12 oz btl poured into a Sam Adam's Perfect Pint Glass, lot #10126"
"This moderately carbonated, spicy/hoppy IPA is a favorite among many. Though I feel the taste is exceptional, the aroma is one of the strongest aspects of this brew. The aroma and taste are near perfectly paired. It pours with a one to two finger head and finishes with a sharp feel which tapers rapidly. This one I keep stocked for as long as I can't find it available."
From a 12oz bottle poured into a glass goblet.
Review adapted from notes taken 1/31/11
Recieved in a trade as an extra from StLThrash. Thanks for sending this one my way! Cheers!
Dark orange gold color that is mildly opaque. Awesome massive hop aroma with sweet sugary citrus and pine. The taste is of citrus and light sweetness that is very very drinkable for the ABV. There is no real alcohol taste due to the honey sweetness that helps cut the bitterness as well. This one delivered on every level of expectation and then some.
Review from sometime in January or February 2011
"If you like/love Double IPA's, this is a must try! Extremely easy to drink for being a 10% ABV. Even if you like IPA's and not Doubles, this is very drinkable. No bitterness at all so if you like bitter DIPA's, then this might not be for you but you should still give it a shot anyway. Ridiculous beer!!!"
Drinking this almost 6 months after it was bottled! I loved this beer fresh but haven't had it aged.
Appearance - This beer was a medium tan and fairly opaque. Not much head on the pour. At most you would get a finger of head with an aggressive pour. Not very viscous and no stickage to the sides of the glass as you swirled it. 
"Hopslam is one of those beers I believe is a little bit overhyped. I've had this a couple of times at different places, and while I think it is an excellent brew, it isn't the holy Grail of hops that some claim it to be"
A- beautiful and crisp. looks like an IIPA should.
A - Poured into a pint glass. It had a transparent yellow orange hue and with a 1 finger white head. The retention and lacing where both great.
"Pours a dirty orange color with a big white head that left behind some lace. Smells of huge hops and a lot of sugary malts. Mostly there is citrus with a bit of pine and some tropical fruit. The mouthfeel is a little syrpuy and the beer tastes a little hot. This is not bad, but kind of hard to drink and I think a little overrated."
"S:A huge bouquet of grapefruit, resiny pine and mango. Nice and hoppy with just a touch of a bready backbone. "
"Thanks to Thagr81us for the chance to try this, but I'm really concerned that this bottle is way past its prime dated March 2011. I'll try to re-review if I can get a fresh bottle next year."
A- Golden yellow
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a tulip glass. Thanks to Mike"
"Served to me on tap. Incidentally, I find that it perfectly complements my rather spicy Sichuan take out. (I'm lucky enough to have a local bar that allows outside food to be brought in)"
into an oversized wine glass
"Had this beer at my favorite bar in town, Sonka's. I've had this in bottles and on tap, and I much prefer the freshly tapped version. "
"Bell's Brewery Hopslam Ale Brewed with Honey pours a clear cherry golden color -- looks a bit like a Shirley Temple -- with a fizzy white head that quickly disappears into nothingness. The smell -- oh, the smell -- is springtime in paradise, all tropical fruits, mango and papaya, with just a hint of very mellow hoppiness. The beer is aptly named, as hops are the first thing I taste, and they're bracing, but not overwhelming, and balanced by a hint of honey sweetness. The taste lingers a long time. This is a beer to remember."
Served from 12oz bottle.
Mega thanks to Scoot1969 for tossing this into an amazing box of goodies for me.
"5/18/11 review, approximately 5 month old bottle."
A: Golden but not transparent. Hardly any head due to alcohol content. White head. Limited lacing.
A - Golden color with an orange tint. Firm head and beautiful lacing.
"I wrote this review when I had my first one of the year, just forgot to publish. Hopslam starts losing flavor quickly to me, and every one I buy is guzzled as quick as possible. My wife was shocked by the smell sitting 15 feet away. She said it was the best beer she has ever smelled and I concur. Very smooth, Lots of grapefruit comes through. Love the citrus and the bitterness. This is top of the class when it comes to DIPAs."
A - Pours very nicely. Easily fits into a globe with one pour. Head is two finger with foamy slightly green/yellow head. Brew color is perfect cloudy orange color. Great head retention and nice lacing!

Date Drunk: 1/15/11
For my first review I will do one of my favorite beers. 
Had this on tap at the neighborhood brewpub. It was my first time having it on tap. Pretty amazing....immediately notice the crisp and citrus hop flavor with an amazing honey after taste. So good it made me keep coming back for more...didn't realize just how strong it was though. 
12oz. bottle poured into a duvel. Bottled 1/26/2011 - consumed 2/21/2011 - reviewing from notes. 
Had from an 12 oz bottle that was a few months old. 
"Pours from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Emerges nice deep golden in color which tells me I am going to enjoy this one. The color shows a lack of caramel color, therefore, a lack of caramel flavor (which I like in DIAP). Small white head leaves minimal lacing."
finally I get the chance to try the legendary Hopslam! Ever since I started on this site I have wanted to try this brew. I can't wait to try this bad boy!
Fresh 2009 batch poured a beautiful hazy yellow with thick white head. Aroma of strong citrusy hops. Initial taste is hot with citrus and grapefruit. Sweet with hints of caramel and left a very nice hoppy taste in my mouth afterward. Alcohol is hidden very well. An aged 2008 bottle mellows out the hops and hotness and makes for a wonderful taste.
A - Golden orange with a fairly decent frothy head.
"Bell's Hopslam is a lovely, hoppy and strong double IPA. Get it whenever you can!"
A: . It pours slightly hazed Orange copper color with a small white cap which disappears within a minute.
A: Got a bottle of this the other day. It pours slightly hazed copper color with a small white cap. Retention is good.
A: Pours a very light amber that yields 2 fingers worth of a white head which recedes into a bubbly film at the top of the glass
"I've had this one for a while, but I just cracked it open."
"This is great, Great, GREAT beer. Upon opening the bottle, anybody within 10 feet is treated to the wonderful floral, citrus aroma. The flavor starts light and sweet, but not for long! Shortly thereafter the hops move in, and not subtely either. This is a big beer with big flavor. I like to pair Hopslam with grilled venison chops topped with crumbled bleu cheese or BBQ ribs, as the big flavors compliment each other. This beer might not be for everybody, but those who like it, absolutely love it."
"Hop slam, I was thinking I would be overwhelmed with the tartness, citrus flavor, but I was in for a surprise. The pour resulted in a two finger head of medium thick slightly off white foam with moderate clinging lace. The color was a 6 on the SRM beer color chart and a bit hazy. The smell blew me away, not what I was expecting. Aromas of honey, flowers, citrus, a hint of toffee, and caramel. Taste is a wonderful shock. Sort of sweet to start with, flavors of honey, and caramel, then the hops come to bear with the grapefruit, lime, and pine. While I was focused on the flavor, the alcohol ambushed me like a mugger. Wow, I don't think I would drink a six of these, even though the taste would let me. I need more of this fine nectar."
A-Light golden straw color with a thick white head that leaves excellent lacing on the glass.
4/20 - Hopslam review and why the hells not. Perfect way to complement the day. Thanks for the trade Shuggy!
"Huge hoppy aromas emerge from the thin white head of this bright golden ale. Citrus dominates with undertones of pine, honey, caramel malt, and cinnamon. Taste is smoother that one would expect, with lots of malt to balance out a strong hops bitterness."
"Poured a dark orangish color with a good amount of white head on it. Smell is very heavy citrus with some honey and floral notes coming through - this is a very good smelling beer. The taste however left a bit to be desired for me. Nice bitterness from the hops but the honey and grapefruit flavor really turned me off. I don't know if it was too much sweetness for me or what. Mouthfeel was alright, light-medium. Overall I was pretty disappointed in this beer. After reading all the hype about it on this site, I was really excited to try it. I've had a few other IIPAs that I think are a lot better than this. I'd give it another shot down the road but until my taste changes, I won't be buying another 6-pack, that's for sure."

"Batch 10196, bottled Feb. 8, '11."
Huge thanks to brew3crew for this one! So glad to finally try this.
"Bell's HopSlam, 12oz's into personalized ""K"" snifter. Pours clear and golden, 1"" off white head dissipates rather quickly into a thin film, slight lacing left behind. Nose is too sweet for my preference in DIPA's, but considering the abv %, I was expecting something in these lines. Floral, citrus like hops shine through a bit, fighting the sweet residual malt character for the lead. Taste is of a hyped up Two Hearted, nothing more, nothing less. This beer is Two Hearted on steroids, boost the centennial's, boost the pale and crystal, and you've got HopSlam. Overall I'm not too impressed by this beer at all. Bell's has a cult following, and I honestly think they could wizz in a batch, label it PissSlam, then stick a $14.99 price tag on a 6'er, and everyone would harp about how good it is. It just doesn't live up to everyone's hype, but seeing as Ive got 17 bottles left after it hit GA three months ago, I'll be cellaring plenty! Overall, grab one or two if you see it @ a reasonable price, but I wouldn't go too far to find it. I'd rather rock a Lagunitas Hop-Stoopid for $3.49 a bomber. Cheers all!"
12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.
A: Crystal clear golden orange with nice frothy off-white head.
Pours a clear golden honey color with a single finger head that leaves lots of sticky lacing on the glass. Small carbonation bubbles up the sides of the glass. Looks delicious.
"Def all the hype! A nice head that is gone in a flash. Great aroma of pine, honey and citrus. oh so very smooth! Definitely a nice hoppy flavor but crisper than most. A with fantastic hint of honey. Definitely on of the best ales around. Can't wait to drink my 5L!"
"A - sparkling clear, honey amber, fine tan bubbles dissapate quickly to lacy ring"
A: Slight cloudy
"Pours a golden amber with a half finger of head. A pretty touch of yellow at the rim. Head quickly dissipates leaving some sticky lacing. Nose has hints of honey, buttered biscuits, some pine and caramel candy with bitter citrus. Taste is a pleasant balance of sweet malts, grapefruit, toffee cookies with a pleasant,mellow hop bitterness. Nicely done dipa that i am happy i had the chance to try, a tad sweet but overall a well done beer and very drinkable."
Poured from 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass. 
"I chose to list the serving type as ""On Tap"" since the beer was poured from a 5 liter mini keg. Appearance was darker honey color. Not as nice looking as most DIPAs I prefer. I like a DIPA that has an orange hue rather than a reddish amber hue. Smell was too sweet for me, I am a hop head and like really hop-forward beers. The smell for me was too malty and not enough hops. Taste followed the aroma...way too sweet and malty for a good DIPA. The hops were not forward enough for me to enjoy this. It reminds me of an English style IPA more than a hop-forward DIPA. I guess I was expecting a better beer, but I get spoiled living in California, and expect the higher rated DIPAs to taste as good as the ones here do. To each his own, I guess."
Batch #10101 
"10073 printed on bottle. Thanks Sammy, for one that's been high on my list for a while."
Poured into a small chalice.
"Pours a clear bronze color with a creamy ivory top. Plenty of lace trails stick to the glass. The aroma is unrestrained hops. Massive concentrates of pine and citrus flavors fill my pallete and indeed sinuses upon first sip. A wonderful confluence of hop flavors, some sweet and fruity, some perfumey and aromatic play against a very bitter backbone and a very overwhelmed malt counter-balance. The mouthfeel is thick and luxuriously smooth with tiny carbonation. Alcohol is kept in check throughout, amazing for 10% ABV. The finish is pure hop bitters, lingerig forever."
"Aroma: Plenty of hops, very floral with hints of sweet honey. Very slight citrus aroma from the hops."
Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass

Thanks MatthewJames for sending me a 6-pack!
I spent 3 days trying to get my hands on a six pack and finally was able to pick one up.
"Cheers to millerbuffoon for sending me this one in a trade. This is the first beer I've opened from my box, and I have a good feeling about the others."
"Pours a slightly hazy, orange color. Minimal head but noticeable lacing as you drink. Delightfully sweet, citrusy hop smell. Taste is very hoppy and sweet with honey and citrus flavors. Also a tinge of alcohol sting. Slightly slow and sticky feel, stays on the tongue."
Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a half-liter beer glass.
a - pours a slightly hazy burnt orange with no head to speak of.
"Big thanks to Viggo for this one! Pours a copper orange color with a solid white head. Aroma has sweet honey and sugar with a whack of hops. Taste and mouthfeel are excellent! Great flavors of citrus, honey, caramel, and pine. Very good balance, this was not as bitter as I expected it to be. Drinkability is crazy good, I sure didn't notice the 10% abv until after I was finished!"
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Bright orange-yellow in color with a slight haze. Poured with a thick white head with that reduces to islands of white foamy and thick sticky lacings on the glass. Huge cirus hop aroma, citris, orange, mango, and an underlying sweet aroma as well. Smooth, thick mouth feel. The fuller side of medium bodied which subdues the carbonation a bit. Intense citrus hop and sweet honey flavor. A bit alcohol burn toward the finish. Leaves a light lingering bitter aftertaste."
"I have got to say that this is probably the best IPA that I have ever had. It starts off pouring a beautiful golden with orange highlights. The aroma is nothing but well thought out citrus characters. The Flavor is nothing shy of exceptional, as it first hits the tongue with a citrusy delight, and lingers for a while and finishes off with a floral quality that blends nicely with the subtle sweetness that the Honey in this master piece adds. The Body has been well designed to match the multitude of hop characteristics that mingle in this beer. Cheers to the brewers at Bell's for once again amazing me with this beer. Every year it never fails to please."
"Received in a trade with my buddy in Illinois. So excited to try this one! Batch 10093, bottles January 3, 2011. It is a little old but it is not available to me so I will review this now, and re-review if a fresh bottle next year is that much better."

"Thanks to CaptainNomihoda for this one. Poured into a pilsner glass. Medium orange a smidge cloudy, light bubbles. Head is bright white and very creamy looking. The lace is looking good so far, but falls off pretty bad by the end of the glass. You gotta love the hop slammed dude on the bottle."
Poured into a Unibroue tulip.
Thanks Kingkong for the popping the mini-keg.
"I had the pleasure of trying this on tap at my local establishment. Lucky for me, the company was buying and I splurged on a $9 a glass brew. I found this amazing. "
"Bought a case of bottles,"
OMFG... Best DIPA I have ever had and I want more. Dear Belle's please distribute in our state so that I may have this when ever I want and not have to lug it back from business trips! But I digress.
A- Deep golden body with a fluffy white head
Appearance: Two fingers worth of head when poured and diminished quite quickly while leaving lacing behind. The foam appears to be slightly creamy. The beer itself is a clear copper.
"As I sipped on this, it reminded me of my general thought of books and movies. The books [original] is always better than the movies [which are still good]. Thus was the case with the Hopslam, as I recently had a bottle and thought it was good..but nothing beats having fresh off the tap, in the house that created it!"
"Wow, what a beer this is! Beautiful in color, pours out a light golden copper with a head the sticks around till the last drop. The flavors are so luscious of fresh hops and honey the are juicy up front that dry you out making crave more. This is one great IPA!"
A- At first a thinner head than I was expecting so I worked the second half of a bottle a bit harder to get a nice two finger head. While softly milky it melted away faster than I expected. Sadly the head disappeared before I finished this review and the last 4 ounces. 
A- pours a golden resin yellow. A half finger of try white foam tops it and then dissipated.
"Bottle into tulip. This beer is top-notch, although the hop-lover in me sheds a silent tear every time I enjoy one (and enjoy them I do), because the top-tier hops combination is slightly masked by the honey, which detracts ever so slightly from what makes me appreciate the best double ipa's. Nevertheless, its drinkability is outstanding for an imperial, and I truly enjoy what is becoming Bell's most sought-after beer on the market."
"My cousin, Uhrhan was able to get his hands on a case and split it with me. Thanks! Had my first Hopslam and first Abrasive today! Lucky me."
Batch 10126.
All 5's. 
Batch 10126
This is one of my all time favorite beers!
A buddy of mine smuggled be a bottle from PA and the results were great. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be. Very smooth finish. Full body. I assume the honey used in the wort reduced the hoppy bite finish. Exceptional taste. Great beer. Best IPA I have had.
2011 Vintage. Batch 10126 Bottled 1/18/11
"It pours a golden hue in the pine class, There isn't a lot of head to this one and the foam that does show, only sticks around for a few seconds. Very clear and almost transparent."
A bottle pour into a small glass twice. 
This is the first time I was prompted for overall vice drinkability I would have to say overall this is exceptional but definitely boy a session beer. Thanks to Sully for the export. Pours adecent golden with mild head and nice lacing. Smell is a great obey citrus mess. Taste is like the name. Plenty citrus grapefruitvwith a sweet honey feel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but not syrupy like a 90 min.
"A-Clear, pale orange with a thin head"
First review
A-Pale amber with 1 inch of eggshell white head. Leaves rings of foamy lacing.
"Feeling like a copy cat, but I love this beer...I got to have a few bottles and several draft pours this season. Can't say enough about how much I enjoy drinking this beer."
"I probably can't add anything useful to what has already been written about this outstanding beer, but here goes. Pours a beautiful golden color with nice head and great lacing on the glass. The aroma is exceptional- very fruity, notes of peaches and of course hops. The taste is unbelievable. Without a doubt the most well balanced double IPA there is. Just the right amount of sweetness to offset the bitterness of the hops. I know this is an overly hyped beer, but in this case the accolades are true. If (god forbid) I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would undoubtedly be my choice."
"Rich golden in appearance, with nice white foam. Superb lacing. "
Got a 6 pack of this from the ABC Tavern in Cleveland Ohio last week. Poured from a 12oz bottle to a Dogfish Head Snifter glass.
"Amber in color with soap-sud foam. Aroma packs a punch - some piney hops but mostly grapefruit. Flavor is grapefruit hop flavor and bitterness that sticks. Some caramel sweetness just peeking through at the end. Most excellent. Not better than Dreadnaught, but about equal in overall impact. Just a bit different."
My first review
"A - Poured into a Bell's tulip glass. Gorgeous, off-white 1 finger head rests on top of a very clean, semi-transparent copper body with plenty of bubbles arising from the abyss to keep the head nice & pillowy. Great head retention & lacing throughout."
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sierra Nevada Tumbler.
Thanks Arnolds's Carry out for pulling some strings to get this one. 
12oz bottle from second batch release poured into a white wine glass. Nice cloudy copper color with frothy white head and lots of lacing. It just looks luscious and commanding of respect.
"okay, i had big expectations for this beer... had this on tap right after i had nugget nectar, so it had big shoes to filll"
"I've never had a 10 % beer that is so well balanced between the high gravity, hops and malt character. Popping open a bottle and pouring produces a wonderful citrusy/grapefruit aroma. A truly fantastic creation by Bell's, if you are a fan of simcoe hops this is beer must be on your TRY NOW list!"
a: pours a rich amber color with a eggshell head about half inch thick with a steady pour. Looks inviting. decent lacing that looks very thick...possibly extra sticky from the honey in the brew.
recieved this in a trade from kflack. thanks man!
"Thanks to BA backfat for sending this hopslam out to me in the original haiku LIF. As promised, my review. Better late to post than never."
"My first HopSlam, starting off what should be a pretty crazy weekend. Received 2 of these and many Surly goodies from a trade with surlytwinsfan, much thanks! This is batch 10100 which was bottled 1/5/11."
Served in a brandy glass. 
ahhh hopslam i will savor every drop of you as i will not see you til next year....
Poured into Bell's tulip. 
"From the bottle, guess it was time I got this review up."
2011 Hopslam Batch #10101 (bottled on Jan 4th--- 2 months old). This is the last bottle of a 6 pack I received in a trade----boo hoo!
Appearance: gold to light copper; little head in my tulip glass-- maybe a finger
A: A dark gold amber with a finger of frothy head. 
"Thanks to generous traders CruisaC and RobWestcott, both of whom sent me a bottle of this! Fortunately, I was able to give one to itsfreeasinbeer for his birthday, so thanks guys!"
12oz. bottle into a snifter
Poured into a glass from strohs. 
Poured from a bottle into a snifter glass.
"So here it is, Hopslam. I was going to wait till next years release because I love hoppy beers, but I hate when they sit for a time and lose the hop aroma and flavor. I saw this at the bottle shop yesterday though and couldn't pass it up. No bottled date but this came out a little over a month ago. Served in a Weyerbacher tulip."
Batch Finder on Bell's Website says this was bottled on 1/3/2011
"Batch #10127. Got in a trade from Schriebeers. Thanks man! I guess this is about two months old so not ideal. Pours a really nice amber color with a small white head. Pine, pineapple and honey on the nose. Definitely a lot of hops and not much malt. The taste is exceptional. Hops, hops and more hops. The honey really shines through and is pretty drinkable for 10% ABV. I would really love to try this fresh. On the other hand I wonder what it would taste like with a few years on it. A great beer!"
A - Nice orangey copper color. Frothy head with nice lacing.
"Had on cask at Pizzeria Paradiso. Had a few hopslams during the past couple of months, bottled. Went into Paradiso and found they had it available in a cask, and had to give it a go."
"I have long said that one of the best decisions of my life was founding The CANQuest (tm). The fact that they are CANning this beer ~ five years after my initial CANned beer review is telling. There was a LOT of discussion back then about what CANstituted a CAN, but it was determined that a 5L mini-keg would count as long as it was a) non-pressurized and b) gravity-driven. I was so happy then and even happier now, when I had begun to despair of FOMO, followed by a CANdiculous trade. I was visiting local Country Garden Six-Pack when I saw two six-packs on the shelf! Not being a beer greed-o, I bought one & traded most of the sixer for other cool CANs. Today (Su, 20 March 2016) is my turn!"
Group tasting notes from 2-18-11
golden/orange color with solid white head. excellent lacing. pretty much transparent with none of the particles I've read in the reviews. 
"A - Pours a bright slightly hazy copper-orange color with a finger of white frothy head. The retention was okay, wit ha nice ring forming around the glass with some lacing. "
"Big thanks to betsona and coenbd, both sent me bottles this week."
"On cask at Pints & Quarts in Muskegon during a Bell's Takeover the Taps event, 3 March 2011."
"Presentation: 12 oz. bottle poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. Batch #10101, bottled January 4th, 2011."
12oz poured into a Lost Abbey snifter.
Great big thick creamy head. Dissolves gradually and leaves tremendous lacing the whole way down. Orange colored beer of average clarity.
A: Pours a clear honey colored orangish-yellow with a thick head that took its time leaving. Did a decent job of lacing the glass.
Served in a tulip at Jaks Tap.
"Poured a light orange color with a thin amount of head. The nose was a mix of piney and citrusy hops, lots of hops. The taste was a ton of hop bitterness with a light amount of sweetness. It was nicely carbonated with a bunch of bubbles coating the toungue as it goes down. The alcohol was very well hidden as I had no clue that this was 10% until I glanced at the bottle again. However, there was also a lot of dryness to it that made it a little difficult to drink as I got farther down the class. "
"A- 4.5 Hopslam is a pretty light orange color and can barely be seen through. It has lots of bubbles and a nice, sticky white head that clings to the glass. An aggressive pour gave it 1-2 fingers. There is high lacing with this one. "
"A: Poured a nice deep golden, almost copper color."
12 oz. bottle
It's my favorite beer in the world (after overtaking Two Hearted Ale after a few tries). 
"A - A darker honey gold with clean white head, one finger of head poured into a chalice. Not a great amount of lacing. "
Served in a 10oz tulip at Fiddler's Hearth.
"Outside of a handful of beers, such as PtE and Dark Lord, there are few beers that are as hyped as Hopslam. Though good, I just feel like it isn't deserving of the devotion this beer inspires. This is coming from someone that had friends drive 2 hours to a distributor to buy cases and a mini-keg from a distributor (I live in PA). I think that the beer has a very nice hoppy aroma, but is it better than most good, fresh DIPA (probably not). There are smells of wildflower meadow, spruce resin, grapefruit rind, and sweet orange. The beer is definitely hoppy, but the flavor doesn't jump out at me as the best I've ever had. The honey definitely is present in the flavor, but it has a bit of an artificial McDonald's ""honey"" tanginess. The beer is too thin with too much alcohol (probably from the added honey) that is definitely present on the tongue that contributes to the perceived bitterness of the beer. The beer is tasty and finishing 1 or 2 is not a problem. But you'll definitely suffer palate fatigue after about half a glass from the alcohol and hops and then you won't really know what you're tasting afterwards."
"12oz bottle packaged on January 11th, 2001. Poured into a 16oz stemless snifter."
"Absolutely loved this beer. One of my favorites. Nice color, had a great smell to it, taste was excellent, especially given the alcohol content. Very smooth with a clean finish. Picked up a very discrete honey flavor which helped the smoothness, as well as the citrus. Drinkability is dangerously good."
"Doing a side by side of Pliny and Hopslam tonight. The Hopslam is batch 10094, but I'm basing most of my review off notes from a month ago when I first got the sixer."
Pours a hazy golden amber with a fairly thin white head that did leave very nice lacing behind.
Thanks to my sis and bro for this growler!!! Poured at fridge temp. into a pint glass.
When you pour this beer you don't perceive the magic it holds because it has a very light copper/yellow color that does not look like a ten percent brew. Head is also light but enough to display the beautiful aroma to follow. 
5 Liter mini-keg. Served in Imperial Pint glass.
"A: Amber-orange, with a thinner than expected head (1/3 thumb). Nice active carbonation. Light lacing from thin head."
"FEB 23, 2011"
Hop slam is my personal fav beer. I wish Bell's would produce this beer year round! The color was golden honey. With a i finger head. taste wise this beer was a home run.. OR slam DUNK!! It has a nice hoppy flavor but was exceptionally balanced by citrus and honey flavor. My palate picked up on orange and grapefruit flavors. I can not say enough about this brew I was lucky to find 2 six packs here in florida this beer sells out in a day!
"On cask during Flying Saucer Raleigh's 11th anniversary, served in a tulip glass a slightly hazy orange with a thin diminishing head that lasts as a ring. Aroma is a nice amount of citrus hops with a bit of pine and caramel. The taste is a nice amount of citrus hops, sweet malts and slight pine and caramel, nice and complex. The beer is very smooth and easy drinking from the cask conditioning. This is an excellent example of what an IPA should be on cask!"
Poured from a bottle into a snifter
"Wow! This is a great beer! Obviously, you will first encounter a sweetened hop taste, which is definitely ok! The beer itself is a beautiful creamy orange color, with minimal head and carbonation. The aroma too is ladened with a hops feel as it should be and is smooth going down. This beer is outstanding. The only downside to this beer is that its $20 for a 6 pack, but if there is any beer worth it, it would be Hopslam! If you have not tried it, you are missing out!"
"The bar poured a lovely clear orange glass of this for me, served with a bare minimum of foam. Some white bubbles and a sticky lacing. "
"I was lucky that the beer buyer at a local store called me to let me know he was holding a 6-pack of it for me. I was excited to try it for the first time. However, I wish the hype on this beer was not so high as I do not think it completely lived up to my expectations."
from the notes Jan 24 2011
Into a sam perfect pint thanks to hayesez!
thanks to LukeM23 for sharing
I am going to start this review by saying this beer is awesome. I have already burned through a 6 pack of this recently and just got another one as a trade extra (thanks DannyKelly) and decided to get around to reviewing it. 
This was had in a side-by-side today w/ Pliny the Elder. 
Thanks ChadQuest for the bottles.
"batch 10127 packaged on January 11, 2011"
"This beer pours a nice golden color and a generous head was exposed for such a high gravity beer. The honey comes right through with the sweetness that perfectly blends with probably the most grapefruity hop profile of them all. There is also some nice freshly cut rose notes to it. The aroma reminds that this is for hop heads, but in my opinion its more of a gateway drug for them. Its easy to drink due to the sweetness and only medium body which is due to the use of honey. "
"Pours a clear orange colour with thick whit head. Some lacing on the glass, with nice head retention. Smells of resiny pine hops with some citrus and lots of sweet caramel malt. Flavour has a really nice sweetness to it, then the bitterness hits you. Leaves the piney hops as a wonderful after-taste. Very smooth mouthfeel. Easily one of the best double IPA's I've had. This beer did live up to the hype."
Bottle Batch #10093. Reviewed Today out of a Tulip glass.
"Excellent beer. Found it the Capital Ale House in Richmond,VA, Church Key in Washington DC, and am enjoying one right now at Mellow Mushroom in Winston-Salem. Surprised to still find it this late in the year. Waitress says they have an extra one for sometime next week...maybe."
"Bottled Jan 5, 2011. Pours a clear golden-orange color with a frothy 2-finger head that slowly recedes, leaving lots of lacing. Smell is, as expected, a slam of hops. Citrusy, piney goodness, with a touch of bitterness on the back end. First sip almost knocked me over. Strong floral hops that are quickly followed by a wave of intense bitterness. There's a nice sweetness lingering there behind the hops that makes the slam a bit more gentle. The impressive thing about this beer is the variety of hop flavors that come through. Though I suspect, based on others' descriptions, that it would be even more intense if it were fresher. Mouthfeel is a bit tingly, fairly light, but lingers in the mouth. This is a very intense, very hoppy DIPA. While it's not exactly my cup of tea (IPAs in general aren't), I can see why it's so highly regarded."
"First year having this, and it is as hyped, amazing! I picked up 8 singles from a local store, at 2.50$ they were well worth it. The beer pours a orange color with a massive white head, 3-4 fingers worth. Hops up front, followed by a rush of citrus, and pine, prefect balance of the two. I expected this beer to be overwhelming with alcohol content but it wasn't even noticed even towards the bottom of the glass. Upset I haven't picked up more, I would have purchased a case at least. Overall this beer lives up to the hype, and is one I will enjoy each and every spring."
Much thanks to burnheartsMKE for the beer. 
"This beer is delicious and deceptively strong. When it first hits your tongue, you feel the hoppy bite, but then when it goes down, a smoothness transforms it in such a fashion like nothing else I've ever tasted. It's a treat and highlight to the beer year when it arrives at the local stores in town. But be careful - the ease at the finish is where you can mess yourself up. With the high ABV plus the easy drink-ability, you can quickly find yourself heading off the rails if you try to down more than 2!"
Poured from a bottle into a snifter
Fairly bright orange color with modest head and good lacing. 
"Enjoyed the beer. Expected more ""hoppy."""
"Got three bottles of this in a recent trade with hopsleeroy. Thanks Lee! Batch 10127 - bottled January 11, 2011."
"12oz bottle, batch #10127 (meaning it was bottled on January 11th), and it was poured into my Duvel tulip."
"Here she is, the legendary Hopslam. Big thanks to Tim from Detroit for this one."
"This is one of my favorite IPAs and I thought it was time to review it. This beer is what makes January in Michigan managable for me. The beer pours a medium orange in color with a nice fluffy white head. The smell is very intense and is of mostly citrusy hops. This is by far one of the most robust, quality smelling beers I've had of this style. The taste is definately hop forward, but the honey balanced it out nicely. There's lots of citrus in the flavor, but a little bit of pine as well, and a touch of sweetness in the finish. The mouthfeel is outstanding as the beer has the perfect amount of carbonation and a great feel. This is my go-to late winter beer."
"My first trade set up for this one, thanks to fourkicks for providing this one. Also my 100th review!"
12oz bottle served in a snifter.
Intro: 12 oz. bottle served in a Bell's 13 oz. tulip stem glass 
A. Beer poured a clear golden amber with a good head that disappeared quickley.
"Thanks to sburrough. Batch #10127, bottled on January 11, 2011. Reviewed on 02/08/2011. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass."
This batch was brewed in mid-January. Enjoyed on February 18.
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.
I had this on tap so my review will be more brief since it was a few hours ago.
Poured into a Chimay goblet.
"This had a white head that left quickly, not many bubbles hung around. A very light colored IPA with minimal cloudiness. Smells very smooth for a name like Hopslam. The sour is there, but almost as fruity in smell. The taste is different though...only hops in the initial sip. The aftertaste tones down the drink perfectly, must be the honey. Its not fruity in taste at all, just hops and a smooth undertone which makes it quite drinkable. Just read the bottle cuz I was starting to realize it was high - at 10%ABV (holy crap) this is an amazingly smooth beer!"
2/17/11 (Draft) 
A - Poured into a goblet a slightly hazy orange with a 3cm head that suprisingly falls away fairly quickly. Bit of lacing left behind.
From a bottle.
"I've been lucky and gotten hopslam through a couple different trades. This Imperial IPA from Bell's brewery is just freakin' fantastic. I poured some, took a pic, then came on to review it before I forget Mr. Hopslam's glory."
"Thanks to my man Mark for giving me a second to try, much obliged."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with some orange hues. The head is dense and fairly big, leaving some webby lacing on the glass."
Poured from a bottle into a Chimay goblet.
"WoW! what a treat. Big thanks to the Dennis brothers,MN for hooking this one up. The first DIPA ive ever had and man was this a tasty one. right off the bat after opening the bottle im surrouned by heavly hop aromas of citrusy, piney melony goodness. Im a chef with what i conisder a pretty cultivaded palet and this beer rocked my taste buds in dramatic fasion. at 10% abv i was in love with the world after my 2nd in a row."
A. Pours a clear copper/burnt orange color with a one finger creamy white head that dissipates quickly to a few globs of residual lacing.
"A- Clear goldish bronze color, 2 finger head, excellent retention"
Light orange and mostly transparent. Solid white head with excellent retention. Some minor lace spots but I drank it very slowly giving the beer little chance to lace.
This thing is a huge citrusy bomb with crazy aromas right away. It pours a golden straw color. 
"A- A nice Clear Golden brown, with a 2 fingure head"
"Sooo much hype - thanks to my little brother for sending me some from Morehead, MN. As NC and SC seem to be out."
applejuice in color...no head
Poured into a whiskey glass
Pours out a hazy golden color. A half finger head emerges from the liquid that is white in color. Texture is frothy and settles to a very thin foam and mostly a ring around the glass. Held to the light it is a very bright golden color yet still hazy. Some foam is left on the sides of the wall but the lacing isn't thick by any standards.
"A- This one looks outstanding. A golden, hazy golden color. With over an inch of sticky head that has a remarkable amount of lacing, the head on this one shows no signs of going away."
Thanks to Bulbman for the hookup on this one!
Appearance: Kind of a nice rosy orange amber. Nice carbonation and excellent lacing.
"A: deep yellow/light orange body, 1 finger head, excellent lacing."
"2011 bottling about 3 weeks old. Split among a couple friends. Pours a nice light copper with decent head that faded. Nothing out of the ordinary, appearance-wise. Now, the scent---amazing! I could smell this beer all night long! Amazing mix of bitter hops, tropical fruit, pine, etc, etc. Really amazing! Taste follows suit---an assault of hops and some light malt. Can definitely taste the honey sweetness. Very nice, but nothing I'd want to have more of one of. Had a touch of heat from the 10% abv on the finish. Overall a really good brew---glad I tried it finally. Personally, this is a beer I'd call a curiosity for me vs. an essential. "
"On-tap at Kelleher's (Peoria, IL) as part of a flight tasting on February 11th, 2001 in a 5.oz mini pint glass. "
"poured into a Duvel Tulip, got as an extra from Adamharbaugh (thanks a ton)"
Appearance - Pours an amber golden wheat that has a slight transparent orange effect. No head at all. It has low carbonation with average lacing. An exceptional and sophisticated looking beer.
Pours a honey orange color. Clear with low carbonation. A vigorous pour produced about a fingers worth of foamy head which in turn receeds quickly to surface film inside a foam ring. Good lacing.
"So here's the deal. I had 2011 fresh, and I also had it 4 weeks later. SO BAD, SO PEDESTRIAN. WHO DOES THAT."
A - Poured into a pint glass with a nice white head. The color is a very nice golden blonde that is translucent. Looks just like honey without the thickness. 
"Packaged on 1/11/2011 enjoyed on 2/12/2011, thanks to mixylplik3 for sharing this with me."
Poured into an oversized wine glass at Silhouettes in Media. Got the next to last pours before the kegs kicked.
"Major thanks to given2flybrewing for these. Poured into an mason jar with a wide mouth and it looks good. Puffy white head that clings onto the glass adrift on a light honey golden liquid. The aroma is where my journey to slight disappointment begins. Yes there are nice tropical fruit notes, mango, pinapple, and citrus along with light pine...but it is not so pungent and less then wowing. I also find the flavor to be muted. The components are there, nice honey note accents well citrus, tropical fruit and zesty earth tones the hops bring to the beer. Mouthfeel is not cloying and easy sipping for such a large beer, possibly the biggest success of the beer. So I am willing to admit that perhaps I didn't get the freshest bottle of hopslam, but until I taste it fresher I am underwhelmed and believe this beer is overhyped."
Thanks to Ballsofruit for the East Coast hookup
"From the bottle, HopSlam pours a light amber / orange, with very little head, and a few shimmering bubbles here and there."
"Shoutout to my main man Buddha22 for this, got it in a trade with him. Poured a cloudy, semitransparent golden amber, with plenty of foamy, pure white head that laced very well and retained not as well. Left a perfect swirl in the middle of the beer that was gorgeous...that was probably dumb luck, but it was still kind of cool. "
"Poured of course into my Bell's tulip. It appears a beautiful deep honey color with a nice fluffy light tan head that falls slowly to a mottled blanket layer. The smell is of a well integrated honey, sweet malt and juicy hops. Tropical fruit...grapefruit, pineapple."
"Batch bottled 1/3/11. Six pack supplied to me via my Chicago hookup, brought back by a buddy there on a business trip"
Had this from batch 10101. 
A: Pours like dark honey with some darker amber tones. Nice two finger head that seems to want to stay for a bit.
"2011 release, batch 10,115"
Serving: 12oz bottle served into a tulip
"This beer truly lives up to its hype. The hop profile is in your face and assaults your taste buds. It is a IIPA that keeps people coming back year after year. I know that I will be buying this beer on a yearly basis, so everyone needs to do themselves a favor and just buy this beer."
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass a rich amber color that left just a bit of head and a small amount of lacing down the glass.
Review from notes taken on 1/27/11. On tap at Al's of Hampden.
12oz bottle poured into a perfect pint. $14.99 for the six pack. Batch #10094 consumed ~ 3 weeks after bottling. (review from notes).
Ha ha!!! I may be one of the only people in the World to drink both Pliny the Younger AND Bell's Hopslam on the same day!!!!
A: A finger of slightly tan head that are rather thick and pretty clear with a slightly copper appearance. The beer leaves nice lacing.
"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle to an Oversized Wine glass. Batch number 10100, according to Bell's Batch Finder it was packaged on 1-5-11. $16.99 for a 6-pack."
"Wow. I have looked forward to trying this beer for years and have finally had a mini-keg opportunity. Expectations were very high, and I'm surprised to say that they were exceeded."
"A:Pours a nice orange color with a fingers worth of bubbly white head that falls fairly quickly, excellent lacing is left hanging around on the glass. "
Poured into 12oz glass from tap.
"Pours clear golden with a great dense white head. Leaves great lacing and holds a good amount of head throughout drinking. Aroma is very floral, I smell pineapple, papaya, oranges/tangerines, grapefruit, some honey. Flavor is resinous hops, tropical fruits, citrus, and a good deal of honey.. This beer dangerously drinkable! Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied, sticky, medium carbonation."
Poured from a bottle into a Duvel tulip. 
"You know, I have had this beer for about 6 months now, and I can't for the life of me remember where I got it. I am thinking that it must have been from Knightly Spirits in Orlando, but I am not sure. Regardless, I know that I didn't pick it up here in Texas. Let's give it a go."
"Finally got to try this one after hearing all the hype. Pours hazy orange with a nice two finger head. Aroma of sweet citrus, grapefruit, orange and honeysuckle. Nicely balanced leaning toward the sweeter, less floral side for me, definitely notice the honey. So easy to drink that the ABV makes this one quite dangerous for me. No alcohol until the very end and by the time I notice it I am taking another sip. Really enjoyed this one and will certainly seek out when the season permits."
"The beer poured golden-honey, with two fingers of frothy foamy eggshell-white head. The foam clung tightly to the side of the glass, and after the head receded it left bubbly residue all over."
"Insanely intense hop aroma hits as soon as you open the bottle. Pours a clear copper with a minimal white head. The overload of hops give this brew a very earthy, almost citrus smell and taste. Good carbonation and definitely a beer a hop head will love."
This beer gets better every year. Pay attention to this one. Beers speak louder than reviews.

New review from the 2011 batch:
"This is my first review. I found this site after buying a Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA and thinking I had quite possibly found the best beer ever made. I have not reviewed the DFH yet (that's next) but after spending hours reading the reviews here I set out to find Hopslam. Lucky for me that my discovery of IIPAs coincided with annual release of Hopslam. Doubly lucky for me apparently there aren't a lot of Beer Advocaters down here in Naples, FL as my local Total Wine had 5 sixes left on January 31st (my birthday). I bought them all without even trying it first."
2011 fresh bottle
"Pours a beautiful hazy orange color with a huge white head. Awesome lacing and head retention. Aroma is noticeable even on the pour. The honey stands out along with awesome tropical fruits, mangos. Absolutely wonderful aroma. The honey sweetness begins the flavor profile, followed by those big tropical fruit flavors. Then a second kick of hops, this time of the floral, pine and citrus variety add a bit of bitterness, but a great blend with the honey sweetness to the last half of the beer."
230th review on BA
Received as an extra from Commis. Thanks again man...
12 OZ bottle poured into tulip.
5L mini keg poured into a tulip.
12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.
a: Hazy honey color with light carbonation and a half-finger of white head
Bottle into a big snifter. 
Hopslam is hoppy as hell but still very drinkable maybe even more drinkable than two hearted. Unfortunately for my wallet this beer is definitely worth the high price... The honey is delicious. All around one hell of a good imperial IPA. I will buy again and again and again.
A: Honey golden in color. Creamy light head that dissipates quickly. Fine lacy retention around the rim of the glass that continues and hangs on the whole time.
I look forward to this beer more than just about any other seasonal release every year. One of my favorites.
"First bottle of Hopslam, 10093 printed on the bottle."
"Poured from a bottle in to a pint glass. It was a nice golden color with a 1"" or so white head that dissipates in a minute or so. Slightly cloudy, mainly clear. The lacing continues down my glass pretty well."
Presentation: Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle as pictured. 10094 is the only printed number on the label and unsure as to it's meaning. 
"I received this bottle as a single from a BA ramseye4 in person in Richmond, VA (Thanks! :) )"
A: Brilliant golden amber with a goopy white head.
Appearance-Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Rogue pint glass. I could have put a little more gravity on this pour but i'm sure the beer wont suffer too much. The color of the beer is a fairly light copper with a completely white head. It fizzles away fairly fast but thats sort of expected from a beer thats fresh with a higher abv (this one rings in at 10% by the way). Lots of tiny bubbles running to the surface but unable to save the head from deflating. Looks stellar.
"2011 bottle, first six pack i have had the chance to purchase"
Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a 12oz Sam Adams Perfect Pint.
"Poured into my tumbler, it was a crystal clear, bright and sparkling honey-golden-amber color with virtually no visible carbonation. I managed to build a 3-finger head through a vigorous pour, but once it settled, it held a creamy 2-finger white head of fluffy soap bubbles with excellent retention. There was quite a surprising amount of lace that lined the glass in intricate sheets while a thick island of large soapy bubbles mingled with a thin covering of minuscule bubbles that covered the rest of the liquid. Hopslam carried a very nice head for such a huge Double IPA."
"All 5's my friends. I was fortunate enough to purchase 12 last year. Drank 6 stored the other 6. The grapefruit on the label threw me off when I first purchased it, but it complements the floral notes of the hops perfectly.

"One of the most amazing beers I've ever tasted. The stong hop bite is offset by the honey just perfectly. Amazing look, amazing nose, and even more amazing taste. "
"Reviewed this beer 2/15/2009 on a batch bottled on 1/20/2009... Gave it a favorable review, yet didn't buy into the hype at that time. So here it goes again. This one was bottled on 1/4/2011 so this is a fair re-do, given both are being reviewed 26 days after bottling."
A= Dark golden yellow looks like it could have some light orange highlights. Nice tight foamy head with some nice lacing.
"A: Poured into a pint glass, has an awesome orange/apricot coloring and a small white head about a finger-width thick. "
"This beer is radical. Hops and honey punch you right in the chops, then reminds you that you should be on some bright and sunny beach drinking a pina coloda but you stuck in Michigan drinking the best thing that ever touched your lips since your first kiss but even better.Taste like the first rain drops that fell from Heaven. Wish I could drink these all day long. Damn it's good. Love to see MICHIGAN beer kicking arse and taking names. Great job Bell's."
"Went over to Viggo's place and the guy let me drink a whole 12oz bottle, which is a testament to his generosity."

"12 oz. -&gt; Weyerbach tulip. Split a case with Frank from Allentown, PA."
I have been waiting to try this beer...and worth the wait it was! Local restaurant has this on tap here in teh 'burbs of Chicago is awesome! The beer is slightly cloudy golden with thin head. The aroma was a powerful citrus and pine...everything one would want from an Imperial IPA. The citrus/pine help to balance the 10% ABV....a few of these and one will be slammed!!!! The high alcohol and powerful flavor makes this a tough session beer! Morning after would probably be like having a car deoderizer in your mounth. Stay thirsty my friends!
First time trying this. Love the label - a lucky sob is getting body-slammed by a giant hop nugget. What a way to go. Hops + Honey...That's just smart. 
"Pours a hazy orangish sunrise with a small white head which fades quickly to some sparse bubbles around the edge. Gobs of grapefruit, citrus, tangerine, pineapple, and honey flowers dominate the nose. So nice. Bitter citrus hoppy flavors really zing the tongue. Oh so dry but fresh, crisp, and clean. A standout for sure. Very well done."
Appearance: Straight pour into a tulip glass. The color is a slightly hazy honey color. One finger of slightly off-white head developed and dissipated quickly to leave a bubbly lacing and ring around the edge. There is some very minor carbonation: one or two bubbles float to the top.
Appearance:
"This is a fine big hoppy IPA. I don't know what it is about many of these ""fresh"" hop strong ales I've had, but they all seem to share similar, if not the very same, hop flavors/aromas/characteristics. Hopslam is no exception. Same hops? - DFH 90 Min and Victory Hop Wallop are other examples I look to that seem nearly indistinguishable from a hop profile standpoint."
been waiting a while to try this beer!
"Oh my. Found this on tap at Blarney's in Dinkytown and much happier paying 5.50 for a pint than the 18 I saw for a six pack last night. I bought a Sierra Nevada bomber Imperial IPA, Hopminium? Or something like that. First taste of Both was wow, but when it was Hopslam it was a bit of a more satisfied statement."
"My first foray into Hopslam Land. Thanks to Hawthorne's in South Philly for having it available fresh; this one was bottled on Dec 7, 2010 and poured into a tulip."
"Pours light, clear amber with generous white head. This dissipates slowly, leaving a thin cap of lacing."
"served on-tap at The Alcove, Tuscaloosa, AL, into a mason jar"
Another solid offering from Bells. I enjoy how the different liquor stores price this abv monster. Be careful an extra $6 can be ripped from your wallet for no good reason. 
"Two fingers of billowing head sit atop this reddish orange hops machine. It says on the bottle that this beer is brewed with honey, and that's what it looks like. Honey. Lacing is sticky and is pulled down the sides of my pint glass. Rising bubbles are medium and somewhat slow. "
"Wow! This beer lives up to its name and accomplishes what it sets out to do...slam you with hops. However, its brewed with honey and this adds a nice sweet character that smooths out the balance and makes it very drinkable. "
12oz bottle into snifter.
"Batch 10,093, served in a stemmed tulip."
Poured a gold with little white head and leaves some lacing.
"Golden orange in color with not much head. Some good lacing but the head dissipates really quickly. Intense citrus aroma with tons of tropical fruit; grapefruit, mango, pineapple, etc. Taste is more fruit, very citrusy. The preceived bitterness is only moderate. Not boozy at all considering the high ABV. Could pass it off as a regular IPA, other than the intense amounts of hop aroma and flavor. Still a great DIPA."
"Got this beauty in a trade with rhodeska. Poured into a SN tulip glass, with a mostly clear, orange color with a thinnish head and light lacing. The smell was one of strong orange and pineapple with a touch of grapefruit. My first thoughts on tasting were 'sweet' and 'orange', which was followed with a nice balance of bitterness. A moderate to heavy mouthfeel, perhaps because of the sweetness. Fairly drinkable, although it may take me a few to get used to the sweeter than normal taste of most of the brews I enjoy. Definitely a Top 100 brew and glad I was able to finally enjoy it!"
Date: 28 January 2011
Drank a pint of Pliny last night. Then the beer fairy delivered a 6 pack of Hopslam. She came disguised as a dear friend who had been traveling from the East Coast.
"This is a review of Hopslam on tap, for which I thank BlackSparrow Pub in Lafayette. Thanks for keeping us in wonderful beer, birdies. My bottle review should appear right below this one for those who wont get access to the kegs."
Poured into my Duvel out of a 12 oz bottle.

"A: Good, what I expect from a double IPA, dark golden color, some lacing down the side"
"Served on tap at Al's of Hamden in Enola, PA in a tulip shaped glass ."
"Love these minikegs. Pours a slightly hazy yellow-orange. Nice almost white head with great retention. OK lacing. Smell is incredible. Tropical fruit, citrus, orange, a touch of sweetness (from the honey?). All very clean. Smells fantastic. This rivals Nelson and Citra for the best aroma I've gotten in a dipa/ipa. "
"On tap at the Alcove International Tavern in Tuscaloosa, AL. Thank God we finally have access to this brew."
"Finally sampled this rare libation. Very good ""drinking IPA"". What I call a ""designer IPA"". Not a bad thing. Very unique, not as strong/bitter as a Symcoe IPA. It is velvety smooth and has sweetness not common in Double IPA's. Would recommend to hop heads as nothing else taste like it."

12oz bottle into Bruges tulip. Batch 10115
Thanks to BeerThursdays for this bottle! Bottle from 1/11/11
Vintage (2011) Actually bottled on my birthday...perhaps a late present?
A- Pours a golden orange with decent carbonation and little to no head regardless of how I pour it. Laces well though. 
"Served to me in a tulip straight out of the cask at Patton Alley Pub in Springfield, MO on 1/20/11"
Got this at The Cracked Kettel in Amsterdam. 
"Tried for the first time last night with a friend with similar beer tastes as myself. Figured id buy into all of the so called ""hype"" and try it out and im very glad i did! Out of the bottle it is a very clear tan straw color with a full head that slithers down to a thin line that leaves ample lacing down the glass, nothing too outstanding here, very common for this type of beer. This is where it gets exciting, this beer smells phonomenal! Catty whiffs mixed with tropical fruit and fresh cut grass that can be smelled from across the room. Now on to the taste portion of our trip. Fresh cut grapefruit and ripe tropical fruit makes your mouth water for more! Very crisp and refreshing, slight sweetness from the honey is found but malts are pushed back and hops take the stage. 10% is lost in traslation of bitterness, leaving the drinker to sip not because of its boozy nature but because it is so hopped up. Great beer well worth the ""hype""!"
Appearance: Golden w/ a thick head when poured. Lacing on the glass was apparent following consumption.
"Ahhhh Hopslam, how I love you..."
aggressive pour into a snifter.
A - Clear golden copper colored with an everlasting white head. Lingering with tons of crusty lacing. Very appealing.
"Bottle (2011 batch) poured into a tulip glass. Dark orange, mostly clear with just a slight amount of haze. Initial half a finger of large bubble white colored head dissipated to the surface of the beer, leaving a bit of lacing. No carbonation visible from the edge of the glass, though a little swirling forces some carbonation to move up before settling into nothing. "

Bell's 2011 Hopslam from a bottle. Poured into glass gave a good amount of fine cell head that dissipated medium fast. Leaves clear head residue on glass. Thin white foam remains after.
Shared via trade from coryking. Thanks again Cory! Poured into a tulip.
Another beer that I have recently wanted to try because of all of the buzz around it. I poured it into a glass and the color looked great with a small head.

Poured from a 5l mini keg into my glass. A huge thanks to dmunroe for this delicious elixir.
this is my first review for BA so i figured I'd start with one of my favorites.
"This brew pours a cloudy, sunburnt orange with a fingers worth of head that rolls down the edges with each swirl. The nose brings a tropical hop jungle to your senses. Sweet fruits such as pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot are noted the most. The hop combination is blended so well that I'm now squirming, ready to take my first sip. The taste follows the nose like a shadow. Sweet fruits are awesomely blended together to create a mouthwatering taste that leaves just enough bitter ""crisp"" at the end. This brew is very well balanced and has a very well hidden ABV. HopSlam is truly the nectar of the gods!! I wish I could drink it all day long!"
A - Golden with a slight haze. Pillowy white head which takes forever to fade. A nice sticky lace coats the glass as I drink.
My 3rd BA Review!
"Pours golden with a reasonable head. Smells strongly of citrus hops, grape fruit and a bit of booze. Hop forward. Really strong taste of hoppy, citrus and grapefruit. Balanced relatively nicely with a bit of honey sweetness. Medium mouth and carb. Very drinkable, despite the lingering hop bitterness. 10%? Where?"

A - Medium amber color and clarity with some white lacey foam and medium effervescence.
"Fresh 2011 bottle. Pours a clear golden orange with a fluffy white cap. Nose is huge on pine, some citrus rind perhaps a touch of sap. Effective hopping on the nose. Caramel malt on the front palate, then a large wash of piney hops that lasts for a good 40 seconds. Hot on the back end. As with previous batches, this has an awesome nose but the mouth is a bit off balance. The hot finish is akin to a splash of vodka. "
I'm pretty sure I got the last 6-pack of Hop Slam in metro Atlanta. Thanks to Smyrna World of Beverages and the special guy (you know who you are) who put the last 6-pack away until I recovered from surgery. You earned my loyalty. I wish Hop City treated their customers like that.

I picked up a couple of these at the store last week. I have had this beer many times but I have never got to try it the same month it was released. So let's see if this brew live up to all the hype. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass.

I don't care what Chuck D said about don't believe the hype. Do believe the Hype! This beer is phenominal! Does Bell's capitilize on Economics 101 which says supply drives demand...Yes! Is this beer worth driving and calling all over town for?...Yes! I really wish Bell's would open up distribution on this one a little.

"A- Golden-orange, clear body looks amazing in my beeker but the rest of the review is from my Providence Reds stein. The only thing that is not amazing is the lack-luster lacing present. Don't get me wrong, there's some lacing, but not a lot as I've seen in other beers"
Appearance 4.5/5
"This legendary ale pours a crisp clear apple juice light amber topped by a cap of pure white fluffy head that quickly drops to a lacy skim on the edges of the glass. Smells amazing sweet tart citrus all the way. I get oranges, lemons, grapefruit very nice spicy aroma with a hint of booze. The taste is an adventure tart obvious booze in front, intense citrus hops in the middle and a super strong bitter ending that coats the mouth and demands another drink. A very pleasant mouthfeel acts a as a balanced maybe slighty thick but smooth hop delivery system. I could really drink many glasses of this top notch double IPA. I had it last year and thought I could detect some sweet honey last year perhaps this bottle is extra fresh which blocks out everything but the mainstage of hops."
Poured slowly in to a tulip glass as a baritone delivers an aria in legato in my living room.

Sticky lacing lines the glass beautifully. "

"A - A golden amber color. A small amount of head, with decent lace retention on the glass. "
"Bell's Hopslam has a huge, white head, but the color was paler than I had expected. The hop aromas hit me as soon as I opened the bottle. The aroma is chock full of the familiar hoppy flavors of grapefruit and pine. The flavor is very interesting. The hops are definitely there, and huge, but the addition to honey adds a sweet finish. It's dry, the hops linger longer than the honey, and you won't find better lacing."
"Batch 10101, from a bottle into a snifter, thanks to calbertb2"
"Going on my 3rd season of this DIPA so I guess it's time I throw in a review of my own. This review from a 10-day-old bottle. As a hophead, I am probably biased but this really is an outstanding brew. Last season was not as good current season or 2 years ago but I enjoyed it last year as well anyway. This would be a good time to commend Bell's Brewery on another superb brew."
Thanks to Pellinore1 for the fresh trade! Bottles 10093.
"From a mini-keg. I drank it when I had a bit of a cold. But alas, it wasn't finished in that sitting. Pours with a lovely billowy head. Bright orange, active carbonation. Chunks of lacing down the glass. Not surprisingly, it looks better here than poured from a bottle. The magnificent smell is there and perhaps even more potent. Fresh and inviting. Green lies underneath throughout and is accompanied by a piney, resinous hop character. A sweetness atop it. Light bready, biscuity scent. Taste is the tongue number that has always been Hopslam. Good balance of bitter and sweet. Bitter is the clear winner but balanced perfectly. Hints of honey do wonders. The finish is dry and tingles the tongue with its bitterness. Somewhat sharp. Before this, a good sticky, resinous sweetness melds with the hops. I could drink it religiously. I only wish to see this beer produced year-round. It has a certain nostalgia to it that doesn't come often enough. And I don't think having it around all the time would hurt my perception of how great it truly is. *crosses fingers*"
"Batch 10101. Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured yellow-orange with a three finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, pin, and citrus/pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, pine, citrus hop, grapefruit, and sweet alcohol on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty excellent brew. Had a great aroma and flavor going on here without doubt. Very well balanced aspects in this one. I can understand why it flys off the shelf nowadays. This is an absolute must try!"
"First bottle out of my case. Bottled on 1-11-11, batch #10127. Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass."
This was a new one for me. I hadn't had a distributed beer from a cask before. The nose had a very fresh floral hop aroma. The color was a nice gold to amber with a slight haze. The taste was mild bitterness huge grapefruit and smooth finish. It is a great lounge/den beer when you have time to just sit back and enjoy the glass. Velvet Grapefruit....
"Aftertaste alternates between the honey, malts and hops. Smoother finish than pliny, although the honey seems to block some of the hops aroma. "
Special thanks to Bell's Brewing and Amalgamated Brewing for procuring a cask of Hopslam for the St Louis area. The cask ran dry in 42 minutes and served more than 200 locals enthusiastic about great craft beer.
"Bottle courtesy of TheSevenDuffs, via peensteen. Thanks again guys, blew my mind that I'd have the chance to sample this. Served in a pint glass, Batch 10093 (just over 2 weeks old)."
Pours a hazy golden color with lighter edges where the light bends in the glass. Nice foamy white head that sits for a long while.

First thing that hits me is the smell. extremely grassy/earth tone with light citrus notes.
I was only able to get one of these in a 12 ounce bottle. God has frowned on me once again. It is like Jesus in a bottle. I love it.

"One of the few DIPA's that really nails it: it's all about the flavor/aroma hops. The nose hits you with the pungent smell of hops and the taste follows through with more delicious hops. There's none of the heavy malt flavor that makes so many DIPA's more like a barleywine. In past years I've thought the honey made this beer a bit too sweet, but the past couple batches have been perfectly in balanace."

A: A nice amber/gold color with nice head. 
"Batch #10,115 was bottled on 1/11/2011, meaning this six-pack is 9 days old. Pretty fresh, I must say... really excited about this guy. Let's see if it lives up to the hype. Bottle poured into my Stone shaker-pint glass."
Got my first Hopslam in a trade. 
2010 Hopslam served from a 120z bottle
"pours a deep golden honey with thin white-ish head that takes it time but eventually leaves. smell is amazing with a strong earthy fresh fruity flavor....hoppy. taste, like the smell, is amazing with a strong grapefruity/hoppy kick and tid bits of alcohol with an awesome bitterness at end. the mouthfeel is all there and big. very drinkable."
"Deep orange/amber with thin white head. Strong earthy/pine hop aroma. The taste follows the nose; earthy, grapefruity hops with strong malt backbone. Finish is rather dry and bitter. Aromatic hop aroma/presence lingers in the finish as well. Extremely drinkable as the alcohol is well hidden."
So much hype...does it deserve it?

"This is a review of the 2011 Hopslam (duh).This beer pours a honey orange, very translucent with a light white head that rims the glass. It smells of citrus and pine with a lot of honey. Remembering last year's via the smell made me smile, almost laugh. Oh...Hopslam. I don't know where people are getting pineapple and other random fruits. The flavor is honey upfront followed by an entire pine tree with a pitcher of orange juice. I'm a fan, obviously, but this was WAY BETTER last year. It's well carbonated and goes down smoothly. This beer is very drinkable for the content. It boasts excellent flavor but this was FAR BETTER last year. It's not as powerful or strong or something. I don't know what it is, but it's off."
Appearance- Bright glowing copper pour with 2 fingers of fluffy off-white head. Good lacing.
"Damn, this stuff is awesome! A buddy of mine got a case last year and kept bragging about it and I didn't get what the big deal was, but mostly because he's a wanker. I've never seen it for sale and our local store, Beer Run had a limited supply. So, sitting at my miserable soul suckling corporate job at about 4:30, my wonderful wife asks if i saw the last part of the Decemberists live show on NPRs website because they asked Chris Funk what his favorite beer was. That's when it clicked: I forgot to call Beer Run to see if they had got some Hopslam in yesterday! I called. They had about two cases left. So, with $50 gift card in hand (thanks in-laws!) I shutdown my computer and explained to my co-workers, who would never understand, this desperate mission I was on. I showed up to Beer Run with lazer like focus on finding this before the other turdbags did. To my surprise, there were a couple of six packs sitting on top of a case, so I snagged the max I could, which was limited to two per customer. I was to busy chit chatting about how awesome this beer is while the girl rang me up and didn't even notice that it was $20 a six pack. Needless to say, it was well worth it and homeostasis is restored in my bio-dome."
Crisp clear golden color. Nice frothy head laces the glass very well. 
Just thought I would begin this review by telling everyone that I just poured the beer and was run over by the smell of fresh pineapple. I wasn't even trying to smell it!

Pours a dark golden color, with a moderate head and gobs of lacing. Hops hit the nose first, with some honey, a lot of pine, citrus. The hops comprise the majority of the smell but it is very well balanced. Hops also come to the forefront of the palate, with the honey becoming evident halfway through the tasting. The hops really shine, and instead of being a simple but tasty hop bomb like a lot of other IPAs, Hopslam's hops are well balanced and complex. Pine, citrus, and earthier hops all make an appearance, and the alcohol can be felt on the way down and it is damn good. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy. Drinkability is outstanding, with the elegant flavor, perfect bitterness, and alluring appearance combing to make this one I just can't get enough of."
"Appearance: Glowing golden amber with a fluffy, soapy white head."
Of the thousands of people trying this I consider myself special getting an entire growler fill (felt I overpaid though spending 23.25 for the fill)
Got this one in trade from Another6pack.
"To start off, I think I should say that I like IPAs, but not a whole lot. A few have blown me away: Widmer Brothers Deadlift, Bell's Two Hearted, and Bell's HopSlam (of course, I've had maybe a dozen IPAs in my short beer life)."
"Batch number 10127, bottled on January 11th, just one week ago today. So, only a week old. Great."
"The elusive HopSlam, we finally meet again. It has been too long, since our last encounter and yet it is a new rendezvous as this is our first time in a bottle. Now, I divulge. "
"I have to admit that I was a little afraid of this beer. The name. The hype. The description of ""biting, bitter"" etc. . ."
"12oz bottle. Batch 10127. Bottled january 11, 2011. Poured into delirium tulip."
Let me preface this by saying that I had this with a 2010 Hopslam as well as a 2011 Sierra Nevada Hoptimum.
This years batch poured from the bottle into my DFH signature glass. Had this one a couple times before and I've loved it every time. The price sucks but the beer is great. 
Review 100!
Quite excited that our local beer bar The Beer Trappe had this on tap. Poured a nice bright orange/amber with a very soft and thick off white head that did not want to go away. Smell oh where to begin hops fruity citrus hops some pineapple and honey with a hint of alchohol. Taste is fantastic sweet upfront with fruity hops and honey followed by a small malt middle with plenty of hops to bite your tongue. Finishes dry and crisp with warming alchohol and a boat load of citrus and cut grass hops. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a nice body and well balanced carbonation. Drinkability is scary with this beer as it carries a 10 percent abv with it but is so delicious I kept wanting more...and did!
Batch 2011 10093
Hopslam's in town. Take a vacation day.
The 2011 Hopslam has a beautiful citrus nose. It is dry and hoppy but with a delightful hint of sweetness.
Odd to say but complex and simply great finish. 
I poured this 12 oz. bottle into a large wine glass.
"It smells like honey and hops, as opposed to just hops, which is a nice change of pace from other hopocalptic brews. Like the rest of this beer, the smell is not overbearing. "
2x 12 oz bottle poured into snifter. One bottle poured and drank at a time. Both bottles finished within an hour.
"Ahh. The first hopslam experience, lets see if the ridiculous hype is justified."

"A sweet, creamy, citrusy, balanced, supremely drinkable DIPA"
12 oz bottle served in a Goose Island IPA tulip
Wow what a drink. I never thought I would want a beer all the time until that is hopslam. i wish i could fall asleep with it and wake up to it. Even with its high gravity there is no alcohol flavor to it. I want this recipe to brew for myself and never look back so when in the off seasons i can grab me one and feel great again and not just disappointed that i have to stock up on it.
Starts out as an undeniably great looking beer: crystal-clear gold with a thick pillow of foam that looks like you could rest your head on it and take a nap. Great lacing is created as the foam patiently settles.
"Batch number 10101, brewed on January 4th, Consumed on January 16th. This is far and away the best DIPA iv'e ever had. I wish I had the palate to describe all the taste sensations and subtleties of this beer but I don't so I won't even try. It is however outstanding. Never was a huge fan of the IPA's but i think maybe this one will get me back in the game. awesome, awesome brew. This puts a new premium on securing some fresh pliny."
Beautiful golden color with a nice head and carbonation. Notes of hops all over the place with a complex body in the middle. The great thing about this beer is you can get a great hop experience without the bitterness and dryness of the hops at the end. The honey in this brew compliments the hops in a nice way.

"Case from Shangy's in Emmaus, PA @ 64.99 on this lovely day. 1st bottle cracked no longer than 2 minutes after I got it home. Batch 10101 from 1/4/11."
HopSlam is one of the best double IPA's around
"Crisp golden apple cider that strangely smells of feline urine and obscene hops. Can taste the 10 per cent and doesn't really work for me, but it is clean, crisp, and puckers the mouth...I love that. I could easily drink 4 in a sitting, but the hype and price are a let down."
"Thanks Andrewinski1 for giving me a bottle of this super fresh hop bomb! Poured into a tulip. The body is a golden honey color with just a bit of haze and about an inch of fluffy white head that retains pretty well and settles down to a thin layer of foam. This smells perfect. I want a cologne that smells like this. The aroma is kind of citrusy sweet with just a bit of honey in the aroma that blends nicely with grassy, piney, bitter hops. Outstanding dry aroma with just a touch of orange zest to round out the aroma. Really a dry flavor to this, with a sweet honey caramel undertone to the grassy hop flavor. The honey is balanced very nicely, adding only a touch of sweetness to this. Feels pretty good in the mouth, but as the bottle says, this is a tongue bruiser with easy carbonation and big hop flavor. Drinks nicely, I really wish I could get this one around these parts."
"Thanks to a great BA (browna71) for the chance to have this one super fresh! Poured into a tulip. Decent head on top of a nice caramel colored body. Pretty nice clarity to this one. Haze is very minimal. The head is very white, not too large, about one inch but the large bubbles tell me it won't last long. It does leave behind very sticky lacing."
"Batch # 10101.. bottled 10 days ago, VERY fresh! I've always been a huge fan of HopSlam, so I'm not being a prisoner of the moment w/ all the HopSlam hoopla, but the hype is real! 12oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a beautiful golden color, very bright. This one has a nice white fluffy head and very very sticky lacing; picture perfect!. Ok, this is definitely the best smelling beer I've come across, still to this day. This beer will stink up a room of hoppy goodness, honestly. Insanely pungent! Lots of fruity hops and berries. The taste is very bold and the honey is noticeable. Finishes with a warm burn; alchohol is noticeable, but is overpowered by the great flavors. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, not over carbonated, rich smooth, and very creamy; full-bodied. Drinkability is good at 10% abv, but the alcohol is noticeable."
"Picked up a fresh case on 1/13/11. Pours a thick sticky golden hue, very little head even with an aggressive finish to the pour. Smell is....unbelievable. Even on the end table a few feet from my seat I can smell a rich floral aroma of hops, hops, and more hops. Sweet malt balancing it out. Taste is...hops, hops, and more hops. But yet balanced. There is a lot of malty sweetness to this beer, I'm not sure when they add the honey in but it definitely does something to smooth this out more than any other DIPA I have tried. A total hop bomb, but yet balanced, a quandry that I choose to enjoy rather than dwell on. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky. Feels like it will chew the enamel off your teeth (in a good way). Drinkability is top notch. I'm not a major hop head, but even I could sip this all night long without batting an eye. Truly a work of art. The hype might be excessive, but this is certainly one of the finest beers in the world."
Pours a reddish copper color with a greenish hue when shown to the light. The head is minimal but a very interesting cirrus-cloud-like-head pattern appears a few minutes after the pour. Lacing is random and splotchy. 
Batch number 10115
Poured from a bottle bottled 1/5/11 into a Duvel tulip.
Batch 10115 ~ Bottled 1/11/11 ~ 3 Days Ago!
"Golden amber, transparent, not much head to speak of and some lacing to start off. The smell reminds me of a wet hopped ale. I believe I've heard its dry hopped with simcoe hops. Very citrusy with pineapple and piney notes. Very balanced beer for being so hoppy. I wonder when the honey used to make it was added. Medium mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. The alcohol is so well hidden, its dangerous. I could drink many in one sitting, but I have to play daddy tomorrow, so I'll take it easy for now. How could you not give it an A+?"

This is the first beer that I've felt the need to review...
Batch # 10094 - FRE$H 2011 Hopslam
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Batch #10101 Bottled on 1/4/11.
"Pours a translucent clear copper and dark golden color, with a frothy white head that lasts for a long time. Spiderweb lacing appear all around my glass."
This is a nice little treat that just arrived at el Bait Shop. It's a light copper color with a white foam that leaves some dense lacing. The aroma is notably hoppy with a touch of citrus. The taste is VERY good. A nice dose of hops with citrus and a touch of apple. The hops are prominent but not overbearing. This goes in the category of strong yet enjoyable. This is one that will please hop heads.
Had this on-tap at Pazzo's pizza pub for 3.95 for a pint. Great price considering the sixer goes for 18-20.
"Sampled from a fresh bottle first, but this is from a minikeg; poured it into a Duvel tulip."
A not quite 10oz gravity pour from a firkin into a Bell's tulip.
"A - Thick, fun, frothy head. Slightly hazy in it's golden colored goodness. Gold color was a lot like Black Hills Gold."
"A - Very crisp, clear light tangerine color with a large, thick, creamy, smooth looking white head with tiny bubbles. Pretty good retention leaving a thin, whispy lace."
12oz bottle poured into a DFH signature snifter. Got the sixer at Cairo Liquors for $20 (pretty good for DC supply/demand).
"Well, this just came in-LOL!"
Picked up a few cases of this today for trades and drinking!
"Heres another review of Hopslam, I've been exploring re-rating beers from different formats. It's very interesting. I gave the tap version a 4.75, this is lower in that it seems less open in smell and taste especially, a little more one Dimensional especially in the aroma. On tap its very open and huge in aroma and not out of the bottle. The taste is still great but not as good as on tap."
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.
"On draught, served in a pint glass two days after it's release."
This beer aches for me to grasp at my tastebuds and limited vocabulary.
Trying to stay away from the hype train here. Will be as unbiased as possible.

"I was so excited when my neighbor pulled this out of the fridge and was kind enough to share!!! Overall a delish beer - I am not a huge fan of IPAs or VERY hoppy beers, but this one was by far the best that I have tasted (compared to Surly Furious and Bell's Two Hearted....)"
WOW!!!
"Largely clear but vaguely hazy, golden orange, a finger or so of fluffy white foam that dissipates gradually, decent retention and patchy lacing. Good lookin' brew, but not amazing."
A - Slightly murky Gold-ish Amber color. Head is generous and white. A think soapy lace lines my english pint glass.
Just picked up a six pack the day it hit the shelves so this is as fresh as we in the Chicago area can get it! 
Batch 10093 - poured into a tulip
"Pours a lighter than expected golden yellow with two fingers worth of beautiful, fluffy slightly off-white head that leaves nice lacing. Smells are grapefruit, pineapple, floral hops, a little spiciness and a little heaven. Tastes are hops, citrus a touch of pine and a hint of honey. There's some drying going on toward the end followed by a bitter finish. This beer is so balanced for being a huge DIPA, the bitterness is there but it's not so overwhelming that it makes it hard to drink. Mouthfeel is great, it's syrupy but the carbonation makes it seem lighter than it really is. Drinkability is out of this world, I can't even taste the 10% ABV. I love this beer, it's one of my favorites for sure, and the fact that they put it in 6 packs instead of bombers is great."
Bought a six pack pretty much off the truck. Poured into my favorite tulip. 
From 12 oz bottle poured into tulip style glass. According to Bell's website this batch was packaged on 1/3/11
12oz bottle poured into tulip
"Hopslam, concocted by god, put in six packs by the devil. This is no ordinary beer, this isn't even an ordinary DIPA. Utterly extraordinary in every way, Hopslam is legendary in its ability to floor even the most able beer drinkers. The secret is its ability to combine the purest, most potent hop flavor with an exceptional drinkability. Each Hopslam you drink goes down smooth as silk while tasting like a godly nectar, but once your glass is empty (which happens far too quickly), you yearn for another. No other brew makes it so hard to stop while being so incredibly potent, at 10%. Deadlier than the jungle juice at a frat party, the love this drink instills must be balanced by respect for what it can do, or you'll end up drinking four before you know it, leaving you in quite a state of inebriation that you never planned for. Seek hopslam out while you can, but don't approach lightly. You will not be the same after you drink it, and the yearlong wait for another batch has destroyed stronger men than myself."
"Pours out to a golden color hue that has a thick white creamy head that has very good retention, really great lacing and good carbonation. The smell is hops, sweet honey, citrus all well blended together giving a pleasant aroma that makes you want to take a drink. The taste is a nice honey taste followed by some floral hops and in the middle is the citrus tastes of grapefruit,orange and lemon. The ending taste has some hop bitterness and grapefruit aftertaste like many IPA's, but doesn't have the too strong of bitterness land hop aftertaste like Bell's Two Hearted Ale does. I know this is a double IPA and is stronger than a regular IPA, but this is really nicely balanced in taste and even though can taste some alcohol near the end, it isn't too strong to ruin it. The mouthfeel is a nice creamy smooth feel that has a pleasant feel on the lips and a clinging bite to the tongue and how can a beer this good not be easily drinkable? This is by far the best IPA or double IPA I ever had very highly recommended."

"If you said to me ""What is the perfect beer?"" I would say HOPSLAM."
"12oz bottle American Double Imperial IPA with date stamp 12-29-10 on the case. Acquired two six-packs from my LBS at $25.99/6-pack (ripoff but wanted my hands on some!). Poured a dark golden/light red amber hue appearance. Leaves very nice lace, although the foam head thins out very quickly. Smells of sweet hops and hints of honey. Very dangerously drinkable and quickly became one of my favortie Imperial IPAs where the sweet malt sits in your mouth rather than leaving a bitter taste off the top of your tongue. I feel like it's a combination of Pliny's smell, but a sweeter pine taste with Dreadnaught's maltiness and mouthfeel. Two thumbs up for this one!"
"had it on tap today at slows bbq, served in a goblet, and got a free bells button with it, went with a fellow BA"
Live review of a 12 oz bottle from batch 10093.
"A - Deep, rich bronze with a finger high head of white foam which sticks all over the side of my glass."
Appearance- There was very little head (due to the bar tender) The rest of the beer is a deep dark orange color. 
This is a beauty! Many thanks to tat2dhllblly for this!
"This is a great beer that everyone should try! It has an amazing aromma! Even better when you let it age for some time! I have two bottles ill let go for a few years then go back and try to see if it changes much! Great job Bells keep it up...and make more of it, for longer!"
"A-dark amber, good amount of white head"
"Poured on tap at local bar into a chalice. Citrus aroma to the max. It was dark inside so I could not judge the color and appearance well. One of the cleanest, hoppiest beers I have ever tasted. Excellent. "
"A - murky, burnt orange color; 2 inch thick cream off white head; really sticky lacing the entire time"
"Another review that slipped through the cracks. Reviewed from notes. Poured from a bottle marked ""Batch 9552"" which was bottled on january 18, 2010. Consumed January 27, 2010. Poured into a Dogfish head pint glass..."
"If I could review this beer with one word, it would be ""Sweetjesus!"""
"Pours a nice golden color that is a bit hazy. Has a Small head that dissipates quickly leaving just a little bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is hops. Tons of hops and a bit of citrus. Smells great. The taste is very hoppy, and I love it. The hops are very present, there is a little bit of citrus, and then the alcohol comes in a little bit at the finish. I was surprised the alcohol was so masked since its 10%. The mouthfeel was good. This beer had nice carbonation, a medium body, and left a nice lingering bitterness. I could drink these quite often. I really love this beer. Bells did a great job on this one. I hope I find some more very soon. Cheers."
A- It's a cloudy gold color small head that leaves quickly and leaves just a little lacing.
Appearance - Pours to a Golden Goodness with a very nice frothy head. Once settled in remains a nice 1-1/2in head in my standard Pint glass with a likable cloudiness. 
"One of my favorite beers of all time! I have had it many times out of the bottle but was lucky enough to have cask recently. Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit all the way throughout the tasting. Sweet and sticky mouthfeel with a sweet honey finish. Hazy orange appearance with a smell of sweet hoppy citrus. Overall an amazing offering from Bells. I will be stocking up come january."
"Draft and bottle on numerous occasions but for this review, draft. Pours a very nice looking amber color with a nice 1 finger white head. Good lace already. Nice floral and citrus rind hop aromas in the nose. Slightly sweet up front mostly I would think from the honey and then there is a strong hop presence on your tongue. Citrus rind, grapefruit and a touch of pine. Nice medium mouthfeel. When fresh this is one of the best IPA's around."
"I wish I could have this on tap. It is very delicious, but like Pliny, out of the tap is way better. What can I say though. Hopslam is good, but I always compare my happiness of Pliny to it and it takes a second every time. I will continue to buy it and love it, but hate the once a year thing"
"This beer is not for the weak of tongue. Intensely hoppy with out being over the top If you are gonna invest in the price of a six pack (near 20 bucks) you had better like hops, but for those of you who do its worth the price. One of many brilliant beers bt Bell's Brewery, pride of Michigan."
"12oz bottle, batch 9478 poured into a Nonic pint glass."
"This is one of the better IPAs available. Hoppy as all get out, as the description notes, but near perfectly balanced by the honey. The result is a clean drinking, aggressively hopped IPA with strong citrus notes and an underlying but non-cloying sweetness. "
Review from BeerAdvocate magazine Vol. II Issue VIII:
"Poured from a bottle into an oversized snifter. Pours a honey-amber color, with a soapy white head providing excellent lacing on the sides. This bottle is about six months old or so, so I'm curious to see if the hops have mellowed at all. "
"Many bottles over the years, here are my notes from two different batches:"
"Finally got my hands on some of this lovely beer! Pours a clear golden bronze with 2 finger white head. Smell is heavy on the citus hops, with a sweet grapefruit kick. Taste is very similar with a sweet, almost candi sugar like malt and citric backbone. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth as silk going down. Overall an amazing beer and as so many others have said the abv is well hidden!"
A: Clear amber color with a 2 finger head.
"A - pours a crisp orange color, with a 1/2"" head that quickly disipates to just a slight covering. Great lacing with every sip."
Notes taken from tasting at eccentric cafe 8-23. Finally a chance to review one of the great Imperial IPAs
"I had a six pack and managed to keep one for four years in my basement. The difference between a fresh one and an aged one is more than daylight and dark. It was a differnt beer altogether. A- poured with a steady hand it is a medium copper and clear as a bell. S- too many aromas to list. Hops are still present but greatly diminished. Lots of wine and meadlike aromas. Tons of pear and appley esters, a little yeast, malt flavor has been replaced by fruit and honey. T- same as aroma. Lots of honey, pear, apple, a little citris, some tropical fruit, white wine, virtualy no malt, mineraly yeasty, old and vinios. M- thin and wll attenuated with a pleasent med-low carbonation. Tiny champaign bubbles. D- I'd drink it till I die. A beer ment to be consumed fresh that just happens to become liquid magic after a few years rest."
This could possibly be my personal all-time favorite beer!
On tap at the Eccentric Cafe.
On tap in my garage ;-).
"Got a bottle from Patchmaster, thanks!"
The local liquor store had a sign posted when I went in today that offered a few remaining cases of hopslam. All you had to do was ask. The batch was from 2009 based on the # so I knew it was passed it's peak prime. I went ahead and got a sixer just to see the difference. I had off a keg earlier in the year at a brewfest so knew what I was getting into.
I've been lucky enough to enjoy this delicious beer on-tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor for the third time in the last two weeks. 
Edit: 
12 ounce bottle. 
"Thanks to Eric and Doug for this one as part of a trade. Clear yellow-orange pour with quickly fading head and decent lacing. Really huge and bold, floral, perfumy, citrusy nose with a hint of caramel malt. The taste is also huge with the mouth puckering citrus hitting you from start to finish. With that said, it's very well balanced. Really nice resiny, chewy mouthfeel makes this highly drinkable and the alcohol is completely hidden. This could be dangerous. Expected it to be somewhat subdued since it's out of season, but was pleasantly surprised by how big it still was. Can't imagine what a fresh one would be like. First non West Coast IPA that just blew me away. Totally awesome beer from a top notch brewery."
Poured from 12oz bottle into Tulip. This is my intial review from the very first time I had Hopslam. Extremely fresh in January 2010.
Reviewed from notes.
Split the hopslam with hu5om in a new belgium goblet.
"Bells Hopslam poured an amber color, with a nice head that dispated rather quickly. It smelt and tasted of alot of hops, and a dash of honey. It waas extremly flavorfull, and full of flavor. Overall an absoultly fantastic beer. If you like hoppy beers, this will be a favorite."
split with e11a627 in New Belgium goblets.
A: a nice translucent amber pour with a dense thick head.
"from 12 oz bottle: hop aroma hits you as soon as you pop the cap. piney smells at first give way to strong tropical fruits (predominantly pineapple) as it poured into my duvel glass. tasting it showed that this is incredibly smooth for a 10% beer, and though there are notes of a variety of familiar hop flavors, the pineapple overwhelms (not that that's a bad thing). I don't know what hop variety that comes from but I love it. "
Awesome. Drinking a 2010 and 2009 side by side.
Picked up a glass at for petes sake...
I am aware that this beer is brewed in January and that I am drinking this beer on June 29 so some of the aroma and flavor will probably have faded. Keep that in mind as you read my review.
Lucky enough to get this brew in a trade!
"Tons of sweet hoppy flavor on the front with a very citrusy finish. I do not want to suck down 26 of these in a night, but I do want to have one every day after work. Excellent beer. I don't like most of Bell's labels, but this one is impeccable. Tough to find, but worth the wait."
A: a two finger head is poured with a rocky and creamy texture. the color is a cloudy gold that looks god damn delicious. heavy lacing coats all sides of the glass. 
"Pours an amber color with some life and a white soapy head. Has an aroma of grapefruit with subtle hints of pine with the honey coming through on the nose. Sweet and spicy up front, malty and bitter on the back end. You can taste the honey. Has a decent carbonation level. I think the honey on the finish puts this off a touch for me. But very good DIPA nonetheless."
"Poured into a RR glass...doesn't seem right, but it's my favorite glass. Beautiful orange/amber color with nice frothy white head. Smells of...I hate to say it...but cat piss...with a bit oh honey. The taste is AMAZING though! Up front sweetness from the honey and such an outstanding balance to this one. Not very bitter at all, as the honey and malts overpower the hops a bit (to make such a unique balance). Not what I'm used to with my typical west coast IPAs. This has a very smooth and chewy mouthfeel with a strong malt/honey taste left along the palate. Amazing beer with incredible drinkability for such high ABV. The alcohol is hidden PERFECTLY in this beer."
Served in a Devil's Backbone willibecher.
"A: Pours a perfect clear golden yellow, w/ an extremely creamy and thick white head. Leaves excellent lacing patterns as consumed. Maintains head very well."
Poured into a glass from a 12oz bottle. The bottle was aged for about 6 months.
This is honestly one of my favorite super-hop style ales. I originally tried it on tap at Mellow Mushroom in Tampa and was immediately blown away. I've since bought several cases...just to be on the safe side. ;-}
"I was sure I rated this, I drank enough of it but I'm over a year behind transferring my tasting notes to this rating site. For some reason this didn't taste as good as it did the first time I tried it, but it's still pretty good. "
12oz bottle poured into my New Belgium globe.
"I'd been waiting for this one for a while, and had a bottle that had been saved for four months by a friend. It was definitely worth it--this is a classic citrus fruit hop-bomb of an American DIPA with a mellow honey touch that tones down the bitterness and amps up the sweetness and floral character enough to keep it interesting and pretty unique so far as I know. I suspect the honey gets stronger as the beer ages a bit--next year hopefully I'll get to try both a slightly fresher bottle and this lovely aged version."
"I am a big IPA fan and I feel that this is one you have to get your hands on. Obviously, it has a huge amount of hops but it has enough of a citrus note to dull down some of the bitterness and add a bit more complexity to the beer. Perfect porch beer on a summer day."
"Recieved this as an extra, thanks!"
"This a strong, hoppy beer. The ones I had most recently were 4 months old and some of the initial strong nose of hops was gone, but the bitter was still in it. I love how creamy this beer is. That leads to it's only one drawback. At 10 percent alcohol, it is best not to crack open too many of these all at one sitting. Not that I speak from experience or anything. I'm just sayin'..."
"The second, and last, bottle that I brought back from Capone's with me when I was in the Philly area."
Poured from a fresh 2010 batch.
Damn!!
Poured into a pint glass.
"Tasted from a twelve ounce bottle. Pours a beautiful light amber orange with a white, one-finger head. Surprise, surprise, the aroma is very hoppy with orange peel and orange blossom, some vanilla, and other white flower aromas. The front of the palate features the orange flavors, and is lightly honeyed. On the mid-palate, the honeyed characteristic continues, but there is also a biscuit flavor. On the back of the palate, the hoppy bitterness kicks in with the orange peel, but it is also quite nice with the vanilla flavor. The beer is full-bodied and coats the entire palate with a long finish. Overall, this is a great IPA. It is super balanced, I can hardly believe that it is ten percent alcohol. It is very hoppy, but even those flavors are perfectly integrated."
"On tap at Underground Bluz. Bell's is a brewery that offers very good beers while taking risks on unique formulas as well (Cherry Stout, for example). This is one of their best. And it just so happens to be in my favorite style."
"A- Big-bubbled white headiness over a typical IPA colored body, with a very active carbonation profile. A universe of motion inside."
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a duvel tulip&gt;
Great extra from mikesgroove. Thanks!
"Despite what some say, this beer is available well beyond January, I just bought some last week at Discount Liquors in Milwaukee and my brother just had some on tap in AZ a few weeks before that. Furthermore, El Bait Shop in Des Moines indicated they had just run out of a keg 2 weeks ago. "
"This precious liquid is only available for a few glorious days in January. As soon as it hits the shelves I buy up as much as I can find/afford, but it's never enough. Larry Bell must be some kind of wizard: Hopslam's amazing balance of hops and honey seems the result of alchemy, and making 10% ABV disappear can only be described as magic. It doesn't get any better than this."
"Bottle from Crown Liquors #6 - Pours a clear, golden/amber with a wispy white head. Aroma is pine and resin with some citrus. Taste is resin, honey, and bready malt sweetness with hints of floral/perfume hops. Mouthfeel is frothy with some oil and warmth."
"Pours golden, clear with nice sized head, and slow carbonation. Smells wonderful. Grapefruit strong presence, sticky, organic aroma fills the nose. Tastes even better than it smells. NICE hoppy bitterness up front, with a touch of sweetness, and a good malt backbone to finish. finishes smooth, bitter, and dry all at once. sticky medium to thick mouthfeel. ABV well masked. highly drinkable. ZING!"
"Bottle, had a bit ago, but I kept good notes!"
A- Mid to darker golden. Lacing aplenty. Head has stayed for pretty much the whole glass down.
"Bought a single of this a while back, and just found some tasting notes, thought I'd plug'em in..."
"Poured a dark amber color with an active carbonation and rich head. I smelled hops as soon as the beer hit the glass. A very pungent and strong smell, not like many others (perhaps Ruination rivals this). Taste was even to me like a bomb of bitterness. Wow! Hits the pallette with crazy piney and grassy bitterness. Next you gte some sweetness trying to balance to frontal attack of the hops, but it doesn't last long. The hop taste lasts for many, I mean many minutes. Not for the faint of heart, or for those that don't crave this taste and sensation. Mouthfeel was very full and satisfying. Drinkability? Not sure I would drink more than one or two due to the intense flavors, but what an experience."
"Received in trade from StormKing47, thanks Josh!"
Drank HopSlam and DL '10 in the same day... Can it really get any better (the answer is no)...
12 oz bottle poured into pint glass
Had the very good fortune to taste this beer on tap at The Porter on Atlanta. I'm told that kegs outside of Kalamazoo are pretty rare.
Bell's HopSlam pours a dark orange with a solid foamy head. holy head! it's sticky and lasts nearly to the bottom.
aggressive pour only gives a one finger head that doesn't linger. translucent orange color with decent lacing down glass
"12oz bottle through trade (thanks Grant!), poured into my Duvel tulip."
"ohhh boy, now that is what i call a beer. pours a copper yellow color, that is slightly hazy. lite carbonation with a bit of fluffy white head. the smell and taste of this beer is fantastic. very fruity-hoppy smell and taste that finishes slightly bitter. easliy a top five favorite beer."
A: Moderate pour yields 1/2 finger of white head with okay retention. A thin layer remains. Slightly hazy amber liquid. I'd like better head retention.
"The ale is an auburn orange color with a thick 1 finger head. The head is not too impressive by leaves a bit of lacing in the glass. The aroma is a big, sweet piney hop. The fruity aroma of the hops are big and bold, leaving exciting hints of things to come. The hops leap off the tastebuds like a harvest ale. They are so fresh-tasting and intense that words almost fall short in describing them. The hops are very fruity, with tangerine and apricot flavors and a strong piney presence. The hop bitterness is intense upfront and rarely fades in the mouth. The malts are not meant to stand out here and they don't. They do, however, provide a strong grainy foundation for the hops to shine. This ale is why the good Lord made humulus lupulus. The mouthfeel is unlike most other DIPAs. The hops are do fresh, vibrant and intense that they are delicious from first sip to last."
"Pours a deep, slightly amber golden with a nice sticky ivory head that leaves equally sticky lacing. "
"12oz bottle, goblet, coded 9552 on the bottom of the rear label. Huge thank you to farrago for making my first trade awesome."
"Aroma - Tons of hops. Citrus and pine and maybe more citrus, just keeps going and going."
12 oz bottle.
A: golden color with a small head that is gone quickly.
"Pours a beautiful deep, dark, golden color, with a huge rocky eggshell colored head. Beautiful aromas of mango, citrus (grapefruit, tangerine) and bright, fresh floral hops. Great fresh hop flavors in this one, predominantly grapefruit/pineapple. This one has more citric hop flavor than any beer I remember. Some sweet malt as well, along with mango/papaya, leads to a nice, warming alcoholic finish. I was not actively seeking this one out, although I have never been more surprised (in a good way) by a beer. An absolutely amazing beer."
"a- bottle poured into a snifter, full finger of creamy head that fades slowly, hazy copper amber coloring, uneven lace pattern with head that trails on the glass with a ring around the glass, active bubbling."
A: golden color with light head that seems to disappear quickly.
"Had on draft. Pours a beautiful, slightly hazy honey amber with a nice white head. Decent head retention and nice lacing."
"App: Golden, honey-colored, with the typical Bell's flotsam in the glass."
Thanks to hayesez for this!
"Reviewed from notes about a week old from my Wisconsin trip. The myth, the legend. Poured from the bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint."
deep gold on this guy coming our of the firkin. a bit of haze mars the viewing pleasure but the froth up there is tight and NICE
"A: Transparent and effervescent, this beer is mostly yellow with hints of orange, reminiscent of a sunrise. There is a moderate level of head and lacing."
"Been finishing a six pack I picked up while in Florida for spring break, its interesting to see how quickly this beer has changed in the month I'd had them."
Batch 9470
"Had this beer on tap at The Stem & Stein in Madison, AL. It was from a very fresh keg. I was surprised at how good it is. "
A huge thanks to RocPorterFanatic (Chad) for hooking me up with a 6 pack! Bottle #9478.
12oz. bottle poured into a tulip.
A-Poured into a glass created about 1/2 inch head of fairly dense foam leaving scattered lacing around the glass.
"Reviewed from my notes, based on a bottle provided by sigma23 and also split with deltatauhobbit. It has a pretty golden color and a thin, white, bubbly head. The clear body lets me see all sorts of rising and clinging carbonation. It has a big sweet citrus aroma. I taste woodsy hops up front. The hops in the finish are all bitter. There is just a hint of the 10% ABV. It's hard to believe this is a double IPA. The finish is very dry, which is pleasant. The amount of coating is as expected. The body is heavier and carbonation lighter that I thought it would be. All of this makes it so drinkable. I might get knocked over if I have too many, but the alcohol taste will never become a limiting factor, it's just too subtle. The same goes for the bitterness. It's not subtle, but it's never overpowering. The hops are perfectly balanced."
12 oz bottle probably about 8 months old. Pours hazy dark gold with very little head. Aroma of honey and lavender. Incredibly sweet caramel and honey flavor followed by an almost stinging bitter finsh. Medium body with quite a bit of activity on the tongue. Very complex and almost reminiscent of a west coast barley wine. Would love to taste it fresh. ABV is hidden extremely well!
"Pours a nice, off-white foamy head. Glass is covered in beautiful lacing and the beer itself is a crisp golden color with moderate carbonation. Visually, it's pretty unique for a DIPA."
Had this on tap at 1702 in Tucson.
"Thanks VanillaMike for hooking me up with a bottle. I tried this just a few weeks after trying Pliny the Elder for the first time. I can see why BAs love comparing the two beers, because they are among the top hoppy beers on the market. I can't say I liked one more than the other because they are both superb. The honey in the HopSlam provides a subtle sweetness but does not take away from the citrus and pine notes that one craves in a hopped-up beer. I live in New England, and HopSlam cannot be found any closer than PA, so I am glad I got to try this excellent beer. It went well with some beer brats, onions, and peppers (all cooked in pale ale) by the highly underrated beer chef chowdahead."
"Orange tinted gold color similar to honey of a sort. Thick and frothy head that I would call at least a centimeter thick. It clings to the glass some, but not all that stubbornly. The hops dominates the nose, but there is certainly a sweetness to it as well. Sweet and light, really. Perhaps a bit of honey? Very hoppy attack and flavor, but not really a bitter beer. I guess its consistent with the DIPA style. The finish smoothes out with a little sweetness that I would swear it wildflower honey. The aftertaste allows the punch of the hops to shine. The mouthfeel is on the thick side, which is to be expected for the style. I would say that the flavors are more interesting than they are drinkable. I enjoyed it, but its probably its unique nature that grabs me more than thinking ""I need to keep a case of this on hand."" Not an everyday beer. A special occasion type."
"Picked up at the 4 Winds Market in Pensacola, FL"
Thanks to Abrand for this one!!!
Pours a hazy light copper with a thin white head. Lots and Lots of Hops in the aroma. Citrus and Floral with a slight pine undertone. Aroma carries over into the flavor with a nice malty sweetness that almost balances it out. This beer is still a little on the extreme hoppy side for me. Medium mouthfeel with a bitter finish.
"12oz. bottle (Batch 9478, Bottled December 23rd, 2009) poured into my Bell's tulip glass..."
"Paid only $11.99 for a growler at Party Town in Florence, KY!"
"Many thanks to jdefont for this, he threw it in as a trade bonus. What a guy!"
A - Clean amber with thin white head.
"A- Deep golden bronze/brushed brass color, with soft slow floating large carbonation rising up through glass after pour. Nice 2 1/2 fingers of creamy white head, gradually lays down as a pleasant pillow on the beer...leaves significant lacing on glass."
"I am not a fan of hoppy beers, so I have no idea why I thought I would like this. Way too sweet for my tastes, way too hoppy, and the alcohol content just makes it even harder for me to swallow down gulp after gulp. Fine beer, but I won't be spending the money for it again."
First let me give a big thank you to klevelandrocks for an awesome trade with great extras. 
Pours a nice amber color with a slight head that manages to maintain a little lacing.
"I can't contribute any more than what's already been said about this beer, but it is truly a great beer. The hop aroma and flavor is where this shines. A great blend of citrus, although I detect more on the orange side of things in my batch. This was the first year I've had this so I can't say if this is normal/abnormal for this beer. "
"a-pretty enough to make you want to drink it. not too much carbonation, but you can feel the bubbles. it looks great."
12 ounce bottle poured into a 12 ounce brandy snifter.
"Bought a growler filled with this nectar of the gods at Roof Brother's Spirits in Paducah, Kentucky. We promptly finished the entire growler in one evening. :P"
"A - Light orange, kinda yellowish color, nice to look at for sure, one of the prettiest beers I've seen"
First review.
"Purchased this growler fill from Roof Bros. in Paducah, KY. "
"A - Poured a light orange/yellow colour with a thick, foamy white head that stuck around for a while and then slowly dissipated. "
"A- Gently poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, I learned from the last Hopslam to pour slow. Nice foamy white head, the beer is a straw colored gold with lots of tiny bubbles streaming from the bottom and after a few drinks some nice lacing."
Pours a light golden amber in a snifter. Has a one finger head that disappeared quickly. Left a good retention along glass.
Obtained through a trade with StormKing47. Bottle into my Lost Abbey tulip.
"HopSlam is a very nice combination of flavors. Instantly you notice the extreme hoppy character and then it mellows off into a sweeter honey flavor. I compair all IPA's to Dogfish 90 min, as being from Milton, DE that is the standard. It would be a nice compliment to a 90 min. Slightly hoppier than the 90 min. and a lot sweeter ending. Overall a very drinkable beer, and I enjoyed every drop."
"A: Clear, bright, golden orange. Very small off white head that fades quickly. Lots of tiny bubbles."
Served from a bottle into a snifter.
"This beer is absolutely amazing. It is like a summer day of hard work away from a water hole and the skies began to rain down juicy fruits and sweet nectar! This beer is just dripping with fresh juice of mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. One of the most beautiful well rounded beers I have ever tried. Drink it fresh though because whenever it gets a little bit of age on it those hops start to go fast. Drink up and cheers!"
Bought this at Hawthornes in the Bella Vista section of Philly.
Had this one on tap at Thomas House. 
A: Golden orange with a small white head
"It's in my top 5 beers I've ever had, I must say..."
"Beautiful amber color with a medium head, good head retention and lacing."
12oz bottle poured into a tulip. No Freshness date listed but it just arrived in a trade Saturday so I'm drinking it as fresh as I possibly can. From notes 03/09/10.
12oz btl poured into Bass pint glass.
"A: Poured into a snifter it yielded a small, wispy head. Beautiful golden color with a slight amber tinge."
I can't believe I haven't reviewed this beer yet...
"Bottle thanks to jprime! Nice clear gold pour with a very thin white head. A long ton of hops, floral hops and pepper, the honey comes out as a kind of coughdrop-like medecine aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma with honey and tons of hops. It is very good, though it might be a little too extreme on hops for me. Stands out of the lot, I'm glad I could try this one Jeff!"
"After trailing Hopslam throughout the Chicago Area for about a month, I finally ran into at the bar next door to the bar I work at. I was shocked - it had been there the for weeks and I had no idea. I guess that's what I get for not going to see my friends who work there often enough. Anyhow, the one session I was able to have there, I got...well...a bit out of hand. I didn't realize that it was a 10%er. Fortunately, I found a six pack at my local grocery store and had the opportunity to come home and review it under far more responsible circumstances."
"This beautiful beer is the best thing that has ever come out of Michigan. The color, taste and smell are what makes this beer one of the best I have ever had. Even though it has a high ABV it is still one of the smoothest beer that you can try. Highly recommend to the amatuer just getting into stronger with more taste beers."
"A: Beautiful fine, amber-honey tone, hints of red with a syrupy, small head. "
A - Hazy orangish/amber with a nice foamy head. Good retention and sticky lacing on the sides.
First time to try it today. Truly an exceptional beer! 
"I had the opportunity to taste (on FEB 2010) a one year old (2009) Hopslam next to a fresh (2010) Hopslam. And tested in the new Samuel Adams beer snob glasses to boot. Wow. What a difference. The 2009 had been stored dark, cool (cellar) and was VERY GOOD. BUT contrasted with the FRESH Hopslam it was considerably mellower with a smoother body, lower head and was of a flatter carbonation. The fresh Hopslam had a face slapping citrus bouquet and from the first sip it had a sharp and stringent smack of grapefruit right into the aftertaste. Wonderfully enjoyable for hopheads BUT maltbellies would be very disappointed. I think I've finally found a breakfast champagne beer to challenge my current choice of the clean and crisply carbonated Birra Moretti (urp). Here's to Bells!"
"Acquired this from 321jeff as a gift for having a son. No Strings attached, what at guy. Thanks Jeff for hooking me up with such a wonderful beer. "
Big thanks to Brian for bringing a case of this back to share from his recent trip. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a generic wide mouth tulip. Batch #9502
"First had this year's version on tap about a month ago at Tyler's in Apex, NC so the appearance rating is from then. That was the first time I've been able to try this beer and I enjoyed it enough that I went on a search for it and was lucky enough to score a couple of cases. I'm halfway through a case and am drinking one out of a bottle as I write this. Smooth with a nice sweet aftertaste. Slight, sweet citrus smell. This is an IPA that I could drink this every day if I could find it. Just great."
"got this beer in a recent trade from lerxst. thanks for this one big time, really enjoyed."
"Drawn from a firkin at Macniven's, on 2/25/10. Served in a tulip. Reviewed from tasting notes. "
"Had this on tap at City Bev in town. Poured into a Chimay goblet. Great bright orange color with a large frothy white head on top. Great retention; left lots of sticky lace globs. Scents of sweet candy, orange and lemon zest, pine, booze, etc. This smells as good as ever!"
"The initial thing that hits you is the aroma. There is a strong ester of mango as soon as you pour this ale into your glass. That aroma only intensifies as the beer airs. However, there is no mistaking the strong scent of alcohol also. Not surprising, considering the 10% abv of this American Double IPA. "
"Pours a orange-yellow amber with a light white head. The aroma is full of floral and hoppy scents. Taste was actually different from the aroma. It started off sweet, like honey, but then the hops started to kick in as it went down. The alcohol isn't that strong, could barely taste it. Kind of surprising for a 10% ABV. Good thickness and carbonation. Since the alcohol wasn't that strong, I would almost recommend this as an anytime beer. But due to price and the 10% ABV, i'll back down a tiny bit."
"I've been tearing through a case of these for the better part of two weeks, so I figured it's time to write a review. Review comes from dinner on Sat, Feb 27. Poured from bottle into standard pint glass. "
Pours to a honey color with a decent head that remains throughout.
Poured from 12 oz. bottle
"I had this beer at a restaurant, poured into a pilesner glass from a bottle. It is an orangy amber color with a nice white head."
"Review from notes. Enjoyed last night from tap into a standard pint glass at Ballantines in Willoughby as a part of their ""IPAlooza"" program (28 IPA's in 28 days)."
Thanks Greg for the bottle.
Served in Pint glass at Shallo's (from notes)
12 oz bottle. 
poured 12 ounce in duvel tulip
"A: Pours a slightly hazy golden-amber color with about a finger of fluffy white head. The head dissipated a little fast than I would have liked, though. Lots of sticky lace on the sides of the glass. "
On Tap @ The POPE
Pour - a beautiful shade of orangish auburn with some bright hues and a big fluffy white head. Looks fairly innocent although it pours a bit viscous.
"A - A bright yet slightly hazy golden honey body...a big, fluffy white head that never really leaves...lacing sticks to the side of the glass in sheets"
C. Clear
Nice fluffy white head that stays around for a while. The beer is a darker shade of golden.
Received from mreusch in a trade.
Acquired this from beerbeerbeerbeer so a big THANK YOU goes out to him!
"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter. I have been anticipating this beer for quite some time, so here we go. "
"I poured into a pint glass to a small off white head. It is gold and clear. I smell pineapple. I love it. The taste is juniper, pineapple, and booze. This is the best IIPA that I have had. The first one I had I didn't know what to make of it. This is my second time having it this season, and I really like this beer. Three or four of these beers would have me feeling real good!"
Batch 9552.
"I had this at the Gerst Haus on tap. In a fishbowl, this left minimal lacing. Typical deep golden color. Floral smell. Taste is somewhat sweet, I'm actually thinking of the fruit taste more than I am noticing the hops. Overall I was relatively unimpressed. This was a good beer, but for what I payed I could have gotten way more buzzed on the Hausbrew!"
Pours orange with a thick white head with good lacing
11 oz tap pour into a snifter at Uncle Mike's in Kenosha.
I just found a lil store by the house that has a great selection of craft beer and if they don't have they will get it.
I've had Hopslam a number of times but was never impressed - mostly due to the freshness. I'm finally sitting down to a nice fresh pint.
"Knew this was rare, but witnessing the want of this is unbelievable. People lined in DROVES at beer fests and reservations were needed at every store that would carry it, haha. Anyway:"
"Appearance - A clear amber/orange coloring with an ample head forming upon pour. Head retains for many minutes after the pour, with lacing begining to form as I watch (and smell) this offering. I fine carbonation feeds the head, allowing the robust head to continue for a fair bit. "
"This inviting brew pours a very pale orange color when held up to the light. There is a slight haze to it, but otherwise, it's pretty clear. Head has settle to a thin lace with some areas of bubbles. Good head retention, especially for being so high in alcohol."
Appearance: Nice orangish golden color with good sized head.
"I've been drinking this beer for about three years now, but i had it on tap last evening, Any beer on tap in my experienvce is always stronger or fresher or the two. "
"Came a rich golden yellow, almost honey-like, with little head. The pint though laced nicely. The nose had sweet honey and a strong amount of hop. Upon the first sampling no alcoholic character was evident, although it did show up over time, with a rich sweet malty backbone. Rolled beautifully across the palate, leaving a bitter finish that was subdued due to the sweetness. Excellent body and balance. Worth the buzz."
Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.
"Ap: Golden-bronze, honey-in-a-glass/meadlike appearance"
"I got this from Dunt in a BIF. It is honey gold in color with a 2 finger white head, lots of lace. The aroma is full of sweet juicy hops, honey, and pine. The taste is sweet pine with some grapefruit up front. The honey lends a very nice sweetness that balances out the hops. Hopslam is medium in body and very smooth, the alcohol is not noticeable. A very tasty DIPA."
Appearance: Has a beautiful pale amber color that is very clear. Has a nice head that provided some decent lacing. 
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.
"Hopslam, Hopslam, Hopslam. We've heard so much about you over the last months. Your production, being limited, makes you a rare commodity even before you hit the marketplace. It gives your fans that extra little bit of satisfaction knowing that they hold in their steins, their goblets, their Solo cups a delicious, golden slice of ""Hop Heaven""(no relation to the beer) that can only be quaffed, but once a year. "
"Had this great beer in the bottle and on draft at the Flying Saucer in Charlotte, NC"
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a large snifter. Pours a radiant golden orange/yellow color, like the color of raw honey. Large white head grows and then dies, leaving decent lacing clingy to the glass for dear life. Decent appearance. Initial smell is inviting...hoppy bitterness, citrusy sweetness and pine and citrus hops all dominate. Amazing smell. The taste virtually lives up to the nose. It is super hoppy, nice and bitter and warming. The lack of maltiness is a nice change from some other brews. This beer doesn't need it to balance it out, it is just plain delicious on its own. The grapefruit and citrus reign supreme on my taste buds. Honeydew and honey dance gingerly on my palate. Mmmm. A decent body and well hidden alcohol content make this beer very drinkable. A truly great beer."
"I had this on tap in St Louis at a pizza joint. It poured beautifully with about an 1.5' of head with OK lacing. The smell was hops, pine, and citirus and lasted well after the initial few sips. It really had a wonderful aroma that lasted well through the first half of the pint. Taste was close to smell - citrus and hops with a clean dry finish. It did not have a strong alcohol taste familiar with lesser IPAs and that would normally tire the pallet. It was a well carbonated beer with good drinkability. The pine/citrusy taste would be a little over-powering after more than a couple. "
12oz bottle from Hop City in Atlanta.
"A: Hop Slam is a deep, dark gold color, there's a hefty mass of thick head and lots of spotty lacing down the side of the glass, significant carbonation is visible in the beer - 4.50, S: Solid punch of citric hop aromas, lots of grapefruit and a bit of pine, there's a thick sweetness on the nose that reminds me of pineapple and cherimoya, a hint of what I perceive as honey - 5.00, T: Pure hops which provides a solid bitterness that is ever so slightly balanced by the malt, alcohol is evident but not oppressive, borders on the edge of a barley wine while still being a double IPA, thick and sweet - 4.50, M: Slightly thick mouth feel - 4.00, D: One of the better double IPAs I've had though the nature of the style often makes it a little less drinkable than some styles, overall a great beer, Bell's has yet to disappoint - 4.00"
Reviewed from notes taken 02-01-2010
"this beer pours crystal clear golden color with a white head that recedes to a thin layer of white lace. the smell is overwhelmingly hoppy with a bit of sweet malt and earthiness in the back. the taste is really nice with the piney hops and fruitiness up front, the dry bitterness at the end rounds out the flavor really nicely. the light mouthfeel and good co2 make the mouthfeel as good as the rest of the beer, the alcohol is well hidden to the point of disappearing, a very drinkable beer."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a huge bitter hop bite with a dry, honey driven aroma. The taste is great! It's pretty light actually. I think the honey lends the high abv. without the mouthfeel. It's damn hoppy with a nice pale malt flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good beer. I've been waiting years to try it. It definitely didn't disappoint."
That's to MrChopin for sendin me a fresh batch.
"An aggressive pour into a pint glass yielded a beautiful golden orange concoction of haze that swirled like summer clouds. A massive, frothy white head left great lacing throughout."
Drank on: 2/12/10
Poured into a imperial pint glass.
"Poured in my favorite glass, my Duvel Tulip."
Thanks to kzoobrew for this fresh bottle.
"Pours orange gold with some cloudiness. Moderate sized white head displays a nice amount of retention and spotty lacing. Aroma is strongly hoppy with gratuitous grapefruit, orange peel, spicy and floral hops, and an underlying malt sweetness. Tastes hopped up with pine, oranges, lemon, and grapefruit. Spicy hops on the midpalate with a big earthy hops, alcohol, and cookie finish. Medium bodied with a full but not quite prickly amount of carbonation, sticky with flora and earth. Quite a tasty DIPA, though a bit spicy for me, with alcohol and caramel malt standing out a bit too much on the finish to make this one of my favorites."
"One of my favorite Bell's products. Smells of honey and hops. Hops blended well with malt/honey backbone, also nice pine background. "
Worthy of the hype. One of the best APA/IPA/DIPA/Imperial IPA/however you want to classify it. 
mini keg I bought at steve's for 35.99
2010 review. Poured from the bottle into a Dogfish Head chalice.
"I guess it's time i put in my 2 cents worth. This is far and away the best beer i have had to date. Yes i'm from michigan and no i am not biased. If this beer were from bum f---ed egypt i would still feel the same! Looks great with a beautiful golden hue and light creamy head with medium lacing. Smell is like no other, sweet honey hops yeast? Taste is balanced perfectly between a hopped up dipa and honey- citrus floral combination. Pineapple galore. Very mild aftershock with a minimal clue to it's potent abv. Mouthfeel is smooth, sweet and luxurious. Drinkability is great so long as you don't ""slam"" too quickly. My or other's words can't express the quality of this beer so theres really only one thing you can do: Try it for yourself and you be the judge!!"
"To date, the best beer I have ever tasted. This was my first experience with this beer and I am already on my second case. Poured from 12 oz. bottle in to pint glass. Pours a golden with minimal white head. From the first sniff of this beer I was hooked. It seriously smells like freshly cut fruit drizzled with honey. The flavor does not disapoint. It is the perfect belend of bitter and sweet. Bitter hops, citrus, peach, honey... Moderate carbonation, very nice mouthfeel. I am hooked."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a small head with lacing that sticks to the sides like glue. It's an almost bright yellow color with sediments dancing like $2.00 Sea Monkeys. Oddly, this almost smells like a pina colada to me. It was really surprising and really unique. This is an extremely smooth beer. Unlike many IPAs, the bitterness hides underneath the sweetness. Boy, a guy could get use to drinking these. 10% ABV? These will get you in trouble fast. My first one and, in my opinion, a beer that livse up to the hype."
Pours orange-gold - a definite beacon of unique color in a world of beers that all too often look alike. A full finger of head is reduced to a thin cap of carbonation. 
A - Pours a light amber/burnt orange with a white head that fades slower than average. Lots of lacing
Poured from a bottle into my pint glass. A hoppy honey flavored ipa the bottle says... can't wait. 
"Pours with a nice pretty white head & clear, light orange color. "
Every year I get excited for this beer to come out - one of the best DIPAs out there for sure! Had this from a bottle numerous times and have already managed to find myself bellied up to the bar at Sonka Irish Pub multiple times this week. Sweet nectar!
"Everyone knows how good this beer is, so I'll add something that maybe everyone doesn't know. "
I finally got my hands on one of these! 
I've been wanting to get my hands on this for quite a while now. Everyone hypes it up to be one of the greatest beers out there...so here we go.
"As a boy who grew up in Vermont I thought we had the best beers in America. After all we've got Shed, LT, Magic Hat, Rock Art, The Bobcat, Trout River and many more. But now that I live in Michigan and I am able to sample some of the midwestern scene I am not so sure any more. Bell's HopSlam is my latest and let me say this bevy has it all for me. High alcohol with a taste that keeps me refilling my glass. I won't bore you with the details of my experience last night but I'll just say that if all beers were as classy, consistent, and as well crafted as the HopSlam, the world would be a better place."
Manna from heaven drank from a clay mug. 
"My 325th review, I have wait some time to finally have a Hopslam."
"Picked this up on a business trip. With the high ABV, the little hotel glass worked perfectly! Pours with just about no head. Very clear copper. Could be confused for a similar amount of whiskey."
"Before I review this beer, I have to give a shoutout to hayesez. If not for his generosity, I wouldn't have had a chance to try this amazing beer. Thanks so much Erik!"
"A darker tint of straw-colored, the head forms decently enough. Lacing along the glass sides indicates a hop presence. ;^) Though this isn't my inaugural Hopslam experience, I must acknowledge the beverage looks ordinary enough...."
Thanks to exiled for sharing this bottle.
"Perfect golden orange brew with a frothy white head that is not quite as prominent (or needed) as some other DIPAs. Aroma is reserved but nice, lots of citrus, tangerine and hop oils. Taste is smooth, unreasonable smooth, no overwhelming alcohol burn or lip-puckering bitterness. This is a very smooth, hoppy beer, almost like a regular IPA, which is good as a lot of IPAs are far too overwhelming. This is a well-crafted brew. Lots or citrus, grapefruit mixing with a leafy hoppiness and honey to produce a very good beer. Finishes with a reserved but fresh bitterness to end the brew perfectly. A rare brew that lives up to the billing."
Aggressively poured into tulip...
"A dark, clear orange, the medium-sized bubble head looks inviting, yet reminds me to pick one up for aging since I believe to have heard that as yeast continue their process the bubbles may get finer. Looks good for the style. The complete opposite of the last beer I reviewed."
Bell's Hopslam purchased at Boo's in Columbus Ga.
Since we can't get this in MD a friend was kind enough to share a bottle he aquired. Poured into 4oz tasting glasses.
Batch 9470 poured into Bells pint glass..
Pours a rather murky orange color with a medium-sized head that leaves some lacings. The color of the beer is surprisingly reminiscent of exotic fruit juice...
"Picked this up on a trade from SincereNC, your the man. Growing up in the mid-nineties in NorCal I always took for granted the amount of awesome beers available to me and my co-drinkers, (Bear Republic/ Sierra/ Lagunitas/ Russian River)but never really giving the rest of the country any thought about big hoppy, full bodied beers, I was so wrong. Is that bad when I pound a 10%er, because this was so perfectly balanced with the hops and the sweet finish that I was done lickety split. One of the best beers i've had in some time, thanks for screwing up my west coast bias."
"This brew pours a deep and rusty orange color with about a finger and a half worth of fluffy thick white foam. The carbonation is moderate. The smell is...but hop and malt, and surprisingly balanced. There's a rich hop character that's just mixed in with this but sweet malt presence. If I say so...the whole thing smells thick, but not in a bad way...just very full flavored. "
Figured I should toss up a review before it starts to fade.
"This was a great beer while it lasted... we got a very small keg at my local bar and loved every last minute of it... I won't get into the details as there are PLENTY of other reviews... however, I will say this: for 10%, it is ridiculously drinkable... "
"WOW!!!! What a treat! Kind of skeptical about this brew with all the hype surroundig it. Did not let me down in anyway whatsoever. Taste actually exceded what I anticipated, was expecting a ""hop bomb"" but this ended up being a very tasty and pleasantly smooth brew! definely and highly recommend trying this brew if you get a chance only downfall is the high dollar pricetag but do yourself and just go for it!"
"Poured at fridge temp into a std. pint glass. On a vigorous pour, you get a tangerine yellow colored brew, with a creamy firm head of decent size. Head retention is impressive for a beer of 10% abv. Small splashes of lacing decorate the glass if you give it a swirl."
"There are 1,500+ reviews about this beer so I'm going to slack a little on the details of my tasting experience, but here are the basics: It's hard to believe that a 10% Imperial IPA goes down so smoothly. The hops are mostly of the citrusy and floral variety, and they seem to pop out the most when it's cold. As it warms up the the sweetness of the pale malt body really opens up. There is easily recognizable an alcohol hotness to it that builds as the beer warms up too. As far as drinkability goes it's a bit of both worlds. When it's cold and the citrusy hops are in the forefront it down really fast, but when it warms up the alcohol becomes really apparent and I find myself sipping very slowly at it. At 10% people probably shouldn't be drinking too many Hopslams in a sitting anyway. "
"2010 - Bottled 1/5/2010 (boo FL distro). Pours a mostly clear amber, two finger offwhite head settles to a quarter inch, some lacing. Smell: sweet tropical fruit and a little citrus, resinous, very nice if not a bit straightforward. Taste: tropical fruit, herbal and a little spicy, a little citrus zest. Medium bodied, juicy, bitter, and sweet. The sweetness has a little honey aspect, though it might have been suggested... more (lots of) sugary pale than caramel/toffee. This is quite good, but I'm glad I didn't pay $20+/6er... would like to try it super fresh though."
12oz bottle poured into a open goblet. 
"A: Pours a brilliant ruby-gold with a 1-finger head into an over-sized wine glass. Has a crisp, clean look to it. Happy carbonation bubbles running up the sides of the glass show this beer is alive! Very nice amoeba-like lacing. "
"This is one of my new favorites. The abv at 10% is very deceiving, and if I drank 2 of these I would know it. The first smell is very strong of citrus. It is almost a grapefruit juice smell. Taste is awesome. Swallowing it is getting a bitter aftertaste, but as the bottle warms up the bitterness fades. This is what would make it easy to slam yourself if drinking more than 1. One of my new favorite beers. Would pair it with anything salty that I could get my hands on to offset the sweet citrus hopsy taste"
"A very nice dark copper semi-transparency with a slight off white head. Smells dank like hops, strong, citrus, and sticky. Taste is much the same with a very sweet green hops aftertaste lingering on all the smokey parts of my pallet. Nice and bitter yet not to overbearing in the sting of alcohol. A sweet IIPA. I love it."
"Batch 9502, packaged on January 5, 2010."
A- poured a golden honey color with a foamy white head. little lacing.
"A: Copper with a rich creamy, frothy head"
"A-Clear, Honey colored w/ very light white foamy head"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Batch #9552 according to Bells website it was bottled on Jan 18,2010. Poured into a snifter. About 2 inches of foamy head. Strong grapefuit like smell with some sweet aroma. Deep copper color. The flavor is outstanding. Strong sweet honey, hoppy flavor is very intense. Hops profile is more grapefruit than pine. Mouthfeel is very smooth and highly drinkable."
"This 12ozer was bottled about a month and a half ago (batch 9470), so it's fresh, though not super-fresh. "
Had it on tap at Mr. Dunderbaks Tampa Fl.
"this beer has a beautiful deep golden color with a small white head that vanishes quickly, like a ninja, but, unlike a ninja, leaves large traces of lacing."
Bell's HopSlam is a brilliant orange Imperial IPA with a moderate off white head than reduced to a collar. 
"Poured into a pint glass. It has a pure clear golden color. About a finger of white head that leaves some excellent lacing on the sides of the glass. It has an incredible clean floral hop aroma with hints of citrus. One of the best noses I have encountered on a beer. The hops are definitely present on the front of the sip. They match the floral notes in the aroma. It is surprisingly smooth. I expected much more bitterness. This is probably the least bitter double IPA I have ever had. The hops are still there just not so abrupt. I am not sure if the honey is responsible for the subdued bitterness or not. The honey is noted in some sweetness at the tail end of the taste and probably adds to the oily mouthfeel along with the hops. This is very smooth and the alcohol is masked making the alcohol content seem to be in the 6%-7% range. Overall and excellent beer. One of the best DIPA I have experienced. Although an excellent beer, I was disappointed slightly. I think the hype raised my expectations too high."
"A - Pours a dark, clear gold with a nice, thick head that dissipates slowly, leaving great lacing."
"12 oz bottle, batch 9470 (Dec. 23), into a Duvel tulip in a side-by-side tasting with Founders Double Trouble. "
Picked on of these up for the first time recently on a trip down to Columbus. Excited as I absolutely loved the Oracle.
"Appearance: B , pours a dark golden color with a 1/2 finger width white head that quicky disappaites to a film which stays for the remainder of the drink and leaves very slight lacing."
On tap at Brixies in Brookfield IL; served in a 10oz. snifter
"This is easily one of the highest rated and most raved about IPAs. This is the third year I have had Hopslam, and my reaction is always the same. Its good, but not great. Here is my review:"
Tis the season right?
"Pours crystal clear with a light copper and orange color crowned with a thick two finger, white head. The visibly high carbonation emits a big and bold aroma of citrus hops with warming floral notes. The body is mild and mouth filling with a touch of malt sweetness to complement the big hop citrus flavors. Very fresh and fruity as well as very well balanced. Completely covers any hint of the 10% abv with great flavor. The finish is very gentle and ends just a touch vinous."
"This beer has a beautiful snow white head on a clear orange body. The aroma explodes with grapefruit and lemon and tropical fruit. This beer has a ton of IBUs, but that's not even the point. The flavor is a wonderful melding of grapefruit and canteloupe fresh hop flavors, with enough warm caramely malt to make it work, and a long bitter finish. This beer is awesome!"
"Poured into a shaker: a clear honey gold with a finger of creamy head. A few tiny, pilsner-like bubbles. Beautiful lacing, a lot more than I'd expect for 10% ABV."
"Ok the first beer went down surprising very smooth. I tasted the honey as it rolled over my tongue then it moved to the normal IPA - grapefruit, piney but disappeared fast as if I was dehydrated. I wanted more... Alc% is a creeper because it is very easy to drink. Probably the best IPA I have had so far. I can't believe how light it is. First review but worth every letter and taste. Try it!"
Had on tap.
"This one pours a light orange color with a quarter inch white head, leaving light lacing. Smells of hops, tastes of hops, specifically a big dose of grapefruit with a tangy aftertaste. Excellent IPA flavor, but a bit light on the mouthfeel for a DIPA. Very drinkable, and I don't notice the ABV that much, but the overall impression is that of an IPA."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Served at cellar temperature, 45 degrees F."
"12 oz bottle, tulip glass"
"The 2009 Hopslam is the best I've had to date. The citrus comes through so well, right from the initial pour, and last all the way to the end. This was a brew that I didn't want to end."
Light gold in color with an orange tint. Pretty decent head which dissipates into a lasting layer of bubbles. A little lacing too. 
Batch 9502 Bottled 1/5/10
12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.
"Pours from the bottle with a sparkling, crystal, orange-copper color, and a sticky, bubbly, cream-colored head. The combination of honey and hop aroma smacks me in the face from the second I open the bottle, like if one of those plastic bears from the grocery store came to life, climbed a pine tree, walked through a field of wildflowers, and then started mauling my sinuses with his sticky, sweet, sap-covered paws. Although the aroma is packed with both the honey sweetness and the piney and floral hops, the flavor is much more hop-forward, showcasing the resinous pine and a bit of orange, and with the honey providing a sweet balance. And the flavor and aroma from the honey is wonderfully natural, rather than an artificial, syrupy sweetness. The potency of the flavors deftly masks the 10% alcohol, and although the label claims that this is ""a biting, bitter, tongue bruiser"", this one is remarkably drinkable. With both a little sweetness and some bitterness lingering on my tongue, and feeling warm on the inside right now, I am certainly content with this year's edition."
"I don't know maybe it's just me.. I see it's gettin so much love.. ""is it my palate or is it the beer?"" that is the question... forget that ""to be or not to be crap""... : ).. "
Received in trade from Pecorasc (thanks!).
This may be my first perfect rating. I'm not sure :)
12oz bottle...batch 9505 into a snifter
Poured a hazy golden-orange color with a super frothy white head. Aroma is reminiscent of nugget nectar. Very sweet and CRAZY HOPPY! Citrus and pine.
"A- Very slightly hazy orange with a decent white head. It's actually pretty clear for an IPA, almost lager-like in appearance. Head remains throughout the glass with lots of lacing."
Sampled on tap at Tyler's in Apex.
"Pours a marigold orange yellow with a large white head of tiny bubbles. Smell is tons of grapefruit, and abundance of pine, pineapple and citrus. There is so much IBU aroma that it smells dankish and similar to the sticky icky. Some may even venture to say that there is some barnyard aroma because of the huge hop presence. "
"Had this on cask last year at BSP, then on tap last week in VA. Now for a bottle in the relative quiet of home for a review."
A-pours a golden yellow/orange with about an inch white head
"Thanks to kzoobrew who knew I would love this, and made it possible. "
New Beer Friday! A huge thanks goes out to kzoobrew for this awesome beer! Cheers friend!
Poured into a pint glass.
This is arguablly my favorite ipa of all time
"Excellent DIPA. First sips are a bit harsh, but flavor smooths out as the beer warms. You would never guess that this is a 10% ABV beer. The balance of hops/malt/alcohol is very good at hiding the alcohol taste. Simcoe hop profile as predominat hop is very apparent to me. Overall great beer!"
"A very nice, if slightly overhyped, DIPA"
"Can this really be a double IPA? This is a highly drinkable beer. Absoutely love the flavor. Hop flavor followed by citrus and balanced by a smooth malt backbone. This beer is deceptive. You'd never know it had such a high alcohol content. Too much to be a session beer, but boy I'd sure like to try. Oh, by the way, also had a nice creamy head on top of a clear amber orange body."
Thanks to FooFaa for the bottle.
12 oz bottle into an oversized wine glass.
"Was lucky enough to find 6 scattered bottles of this at Abe's Six Pack in PA last year. Pours a cloudy orange color with a thin white head. Smell- oh my, huge grapefruit/pineapple smell WOW, unlike any DIPA I have ever smelt. Some hints of carmael and you can smell the hops too I think! Taste - MMMM hopssss, sweet carmel also to keep the hops in check. Great body, for the ABV and style, creamy, some alcohol comes through. What an awesome beer overall, I am not worthy."
A-Pours a nice gold color with a white head that dissipated pretty quickly.
Wow where do I start with this beer?
"12oz bottle, served in a Stone Levitation glass...case stamped 1/18/2010"
"A: Looks like Two Hearted in both a mug and oversized wine glass, this means this beer needs a bit more lacing and head retention as it is fairly poor compared to other examples of the D/IPA style."
On-tap at the Porter Beer Bar in Atlanta.
"A: Dark golden, no active carbonation. Poured a razor thin head that vanished pretty quickly."
"Loved this beer! Poured into a pint glass and immediately noticed the perfect head, 3 fingers thick with a nice puffy lacing and the color was a brilliant golden orange. Holy cow the hops on this beer! Almost overwhelmingly aromatic. My wife could smell it all the way in the next room! Bursting with a bright citrus pop, the smell is incredibly bright and cheery, like wind blowing over an orange tree. The carbonation is perfectly balanced, mixing well with the bright, white grapefruit taste that seems to almost float in your mouth. The finish has a slight bitterness to it not unlike that of citrus zest. Though this beer is INCREDIBLY drinkable, watch out because the 10% ABV will knock you on your ass if you're not careful. This would be a perfect beer to enjoy on your deck in the summertime, and it may very well be my favorite offering from Bell's at this point. Can't wait for another bottle!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Perfect Pint glass. Instantly formed a 2 finger, bone white head. The thick foam lasted forever! Lots of lacing here...puffy trails on the sides of the glass. The body is a clear golden yellow with some hints of ruby hues."
"The pale bronze colored body was very clear, and the head was small, which I'm sure was due to the alcoholic strength. The smell was a seductive mix of grapefruit, pine resin, and more grapefruit. The taste was very citric and juicy to the core, almost hard candy like in its sweetness until smacking you down with a spicy hop finish. The bitterness was quite low, but otherwise hops drove the show. Sticky texture and long spicy aftertaste made this an enjoyable beer, which was surprisingly approachable despite the double digit ABV. Bravo."
Thanks to abuliarose for splitting this bottle with me and thanks to hayesez for sending her a free bottle. Can't wait to try this.
"Thanks goes out to hayesez for being a trooper and giving this out of sheer beer love. We can all strive to emulate you, sir!"
"First hopslam I've ever had. So far living up to the hype. Appears like many other DIPAs but the smell is exceptional, smells like a cross between grapefruit and pine resin, if grapefruit grew on a resinous tree this is what the resin would smell like. (Upon re-reading the last sentence it seems weird that that would be appealing, but then I was thinking of the possibilities of grapefruit wood aged beers...anyway, moving on)."
Courtesy of NorthsideFred (thanks again). Reviewing from last week's notes. 12oz into a DFH snifter
The legendary Hopslam. It is all its cracked up to be. As good as the style gets.
"01.24.10, courtesy of BrewskiDudeski (superdanks! You are the man!)"
A: Slightly orange color and very clear with just a slight haze which indicates unfiltered beer. An aggressive pour didn't make more than a one finger head with large bubbles which dissipates fairly quickly.
Generously given to me by Hayesez for no other reason then he loves sharing good beer.
12oz bottle received in trade with SirSketch...Thanks Zach! Batch 9470 - about 3-4 weeks since bottling. Poured into a Bruery tulip.
"Beautiful, hazy amber color with a foamy off-white head of various bubble sizes that settles slowly. Great sheets of lace cling to the glass."
"Thanks again to ericwo for sending me this. Poured a nice golden honey color into the glass with a nice white two finger head that slowly dissipated leaving lacing all the way down the glass.The nose is citrus, hoppy and honey. There is a faint smell in the nose that is a little reminiscent of cheese. The taste is solid. Delicious citrus hops that open up more with each sip. Hints of honey, grapefruit, pine and hop resin come through early. There's a bit of bite in the initial taste that is smoothed over by honey in the finish. The beer rolls over your tongue and kind of coats your mouth. The honey really balances this out and keeps the hops in check, making it very, very drinkable. I wish they made this year round, this would be the perfect beer to have on hand in your fridge at all times."
"This is HopSlam's first appearance in Alabama. I picked up a 6-pack yesterday, but rushed out today and find more. My first tastes of this beer were yesterday. My review reflects a second taste."
Pours a clear golden orange color with a small white head that leaves enough lacing.
Poured into a tulip.
Poured into a Sam Adam's glass.
"Pours a golden yellow, slightly cloudy, an holding a solid head."
"On-tap at CK Diggs, served in a 10 oz snifter."
Appearance - Pours a nice golden color with tiny beautiful carbonated bubbles. Some medium to light lacing that looks excellent on the glass.
12oz. Bottle poured into a DFH Signature Glass.
"I had Hopslam on tap and bought a 6pack last year (09), this is my first bottle of the 2010 edition. Batch 9505 (packaged Jan 5, 2010, drank Jan 22, 2010) from a 12oz bottle into a Rouge pint glass."
"2nd Hopslam of the night. First one was @ a BYOB THAI restaurant paired with a spicy noodle dish, this one is at home savored by itself."
12flz oz bottle poured into my pint glass
"Pours a clear light golden orange with golden yellowish orange hues when held to a light source and a two finger frothy soapy white head with excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Sheets of chunky soapy white lacing are left coating the glass."
A: Pours a nice hazy honey gold with a thick finger of head.
12oz bottle courtesy of hayesez into a Brooklyn Snifter
This is a unbelievable IPA so good it is what DIPAS are made for. Up front taste leaves you wanting another and unforgetable !!
Poured into a standard pint glass.
12oz bottle. bottled 1/18/2010. just 4 days young.
Glassware - Corsendonk Tulip
"Oh sweet jesus its back!!! gotta say this is my favorite time of the year because of the inevitable release of this beer. Nice hazy golden hue and a nose that if was made into a perfume, i would fall in love with any girl wearing it. Tons of citrus, like every type of citrus fruit was squeezed into this fine brew. Not overly bitter, but just enough to make you want to pucker a little bit, very smooth and packed with more fresh hop taste than one could hope for. This is definately a beer i could sit down a pound a lot of, the only problem is the 10% ABV, which isnt a problem as much as an obstacle. wish this was more readily available throughout the year so i wouldnt have to stockpile so much at once, but i'll take it when i can get it and in as much quantity as possible!"
lives up to its name because it slams you with hops right away.
Re-review after trying this several times. This is a fresh 2010 batch. 
Review #2 - 01/21/2010
A- Poured into my favorite snifter... a light somewhat fizzy 1/4 inch head appears and disappears leaving some spotted lacing. Beer is light amber color and slightly cloudy
"Light orange color, just okay head and lacing."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass (January 20, 2010). Batch ""9470"" is printed on real label, which according to the website was packaged on Dec 23, 2009. "
From a growler into a flute. I had a small portion at lunch - the rest is for some friends.
"I had this on tap last evening at Brass Rail Deli in Campbelltown, PA. Served in a pint glass."
"This is the first time I've felt compelled to review a beer. My first notes date back to 12/30/06, and each year Hopslam never fails to satisfy. This might be the best batch yet."
Thanks to Hayesez.
Thanks Bill for throwing this in as an extra. Poured into a pint glass.
"Picked up a couple bottles at Beer Run in Charlottesville, and paired with Teriyaki tofu stir fry, which by the way worked excellently. "
Hazy copper with a small eggshell cap that leaves sticky rings of lace on the glass. The smell is pretty hop forward with dank and fruity pineapple and grapefruit rind hop notes with just a touch of honey. The flavor on this one is like drinking fresh hops straight up with just enough malt backbone and light honey sweetness to keep it in check. The alcohol is well hidden. Mild carbonation and medium bodied. Hopslam actually almost lives up to it's hype. This is what I look for in a DIPA. This beer is pretty darn hard to beat when served fresh.
"I was so excited, and extremely suprised, to see this on-tap in the crappy little town I work in."
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.
Poured from a 12oz. bottle into an Ithaca tulip. 
I bought the last case at Bound beverage in Bensalem PA. Poured into a tulip. Pours a slightly hazy apricot with a very fluffy soapy looking white heading. Leaves a mess of lacing everywhere.
This was my first experience with Hopslam. I enjoy cask beers in general so this was definitely a treat. Thanks to the Flying Saucer in KC for this opportunity.
"Slightly hazy orange-gold pour with a small white head. Aroma is lots of citrusy hops and honey sweet malt with a little bit of noble hop spicinesses and a hint of orange zest. Tastes like a glass full of wet, juicy, piny hops with a little noble hop spice and a very slight malt background. Body is a bit on the thin side with a tingly carbonation. Note: Batch 8283 seems to have a sharper pine note to the hop profile."
I had this on tap at Sycamore Restaurant after missing out on all the cases in town. Needless to say I was anxious to attack my palate with some HopSlam.
Poured into a pint glass. Beautiful orange honey colored head with a big white head and a truckload of lacing.
"Poured into a Perfect Pint glass. Has a 3 finger head won't budge! Extremely billowly. As soon as I started pouring I thought Wow, this smells like honeysuckle. Very fresh and moist. Nice."
Batch #9505 12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.
"Batch #9505, Shipped on January 5th"
"I traveled 90 minutes, and showed up 3 hours early to try this...."
Poured a bottle from The Foodery into a pint glass.
Dead horse meet stick. 
A- It pours a clear goldish brown. A beatiful color. Not much head but a strong rocky lacing after every sip!
Updated on 2/8/16 and rating adjusted accordingly.
Pours a crystal clear amber color with honey highlights and lots of visible carbonation. Has a small fizzy head that dissipates pretty quickly leaving some ropey lacing.
"On my latest outing to Abe's Cold Beer in Bethlehem, I was thrilled to find several ""rare birds"" of the beer world. Topping the hit list was Bell's HopSlam, a legend in it's own time."
"To be honest, I've seen negative reviews of this one along with the hype. Let me just say to begin that I've never met a food or drink critic (several of whom I know well) who didn't agree with my assessment. Just a disclaimer."
"Apricot golden body, tiny hop flecks visible and a classic ivory creamy, spritzy cap. The nose is very aromatic like a freshly prepped bowl of ambrosia. Lots of ripe citrus in the nose, specifically tangerine and ruby red grapefruit. Small pine character in the background. The taste is crisp, hoppy and I could tell upon first drink the mouthfeel is superb. The label claims this beer was brewed with honey and I think I could tell that for myself even if they didn't help out with that bit of information. Hops, hops and more hops, well balanced though with a good sized malt backbone,pale and caramel malts try to balance the hop onslaught and do, almost, lots of honey encrusted tangerine, resinous, pithy hops buds, the honey gives a sweet, sugary parity to the beer along with notes of dried apricots. Mouthfeel is sharp, nectary and crisp. The taste is big but not great. I appreciate the boldness, bitterness, balance and power of the hops, it's just not amazing. I'll say it, it's overrated a little. Change the name from Hopslam to Bells Double IPA and this beer averages to an A- and doesn't crack the top 100 or garner as much hype."
"355ml bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Beer World in Largo, Florida."
"Poured from bottle into tulip. Lighter golden color and white head, certainly lighter than expected. "
Bell's HopSlam poured a very light straw-like color with a thick white head. It left good amount of lace on the glass.
"Pours a hazy amber copper red in a pint glass,the smell is floral citrus grapefruit hoppiness,well balanced honey sweetness and west coast hops make this a Classic DIPA,This one slide right down,mouth feel is silky smooth,The alcohol in this one is hidden and makes for an easy drink,This one is a sleeper at 10% you could have a number of these down before ya know it,this is one beer that leaves ya pine for another"
"This beer could easily be the prototype for what a double IPA is supposed to be. Thick two finger head that held up well with good belgian lacing. Color is a light golden color. Aroma is outstanding. Lots of nice grassy hops upfront with citrus in the background. Loads of dry hopping. Flavor was citrus hops, with a good malt balance. Could tell it was a high alcohol beer. Pretty much flawless. CO2 just right. Best Bell's beer I have ever had."
Figured I'd review this VERY talked about beer for my 50th review. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter:
Picked up a couple of sixers at Total Wine and More yesterday for $14.99. Also picked up two sixers at BevMo for $16.99. 
"It's finally Hopslam release month, and it's time to review this beast. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Dogfish snifter. Poured amber, slightly gold in color with a thin white layer covering the top. It laced nicely on the sides of the glass as I drank it,."
"A: I've seen better and I've seen worse, but I have to say, Hopslam has a better then average look. This brew pours a golden yellow with a thick off white head. I wish I had poured this into my tulip to really get a good appreciation for the burlyness of the head."
Poured a nice golden hazy cloudy color with a nice fluffy white head that stuck around just long enough and left beautiful white lacing the entire way down the glass.
"Appearance: (4.5) Amber to orange in color, with a creamy white head that retains itself through each sip. Lacing is at it's peak, coating the glass all the way down. "
Bottle of batch 9470 hardpoured into my DFH signature glass.
Bottled 12-30-09
"Pours a great thick head that sticks around. Has a strong bodied dark golden color with a lot of activity about. Very strong, vibrant aroma. Very appealing. I'm not one that typically likes hop infused beers, but this one is great. The label calls it a ""biting,bitter,tongue bruiser of an ale."" I don't think it is as rough as they might make it seem. Very drinkable, and at 10% abv that is saying something."
"Appearance: Poured from a bottle into a large wine glass. Beer is golden in color with a large, frothy head. It's fairly clear with just a little haziness to it. The head takes a good couple of minutes to dissipate and leaves good lacing on the sides of the glass. Good carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass."
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Batch # 9471.
"the beer pours a golden color with a small amount of head. Looks fresh and great already. The smell is very strong and floral. Smells very complex right off the bat. I get floral with a hint of citrus and malt. Definitely one of the strongest most complex smells i have gotten from an IPA. The taste is amazing! It is floral with a hint of citrus at first and finishes with a touch of malt and honey backbone, very well balanced. I don't usually like much malt in my IPAs, but this is done right! Mouthfeel is fine for and DIPA a bit thicker than a normal IPA, as to be expected. Drinkability is surprisingly great for a 10% DIPA, only downfall is that it tastes so good, that you want more, but the ABV prohibits you from drinking too much."

12oz bottle poured into a tulip.
I tried this beer in bottled form from a six pack that I purchased. 
Clear amber coloring.
First time having this hyped beer -- picked it up right after it hit town. Bellsbeer.com Batch Finder indicates my batch -- 9501 -- was bottled on Dec. 30. I'm drinking on Jan. 15. 
"Whoa! Silly me for only purchasing one six pack on the first visit. I'm a skeptic about hyped beers, but this one delivers."
Poured into a tulip. So excited!!
Thanks to khumbard for the fine box today. I couldn't help but open a hopslam immediately.

"Appearance- Golden and honey is color, with a great firm two finger head. It is cleanly filtered with no haze."
"Bell's hopslam. What can you say that hasn't already been said. I bought this beer in bottle form for a decent price, $4 a bottle. Poured the beer into a standard American pint and it held a great frothy head. Immediate overwhelming hop presence in the nose. I could smell this beer all evening. This beer taste of a hop plant, check the label. It starts strong and finish's like a 12 round heavy weight champion. It's mouthfeel is a like a lingering hangover sitting on your tongue. I feel that if you drink more than two you will not be able to drink anything else for the rest of the night...and I would be totally fine with that."
Served in a 12oz snifter. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 
"A- Light golden, honey color with minimal head. Very little lacing."
"From my first BIF.. thanks a billion, MbpBugeye!!!"
"I don't buy into hype. I expected to go to the Bell's Dinner at Spinnerstown Hotel in PA and SLAM hopslam as another over-hopped, over-hyped burly man brew."
Bottle # 9501 (12/09)
"taken from notes, had ontap a few nights ago."
Poured from a tap into a 12 oz snifter.
Finally...the last time this came around I was unsure of my hopheadedness...but not this time...
"wow. this beer is ungodly. i had to avoid it last year because of the price, and this year wasn't too much better, but luckily im not as poor and i got a case. pours a hazy, faint bronze that laces my oversized wine glass like a wet snowball against a car's wind-shield. smells elegant, with a biting, pungent, and gorgeous sting of alpha acids. phenomenally floral, with a bite of granny smith tartness and tons of grapefruit, a bit of lime zest, and just perfection and balance. the taste is incredibly fresh, beautiful and brilliant. i also got pineapple, mango, a touch of banana, and as it warms, some very pleasant and faint caramel malt. Life is too short not to drink beer this excellent, absolutely divine. A+"
Batch 9470. Bottled 12/22/09. Poured into a pint glass.
Served in a snifter. Finally.
Pours a clear amber with about an inch of off-white head.
"Had a Hopslam on tap last night at Churchkey in Washington D.C. and am currently enjoying a bottle now, bought today at my local Whole Foods."
Moment of truth has arrived for me. First timer here been waiting and wanting for months. 
"Hopslam just came in to the local store, and its a buck cheaper this year... score! Poured in to Duvel glass."
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.
"Wait, what"
Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Corsedonk snifter. Fresh: Batch 9470. Pours a clearish golden color with a nice size thick and creamy white head. Head quickly dissipates but remains a nice creamy surface with great sticky lacing.
Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint.
"I stand corrected. I had this on tap two nights ago and was somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong - it was good, but not as good as I was expecting. The bottle, on the other hand, wow!"
"A- 12 oz. bottle decanted into a pint glass reveals an exceptionally clear amber colored brew. A good finger and a half of white, sticky head sits atop the beer. Good head retention leads to a terrific amount of lacing. "
A: Clear golden color with a medium white head that evaporates very quickly and leaves amazing lacing.
I drank this from a 12oz bottle right from the brewery into my Rochefort chalice.
Batch # 9471. I am not sure what is going on with this batch. My local store usually carries outdated beer so I had to double check the batch number on Bell's site to make sure this wasn't last years batch. It is fresh...packaged on 21 of Dec 09. 
"Pours a pale orange color with two fingers worth of head. Smells of orange, grapefruit, pineapple, honey, and especially hops. The flavor is amazing. The hops are the star here, but some of the sweet malt comes through, as well as the honey, pineapple, grapefruit, and oranges. "
"Bottled on 12/30/09, drank on 1/11/10, yum. "
On tap at Union Jacks HopSlam night. MY LORD.
"Rather chilled when poured, warmed slightly before tasted, in a pint glass."
"A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale. With a name like Hopslam, what did you expect?"
First off before I go into this review I have to say &lt;b&gt;WOW!&lt;/b&gt;
12oz. poured into pint glass
Had on tap at the Uptown Grille in Commerce Township MI
"Had this at a neighborhood pub in a brandy snifter. The beer is a golden/orange color with some hop haze and a small but clingy white head. The aroma is intensely hoppy, slap you in the face American hops, tangerine and apricot aromas come to my mind. The flavor is like the smell, very very hoppy with a solid yet not overpowering hop bitterness. There is a bit of sweet malt and a warming quality from the high ABV, although that is appreciated and is not harsh. The carbonation is medium and body medium as well. Overall an intense, well crafted, very enjoyable beer. At its ABV it is amazing how drinkable this beer is, I especially enjoy the over the top hop flavor/aroma and yet not exceedingly bitter."
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. Great lacing develops as I consume this nectar of God. The smell is absolutely amazing. Its pungent and overpowering but just beckons my lips to the glass. The taste, the name says it all. Its as if all the hops off the vine gathered their might together to just pop me in the mouth. The honey doesn't do much to this beer as far as sweetening it, but rather keeps the bitterness in check as all of the other flavors develop. I think it helps to tame the alcohol warmth, while not totally killing it. What an amazing elixir."
batch 9470
Can I just say THANK YOU beeradvocate reviewers. I went out on a limb and bought a whole case of this stuff before ever trying due to the great reviews an all I can say is THANK YOU!!
"2010 vintage, batch 9471, bottled 12/21/09, sampled 17 days later. Each year, I get my first bottles of the season and rush home to sample."
"Orange/gold in color, big white head. Tons of citrusy hop aroma with a touch of alcohol sweetness. The taste is pretty stellar, the name is pretty fitting, you get slammed with hops. I think the alcohol is too high to really enjoy much but to be this big its quite drinkable and not plagued with too much sweetness. Overall a great beer from Bell's but Two Hearted will always be my Bell's go to."
Total in-your-face hops!
"This bottle has some age on it, I may re-review if I can get a fresh one this winter."
poured from 12 oz bottle into standard pint glass
Hopslam is pretty much universally loved. Me too. In 2008 I bought a mess of it and I am still sipping off of those old ones. I have some 2009's sitting up too. I'll hang on to them. 
Another hit from Bell's. This brew has a great golden-orange hue with a big white head. The aroma is fresh citrus blossoms and the taste is good. There is a little too strong of a mouth coating that never goes away; sometimes that's a good thing and other times it's annoying. It definately leaves you excited about the next time.
Fresh Batch Poured 1/29/10.
"Thanks to the guys at Corks and Kegs for sharing this one,"
"I think this is my favorite beer of all time. I'm not sure if it's because it's released only once a year, or if it's because it really is so good. I also can't tell if I'd get sick of it if I was able to have it all the time, or if part of it's appeal is because of it's limit."
"Batch 8913 packaged 1/12/09, no freshness date to be found"
"I really wanted to try this beer as soon as I first saw it; I just didn't want to pay the $18 for a six pack, but then I found individual bottles. "

bottle to glass. Unknown freshness date.
"Pours a nice orange-gold with a rich, creamy head. Lots of lace left behind."
"A pale honeyish amber with a thick off-white head. A good amount of lace and foam sticking to the glass. A bitter citrus smell on the nose with hints of pine and a whiff of something sweet. The citrus comes through on the taste with a lot of dried orange peel and a little grapefruit. There's a nice amount of pine in there as well. The sweetness is more developed than with the aroma and serves as a nice counterbalance to the bitterness of the hops. Not sure if it's the honey or the malt. Whatever it is, the taste is absolutely phenomenal. A nice dry finish leaves me refreshed yet wanting more. It's easy to forget this is 10% ABV as it's very drinkable. I think Hopslam is an appropriate name. I could see myself slamming these back all night. The balance of flavors is hard to beat and it's so ridiculously refreshing. I want to gulp it. A friend of mine gave me a few bottles to try. Needless to say, I'll be buying a bunch of this on it's next release and I highly recommend you do the same. Kick-ass beer."
"Although this brew was a bit past prime, ca. 8 months old, it had stood up quite well, with the exception of its original rough over the top hoppiness."
"Got this one in a BA trade (thanks to mflick). I know it was a bit ""faded"" or ""past-peak,"" but it was still awesome."
"8 month vintage Hopslam poured into a snifter - Golden straw color, maybe a shade darker and more rich than a pilsner color, with a decent head that died down pretty quickly. "
"this poor bottle had a protracted wait, as it took FOREVER for my trade with jnn4v to come through (was originally expecting arrival in early march, but ended up having to wait until MID-MAY). some of his reasons were understandable, some not as much. supposedly it was kept in the fridge most of the time though."
"finally, i scored this on tap,at the bell's eclectic cafe in kalamazoo, knowing it's only available in bottles jan-march, i was surprised to see it on tap amongst the many other brews available - this beer was superb, a nice pour with a 2 finger head, hazy amber color, hoppy sweet smell and WOW on taste - a nice hop bite with a sweet lingering finish - i found a couple of 6pks in new buffalo, probably past their prime, but very good nonetheless - i was excited to grab a couple @ 16.99 a six - two of these (on tap)went down too easy at the cafe( accompanied by an excellent pulled pork sandwich) - the abv doesn't show it's presence til you're done - real tasty stuff either way - lives up to the hype -"
Thanks to COBeerBuff for this gem. Poured from bottle into oversized snifter.
Pours a nice amber color and the glass I poured has a little hop haze effect. Smells like citrus or grapefruit. Laces the glass well. Tastes like a double IPA with the upfront hop blast and has a nice malt backbone to it to balance it out. Overall one of the best double IPA's I've had.
"Nice copper color with a slight head and good lacing. Nice aroma due to the hops. Some esters are present; however, they are hard to identify due to the hops. The flavor is balanced between sweet, sour, and bitter. The mouthfeel and drinkability are superior. In short, a wonderful beer."
Poured into a pint glass.
"Pours into the goblet with a slightly hazy gold and a thick foam. The tiny tight bubbles are layered with a few larger ones. They collapse from nearly an inch thick to an eighth inch table. Good, but noting exceptional."
"A: Orangy-Amber in color. Slightly cloudy. Thin head, good lacing."
Re-review on 2/15/10 as I got a fresh one. Original 8/3/09 review erased since it was an out of season review. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Had a batch number code on back label that you can look up on the web. This one is from 12/21/09 so fresh. It was a slightly hazy golden honey color with light carb bubbles. It had a good sized white head that settled into a thick collar and central wisps. Good sliding lace with some sticky spots.
"a golden well malted beer with indistinguishable abv compared to some. nice honey malt, bit o honey, peppery lemon zest nose. well hopped... or more so balanced hop palate for the malt character. palate of honey, grass, lemon, and mild sweet tea aspect. this beer ages very well."
"A- Hazy, cloudy orange with small beighe head that leaves a little lacing."
"A: Poured from a growler to a tulip glass. Had an orangey-amber color and a cloudy consistency. There was a half inch of foamy, long-lasting head and excellent lacing."
"Probably my favorite beer ever, anywhere, of any style, period! Nothing wrong with it at all. Great taste, great smell, perfectly balanced, hides the 10% ABV well. The only problem with it is that it's only available for a very short time each year. But that probably makes it that much better."
I was able to pick up this fine beer while in Wisconsin.
Pours a hazy golden peach color with a frothy head that leaves sticky lace behind.
"Pours an orange copper color with a huge frothy white head that leaves lacing. The smell is sweet upfront with tons of hop aroma and nice bit of citrus like orange and grapefruit. The taste starts sweet and pretty hoppy, then somewhat bitter with a slight hop bitter aftertaste. I was expecting a bigger bitter bite considering the bottles advertisement, but no big deal. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth, medium body, with great flavors and a nice depth to the taste. Not an over the top flavor that gets old, but a great beer that keeps things fresh. This is a great drinker considering the high ABV, it is really hard to tell that it is so high, a half a six pack could be too much, but a great hophead beer."
"Had this on tap at Vintner Wine Market in Charlotte. Appearance was a hazy, glowing orange. Smells like nectarines. Taste is unbelieveable: Imagine sweet grapefruit juice mixed with honey. Big mouthfeel that lingers. Finish is just as amazing with absolutely no alcohol heat. It's hard to believe this is a high gravity beer (until I finished the pint). This is my favorite Double IPA. I would put this on tap at home all the time if I could..."
Poured from a 12oz bottle to a pint glass.
"Purchased from Consumer Beverage Center in Hales Corners, WI. Pours a bright golden body with a thick white head that falls to a cap and lasts to the end. Aroma is a big blast of sweet, fruity hops. Excellent malt sweetness used to balance out the hop bitterness. Even at 10% alcohol, the drinkability is extremely high."
"Pretty much the perfect beer! Pours a beautiful golden hue with a rich head of foam which leaves beautiful lacing. Smells of hoppy citrus goodness. Hints of honey, well balanced, amazing drinkable for such a big beer. Best when fresh, even a few months past prime it's still a delicious brew. Don't pass this up!"
Bottle poured into tulip.
"12oz bottle received as an extra. This one has been on my wants for a while and I was glad to finally be able to have this. Poured a orange body with a big loose rocky head with amazing lace as it went on. Smelled very citrusy, piny, grapefruit. Tasted very hoppy, resinous, some pineapple, piny. Medium body, thick sticky mouthfeel. Amazing DIPA"
hats off to ratpack554 for the bottle.
Poured from bottle to dogfish head signature glass.
I was extremely excited to try this beer despite it being past its peak freshness. I poured it into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. It's a beautiful orange hue that is nicely transparent with a two finger white head.
Poured 12 oz bottle into pint glass.
"A: This pours somewhere between orange and amber, almost completely clear, with a tight, bone-white that evaporates quickly and leaves lots of lace."
Thanks go to cvaypai for this one.
"A: HopSlam pours a slightly hazy tangerine-copper with a creamy ecru-colored head that sticks around a while, retains well, and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Good appearance for a DIPA, but not a world-beater."
poured into a tulip glass this beer is a glowing tan orange color. not much head here. with a swirl of the glass tiny shimmering bubbles cling to the sides of the glass. good slippery lacing.
"A: 12 oz. brown bottle. Slightly hazy orange body with 1/2"" of ivory head. Pretty nice lace patterns are left behind as the head fades."
a: pours a hazy orange color with about a half inch of head that dissapears slowly leaving only a hint of lacing
This beer really blew me away. For a 10% beer it is exceptionally drinkable (to the point of getting yourself in trouble very easily).
Had this with a friend earlier tonight and very much enjoyed it. Poured a nice golden color with medium-thick head that left plenty of lacing. Smelled wonderfully of citrusy hops. Taste was a little less hoppy than the smell. Very smooth and masked the 10% alcohol extremely well. I could easily have drunk 3 or 4 without realizing how buzzed I was getting.
Received a 6 pack plus 2 via trade with Kiefdog(an excellent trader I may add). 
A- Pours golden/orange with a heavy off-white head.
"A tight and rolling large tan head sits neatly atop a hazy orange and amber brew. A sticky, curvy lace is revealed as the froth slowly drifts away, leaving a thick covering atop. Subdued and pleasant citrusy hops float to the nose. Tastes fruity, citrusy and malty upfront with the hops coming at the end, adding to, and not overpowering the palate. Spice and pine exist, as does some butterscotch or other such candy. The honey comes in and adds a nice texture to the whole experience. Equanimity is achieved across the board. The alcohol heat bites at the throat just a bit, but is welcomed, not at all bothersome, but demands care. The mouth-feel is a perfect medium, as it doesn't weigh you down; demands sipping, but also has a certain hint of fluff that allows you stay in for the long haul. This is an exceptional, highly approachable and satisfying beer that reminds me of bittersweet candy, candy which I would not hesitate to steal from a child."
"So I got this gem from a buddy who got it in a trade. Saying that much, it makes the bottle somewhat old. It was in the 8911 batch which was bottled on January 20 2009. This will make a difference to my reviewing, I am sure. "
Batch #8907 poured into a pint glass
"Thanks to BDLbrewster for hooking me up with a couple bottles of this. A fairly elusive beer for me, as the timing has never been right for me to score it. Thanks dude!"
Poured into a snifter.
"Batch #8907, January 6, 2009. 12 oz. bottle."
"Served in a Pilsner Glass. Typed in batch # on Bell's website and found it was was packaged on January 6, 2009. (I did this after tasting the beer). "
"I've been told that this beer is very susceptible to going bad if it sits on the shelf at the liquor store for too long. Thankfully, I was able to get a fresh 12oz bottle and thoroughly enjoy it. It's a shame I bought but a single 12oz bottle of it!"
"I love HopSlam. I love it fresh, and I love it now, nearly five months later. Bottled Jan. 5, 2009."
"From batch 8911, bottled in January 09. Already had the first four from the pack."
Poured into a snifter.
"Bottle Pours a clear golden with an off white head. The head is frothy and lasts well. Fairly good lacing. Has a good hoppy aroma of pine, oranges, and a touch of vanilla. Has a good carbonation and a wonderful mouthfeel. The flavor is excellent. The alcohol is well hidden. Very well blended. Has a soft bitterness. It is bitter but the bite is mellow. Has an oily texture. A medium body mostly because it's so refined. A good finish with a good lingering aftertaste. This is a real good beer. Very smooth."
"Pours a hazy orange-brown color (almost cider-like) with a modest and quickly fleeting white head that left a respectable lace behind. Smell though was this beer's best selling point. The aroma was heavenly, perhaps the best I've come across of any beer. The smell was of citrus fruits, mostly lemon and pineapple, with a bit of honey too. "
Just had this at the Taco mac in Kennesaw Ga. 
Poured into a Duvel glass around 48 degrees this beer is copper to dark straw in color. The head is white and frothy and the lacing resides for the entire session. This is around the 27th Hopslam I've had - but never reveiwed it until now. I know the hops have faded from when I first had it and I know the progression that this beer takes over a three month period. 
"I am reviewing the second pint I had off a cask @ BSP, yummy. The first pint was a little faint in al regards, and the second was far better. Nice vibrant orange color, a bit richer and deeper than the first pour. Little carbonation, its a cask. Lovely floral and citrus hop aroma. This second pint was far better in the hop flavor department. I get a much more pronounced bitterness, but I think the honey sweetness helps balance it out. Also make is incredible easy to drink. Too easy really. I think the middle of this cask was amazing, but also a testament to how cask settle, there is definitely a sweet spot. Off cask, it really opens up the flavor and aroma."
"Bright orangey apple juice pour at BSP on the Bell's Launch Day. Typical cask-like flatness with just some glistening white bubble film on the flat head. Very nice brightness, though."
"a: gold color, thick foamy head with layer upon layer of lacing, lots of bubbly activity"
"Reviewed from notes, 5/8/09. Keeping in mind that this beer isn't the ""freshest"" it can be. Thanks to mikereaser for this 6er."
Appearance: Poured from a growler like milk into a pint glass. Very nice head - about a finger/half worth of head - nice lacing around glass - Nice Mango colored goodness.
"Got this one kind of magically. A little elf told me of a store where it existed in SoCal. So even though it's not super-fresh, I'm super-amped."
Picked this up at the Bell's kickoff at the Charleston Beer Exchange.
"I realize this bottle is several months old, so read this review with that in mind. Hey, people want to know what its like with a little age on it, right?!"
This was the first beer that made me shit my pants and realize that beers could be extreme. Boy...how times have changed.
"12oz bottle, batch 8907. Mostly clear deep gold-orange color with a small white head that leaves some spotty lace. Citrus, melon rind, alcohol, sweet honey, and spicy herbal hop aroma. Quite sweet, with a touch of honey and bread. Some fruity, citrucy hop flavor and a finish that almost gets dry and bitter until the sweetness comes back in and sticks to the back of the tongue. Medium bodied and rather light feel overall, which helps to partially mitigate the sweetness. This could use either a ton more hops, or a much dryer finish. I'll stick to two hearted. "
Had on the Firkin at the Bell's Eccentric Cafe.
Nice copper orange pour with a thick and fluffy white head that left lace cling to the glass.
"Pours a hazy copper to orange with a pillow-like white head containing extremely dense carbonation bubbles, leaving a faint lacing in its path which clings to the glass."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an American pint glass. The off white head really went over the glass, had to give to a minute to reside before I poured the rest from the bottle in. The lacing that was left behind was really nice and clung to the glass till the last hoppy sip. The colors was a glowing amber, a bit darker then most DIPAs. Sweet hops come out in the aroma, but not a smack you in the face aroma. But the hops hit you big time in the taste. Even though the hops are big up front it finishes smooth and clean leaving you ready for the next tasty sip. If this guy wasn't around 10% I could drink it all night, but I could see myself getting in trouble trying to do just that."
Poured into a pint for review.
"About as smooth as an Double IPA can get. Incredible grapefruit smell, nice dark golden color with extended lacing. Paid $4 for a single but well worth it - looks like I need to drink these fresh. So much hops, but nothing that overpowers you to not enjoy it as a beer. Would be one of my favorites for the summer, but a bit on the pricey side to be a regular staple. Very good, however. Another great performance from Bell's."
"Pours a brilliant, glowing, crystalline golden orange -- the hue of a brand new penny with an incredibly delicate look to it. Cream-colored head that didn't froth up much and reduced to a ring and surface flotsam in moments -- I would have liked more head volume and stickiness, but what a beautiful body to the liquid itself. The second pour is somewhat darker with more haziness, but still gorgeous."
"batch 8907, tasted from a bottle at almost 4 months old in sam adams 'perfect' glassware."
Christmas in my nose.
"I can't get this beer in Maine, but did find it on a trip to Tampa. It certainly lives up to it's reputation. In a pint glass it has that slightly hazy orange color I expect from IIPAs. The aroma is just wonderful, a nice balance of sweet honey and tart citrus. Taste followed form, sweet malt and grapefruit. A nicely balanced, incredibly smooth beer. The alcohol is well-hidden, but I think two of these at a time are my limit."
"Reviewed this previously, but not out of the bottle."
"Poured from a bottle during an Imperial IPA ""competition""; faced off against DFH 90 Minute IPA."
"Bottle, batch # 8912, which was born of Jan 13, according to the website. So, over three months. The beer is underwhelming. Aroma is hoppy, possibly a little solventy/resiny. Taste is sweet, almost to the point of cloying. There is a bitter grapefruit rind finish. I believe this is my first DIPA and I find it oddly disappointing. Given my anticipation of bitterness, I thought I would welcome a sweet malty backbone more. But it might actually be too sweet. 10% alcohol? That will be a hoot when I try to stand up."
"Batch #8907, bottled in January according to the website, drank in April. Had high hopes for this one but not initially floored as I thought I might be. It's only 3 months old, but perhaps it's starting to fade a bit. My question is, should a beer lose it's quality that quickly? I dunno... but I will definitely seek out an uber fresh sample of this when available and compare it with these notes. As is this beer pours a sturdy looking amber color, darkish, with a small head fading pretty quickly. Smell is hoppy, citrus mostly, orange peel, but then dominated by a sweet maltyness. Very heavy on the malt as well in the taste. I'm not getting destroyed by the hops here. A vanilla sweetness and an orange citrus flavor prevail over everything else. Perhaps a little too sweet from the added honey. And a little boozy to be honest. If there was a bigger hop presence this may be covered up but it's just not holding up. Malty, sweet, sticky, chewy, kind of clumsy. Not trying to knock this beer as I may not have the freshest example (but I did have three bottles to make sure) but it isn't world class in my book."
Yellow/Golden with a sizable off-white/tan head. Laces moderately well.
I've been meaning to review this bad boy for a while now...finally got the chance.
"12oz. Usually I carefully decant Bell's products, but not this one. Poured a cloudy but bright amber color with a rocky, off-white head with good retention and a nice lacing. Huge floral hop and pine aroma coupled with grapefruit and some tropical mango and pineapple. Mouth-feel is thick and juicy, some carbonation that allows the flavors to cover the entire palate. Juicy ripened pineapple and grapefruit explode on the first sip, it's sweet like fresh honey, but the bitter piny hop finish is fantastically balanced with the malty sweetness. Alcohol is well concealed. This is an amazing ale. Always a favorite of mine."
Appearance- Slightly clouded amber with a creamy white one finger head. 
"Poured a 2f white head, with nice lacing. Fairly clear, amber/orange color and light carbonation present. "
"On tap in Bloomington, IN. Had this some time in January 2009."
Thanks to DoctorDog for this one in a trade. 
"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy golden amber color with a small off-white head that quickly disappears, pretty good lacing. Aroma is mainly hops; pine, resin, grapefruit, and a decent caramel malt backbone. Flavor is also mainly hops. I get grapefruit, resin, honey, and a touch of alcohol. Very strong bitter finish puts action to its name. Very good beer, warms pretty well also."
on tap 3/19/09.
A- Pours beautiful golden/amber color with a thin off-white head that leaves great lacing. 
"Pours clear gold, with a head that dissipates quickly, retaining a thin layer of foam and leaving a little lacing on the glass. Smells of sweet hay and citrus, with some brown sugar sweetness. A concentrated grassy hopslam it is. It has a strong citrus, I'd say grapefruit flavor, yet a balanced sweetness level. Most of the taste comes out at the beginning. Though concentrated, it is a well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This is one to make you sad when the glass is empty and definitely glad to have another."
"This is one appropriately named beer. Pours a hazy golden-orange and the nose is, well, hoppy. Lots of citrus right in your face. This is one you can smell across the room. In my book, that's a good thing."
Poured into a Maudite Snifter yielded a Honey color with a tall white head that dissapated to a thin layer rather quickly. 
"Pours nicely with an ok amount of head. It stayed around for a while and laced well. The rest of the beer didn't lace too much. Smell was intoxicating. The only imperial IPA with more citrus and robust hops smell that I have had is Pliny. After the amazing smell that didn't hold back a bit I was expecting more from the taste. I have a bottle back from an early January batch and i have heard that the taste is better with freshness on this one. Citrus fruits, hops, and honey dominate the beginning and middle but the end of the flavor is pretty big on malt and alcohol. It's pretty good on mouthfeel but it's a little light. i will definitely try this one again next time it is available."
"Clear-amber/orange topped with two fingers of off-white head that hangs around forever. Smells like citrus-hop-candy: sweet, caramel, citrus, bright, honey. Flavor is too sweet for me. Balance is close to what it should be, but sweetness of malt (honey?) is too much for the style. Hops are great both in aroma and flavor. Fairly light feel for the style. Not too cloying or syrupy. Easy-to-drink for such a big beer, but sweetness prohibits slows things down."
A: Pours a hazy yellowish amber color. Provides a small white foam head with decent lazy. 
"Batch 8907 Bottled on January 6, 2009"
An overwhelming smell of hops. Almost like a garden's fresh topsoil. Smells like spring flowers. 
"My favorite double IPA to date. Pours a nice amber color, smell sensation with citrusy hops and some I couldn't describe. Just delicious. The hop taste is just perfect. I was glad I decided to split this six pack because the alcohol was so well disguised I would have been in a world of hurt later. My friend is not really a beeradvocate and he loved it. Must try!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass..Pours a nice coppery hue. Aroma is overwhelmingly pleasant, with some citrus, piney, and earthy notes pleasant. I'm guessing several types of hops were used here, with a surplus being put on the aromatic hops. The flavor is extremely balanced well. The hop flavor profile seems to lean on the citric side, and it isn't nearly as imposing as I anticipated, which is not a bad thing here. I wouldn't guess this was any where near 10%. The malt profile really comes through well, and I the taste of honey works rather nicely. All in all, definitely on my top 5 IPA's because of its balance."
"Poured a nice orange/golden color, like the color of brandy. Had a nice white head which retained good lacing at first but subsides as the beer settles."
"I received this bottle from Bruisin Ales in North Carolina, great transaction, I will definitely be doing more business with them in the future. "
Reviewed from Notes. Tasted 2/26/09 - Thanks to fellow BA Speakorspasm for hooking me up with this one.
"This beer looks great, with a burnt orange color and a nice, big beige head. It's aroma is phenomenal. It is loaded with floral and citrus hops. The flavor is much the same. Such a bold, spicy and citrus hop flavor. There is also some good malt sweetness and you can definitely taste the honey that was added. It is sufficiently bitter for a DIPA. It has a full flavor and medium body. I don't crave more than one of these beers in one sitting but it is not out of the realm of possibilities since it is so good overall."
I received this bottle in a trade from alleykatking. Thanks Josh!
12 ounce bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip.
"Huge thanks to johnmichaelsen for this one. 12 oz bottle poured into my Delirium snifter, Hopslam is a chill hazed pale orange with creamy off-white head"
Appearance: A deep golden color with light carbonation rising from the bottom. A medium white foamy head stuck around the edges for some time.
"No freakin' kidding!! I can see why it is so loved. This stuff is amazing. The tag is never a cheap one, but I can see a budding romance starting with this stuff."
A - Amber with a huge head that retained quite well and laced as it receded
"A--Pours a golden/copper color with a slight bit of murkiness. Near white head was about a finger tall, although I don't think I gave it a very good pour. It recedes but doesn't disappear. Good lacing down the glass."
Served in a tulip from a 12oz. bottle.
"A: Pours a golden amber, I only got about a pinkys worth of head, but there's some pretty decent lacing. This beer has high turbidity."
"Poured from a bottle into a normal pint glass the head is great and lasts, two fingers. The color is hazy and a yellow orangish- golden. "
A - Cloudy like ice tea with a beautiful head that poured. I got about 3 fingers of head on this brew and I have to say it was a pretty sight to behond. Very nice lacing as well.
Drinking as I write this. Just received in the mail.
"Beautiful dark amber glow coming out of the glass on this one. The head coats the top of the beer heavily, almost like a lid waiting to be popped. The smell is so full of grapefruit and citrus is incredible. Very nice sweetness in the back too. This is my favorite taste in the world. Lovely hop oil provides a strong bitter citrus, but right behind that is sweetness from the honey that is brewed in this one. This has a great sticky mouthfeel, but goes down easy. Best drinkability of any 9% and above I've ever tasted. Amazing beer."
Acquired in a trade with alleykatking...thanks Josh!
"Bottle thanks to mreusch. Pours a slightly cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma of hop oils, citrus, and grapefruit. Flavor is sweet and malty with lots of citrus hops. Full-bodied and not too sticky/sweet as some IIPAs tend to be. Hopslam lives up to its reputation. Quite tasty!"
Was fortunate enough to catch this beer on cask @ the Buckeye Brew Engine. Poured into a snifter.
"The nose on the beer is piny, with a slight resinous hint. There is also a huge amount of citrus/grapefruit that come through at the end. The beer has a nice dark gold colour with a nice centimeter head. The flavour of the beer is immense; there is a huge bitterness with a great citrus/grapefruit flavour. The fruity flavours are balanced with a sweetness that comes from the honey. These flavours come through initially, but the end of the beer flavours is quite spicy/resiny. There is a great balance between the flavours."
"12 oz bottle purchased as part of a 6 pack by my friend that we split. It was purchased in Bowling Green, KY and poured into a Hennepin Tulip to help concentrate the aroma."
"A - Eggshell white head standing a couple inches tall. The body is hazy, burnt orange with no carbonation. The lacing is unbelievable."
A - Pours to a two-finger off-white lasting head. The body has a somewhat cloudy light orange color. Excellent lacing which leaves rings around the glass as you savor every sip.
12oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. 
"Reviewing this brew at 6:00 pm on 3/27/09 for the nation-wide toast of the beer hunter, Michael Jackson, in honor of his birthday. (He passed way too early, and is now in that micro-brewery in the sky.)"
"The back label of this bottle tells me I'm in for ""a biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale"". I can't wait."
"Pours golden colour with gorgeous off-wite head. Smell - hoppy, fruity (pears, grapes), some citrusy flavours. Taste - hops and hops only, lots of them, but it is not as bitter as I expected. alcohol is hidden very well. pretty smooth, very flavourful, gerat stuff. Dangerously drinkable."
"This is a great Double I.P.A. in my opinion, the touch of honey gives it a great balance. I drank this one straight out of the bottle as i was too anxious to try after all the good things i've heard about it. I was a bit underwhelmed by it though. It didn't excite my tongue as much as it excited me to try it. It was extremely hoppy but didn't give me the west coast grapefruity and piney taste that i love. It may be a little too syrupy (too malty) for my taste. I have definately had better double IPA's, But overall i was very pleased with it and didn't have a problem finishing the case off with a few buddies."
a - slightly cloudy orange. Whispy white head.
A - Pours a cloudy copper with a decent off-white head that lingers for a bit. Lacing is plentiful.
"A- Bright golden honey, has a slight haze and a fluffy white head. Head fades slowly and is sticky enough to leave some nice lacing on the glass."
"A: Beautiful looking ruby red, burnt orange with a big frothy white head. Really nice"
"For my first real beer review, I'm taking pains to make sure I get everything right: correct glassware (properly cleaned and air dried), right temperature (approximated as best as I can), and an earnest attempt to completely cleanse my palate before I start. I have had some very good experiences with this beer in the past, and I want to do it justice and write the best review I can. I'm nervous and excited to get to work!"
"A- Bright orange/amber. With good head retention, turning into a thin ring."
"Updated review, 01/22/11, 12oz bottle into Portsmouth tulip. "
"Very interesting and delicious double. The aroma was very citrusy and you could even smell the sweetness before tasting. While drinking, you are hit with all of the hop flavor right away, but because of the added sweetness, the bitterness at the end is much less than you would expect from the up front taste. Probably not the best beer to drink multiples of, but great for sipping and great overall."
Classic double with an intresting twist.
"Big thanks to psychohops bob for sending me this as an extra. I love the label. Pours a brilliant orange with a frothy egg-white head. Smell is strong of grapefruit and pine. It's hard to sense much else until halfway through the glass at which point hints of sweetness can be slightly detected. At first the taste is almost entirely masked by a vigorous carbonation. However once the beer has calmed down and your tounge acclimated, the taste is grapefruit up front fading to a lingering, strong pine. Traces of the sweet honey show itself but it's never in control of the taste. Good beer."
Had on tap at Bell's in Kalamazoo.
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. Huge thanks to the fine folks at Brawley's for hooking me up with a bottle.
Thanks to Uwftke26 for the trade on this one. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours an orange light amber color with a thin white head and a light sticky lace left on the glass.
"A hazy amber color with a very nice white fuzz cap and decent lacing. The aroma is heavy flowery hops with some sweet malt hiding in the background. The flavor confirms the intense floral hops but a few mouthfuls eventually reveal the attempt to balance this brew with a touch of brown sugar and salty malt. Full bodied and lightly carbonated. I don't see this as a session beer with such thick constitution and heavy hops. But this a quality hop concoction. This was pretty heavy handed in the hops so it might take a couple tries to entirely warm up to it, a price I am happy to pay. Don't miss giving it a try!"
HopSlam pours an amber/light orange with a thin white-gold head. Minimal lacing.
Bottle bears batch No. 8908 which was packaged on 1-5-09 according to the Bell's website.
"Received a bottle of this from a friend. This is my 2nd Bell's beer ever, the 1st being the 2 Hearted Ale. The bottle says 10% ABV and after a few sips I want to question that. "
Bought this at Lone Hill Liquors
A fresh bottle...let see how this stands up to the draft version.
A - Slightly cloudy amber/orange color Small bright white head. Lacing on the glass. 
"Pours a nice orange-hue with a decent white head. Retention is poor but it laces well. Smells like spicy, citrus, lemon rid or something. The aroma isn't very powerful and I'm not sure if it's because the beer is a couple months old. Definitely has a decent hop bitterness bite, lacks in hop flavor. It's there but I'm not very impressed with it. The alcohol is subdued, which is nice and it has a nice mouthfeel and not too heavy in body. There is a balance of some malt sweetness there that helps out. "
"Good amber color that even had my Kalik/Corona drinking dad impressed and wanting to try it. This is definitely a hop-head beer, so I am quite happy with it. However, I think that although Hopslam gets massive hype (and is deserving of most of it) I can't escape the thought that there are a ton of west coast IPAs in this class, most notably similar is Green Flash West Coast. Still a great beer, easy drinking for the ABV, and satisfies my hop cravings."
A huge thank you to redbird for this beer.
Poured into a tall highball style glass provided by my hotel where I am consuming this in my room. 
"Pours dark golden bordering on amber with an off white head that has great retention and laces the glass beautifully. Smells majorly of HOPS! Sweet honey, piney and citrusy fruitiness compliment the hop bitterness. Pineapple and grapefruit come to mind."
"Most of the reviews here seem to agree that HopSlam is awesome, but I'm going to review this anyway so I can remember it since I can't get my hands on this that often."
"And that friend alex3891 is referring to (i.e., me) gives the HopSlam a comparable rating and review. "
"Batch 8912, which puts this at roughly 2 months."
"One of the best beers I have ever had the privilege of partaking. A stunning offering from Bell's- citrusy, pineapple, honey. Brilliant, blissful, simply put - Beer at its best. Definitely a good choice on tap, if available. Brings out the aromas and flavors that much more. Perfection!"
"12oz bottle poured into, appropriately enough, a Bell's pint glass. Batch 8949, packaged on February 9."
On tap at Beer Run. Always nice to try a beer like this on tap and see how it stacks up to the bottled version. Served in a 10 oz. brandy snifter.
"My first review! Got ahold of this in a cross-country trade, thanks Stephen!"
"Hopslam has a slammin' hoppy and piney aroma that smelled very sweet and fresh. I poured from a chilled bottle to glass which left a nice 1 ½ head. The color was a slight cloudy golden honey. It had a very complex body full of hoppy flavor with a twist of sweetness. Despite all the hop flavor and aroma it was not too overwhelming. If you are a hop fan then you will thoroughly enjoy this beer, as I did."
"Now were talking. This is my kind of beer. It had a very rich color and I could immediately smell the hops when it was placed before me. For having such a high ABV I was concerned this might be sweeter than I like, but the people at Bell's have loaded up on the hop goodness!"
"This was aggressively poured into a tulip. Nice golden color with two finger head that dissipates quickly, leaving a light lacing. Halfway through the head was almost completely gone along with the lacing. The final product looked like a glass of honey. "
Poured into a pint glass
Aquired via the amazing graciousness of the clerks at the Foodery in North Philadelphia. 
"got this in a trade with kiefdog, thanks for the chance to try this beer."
"The first of a long line of great cask beers at the ""Casks of March"" event at Rustico in Northern VA. Had to get it quick because it was gone in 40 minutes!"
Batch #8908
HopSlam? Ought to be called HotDamn!!!
"Just had this on cask at Rustico last night for their Glassware Giveaway event. Poured with no head, and was a hazy brushed gold color. Smelled fantastic. Ultra fresh hops, super clean, pineapple dominates, but also hints of pine and sour apple, solid honey sweetness. Taste is along the same lines as the smell. Definitely pure and clean hops, but not the exact flavor I enjoy best in a 2IPA. That's what kills this beer vs the hype for me. It's brewed excellently and tastes great, but just isn't my favorite flavor. Sweet honey malt helps balance the bitterness and makes it easier to drink, but it's still more of a sipping beer. Body was a little thick, but not as much as I was expecting from the cask. Basically no carbonation, and lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. Alcohol is nicely hidden, almost too well. Not sure if cask is worth the hype over regular tap? Overall, this was a pleasure to drink, but still not my favorite beer in the world."
On cask last night at Rustico.
"Bottle poured into Duvel snifter. Poured a murky golden copper color with a one finger quickly diminishing head. Smell of citrusy hops with some floral and small malt undertones that almost leaves a sweet taste on the back of your tongue. Quite possibly the best nose that I have ever experienced. For a double IPA, the mouthfeel is a little thin for my expectations. Taste of a normal double IPA, citrusy hops a thin malt body that leaves a sweet aftertaste maybe a little caramel is in there. Very drinkable beer. "
A- a thicker than normal IPA. Little head.
Impressive...most impressive.
"Very expensive six pack of this stuff. I think it may be well worth it, however. It's a beautiful honey-golden color with a thick dark white head that sticks to the glass the whole way down. It reeks of floral hops and citrus in the best possible way. A little sweetness and alcohol in the smell as well. The taste is remarkabley smooth considering the alcohol content. Grapefruity, hoppy, pine tree, and a touch of sweetness come together to form the best IPA I've ever had. Its medium body and texture is close to perfect and it's quite easy to drink. This may be the best beer I've ever had."
Served slightly chilled in my 12 oz. tulip.
4-22-10 (rating)
A- Like the label but the pour could have been more impressive. Color is similar to two heated ale; pale straw color yellow. Very little head with the pour but may be attributed to the temp of my refrigerator.
Reviewed from notes so sorry if brief.
I've heard so much about this beer that I had to fork over the $18 for a six pack. 
"Hopslam has an extremely floral nose and taste. As one the best DIPAs I've had, I highly recommend it. However, at 10% ABV it's tough for me to drink more than two. Note: that this is one of Bells seasonal beers and is only available for a short time beginning in early January."
A- Pours a nice golden-amber with moderate head. Pretty.
Thanks to kirok1999 for this one. I've been waiting to try this for some time.
Pours a clear bright light gold with a small mostly white head. Smells only of thick citrusy hops that is reminiscent of a west coast hop bomb. First sip is all grapefruit. It is thick and strong with the flavor of Indian River grapefruit upfront and dominating. A bitter finish compliments well as the mouth puckering hop quality is so very loved.
"Well, I am not what you would call a ""hop head"", so I normally pass on DIPA's, etc. I figured I would give this one a go, since it gets so much praise (despite 15 dollars a sixer at the local Total Wine in Clearwater)."
a: clear amber with a light white foam on top and a center column of tiny white bubbles
Hopslam yes! Why not try this beer? I has everything you want in an ipa... plus more?
"Tried this for the first time. A 12oz bottle poured into my pint glass. It pours a darker goldish brown with a fairly small head, no bigger than 1 finger. The smell is very citrusy with a hint of pine needles. Upon the first sip, the beer is fairly bitter, and very citrusy and grassy as the smell would foreshadow. It goes down extremely well, better than I thought it would. The alcohol is there, but hidden very well for the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is prtty bitter and acidy, in a good way. Overall, what a fantastic brew! I will definitely be back for more of these, when I have the money for them! Only wish they were cheaper!"
A - Light amber color. Slightly hazy appearance. 1/2 inch head which dissolves into lace on the side of the glass.
Batch #8912. Quite fresh - had just arrived from the distributor. 
"Thank you JoBoTo for the beer trade... I am from Oregon, and can't get this stuff anywhere... so I sent off some Hop Henge and Slipknot among others for this tasty number. 12 oz. bottle. Got more than I expected, and I appreciate that."
S = Strong pine aroma.
"This is one of the best American beers I've ever had. Hands down. I'm from Michigan (although I've never been to Bell's), and it makes me proud that beer is one thing my state does right. It stands up well to all other IPAs that I've been able to drink, including my all-time favourite, Deuchar's IPA. It's a shame this beer is only available in January and February. I personally have stocked up."
Poured into a pint glass. Clear orange with a nice head and wonderful lace.
"this is one of the best beers for a beer lover to drink. it has everything one would want in a craft brew. for starters, the wonderful smell hopslam puts out. once you are lucky enough to taste it, the hops are definitely there, the smell and flavor follow all the way down into your stomach. with the high abv. i would possibly expect a less drinkable beer but quite contrary this beer tastes excellent and i would drink it all the time if i could"
2009 vintage poured a very nice gold color with an inch thick head. This has to be one of the best smelling IIPA's around with a strong fruit and citrus background. The alcohol is well hidden at first sip and the hops dominate on the way down. This beer is deadly but one of my personal favorites. Very highly recommended if you can find it fresh.
P- Market Cross Pub in Carlisle
"Pours a clear sunflower gold, with slight orange highlights. Head is a full 3 fingers of perfectly white foam. Head retention is moderate. Leaves sticky lace all over."
12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.
"12 oz bottle purchased at Capone's in Norristown, PA. Drank from a pint glass."
"Pours out an orange color, almost amber. Very perfectly clear, with a 1cm white head, with minimal lacing. Looks just to style, I like the appearance. The smell is filled with fruity hops, and the honey sweetness is very present. There's also the entire range of hoppy smells in there, which is nice: orange zest, herbal, floral, earthy, leafy. Very nice, but not the most completely overwhelming nose of hops. The taste is very rich. I get loads of fruity hops with quite a nice grapefruit sweetness. The bitterness isn't actually overpowering - I can find some balance here, and there is plenty of hop flavor. I love the late hops. The taste of the honey on my tongue is really nice, adds a bit of complexity to go with the hops. The mouthfeel is right about what you'd expect, full of hops, nice carbonation, not much of an alcohol burn. I found myself diving back for sip after sip, and the 10% didn't hit me until the end."
"pours a nice honey color without much of a head. it doesn't have a lot of carbonation, and the small head dissipates quickly, sort of anti-IPA of it. smell is great, has a wonderful piney hop aroma to it, maybe even a hint of mango to it, according to my fiancee. taste is really good, has a distinct bitterness to it of course but also has a strange mild maltiness to it, the higher alcohol content definitely warms me up. we just started to get bells in this area so i look forward to trying their other beers."
Appearance: This beer pours a beautiful crystal clear amber with a pure white white fluffy head. The head settles rather quickly to a nice contrasting white lacing.
"The smell and initial taste is similar to eating a good, pungent French cheese. The hops hit you up front and finishes sweet and runny, as opposed to the initial subtlety of the Stone Ruination IPA, which finishes more peppery and bitter. "
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip, batch # 8911."
"Wow... this was great. I had this one at Stable in St. Louis and it did not dissappoint. I have had out of a bottle and on tap. This, in my opinion was not too different. Like any beer out of a cask it was less carbonated, which is very good, and the flavor were more prevelant. Definitely had the grapefruit hop, and the honey finish on the end. I was lucky enough to get in on the ass end of the cask and the pour, and I do mean pour as the spout had been removed at that point, was like a blond mud. It was an experience that I thoroughly enjoyed and hope to get the same next year."
Bottle in the mail courtesy of my best friend. 
"A long time in coming, this one. I wish the ground would look like the top of this beer in the morning, but one can always wish, it's been the same since childhood. I've seen snow but a few times in my life. It reminds me though. The thick sheet of lacing, like the window from inside a car. A cloudy orange, the glow from our wood stove as I was growing up. A ranch-style house, I think it sucked more heat out, that was the only warm room. It drops off after a couple minutes, looks like soap-bubble-jello, wiggling in the glass as I tap on the keyboard."
Had the traditional pale color of hazy golden blond with a nice 2 fingers of creamy white head that stayed around for the entire beer and left quite a bit of lacing.
"Served up on tap at Macnivens in Indianapolis in proper glassware (a snifter with the bells logo). Sadly, a smokie environ impaired an already weak sniffer, but in between whaffs, the citusy hops came through. A fairly clear golden color with nairy a hint of carb but sticky lace clings to the glass throughout. Nice hop bite yet creamy mouthfeel. The hops are piney yet the citrusy aspect and smooth mouthfeel make for a harmonic convergence of flavor. That was lame, but its accurate. This is a solid DIPA and worthy of all the hype from my fellow BA's. I enjoyed it so much, I smuggled four bottles in me luggage after buying some at a local packie."
Pours lightly cloudy and pale orange-brown. Thick white head dissipates quickly but leaves a nice amount of lacing.
"first, HUGE thanks to Jerad, The Stable, and Bells for everything !!! this is my 2nd review because from a cask, this is a very different beer"
"Poured from 12oz bottle batch #8911 into Bell's pint glass. Pours a light amber golden color with a half finger of frothy head that leaves gobs of retention on the sides of the glass. Smell is all grapefruit. I don't know how else to describe it but grapefruit citrus smell with maybe a hint of biscuitlike malt hidden deep. Taste is citrus hops up front(grapefruit, hints of banana and orange peel) followed seemlessly by smooth biscuitlike malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and not as dry as most DIPAs are. Drinkability is amazing for such a high ABV beer. Alcohol is perfectly hidden and kind of scary this could be so easy drinking. This is the best DIPA I've ever had, ever. This beer deserves a perfect 5. If this were available year round I'd stop trying new beers and this is all I would drink(at least for this style). In my opinion a perfect DIPA."
"On-cask at the Stable poured into tulip. As expected from a cask, a short-lived head topped a bronze hue, unfiltered haze and slightly reddened. With a fully hopped nose I smelled this three times before sipping because it really did fill the senses. "
"Appearance: Transparent reddish-orange body, thick white head that leaves some lacing. Impressive quantity of head considering the ABV. Some carbonation in the glass. "
Poured into a tulip glass.
"Beautiful clear gold, creamy off-white head. Pretty good lacing."
I'm not sure what I can say about this one that hasn't already been said. I've had this on tap a few times and always was extremely impressed although usually not in any condition to be reviewing anything. 
Pours hazy copper-orange with a crisp white head that leaves globs of sticky lacing.
"been on a big hop kick lately, and I am so glad this baby fell into my lap."
Serving type: BTL
"Tried this for the first time today. A 12oz bottle poured into my pint glass. It pours a darker goldish brown with a fairly small head, no bigger than 1 finger. The smell is very citrusy with a hint of pine needles. Upon the first sip, the beer is fairly bitter, and very citrusy and grassy as the smell would foreshadow. It goes down extremely well, better than I thought it would. The alcohol is there, but hidden very well for the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is prtty bitter and acidy, in a good way. Overall, what a fantastic brew! I will definitely be back for more of these, when I have the money for them! Only wish they were cheaper!"
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. This beer pours a lovely golden color and forms a 1/2 inch off-white head that minimally reduces to a full covering. No sediment and fizz is noted in the transparent gold color.
"Finally had this one on tap at Whistle Binkies on the Lake. Small head on tap, but still had some decent lacing. Smell was just as good as from the bottle. Nothing pure hop bliss. Pine and citrus all the way. Taste? Well, what can I say? It's delicious. So much orange, grapefruit, and various citrus flavors backed up by some pine resin and a very solid, very sweet backbone. Do I like it better on tap? Well, probably not. The first time I had it out of the bottle (which my bottle review implies) was just magical. I can't see that first experience being topped. The only difference was lighter carbonation from the tap than from the bottle. Still fantastic, nonetheless. Appearance and a bit of aroma is the only thing lacking on tap compared to from the bottle."
Not sure why I haven't reviewed this yet...
A - This beer poured a golden amber color that produced a fluffy white head that had good retention and left a decent amount of lace on the side of the glass
Appearance - Slightly hazy orange/yellow brew with a frothy off-white head that dissipates quickly.
"This beer poured a beautiful golden amber with a finger or two of head. Fluffy and light like whipped butter atop the amber candy below. The smell isn't as pungent as I expected, but is complex with a hint of the hoppy bitterness to come. The flavor is quite nice, and quite well rounded. Hops up front with a hint of the honey sweetness are followed by a nice hoppy bitter finish. Crisp and refreshing. This will be an excellent hot day beer and a very nice example of what I like in a DIPA. Worth the too much I paid for it."
"Appearance - Pours a slightly cloudy amber with a full, sticky head and nice lacing."
"I have experienced this beer on tap many times, but this was actually my first time buying a 6 pack of this stuff. I cannot believe the exorbitant price of hops. Oh well..."
"Tried this beer for the first time this year at D's Six Pax and Dogz in Pittsburgh, I was thrilled to find it there on tap. Arrived at the table a beautiful golden orange with nice lacing on the pint glass. The nose is so tremendous, I just had to share it with those sitting at the table with me, and all agreed - very hoppy and floral, with notes of fruit, especially pineapple. The taste didn't disappoint, with a great deal of fruity hops on the tongue right off the bat. Finishes off so smoothly that you'd never know about the high ABV. Feels smooth and creamy in the mouth, extreme drinkability - enough so that I immediately went next door to buy a whole case for the fridge. Always look forward to the release of this beer."
"Had this beer for the first time on tap at ""Teresa's Next Door"" in Wayne PA. It was part of their Double IPA day. It was poured into a 12 oz. goblet. The color was a deep reddish amber color with about an inch head. The nose was strong of hops and fruits. The taste was outstanding and tastes as good as it smells. It is often compared to Russian River's Pliny the Elder but Bells has been more consistent with flavor and appearance. The drink ability was excellent and I ended up having 3 glasses :). A highly recommended double IPA!"
12 oz. into a snifter/ no freshness date
Had this on cask at Uncle Mike's. Thanks Bells!
In a snifter:
"Thanks to my friend Jim for buying me a pint at WB's this evening. Nice to find on tap here in our home town. Now, to the review..."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into Samuel Smith pint glass. Bright clear golden orange, 1"" frothy bone white head. Sticky spotty lacing remains along with a thick foamy cap of head. Aroma is sweet floral honey, earthy piney orangey citrus. Taste is outstanding, sweet floral honey up front, bitter grapefruit in the back, long bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and full, finish is long and astringent. A glorious beer. So easy to drink if you love the hops."
"I have only had this wonderful beer on tap. Not complaining, the best way to get it if you can."
This beer poured a nice clear orange color with a thick and creamy long lasting off white head that left some nice sticky lacing.

Had both bottle and on tap
Was lucky enough to walk into my local distributor to be greeted by the 2 cases they would receive this year. Easy decision to pick one up. Took it home and poured into a glass after letting it warm on top the kegerator for 20min or so...
Thanks tjmodica for hooking me up with a bottle of this stuff.
Served from a bottle into an American pint glass.
"EVERY YEAR I LOOK FORWORD TO THIS BEER. ANY TIME ONE BOTTLE HAS THE SAME AMOUNT OF HOPS THAT SIX CASES OF BUD DOES THAT IS A GOOD BEER. THIS YEARS HAS A SOFT PINE AROMA WITH A HINT OF HONEY. THE TASTE HAS A RICH GRAPEFRUIT AND ACIDIC FLAVOR. IT HAS A HAZY APPERANCE IN THE GLASS, BUT THE TASTE IS SMOOTH."
12oz bottle poured into hi-tech Sam Adams glass
Poured into a pint glass. Clear amber color with a good carbonation. Poured with a half finger head that dissipates rather quickly. 
"A- Off-white two-finger head that stuck around for a decent amount of time...ends up hazy gold...lacing started strong, but really wasn't there by the end of the beer"
"Well here I go with my very first review, & this is my last Hopslam other than what I have cellared away for a while. "
"Ashleys in Ann Arbor, on tap. Great beer, taste smell and eveything else. On thing is for sure if that it's got a very green flavor, all those good hops. Currently I'm sitting in the bar typing this review and let me tell you"" this is a serious brew""(Bigal723)."
Thanks to Yetiman420 for trading me this one.
Notes from Super Beer Sunday '09. Bottle from a recent trade poured into a Lagunitas pint glass.
"Trade bottle received from crazynelson. Really nice beer, has a nicely floral and piney mix in the nose that brings with it a sweet kick. Shows the hops off in a lovely platform. Glad I got to try this highly sought after beer. "
"Had a couple of these from so recent trades, "
A: Orange/gold color. Poured a 3 finger billowy white head with excellent retention. Laced in big sticky gops that slowy coated the inside of the glass.
"My my what have we here. I have been seeking this out as I am an extreme hophead, and this met every expectation and more. In fact, the only two IPAs to date that I enjoyed better by memory were Hop Stoopid at the EBF last year, and Shorts anniversary ale grapefruit version."
Bell's HopSlam Ale
"Got this in a trade with a buddy of mine. Poured into a pint glass, the appearance is a very tempting golden opaque color, exactly like that of expensive honey."
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a red plastic cup. I know it doesn't seem right but I have no clean glasses so it will have to do. 
This is the quintessentail imperial IPA. A nice golden color poured into a Bell's snifter. A big hop nose that doesn't over whelm you. This is a big IPA but it drinks very smooth. It does not have an over the top IPA taste it comes across almost creamy with a very subtle bitterness. There are a lot of breweries that go for big IPA's but this is the most drinkable and I can't think of another beer in the midwest that people anticipate and love more then Hop Slam.
"I know, I know another damn review for a Hopslam but hey. If you do a side by side, you gotta review both."
"Ale was poured into a pint glass. At first I noticed how little carbonation emanated from the beer as I poured it. A small white head appeared which quickly laced away. The beer is a golden color with some orange highlights....Smells strongly of hops with some mild spice and honey. Taste's very powerfully of hops, rather bitter, but not unpleasant. Slightly sweet as well, from the honey along with some clove. This beer is not as resiny as many other strongly hopped beers, which leaves a very pleasant mouth feel."
"Five of us passed this lovely beer around the table, and each person gave an immediate ""WOW"" upon smelling. I can't remember the last time I saw so many smiles around one beer. "
Thanks to Traquairlover for this bottle.
"Huge thanks goes out to a BA among BAs, joe1510 for sending these my way."
I had this beer shipped to me in New York from West Lakeview Liquors. Pours a deep orange color with a small white fizzy head. The smell got me excited for this one. I could tell I was in for a citrusy hops explosion. I totally got it. This is the citrusy DIPA from my dreams. If it gets better than this then I have yet to see it. Totally worth the shipping costs.
"I was at my local beer and wine store picking up some well known and great tasting IPA's when the clerk mentioned the Hopslam and how they sold out in hours. It was then my mission to find this beer that was so sought after in the NOVA area. A Total Wine in the area had one case that someone had just canceled. After picking up two six packs and letting it chill over night, i savored this gift from the beer gods and it made me sing."
12 oz bottle into sniffer...
New review: 2011 batch
what a great beer. needs more credit. it tastes like liquid gold. needs to be a year round beer. i love it. what a great beer. this year tastes like grapefruit. with a golden color. the smell it wonderful. i would drink it over and over again. its a little spendy but worth every penny
"Bottle from 6-pack packaged on January 12, 2009 poured into pint glass."
Poured from a bottle into a standard pint.
"Bottle Inspection: Great label! Dude getting the hop body slam, sign me up. Honey! This just keeps getting better. 10% abv.! Talk dirty to me. Indecipherable date code?!! I take back half the fantasies I've had about you."
"Wow, incredible beer. On tap at Stub and Herbs in Minneapolis. Served up in a Bell's Goblet."
"Oh good lord, what a beer. I can see why this is talked about so much and even compared to Pliney. It is worthy of that comparison. Thanks very much to psunate for the trade. This one will not be taken off my want list anytime soon. Whoever gave this one a D- must have had a bad bottle or something. This beer is objectively superb."
"I've heard a lot of great things about this beer so I was excited to try it. Ended up picking it up while on a trip to see a friend. It poured a hazy orangish, light amber, off gold color. Had about a one finger head that faded not to long after pouring. The smell is great! Very hoppy and piney. After taking a sip the mouthfeel is good, not light at all but not heavy just right really. The taste is very sweet because of the honey and the hops stand out nicely, piiney and a bit citrusy. The flavor is very good. With a 10% ABV it's hidden very well making this beer very very drinkable. I could easily drink these! In the end I'm glad I went out of my way to grab a six pack of Hopslam up. Very well worth the $17 I paid for it."
"To start off, I am very fortunate to live in Mid-Michigan, as the Bell's Brewery is only about two hours away."
Big Thanks to Hophead101 for the hookup on this. Can't believe this is the first time I've tried this brew.
"I've been waiting to try this for a while, finally had a friend bring some up from Milwaukee."
"Was really looking forward to having a ""rare"" Hopslam. So maybe I'm just feeling let down."
"12 oz bottle, thanks to Cindirene's in Ayden, NC. Served at around 45 F. Poured into a big snifter. Pours an amber-gold with about 1/2 an inch of head, which dissipates slowly and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma heavy on the citrus - grapefruit mostly. But its not as intense as I was hoping. Some honey and alcohol aroma as it warms. Taste is very nice - the first thing that hits you is a massive amount of hop flavor, again very citrusy. The finish is actually pretty sweet, mostly what comes through is the honey (which is an awesome addition to this beer). Surprisingly, I found this beer to be not that bitter at all, and the honey really helps smooth everything out. The drinkability is off the charts for a 10% beer, I could easily burn through a 6-pack of this in a night."
"Pours a nice, if light, copper color, with some good initial head (quickly fading) and a wee bit of lacing. Nice strong hoppy scent, floral and citrus (extreme amounts of grapefruit, which I honestly don't care for as a melon). Nice deep hoppy taste from beginning to end, although the pine and the grapefruit battle a bit, with the grapefruit winning out. Goes down fine for a higher ABV beer, although there's a little roughness in it. A nice double IPA, there are better and worse."
"Pale golden-orange, fairly decent head, decent lacing."
On tap at World of Beer in Westchase.
a: very light pour with minimal head
"A: Poured an amber color, very clear, light tan small head which dissipated quickly. Lacing was left on the glass."
"Beer pours a hazy light copper color with a nice head which disappears fairly quickly. The smell of this beer is really great. Some piney hops, but a really strong smell of lemon zest and some very noticeable grapefruit notes. There is something else in the nose that sets the smell apart, but I can't quite place it. Taste is bitter upfront before the honey-like sweetness balances on the mid-palate. Ultimately the hop bitterness reappears and lingers, and the alcohol becomes very evident. This is a winner. Very much enjoying this beer and like the fact that while it is a great IPA, it is slightly more unique than many other IPAs that are out there. I wish this was available in my area."
"Pours a hazy peach/orange color, which is the color of most of my favorite IPA's. Thin lacing around the edge. Ripe tropical fruit hops in the aroma, with a hint of alcohol. Plush, juicy hops-- dried apricot, ripe citrus and a gently drying, leafy green bitterness. A light malt profile with a soft sweetness brings some floral hints to the hops, but stays in the background and is well integrated. Hops are mostly on the flavoring end of the spectrum; bittering is on the light side for the amount of hop flavor in here. Finishes fairly dry with a fresh, citrus pith aftertaste. "
"Poured a 12oz. bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Visually, the beer is stunning with a reddish-orange hue. "
this is one of god's gifts to mankind
"Pours a clear copper color with a pretty nice slightly off-white head that has awesome retention and leaves great lacing. The aroma is fresh, pungent, American hops. The taste has its own hop blast but it is matched with a nice maltiness. It is one of the piney-est beers I have ever had and has considerable bitterness. It feels much lighter in the mouth than its relative strength. Its got a medium body and finishes smoothly. Awesome beer!"
"Pours a pretty, clear, golden amber with a 2 finger creamy sudsy off-white head. Actually like white cake batter. There is tons of lacing left in the glass, its probably more like frosting in my glass."
"This beer tastes like a grapefruit. It's very good. It's golden brown, and it has a citrusy grapefruit smell. Hopslam tastes much different than I thought it would but its a good thing. I may have to edit this review when I am a bit more sober. Bells brewery is awesome. Try this beer....you will not regret it. It's worth every penny"
"Perfection in a bottle. This brew pours a radiant yellow orange liquid, floating a respectable head. Insane lacing sticks to the glass. Smell is a sweet citrusy pine aroma. Grapefruit and lemons. Taste is a tart citrus hop attack balanced quite perfectly by asugary honey note. This beer is perfect. 10% drinks like 5%. After every sip, my mouth was left wanting another. The bar has been set, this is the perfect DIPA for the citrus hop fiend."
Two Hearted's bastard of an older brother pours an impeccably clear orange/copper with a big white head that settles into a nice ring. Wads of lacing. Beautiful beer.
"This beer is starting to become a legend, I felt it necessary to finally sit down and review it with a fresh bottle in my hand."
on tap. looks amber-yellow but hard to tell in the dim bar. head retention was poor and disappeared in a minute or two.
"Finally picked up one of these. Poured from a bottle. Pours a nice thick offwhite head. A dark golden color. The smell is just wonderful, sweet citrisy scent. First, taste of sweet hops, then a wonderfull hit hop. Then a bit of warming sensation of the alcohol. Mouthfell good not too thick for this kind of beer. Overall a smooth great tasting beer but it will be a while till I buy another."
12 oz bottle brought by azagthoth yesterday.
"12 oz bottle thanks again to hwwty4 and served up in that DFH shaped pint. Well, been hearing quite a bit about this guy and now I have the honor. Lets do this."
Had this beer on tap at the always impressive Common Market in Charlotte NC. The golden color is consistant with a beautiful white head that you just know is going to smell amazing.
"Well, I could only justify buying a single of these bad boys and I've heard great things (albeit kind of scary things too. You know, things like, ""After I drank a pint all I could taste was hops for the next two hours...""). I'm looking forward to it, but let's see if I would actually considering paying 17 plus dollars for a sixer. Here goes..."
"notes from 1/20/2011: won't change any ratings, still an excellent beer. just noting the nose while very good does not blow a person away and, more importantly, the pale malty sweetness is so intense it makes me wish for more bitterness to balance it out. back to back against double trouble, the founders offering seemed to bring enough bitterness to give it the edge in drinkability. "
"poured into my duvel tulip,"
This is my 99th beer review. YAY!
"Reviewed out of a 12 oz. longneck bottle from the 2009 release and poured carefully into a 18oz. snifter. Translucent orange in color with a small head. Leaves ring of lacing on the glass. A surprisingly sweet smell for an IPA. The hops are only just detectable next to the grapefruit/honey aroma. Sweet on the nose and seems to oscillate between the sweetness of the honey and the bitterness of the hops. As you swallow, it slides smoothly down your throat and that sweet taste sets in for a few seconds, after which the hop taste takes over for good. This is one of the most flavor packed beers I have ever had, and I'm not just talking about hops! This is a perfectly balanced IPA on a level of greatness I didn't even think was possible. This will easily be one of my favorite brews of the year."
"Doing a side by side vertical tasting here of a bottle of the winter 2009 batch and also a bottle of the fall 2007 batch that has been sitting in my cellar for about 13 months or so now Both were poured out of 12 oz bottles into mugs. The appearance of both are identical. Both pour a slightly hazy golden/copper color with a bit of an orangish tint. Has a nice foamy white head that doesn't stick around for long. Both settled to a nice surface coating within 5 minutes of being poured. Both had very good lacing. The 2009 one had aromas of hops are that were strongly present followed by some citrus and a bit of malt. The 2007 one had a very similar aroma, but the hops were aroma was not quite as dominant and a bit more caramel malt aroma came through. For the 2009 one, tastewise this bad baby is dominated by hops, followed by orange and a bit of lemon, rounded out by some toasted caramel malt. The 2007 one has a fairly similar flavor. Obviously the hop bitterness isn't nearly as present as in the 2009, instead the caramel malt flavor is upfront, followed by a citrus flavor and is rounded out with hops. The hops still make their presence know though. Both have a crisp, full bodied mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink in a good way. Everyone should try this beer at least once! Can't way that one is better than the other, they are both great, but a hophead will probably like a fresh one more than an aged one."
"A: vigorous pour into a snifter yields a half inch head that quickly recedes to a lacing, dull copper with a white head"
Thanks again to bb8189 for the chance to try this awesome hop-bomb!!
Poured from a 12oz bottle to my Rogue pint glass.
"Pours a slightly cloudy reddish orange with a nice white head that laces fairly well. Smells of, guess what?, hops. Huge floral and citrus, lemon, orange, grapefruit and pineapple."
"A: Pours a thick, murky amber with a short but tight orange-tinted off-white head that peels down slowly leaving sticky sheets of lacing."
"Poured a slightly hazy amber orange. White creamy head displays great, sticky lacing. Whispy but substantial cap is settled on after nice retention."
Thanks to vwcraig for this one.
"12 oz bottle poured clear golden into a snifter. Slight to no head but wow, intense hop grapefruit hits instantly. First sip.. amazing bright citrus flavor hopiness. What comes to mind is biting into a red grapefruit. Leaves with a silky smoothness with slight carbonation. Amazing drinkability for the ABV. Great beer to satisfy the needs of the most demanding hop head. (Wish this was a year round offering)"
"Open bottle and smell...mmmm...Hops, lots of hops. Looks gorgeous in my glass. Orange-ish, brown. And that smell...damn!! First taste, hoppy grapefruit. That's all I can think of. Very smooth for the 10% ABV. Mellowed by the honey, I'm guessing. This tastes better than I remembered from last year. As a Hop Guy...this is heaven. I highly recommend this beer. Even with the hefty $17.99/6pk price. Remember...doing the math it's almost the same as $11.99 4pk and $5.99 for a 22oz. Rationalizing is an art."
"Pours a clearish light copper with a two-finger head that left lace on the glass. A mix of hops and some sweet malts in the smell. Medium-bodied with a huge hop bite that goes down smooth and finishes clean (I'm not used to that in a DIPA). I kept hearing about grapefruit in this beer and there is definitely grapefruit notes coming from the hops, for a drying yet also semi-sweet sensation. It is rather noticeable in this beer and I haven't had a DIPA that quite tasted like this. And while this along with sweet malts made for an interesting taste, the grape feeling wore on me a little."
Poured from a growler purchased at Roof Brothers in Paducah..Kane is the man!!
"I love this beer, and it is SO amazing fresh. Syrupy, bitter, sweet all at the same time. This is one crazy beer."
Sampled on tap at Coasters in Melbourne.
A - Clear golden color with a bright white head. It fades fast to leave a nice cap & laces wonderfully. Looks like a pint glass full of honey.
12 oz. bottled poured into a snifter.
12 oz bottle with no bottling or drink by date.
This reminds me a lot of DFH 90-Minute IPA. 
"This beer is amazing. Anyone who loves hops, IPA's, and good beer will love this beer."
Poured this into a large stemless wine glass. It poured with a smallish head nice orange color. Definitely visible signs of carbonation.
Received a 6 pack of Hop Slam in a trade with HopHobo. 12 oz. long-neck with a green label featuring an image of some pour bastard who has just been pounded in a gigantic hop cone avalanche of some sort. 
"A - One and a half fingers of bone white head on top of a slightly hazy, copper colored body. The head settles slowly and leaves a thick layer of lace clinging to the glass."
"A: Poured in to an imperial pint glass. Poured a very orange tinged clear gold, almost yellow at the bottom, darker orange at the top. "
12 oz into Nonic
"Appearance: poured with 2cm off white slightly fluffy head, that dissipated to a thin layer within 3 minutes and left a little lacing. The beer is a hazy golden color. "
Purchased at EV1 Liquors in Evanston. Poured from a 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. The batch number 8913 tells me that this was packaged on Jan 12th - pretty fresh.
"12 oz bottle. A bright barely cloudy dark gold pour. Smallish white head. Very floral aroma, fresh hops with just a hint of honey and malt. Pretty straight forward very hoppy, but there is some sweet malt with the honey, and some citrus and apple. Finishes real clean, for those that like a hop belch, this will do it for you. Tastes like a really really good pale ale. I was expecting this to be just a bite in the rear bitter beer, but it was quite well balanced and dangerously drinkable. The most drinkable double I've had. Was not an earth shattering experience, but I'm glad I tried it. Not sure it was worth the 15 for the sixer, but hopefully I can trade some of this."
Serving type- 12 ounce bottled poured into a Pisgah pint glass.
12 oz. bottle poured into a Sam Adams sensory glass
12oz bottle into nonic.
"Well, this is my first beer review here, and an excellent one to start with. After reading everyone elses reviews I half expected to see God with my first drink...my first drink was lacking, but after I let it settle a bit it was, well, exceptional. I'm a big Bell's fan anyways, heavy hops usually don't do alot for me, but I did really love this beer...and for over $17 for the 6 pack I should...think the review taped to the door added a few dollars to the price. "
First one of the year as I snagged almost the last case the store had. Upon poping the bottle wow I mean holy hops. Citrusy delicious hops. On the poor nice head good lacing and a beautiful slightly hazy amber gold. Taste fully of hops what did one expect good malt presence can taste the honey in the middle. Great easy drinking beer somewhat different from what I remember last years as but stellar none the less.
"I can smell 'em from across the table, those lovely hops. The aroma is rich, almost sexual, grapefruit and musk, honey sweetness. The taste is more of the same, but with the citrus bite really coming through on the front of the palate, and the honey notes lingering on. Lick your lips a couple of seconds after a sip, and I swear it's just like like you've been in the honey jar. "
A - Pours a nice golden hue with an offwhite/light yellow head. If you look closely you can see traces of suspended yeast from being slightly unfiltered.
This is my fifth go at this beer. Not in a row. But now I feel like I can review it.
"Nice head, very clear yellow, head leaves some lace but nothing special."
Had this on tap at Poor Phil's in Oak Park. They served it in a Bell's-branded tulip glass.
"HopSlam lives up to it's hype. I picked up a 12-pack from Chicago's south-loop Binny's. The bottle says ""brewed with honey"" and the influence is noticeable....in a very good and balancing way...more on that below."
A- classic burnt orange IPA color with a solid finger of off white head. Very nice lacing left on the sides of the glass. Small bubbles of carbonation can be seen rushing to the top of the glass.
"This is an amazing beer. A truly distinctive and memorable beer. My first sniff of this one will be forever etched in my mind. I don't think I have ever smelled such a wonderfully fruity, floral, tropical nose in a beer before. The character of the hop aroma in this is simply amazing. This beer truly has a ""bouquet."" The mouthfeel is big, full, and totally satiating. The expressions of the hops are just fascinating. So complex, so intriguing. If you are a hop head, you need to try this beer. One of the finest DIPAs you will find anywhere."
"Wow. I expected a big, in your face, strong IPA when I purchased this beer...which I would have enjoyed thoroughly. This was something altogether different and amazing. I have been a huge DFH 90 minute fan for a long time, and it has been my IPA go to. This has just beat the 90 unmercifully out of first position. "
"I love good, strong IPAs. When it comes to a good imperial IPA and a good imperial stout, I'm torn. This beer makes a darn good tug in the direction of the IPAs, that's for sure."
Batch 8908. Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. 
"Super whipped-up, agitated head of white froth, very sticky lacing. Brightly hued orange to yellow throughout, not fully transparent but clean and quite pretty. The nose is a citrus fest of pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime, if you can adjust to this you might be able to tease out pine resin, rose hips, nectarine, papaya and pineapple fruit scents, not much discernible malt-wise but doesn't feel out of balance, very credible lift in the nostrils. Medium-bodied, isn't bitter at all, more stings or pinches the palate than bites it. Same gargantuan element of pink grapefruit, tangelo, lime citrus, equally sweet and sour. The floral dimension a touch stronger, aided by the honey accents. On the other hand, any pine or charcoal flavors step back. Texturally, it's crisp and lively and built for speed, glides down the chute. No grassy nor herbaceous pucker, the hops taste fresh like you could wring them out with your hands. Carbonation shows a gentle but persistent hand. Real fun to throw back."
I love the hops and when I tied this beer my taste buds said HOLY CRAP!! The aroma when I opened it was a lot like grapefruit and hops. Then I poured it to see an orange haze which I expected more golden. I also expected to see the nice head but it teneded to recede quicker then expected. A nice semi-crisp medium bodied with a bit of oiliness resin. I expected a major bitterness but was surprised on how smooth it was for having so much hops. Don't get me wrong this is a very hoppy beer that made me pucker up like most IPAs and DIPAs. However it is still pretty smooth especially for having a 10% abv. Very well balanced and surprising smoother then expected. This is definitely one hellava great IPA. Thank you Bells!!
A: pours a clear appetizing orange with avery small white head
Hopslam 2010--1/10/10
"The first time a had a bottle of this, it must have been 2 years old... needless to say there was no hop aroma or flavor, I thought i may had gotten a bad bottle.... With all the fuss about hopslam this year i thought id give it another go. Damn, Im glad i did. "
Light and beautiful
"This beer is kind of like The Matrix: I had heard so much about it's awesomeness before I acctaully experienced it, that my expectations were really high, and when I finally saw the movie/drank the brew, I was like hell yes...but not blown away as I thought I would be. "
"A - poured into a Troegs Nugget Nectar pint glass (can anyone say heresy!) Poured a hazy brownish-orange, with a finger thick slightly off-white head. The bubbles are fine and aesthetically pleasing. I found myself leaning the glass over to watch the bubbles separate and form small islands of lacing. There is obviously something wrong with me..."
"Batch 8907, which according to their site was packaged 1/6/09. So still nice and fresh!"
Appearance: Pours a hazy orange with a half inch head and plenty of fizzy carbonation stuck to the sides of the glass and flowing up. the head recedes moderately quickly leaving a lunar-like landscape on the top of the beer and clumpy lacing.
Are there hops in this?
"had my bud pick me up a sixer when it came into friar tucks. fearing it was sold out, i was relieved and sooo excited to get it."
A: a light copper with an orange tint. has a hazy apearance to it. beautiful white head with picturesque lacing on the glass. head stayed throughout the beer.
"This beer pours an amber orange color with a small head that dissipates quickly. The smell is in your face HOPS! Also, pine and citrus with a huge grapefruit nose. The taste has huge citrus flavors - pinapple, orange and grapefruit with a touch of honey and alcohol at the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and coats the mouth with hop oil and has perfect carbonation. Drinkability is hindered only by the high alcohol content. Overall, My absolute favorite IPA. I could drink this all day if the alcohol and price were not so high."
"Appearance: This brew pours beautifully. A medium amber color with a tanish-almost-light-green foamy head. The hue is a little different, but it evokes the feeling that hops are literally force infused into this brew. Lacings are plentiful. Very interesting! I'm impressed."
"On tap at Brass Rail Deli in Campbelltown, PA on 1/26/09. "
A- Two inch light tan head that has great retention and beautiful lacing. This beer pours a golden yellow/light orange color 
Ratings posted are for BATCH #8277
12oz fresh bottle into the flying fish brewing glass. I wanted to dive right into this one and not waste any time or hops.
Golden with orange tinge. 3cm off-white head.
Popped off the top and immediately the aroma of orangey hops fills the air. 
"I was a little nervous walking into this beer. As a longtime fan of 2 Hearted the idea of bells making a ""seriously hoppy beer"" left me... well... concerned."
"12 oz. bottle, freshness stamp on case 1/6/09. Into a Chouffe tulip glass..."
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.

Pours a very nice golden with slight head.
"Picked up a six pack from Binny's in Schaumburg, IL."
"Hazy amber colored with a thick head that persists (even from a growler). smell is all hops - grapefruit and citrus. a little nose of biscuit in the back too. taste is a bit sweet up front, then the hops come in and balance and then back to a sweetness in the finish. notes of citrus, especially lemon and grapefruit fill this beer. alcohol is well hidden for 10%. Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy yet has plenty of carbonation."
"Wow. What a beer. Its hard for me to write a clear-headed review, But I'll give it a shot. Bottle poured into a standard pint glass."
Poured from a fridge temp bottle into a room temp glass.
A: Lightly golden colored. Good half inch head on top. good amount of lacing down the side of the glass.
A - Big white chunky fluffy head with excellent retention... Hazy orange honey color... Slight very slow distinctive carbonation... 
Got this beaut in a trade from d0b. thanks to him for something new and exciting.
"A peachy grapefruit flower punch to your traditional understanding of an IIPA. Definitely more of a citrus taste than last year. One of the best beers I have every had. For $16 a six pack, it better be. I wish there was a way to store and cellar this beer so that it could last until next year's release."
"Bell's Hopslam immediately brings thoughts of wildflower honey, bitter soapy hops, and the pith of an overripe clementine. Slightly medicinal tasting. Thick mouthfeel, but astringent and clean. Orange golden hue like viscous unfiltered honey; beautiful hue. Heavy body, warming. Notes of brown sugar, turmeric, molasses, whiskey on the nose. Not to be missed. If you are a fan of the Bell's brewing style, do not miss this beer. At 10%, I'm about half-way through my pint, and feeling it. "
I love Bell's and was really excited to try this one out. Thank you Bell's for continuing the seasonal in a terrible hop market.

"6 pack picked up at Heinen's, a local grocery for $17.99."
"Purchased at the Beeryard, Batch #8913. Poured into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint from a 12oz bottle."
"Poured into my DFH shaped pint glass, the 2009 version of Bell's infamous HopSlam Ale is bright golden copper and topped with a couple of fingers of soft bright-white foam. The head hangs around quite a while, settling slowly by consolidating its smaller bubbles into a soapy foam that clings to the glass in thick webs and stringy ribbons."

Poured into a new Belgium globe.
Wow...
Looks like liquid gold when poured into my fav pint glass with a thick dense two finger head. 
A= pours a beautiful orange color with a nice head and some spotty lacing
"After all the hype I was prepared to be disappointed. Wow, I was wrong. It's all thew hype then some IMO. I was afraid when I read on the bottle it was brewed with honey. Not to fear."
Three Cheers for iceicebaby for providing this in a recent trade. Thanks man!!!
"On tap at TJ's. Figured I should stop by while the hop slam is still around. So good on draft. Thick soapy head with huge lacing left on glass. Very sweet smell to it, honey, hops, hops and more hops. Nice malt to it so its not a hop bomb by any means. Goes down insanely smooth for being 10% abv. I had 2 9oz pours @ $5.50 each but I could of easily had a couple more if I had a designated driver. I got buzzed farily quickly b/c I had no lunch. Fantastic brew and highly recommended. Cheers."
"Pours a light golden amber with a head that fades to film, moderate lacing. Strong pine, hoppy aroma. Wow, no wonder they call it hopslam. This thing is hoppy hoppy hoppy. Other flavors are subtle and nice, but the hops definitely dominate this one. The ABV is hidden pretty well. I definitely can say I enjoy this. Would have another and would recommended it to someone interested in hops."
"Presentation: 12 oz bottle into an snifter. Stamped with ""8907"" on back of label."
"I would have to say this did not live up to the hype. In the last week I have sampled Pliny and Blind Pig on draft and have finished about 6 Nugget Nectars, and I feel that Slam has fallen well short of all three. "
200th review!
"Batch 8912 (January 13th, 2009) - only 9 days old! Poured into my Kuhnhenn tulip."
"Holy hell, this stuff is awesome! I had to come back and update after finishing off my 3rd six pack of this LUCIOUS beer. This is definitely into my top five favorite brews now. Spanking! good stuff!"
It's to bad that they limit the quantity. This is a brew I would like to stock all year round.
"A-Clear dark gold/amber color.Thin,white head that quickly fades."
"Appearance - pours a bright peachy color into a pint glass. 16 ounces, yippee!!! Good sheeted lacing forms large ribboned patches on the glass as the beer level falls."
WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE...
"Appearance: Pale light tint of orange/amber. A bit cloudy, slight carbonation. Little lasting head, some spotty lacing as well."
Drank over a case of this last year but never reviewed - here goes.
"Just picked up a sixer of this year's release. Poured into a pint glass, revealing a nice, mellow head and a beautiful light amber color. "
"Poured a little cloudy gold color with a white head that retained quite nicely. This smells like hops, the freshest, juiciest, citrusy hops you can imagine. You can smell your glass from around 3 feet away, it is as pungent as it gets. Just delicious. Taste is stellar as well. It is a hop fest, with almost no malt, but somehow the finish is mellow. Where you expect an insane and almost overwhelming bitterness, you get a pleasant hint of sweetness instead. Could it be honey that causes this gentle finish? Whatever magic mojo they have working, who cares, it's darn good, probably the best DIPA I've had. Can't believe it is 10%, that could get you into trouble really quick. So drinkable, that smooth finish doesn't destroy your palate, encouraging you to have another."
HOLY CRAP! BATMAN!
fresh 2009 bottling. 
"love this beer. too bad it's hard to find and available for such a short time. pours clear, little head, little lacing. smells of grapefruit very citrusy. exceptionally hopped nice bitterness. i shouldn't have more than one since i'm working tommorrow, but i will. this one is just too good."
"Bottle is labelled as being from batch number 8908, which means it was bottled on January 5th meaning that this is only 2 weeks and 1 day old. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Duvel tulip glass."
"Poured to a one fingered head that didnt last long. Did have some big bubbles around the edges and left some lacing. Ale was yellowish brown in color. Head had a slight orange tint. Smelled like grapefruit, pine, and malt. No alcohol was detected. Had a strong grapefruit flavor. Along with that piney hops. Also hints of malt. Had a slight bitter aftertaste. Actually not as strong as I thought it would be. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. Another ale that you would have to be carefull while enjoying. The taste is so good and smooth, all you want to do is gulp it down. With the higher alcohol content you would have to be carefull. I had a good buzz after two."
"Clear orange poor with a small offwhite head and a little lacing. Aromas of grapefruit zest, oranges, peaches, pepper, pine, creamy caramel and hoppy. Sweet start but the bitter peppery bitterness hits you big time right at the end. Slightly sweeter than most IIPAs. Alcohol is present but far from overwhelming. Smooth, creamy and velvetty mouthfeel. Taste is very citrusy and very hoppy as well. Tastes amazingly fresh.As it warms the flavor changes to a very nice sugary grapefruit. Very Good."
Pour: Light orange in color with a lot of lacing and a frothy head.
10oz. pour at the midnight release at Bryant Lake Bowl. Walked in to have a tasty app and a beer and found out this was happening so I had to stick around.
Purchased in a six pack from Wayne's Deli in Muskegon. Drank out of a Duvel tulip. Waited 2 weeks to finally buy it. 
"Ahh, my first Hopslam. Batch 8907 bottled on 1/6/2009."
Had to share my only bottle with my neighbor. Pours an amber golden color with a thick white head that laces the glass perfectly. Smells of brilliant grapefriut citrus hops with a touch of apricot and malt. Freshly cut citrus comes to mind. Absolutly the best smelling beer on earth. Tastes of citrusy grapefruit with a perfect touch of honey. Brilliantly balanced. Mouthfeel is great but drinkability is low due to being so high in alcohal.
A-pours a nice yellow with a touch off of white head and a little lacing
"This is it...round two of a Grand Slam! Last year's batch, #8283 was my first encounter with this luxurious, liquid libation. This year's batch, #8908 is all about consistency, strength amid weakness, and forbearance against a long, cold winter. Following last year's release, I managed to round up the remaining several 6 packs in close proximity of La Crosse as well as 4 additional ones from Eau Claire. This year, I made a point to special order two cases of the Slam."
"12 ounce bottle, served in a tulip, purchased at Belmont Party Source in Dayton, OH. Batch 8913, bottled 1/12/2009. Fresh!!"
"Presentation: Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into an Imperial Pint glass. Label depicts legs and arms sticking out from underneath a large hop flower. Batch #8907, brewed on January 6, 2009 and sampled 10 days later."
"Not much to say about this that hasn't already been said. Click on the highest reviews and picture me nodding in agreement. It might be through the power of suggestion, but I love the honey sweetness in this one. Some DIPAs have a ""rough"" sweetness. The honey, though, seems to smooth things out instead. I love this one. Just a fresh citric blast, hell yeah!"
12 oz bottle poured into a german pilsner glass. This beer was fresh from the distributor
I poured this one from a 12oz brown bottle into a stemmed tulip glass.
I poured this one from a 12oz brown bottle into a stemmed tulip glass.
Vibrant orange pour with decent head and beautiful lacing smeared Dali-like by the boozy legs produced in the sides of the snifter. 
"Pours a golden orange color with a white head. The aroma is hops, hops and more fresh hops with some malt and a touch of alcohol in the background. There is a lot of grapefruit and other citrus in the aroma from the hops. The taste like the aroma suggests is dominated by the fresh citrusy hop flavors. There is also a solid malt backbone, but it is overshadowed by the delicious hop profile. The drinkability is extremely high for a brew of this caliber, however it is probably not a good idea to drink more than a couple of these in one sitting. Overall, this is a solid DIPA that is probably my favorite beer IPA/DIPA category. Highly Recommended."
Pours a golden color with one finger of white head and plenty of carbonation.
golden look with a nice lacing head.
"After trying soooo many beers on the best of BA list and being disappointed time after time by the hype, FINALLY there's a beer that blows my mind."
A: A beautiful light copper color with a quickly diminishing head.
12 oz. bottle.
Had this on tap at the great Brass Rail Beverage. Literally had the first 2 drafts off of a fresh tap thanks to Cisco.
so cracked this with patronwizard olieipa and aimstatus. excited about this. 
A big thanks to Mauerhan for sharing this beer with me.
"A: Poured into a pint glass. Not much for head, a nice golden orange color to it."
"Color: clear light, golden brown"
"A- Clear orange, much clearer than any IIPA I've ever seen. Slight 1 inch head with great retention. Smooth spider web lacing along the sides of the glass."
Poured amber color with a large frothy white head that was lasting with excellent lacing.
"Thanks to armietaj for this extra. Has sat a year, so it'll be interesting to compare this to the fresh stuff that will be released pretty soon."
The hops in this one slam into you like a novacaine hurricane and don't let up until you tap into submission. Beautiful gold pour with a massive citrus and floral aroma that largely features oranges. Some honey in the flavor on top of the aforementioned ingredients. For serious hop lovers only.
"A - Pours cloudy orange-amber, with little head. Thin lacing down the glass. I am a bit concerned with this bottle since I've had this on tap and this ain't lookin the same."
Thehand hooked me up with this bottle. Thanks thehand!
A_Pours an slightly cloudy orange with a tiny head that dissipates to a small slick within seconds. The actual liquid looks fine but where is the head?
"Appearance: Pours a hazy amber-orange, nice head."
This has to be one of the hoppiest beers I have ever tasted. Bells Two Hearted Ale is my favorite beer in the hoppy category. Bells Hop Slam is a turbo-jolted version of the Two Hearted Ale with more alcohol and hop character. 
12oz bottles multiple times! 
Thanks to mikereaser for the trade.
12oz bottle
"Not the freshest bottle, so take this review with a grain of salt. It pours a woody brown color with a thick beige head and excellent lacing. The nose has a big bouquet of fruity hops over a rich malt profile. Taste has an explosion of citrusy and piney hops well balanced by sweet bready malts. Big oily body is carbonated perfectly . A great brew, but I would love to try a fresh bottle."
"Acquired via trade with hrking, thanks very much."
"Pours a medium amber color, very cloudy and hazy. Small whitish head falls quickly. Aroma displays a honeyish sweetness followed by some hoppy, piney notes. Faint aromas of apricot and citrus are there too. I didn't find the aroma to be that big compared to other great DIPA's."
"Look was a half inch head dissipating to ring around rim, some lacing. Tan in color with some hazy yellow."
"Original tasting, 1/27/08, the one the ratings are for:"
Another score in an awesome trade box from Kadonny.
12oz bottle in snifter
"A 12 oz bottle, long neck. "" Ale brewed with honey"" . A honeyed amber in my tulip tumbler with a one finger off-white head. A gentle fade and a ring remains around the glass. Moderate carbonation and a bit of chill haze. Once warmed a little it goes clear."
"nice and bitter at the start but as it warms the honey comes out to be eaqual to the hops. this is the first time that i have ipa with honney, i like this one but its not my first choise. this is a beer that i would drink agan, i do love the huge floral flavor on this one. this is a beer that should be tryed by everyone"
"pours up a murky copper color with a nice white head. the smell is all sorts of hop characters! citrus, floral, grapefruit, subtle spices. Its a hop medley! the taste is remarkably smoothe for a shitload of IBUs! i taste all of your hop characteristics here. mostly citrus though. the 10% ABV is very unapparent. full bodied, medium carbo. Deelish!"
"It pours a clear orangey copper with a frothy ivory head. Lots of fine spiderweb lacing. Beautiful smell. Floral and sweet citrusy hops. Hints of tangerine and apricot, orange rind and a hint of alcohol."
"A great awesome hoppy brew. Pours an orangeish amber, with a thick white head. Aroma of honey and very strong hops. The flavor is a delicious blend of citrusy hops with a honey sweetness unlike the typical maltiness of many imperial IPAs. The alcohol is also prominent, but not in a bad way. This is a favorite beer when in mood for hops."
Props to Jeff at Case and Keg in Boca.
Batch 9478 Rereview with a fresh bottle.
Acquired from monkeyknife in 80's BIF. Big thanks!!
"Another beer trade from my mid-western friends. 12 oz bottle in a pint glass...sorry, for Grant, IPA's go in a pint glass."
"Yet another one courtesy of tayner, the Queen of Beers."
"undated 12 oz bottle, id 8285"
"I've had this a few times before without yet reviewing it, but I finally popped open my last one from past January '08 (Batch 8283). This is the holy grail of beer! Poured a dark amber-golden with medium clarity and medium to heavy carbonation with a slight white head. The hops are apparent at quite a distance, and once you actually put your nose in it, you've reached the motherland. On the tip of the tongue, the bitter hops are already being absorbed, and upon swallowing, the piney flavor melds with the monster hops to the most pleasurable blend imaginable. It's medium to heavy bodied and a true hop-SLAM, yet goes down smooth and remains extremely drinkable. This seasonal is one to definitely one to stock up on to enjoy sparingly at special moments throughout the year! Thank you, Bell's!"
"Reviewing beers like this one is fun. This is one fine beer. Pours a clear light orange color with a medium sized head. A wonderful grapefruit hoppy aroma. The flavor is grapefruit hops with a good amount of honey and maybe some caramel. Bitter, dry with a pretty clean finish considering the style. Extremely well balanced. This has got to be the smoothest beer with this much alcohol I have ever had. I have got to get more of this stuff!"
Got this from a trade with softcough - thanks Scott!
"What a tasty and interesting brew! The appearance and smell both hint at a pretty typical, very hoppy IPA. The first taste that I got was citrus hops, but it wasn't as overpowering as I was anticipating. Then the complexity of the honey plus some kind of fruity taste set in, and finally the beer finished with a taste of bitterness. The finish is very smooth and clean as well."
Poured from the bottle into a pint glass
"A - Pours a hazy golden amber, with generous fluffy head. Thin lacing down the glass."
"Received in trade as a generous extra (2 bottles) from Lofgrep. I'm feeling a bit lazy with regards to reviews, so please excuse my lack of structure and depth in this one."
Received in a generous trade from rnorgart. Thanks! I've been looking forward to it.
The name says it all. Extremely hoppy. Surprisingly drinkable considering the bitterness and the level of alcohol. Some lacing on the glass. Big hop aroma and flavor. Some sweetness balances things out. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who is into hops.
"had at the first ever in history Stumelagram Tasting !! .. what a treat, time to ring that Bell .... funny, it IS very biting ... has a nice abv ... lots of floral/citrus aromas .. tastes fresh, like an apple of hops.... mellow and tasty as it warms a bit ... lots of tasty hops flavours.. good stuff"
Pours a pretty amber/rust color with a picture perfect fluffy head. Nice lacing on glass. This head has some staying power. Leaves a good amount on your upper lip on first drink. 
"One of my favorites, the Hopslam is released each year in January and acts to give many something to look forward to in the dead of winter/post holiday period."
this beer poured a cloudy golden amber with no head.
10% ABV according to the bottle label. Purchased at Red Wagon Wine Shop in Michigan.
12 oz. bottle &gt; Imperial Piny glass
"Bottle at Coles. Hazy orange with a big grapefruit and pine aroma with some sweet pineapple. Not as hoppy as I expected. As it warms up it starts to get a bit hot and boozy towards the end. Meh, a decent example but there are much better DIPAs out there."
Thanks to moose3285 for including this as an extra in a trade!!
Special thanks to PaulTheBeerGuru for putting this on tap at Underground Bluz in Orlando.
"Sampled this at the Eccentric back in May after partaking of several other offerings from Bell's; however, I'm thankful for the opportunity to try this as a standalone. Received this as a generous extra from bgramer (thanks Brendan). Batch 8277 printed on the bottle. Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a one-inch loose head. Cap reduced to half its size within seconds before settling into a thin skim of foam and ringlets. Some strands of watery lacing adhered to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Scent off the cap pop was sweet; however, aromas in the glass yielded a predominantly floral hops nose, with a mead-like quality detectable in the background. Taste consistent with nose, with a very complex flavor profile; both sweet and bitter at the same time. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a slightly viscous feeling and a light effervescence in the mouth. I'm generally not one for IPAs, but Hopslam is in a category all its own in my opinion."
Poued froma bottle into a snifter
Reveiwed on 4-21-08
I really had to sweet talk one of the guys at the store to let a couple of these go. We found out that they don't put this on the shelf and just split it between the staff. I'm glad all I had to do was TALk him out of it. 
Nananana-nananana HopSlam!
"Intense, knock you over the head hoppiness. Loaded with fruity hops - pineapple, candied orange, grapefruits. Clean fermentation and malt character."
"My wife brought me a 6 pack of this beer. I was definately looking forward to trying this beer. It pours amber with a slight white head. The smell of this beer is astounding... definately the best smelling beer I have smelled to date. You can smell citrus, hops and malt in a beautiful harmony. The flavor is wonderful for a dipa, borderline grapefruit juice :) the 9.3% alcohol is well hidden but it seems a little overcarbonated imo. Not something I could drink all night but certainly a great beer."
A - It pours one fingers worth of off white head. The beer is a clear orange copper color. There is a moderate amount of lacing as well.
"A: Pours an awesome looking amber copper orange, with a very thick 1 finger had that sustains very well, leaving sticky lacing down the inside of my glass."
Pours a nice bright orange with a rocky off white head.
A- Poured a Hazy copper color with a nice amount of thick head look heavy before even tasting it.
Amazing gratitude to Proteus93 ANDTilley4 for this.
Poured into an ommegang tulip glass
"Pours a nice frothy, off-white, head that fully disappears. Aroms is heavy hops with big grapefruit and orange . There's also a hint of vanilla and , of course honey. Doesn't have the bit that manny douple IPAs seem to have. Even thought the alocohol is high, there is very little that I could taste, but I could feel it."
12oz bottle poored into a pilsner glass.
Easily my favorite Double IPA. This is a highly complex beer that is well served by the addition of honey.
12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. I love this label. Small 1 inch head that dissipates pretty quickly. Nice lacing remains as I finish it off.
I enjoyed this beer from the comfort of my own living room. From bottle to a standard pint glass.
"A- I like the label of the bottle, its funny. The beer is a nice golden copper color. The head was nice and tight that depleted to half a finger width and left nice lacing. "
A big thanks to sholland119 for this one!
Thanks to Phawk for the trade.
"Huge thanks to Dave for this tasty treat!! Pours deep amber gold with a minimal white head. Huge hop aroma of pine, honey, and citrus. Honey and grapefruit dominate early, sliding aggressively into a hugely lasting bitter finish. Pretty full mouthfeel. One of the biggest beers I've ever head, up there with Double Bastard."
"Hopslam (dig the name) pours a beautiful bright golden apricot color with a tight, creamy, yellow tinted lid. The smell is tons of fruit and that's it. Gotta love it. Tangerines and oranges, pineapples and grapefruits all make a statement as they swirl together in the nose, and sweep through onto the palate. Fruits balance with the soft sweetness of animal crackers, and leave the flavor with a solid bitterness. Fantasticly full body with oily smoothness and creamy carbonation. Believe the hype. This is one awesome IIPA"
Thanks to drxandy for this one. My first trade. Served from bottle to pint glass to belly.
poured into a plastic kiawah cup. Bottle says 10% ABV by the way. Thanks Brawley for hooking it up by the way!
12 oz bottle poured into an oversized wine glass served in the high 40's low 50's
"12 oz bottle in to goblet. Not hazy, but not clear orangy with white head that leaves beautiful lacing. Smells of grapefruit, pine, and maybe orange. Sweet citrus taste that gets kicked by very strong hops. Perhaps my favorite beer. Pretty well masked 10% booze."
Thanks abankovich!
12oz. bottle into a tulip glass. A giant hop bud on the label is smothering some dude to death. I would gladly go out like that.
Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my unibroue tulip glass. Label has a great picture of a bunch of hop buds crushing some lucky SOB to death.
"12 oz bottle, batch 8277 (1/9/08). Pours a hazy dark gold with a huge pillowy white head that retains well and laces the glass. There's tons of big yeasties in the bottom."
"Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit!"
"A: Bright golden orange, with a slight chill haze that's nice to see. Like Bell's says, ""Live life unfiltered."" Thin stand of white head and a beautiful unbroken white lace remain all the way down the glass."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Thanks to tizzod, midwest beer guide!"
"Bell's Hopslam, I saved this beer for the end of the night so as to savor my taste buds for the hop slamming they are about to receive. Pours a somewhat hazy orange, with not too much heading, but a good enough white lacing. Smell is everything that you would want from a good Imperial IPA: resiny hops, citrus fruits, earthy hops...its got it all. I have to say that taste wasn't quite as good. The citrus notes came through well, with lots of pineapple, mango and orange along withe the hops, but I don't know, it felt as if something essential was missing....perhaps a bit more malt balance? Mouthfeel is viscous and sweet, yet bitter. One is more than enough for me in one night, but still, I am glad I had the chance to try this brew from Bell's. Maybe not the best DIPA I have had, but certainly ranks among the better ones I have tasted recently. Cheers"
"Pours a magnificent burnt copper with a thin but creamy white covering. Beautiful lacing. Rich nose of fresh, grassy, juicy citrusy hops on top of a subtly sweet and spicy malt backbone. Hops have faded just barely over the last couple months as the bitterness has died down a little and the sweet and spicy maltiness is playing a larger role in the finish. Medium to full bodied, and the carbonation is on point for what I look for in IIPAs. If you told me this beer was 10% I would have laughed at you. I am loving this beer a few months old just as much as I did fresh. This balance is perfect for me, and the drinkability is absurd."
"Appearance: dark orange in color with a 1"" head. Mild lacing develops during the session."
"Pours up a nice orangy amber color with a short-lived off-white head. Some lacing left behind, but not really noteworthy. Some very nice piney and grapefruit rind aromas going on, a slight dose of spicy V-8 type veggie showing up as well. Hard to discern any malt or alcohol characteristics even though I'm sure they're going on in there. Nice balance between maltiness and hoppiness, but I'm sensing the same veggie V-8 type of flavor remotely in the aftertaste. I must say that this ale hides it's 10% ABV pretty well with an assortment of flavors. Some pale maltiness, short crystal malt, hoppy profile, some residual sugars in the aftertaste. Pretty solid, but I think I've had better. Very astringent and hoppy, yet somewhat lacking."
A - Pours a nice copper with a dense two finger head that disipated slowly leaving a good lacing.
"Pours out a hazy golden color with red hints and a thin, dense white head. Nose is west coast floral hops, with dense syrupy honey. Taste is surprisingly malty, then the hops kick in and linger over dark honeycomb and bitter citrus. Slight alcohol on the end balances and mingles with the lingering hops. Mouthfeel is foamy and smooth. Good drinkability except for the ABV."
Pours a orangy amber with a decent 1/2 inch head that settles and sticks some lacing to the glass.
A - Pours a nice yellowish copper color with a light white head that unfortunately doesn't stick around. Lacing is fair.
This beer has a great initial palate with tremendous fruitiness and gobbs of weight which is reflected in its dark yellow color. You taste the hops but do not experience any bitterness . What separates this beer from the others in this class is the finish. It is unique and very sweet almost like a very expensive dessert wine from France(Sauternes). What a luxury drink!!!! They are going to make more of this beer for the 2009 season.
"Since drinking this dbl IPA, I have been on a quest to find even more. Being in Michigan has helped but my sources are drying up. IMO - This beer is exactly what a double IPA should deliver from the initial aroma thru to the lingering finish. "
"Presented in a 12 oz., brown bottle with freshness code: 8285."
"A - orange, not quite clear. Big off-white head. Leaves lots of sticky lace down the glass."
"Poured a clear amber color. Appears cloudy orange in the glass. Good retention. Exceptional lacing. Smelled predictably heavy of hops. Tastes bready, piney. Alcohol cleaverly hidden within. This brew is right in my wheelhouse, so I am slightly partisan to what it offers. That being said, I have been courted by a few brews that promised what this one does and they didn't deliver. This one does. I love it."
A : Pours a hazy orange/amber color with a good white head. Good retention and nice lacing.
"Pours a beautiful clear rich amber color with 1/2 inch of thick foamy eggshell colored head with nice retention and great lacing. Smells of grapefruit, pine, honey, biscuit, grass, grapes, and oranges. Tastes of grass mixed with sweet honey with a light biscuit backbone and a finish of grapefruit, orange peel, and a juniper tasting dryness, definitely a slam of hops. Medium in body with good carbonation and semi-syrupy but still smooth and sweet with a sticky dry bitter finish. Very easy to drink and extremely pleasant for a hop lover with an appropriate name. A little high in ABV to session, but it'd be well worth dealing with the aftermath the next day."
poured into a standard pint glass from 12oz
A - A hazy orange/brown color with a thin white head. 
"Bell's Hopslam Ale (12oz. bottle): Thanks to saucya or aksorak for this! Poured from bottle into pint glass. Golden color with a small head that recedes quickly. Aroma of sweet citrus hops, with a little resin and sweet malt underneath. A little tropical fruit too. Very nice smell. Taste hits you with bitter, resiny, hops at first, then a little citrus and bready malts. This beer has a medium body and is lively in the mouth. Drinkability is fairly high if you're into the style, which I increasingly am. Overall I'm pretty into this beer. Exactly what I was looking for today."
"Drank this from a 12 oz. bottle from batch 8277, bottled on January 9, 2008. Decanted into a pint glass."
"Bottle. Batch 8277. Pours a sparkling murky cloudy pinkish amber. Lots of head, and a crazy amount of lacing. Aroma is spectacular; grapefruits and citrus out the ass. Hoppy as hell, incredibly vacuous and worthy of its own praise. Crazy good. Flavor is delectable: spicy hops and pleasant citrus interwoven with honey and ginger. Thick and syrupy, but with a nice watery and easy finish. Way too drinkable at 10%, but I feel overall it's not as striking of an IPA as Bells own Two Hearted Ale."
This beer poured a nice burnt orange with a light white head that disappated quickly leavign a lace arounf my glass.
Got this as a gift from thickerfreakness. Thanks Charles! I appreciate it.
"Pours a cloudy coppery-orange with a full 3-finger head that just won't quit. Sticky lacing everywhere. I can smell the hops without even sticking my nose in the glass. Smell is heavenly. A veritable bouquet of every smell that makes a DIPA good. Grapefruit, tangerine, pine, grass, flowers, you name it its in here somewhere. I could keep my face in this glass for hours! The flavor is more on the earthy side of the hop spectrum, with a bit of tangerine & caramel showing through. The expected hoppy-bitter finish was more of a kick in the face than I was hoping for, which throws the balance for me, but nevertheless, this is one of the best examples of a DIPA that i've found. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, yet soft and creamy. A pleasure to drink, and a must for any hophead!"
"It was burnt orange in color and poured a 1/4"" white head of fine bubbles. Aromas of herb/floral hops followed by light citrus. These flavors continued into the mouth along with some honey. The palate was dense but didn't come off as heavy leading into a dry, bitter, hoppy finish. Well done and especially enjoyable for people who enjoy the herbal side of hops."
Thanks to wcudwight for this one!
Another amazing beer from the Midwest! Bells is quickly becoming one of my favorite brewers. 
"Thanks to my buddy David for providing me with this bottle brought down from NC. One of those beers that is definately a transending experience. The smell is a mix of citrus, but not overwelming like some DIPAs. The taste is one of the most balanced I have ever had, of course it is very hoppy, but so smooth. The transition from one complex flavor to another is seamless, with not one element overpowering another. The alc is so hidden, you could definately get in trouble if you had a few."
It pours a hazy lemony iced tea golden orange. A finger-plus of frothy slightly off-white head settles to bubbly islets. Mountainscapes of lacing scale the inside of the glass. 
This is an amazing IPA times 2. Man does it ring home with a heavy hop hand and a creamy Finish. And it is another reason why Bell's is the rockingest micro in the middle of America. 
Thanks to goryshkewych for the opportunity to try this.
A- Light orange in color with a minimal cream-colored head. 
"This beer poured a nice copper color with little to no head. What head was present was off white. No lacing present. The aroma was pine forest! The taste was again a ""hop slam"" to the face with a nice hint of sweet. Mouthfeel was a bit thick and carbonation was little. Overall a little too hoppy for me but still a great beer!"
"Poured orangey/caramel color with good white head that laced the glass for the whole 12 oz. Smelled of fruit hop grapefruit, orange citrus, and some sweet scents. Tasted great. With plenty of hop citrus and astringency and a balanced sweetness that was not bready or biscuity but very balanced. Where is the alcohol? Good feel in the mouth-slightly coating and a good level of carbonation. Very enjoyable beer. I don't tend to enjoy this style because it isn't balanced enough, but this one jas all of the right flavors. Thanks to Tilley4 for this treat. One of my favorite DIPAs out there"
"Holy Crap in a pita! A bold beast that is absolutely outstanding! The color was not what I was expecting. A little bit more orange and murky than what I'm used to, but not offsetting in any way. Smells like someone juiced a grapefruit on a pine tree. Taste is pretty dry with a bitter following. Overall, an oustanding beer that really hits the spot."
Big thanks to sholland119 for sharing this one! 12oz bottle poured into a snifter.
"pours out a slightly hazed copper colour, with a thin white head that sticks and stays leaving nice rings of lace. stupendous aroma of hops; all citrus all the time...think lemon-lime meets grapefruit punch with an fresh apple kick. a nice maltiness noses it's way in also...wow this smells great! the taste backs up all the lip smacking, juicy fruit hopping that this DIPA is known for. grapefruit rind, lemon zest, orange juice, lime, with an understated honey sweetened herbal tea note that really rounds out the hop profile. it's full of bitterness, but it melds so well into the background, that i almost dismissed the tremendous IBU's. oh yeah, i almost forgot that there is a nice, straightforward, sweet caramel maltiness that holds everything together beautifully. and the honey helps, too, if i already didn't mention that. it's a gorgeous combination. there are some yeasty notes prevalent, mostly due to the bottle conditioning, but i tried not to mix in the dregs. i'll save them until the end. while i can tell this is a big brew full of booze, i can't detect any alcohol related flavours, either. i can only say that this tastes fantastic. big bodied; full, albeit dry mouthfeel. drinks smaller than it should for a %10 ABV beer. finishes dry...thus, drinkability is dangerous. proceed with caution!"
"Finally I was able to get some of this and it was well worth the wait. Medium body with a thin head and a bit of retention. Moving on to the highlights... bam-- what an explosion of citrusy, grapefruit hops in the nose and then again in the taste with bitterness that is very present but not overwhelming. Very light and present in the mouth, making it very enjoyable and present. For the ingredients and the alcohol the drinkability is incredible as well. Here to looking forward to being able to find some more of this."
"Well, I can't be as eloquent as others, and I'm new at this gig. Moving CD's to the IPOD while I type this."
"It's bright, but murky. Harsh, yet comforting. Aggressive, and inviting. I don't know how one makes a beer like this, but Bell's has nailed it again."
"Appearance- Pours a beautiful orange color, with some very cloudy sediment into a large wine glass, leaving a 2 finger head that slowly recedes to a smaller cap with some great clinging lace on the glass. "
A- Pours a nice deep golden orange color that is a little hazy. Nice white head with great amount of lacing. 
"Finally getting around to review this, as my stash has dwindeled. Hate to see this go."
"12 oz. bottle,"
"Part of a ""Michigan Double IPA"" 4-pack put together and sold by Merchant Wine in Dearborn Heights, MI. for $13.99; purchased and consumed late March-early April 2008."
Appearance
Thanks to abankovich for a great trade. I poured a capped 12 ounce bottle into a tulip.
Bottle pured into mug.
12oz bottle served at 45 degrees into a pint glass.
"Honestly, this is my favorite beer. I was introduced to it early in my beer drinking career and still love it."
"One of the best beers i have had with the amount of hops. Bell's did a good job! Many of my friends felt the abv was a little strong but i did not notice. I felt Bell's has a very unike flavor and complexity. For people who would like to try a highly hopped ale, this is a good one!"
"From a fairly hard pour I got about a 2 inch head which dropped a little but doesn't really seem to be going anywhere. It is a gorgeous copper gold color, rich and beautiful. The smell is floral hoppiness, clean and fresh with a slight sticky sweet character. The flavor is sharp citrusy hoppiness up front, a sweetness develops, then drops right into a lingering hop biting bitterness. This is far from a balanced beer, more like unadulterated hopjuice, but with a name like Hopslam that is obviously what they were going for. The mouthfeel is average, and drinkability is good for a 10% tastebud peeler. The honey added does a little to mellow it out. If you are a hophead this beer is great. I wouldn't call it complex, but it is what it is and I like that."
"Attractive amber color in the glass with a tiny bit of cream as the head. Earthy, pungent - but not overpowering scent. It reminded me of freshly moved glass. However, there was a distinct fruitiness to this brew. As I continued drinking it, I noticed it smelled exactly like a grapefruit. My husband remarked that it smelled like floral perfume. Super hoppy taste, which I expected, however it lacks that signature bite of many IPAs, making it quite drinkable. The finish is very clean and pleasantly bitter. I found this beer to be quite balanced and delicious."
Poured with a thick white head. Nice orange color. 
ok this beer is best fresh (imo) but i have now gone through a whole case (slowly) and feel apt to both review from past to now. 
12 oz bottle poured into an imperial pint.
Appearance: Golden/amber color with nice head that sticks around.
Batch 8277
Received this beauty from both TheodorHertzle and Brent56K. I love Bells and have been excited to try this beauty. Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale tulip.
Bottle courtesy of jsquire. Thanks for the awesome bonus!!
On tap at Underground Bluz! (pint glass)
"Hopslam pours a hazy, light, amber honey color with a small head that leaves a bit of lacing on the side of the snifter. The smell is very strong, mainly consisting of bright, citrussy hopes. Mostly grapefruit aromas with an underlying bit of honey. The taste starts with a very, very brief bit of sweetness followed a powerful punch of hop bitterness that knocks your socks off but slowly fades away to a soft bitter aftertaste. As the beer warms, the bitterness calms down, the alcohol starts to show up, and the flavors smooth out a bit. The mouthfeel is nice and medium-bodied. This is a tasty hop-bomb, though maybe not quite as good as the hype led me to believe."
"Fantastic double IPA, it wrecks you though. Mouthfeel is utterly like butter in you're mouth with it's pleasent hints of floral and suttle tones of the bitter. It does punch you in the mouth and really kicks you in the rear when the alcohol sneaks up on you down the line. After about 3 of these I was pretty well off and yet I found myself ordering more. A FINE example of what a DIPA can be, I feel it's better than two-hearted but thats a matter of opinion! :)"
I finally got to try Hopslam and found it amazing. Quite hoppy and extremly bitter.
"Pours from the botttle a slightly hazy, but bright orange/copper color under a creamy 1/2"" beige head. Retention is strong throughout the glass with just a few streaks of lacing noted. "
Appearance: Poured into a Nonic Pint Glass. Beer is a hazy pale orange color with a thin one-finger head of off-white foam that quickly dissipates leaving a fine layer across the surface of the beer. Fine lacing clings to the side of the glass.
"Bottle given to me as a gift from my fellow beer-enthusiast, Keith. I'd been dying to get my hands on one of these for the last year, so my expectations were perhaps a bit unrealistic. "
ok. first beer from Bell's i was disappointed. the second was better. this is the third. 
"I had high expectations, as I love Bells two hearted..."
"Had on tap at the Heorot in Muncie, IN. Served in a tulip glass with a generous 1"" off-white head over a orangy colored beer. The head lasted quite a while and left lots of clumpy lace as I drank."
"A: Deep gold with just a small amount of head, no lace."
"It looks like a thick copper, just like most doube IPA's, with a nice off-white head. The head is solid at first but dissipates relatively quick with minimal lacing."
"Nice amber color with a light pink tint. Solid head drops to a thin covering and leaves solid lacing. I couldn't even see through the lacing at one point, it was like a sheet."
I have had this one in the bottle several times. Today was my first time on draft.
Stopped into a local bar after work that had this on tap. On top of that the rep from Bells was on site who was wonderful to talk to. 
Got a recommendation of this brew from another member
Orange amber with a sticky ipa-style head. 
Pours a fairly transparent orange/red with a nice thick fine white head.
"Appearance- Poured into a pint glass, I got a great two finger head. Thick, creamy foam that looked just heavenly. Huge bubble lacing that sticks to the glass in great rings. I love it."
"12 oz. bottle from Greenwood Spirits (Bowling Green), poured into a Unibroue ""tulip."""
"Wow what a great beer here. One of the characteristics of an IPA is the strong presence of hops. This beer has them in there. It pours an amber color and has very little head. The first thing you will notice with this beer is aroma. My god it is a heavenly smell. It is very much a flowery bouquet in there. Now I have not yet learned my hops by smell but I am sure more experienced beer lovers could pick out the hops used in this brew just based on the smell. It has a smooth and sweet taste. One that makes drinking more than one very easy to take down. However, that is not good as it 10% ABV. So it's pretty easy to get drunk off this beer, which is a shame. This is a beer that should be enjoyed slowly to savor all that is have to offer."
Holy crap! ncvbc sent me this on a recent trade! Thank you thank you thank you!
A: Pours a nice 1.5 finger head with nice retention with substantial lacing. The beer looks like some sort of golden honey.
12oz bottle poured into a pint glass with about a half inch of head.
Poured golden amber into a Unibroue tulip. Looked delicious.
Thanks to readicculus for the trade! 
From Notes:
"2008 version (10% ABV) Pours a golden bronze with a thick, creamy two and a half finger head. Dull clarity with excellent retention and spectacular spiderweb lacing. The nose is truly amazing- heavy pine needle scent with robust tangerine/mango tropical hop oil aroma, some orange and grapefruit rind in the background; and a soild caramel malt backing. There is another sweet aroma here I could not place, but when I noticed that the label says it is brewed with honey, I found that to be a likely culprit. The first sip reveals the honey further- like clover with a touch of orange blossom- the malt tastes like a medium roast crystal with some two-row thrown in for good measure. Thankfully, the sweetness carries over into the aftertaste and attempts some kind of balance. The first wave of hop flavor is a pungent mix of pine sap-tangy ripe fruit; followed by fresh cut grass and oranges, and finally grapefruit and resinous earthy hop oils and cling to the tounge but in a very soft- low cohumulone sort of way. This beer is bursting with both malt and hop flavor- especially american ""C"" varieties like Cascade, Chinook, Columbus and Centennial; yet is does not overwhelm the taste buds with boistrious alpha acids or astringent bitterness like some other hop bombs. This beer presents a unique and charismatic malt profile set against a showcase of west coast hop volatiles. The body is full and the carbonation light- just enough to prevent cloying and lift some of the more stubborn hop residues. It finishes flashy and saturated with the taste of fresh hop cones dipped in honey and copper-colored malt. The flavor is balanced enough to achive a good drinkability despite the heavy mouthfeel and lingering flavors. This limited availability seasonal is elite amongst it's D.I.P.A. bretheren, but still not worth the $16.00 a six pack price tag- hop crisis be damned."
"Thanks to EliteDigger for this tasty brew. This has been on my radar for a while. Poured from a 120z. bottle into a Dogfish Head snifter. Beer pours an orange, copper color with a small white, bubbly head. Very soft carbonation and moderate lacing around the glass."
"Just cracked open this bottle that has been sitting in the back of my fridge for the past week and a half. Pours a reddish-gold with a nice frothy head that dissolved and left a nice layer of bubbles on the top. I'm sitting about 2 feet away from the beer, looking at its color and I can already smell the pungent hops. Nice and floral in the nose with a grapefruity tint. Bring your nose closer to the beer and you can smell the bitterness."
Poured from a 12oz bottle.
"can you say slow and reflective? say it s l o w and then s l o w it down some more... this is the equivilant of hopped wine. the hoppiet barley wine I have ever tasted. And the taste! and the smell! strong resins predominate, a lemony piney, citrusy balm that lingers in the nose and contributes to a most amazing taste. You are drinking a wonderfully balanced but strong, nuanced but powerful beer. One of the best beers that I have had so far in 2008. Wonderful. Don't drink it all night unless you can nurse a bottle for several hours. given the complexity of this beer, that is indeed possible. Savor a sublime, deep taste sensation."
"A. Clear, still orange with a fat 3 finger head that fades over time. No lacing, decent retention."
"Had this beer in Ann Arbor last year, quite pricey buying a six pack but found it on tap in the U.P for two dollars a pint...rough night needless to say"
Decided to try this beer while watching Big Brother 9. Wife is in bed - kids are asleep. my time now.
"Thanks to Sephiroth for this gem! Pours a fairly clear orange color with a timy white head. It leaves slight lacing down the glass. This IMO (along with NN) has the best aroma of any beer I have ever tried. Huge amounts of floral and citrus hops invade upon my first and every sniff. Massive citrus hop flavor, but not a typical hop monster- this fades as it gets balanced with the honey flavor. Very drinkable medium bodied beer for 10%! Can't wait for more!!"
This beer is fantastic!
"At first pour the beer is deep amber in color. Mine was slightly cloudy to which looked to me like ""chill haze."" Not a lot of head but then the hops hit you in the nose. They are overwhelming and awesome. At first taste there is some sweetness up front but it's quickly swallowed up by the hops, woody at first but then a citrus/grapefruit after taste."
A light to medium amber colored body with a small off white head. Leaves some lacing along the glass.
Poured a slightly hazy orange color with a one finger white head. The smell hits you as you pour. Smells of pine and citrus hops with a sweet fruity scent somewhat like white wine. The taste is again pine and citrus hops but the sweetness is very strong. Taste of grape and honey that really balances out the hops. There is some alcohol burn in the finish but isn't unpleasant. The mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation. Overall I really liked this one even though I usually don't like big hops. This one was balanced well and really impressed me.
The pour is a bright orange tinged copper color with a fluffy white head. 
12 oz. bottle in a snifter.
A: Pours a nice goldenrod color with a good amount of head.
12 oz. bottle poured into Hess truck glass at parents' house...
Got my hands on some. Please Bell's come to NJ.
12oz. brown bottle into pint glass (Bottle lists ABV as 10%)
Another delicious Bells offering. I want to thank my neighbor for this thank you for dog-watching beer. I'm drinking it with her (the dog) right now!
A-Beautiful two finger head with a slightly hazy light amber body.
12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.
"This may be the best smelling beer I've ever had! The grapefruit aromas could be detected several feet away. Pours a golden, almost orange color - small head. Taste is fruity and hops, hops, hops. Lives up to it's name. Ultimately, it's on the bitter side, but quite drinkable nonetheless. This is a terrific beer (made by a terrific brewery). Keep 'em coming to SW Fl., Bells!"
a: slightly darker than your average peach. 1 finger white head that seems to be holding up pretty well.
a - slightly hazy burnt orange color with a 1.5 finger head that lasts a good while for 10.5% abv 
"Pours a ruby colored amber. Hazy with a one finger cream colored head. Disappears quickly, but leaves sticky lace all over."
"This is a serious beer. Smells like strong citrus hops with a bit of sweetness. Initial hop bitterness gives way to a bit of sweetness at the end to balance things out and give a nice aftertaste of not-overly-bitter hop flavor. Really good stuff. You can sense the honey. Very balanced for an imperial IPA. The alcohol is well hidden (I had no idea this was 10% abv until I read the label), but with alcohol that high, this is a once an evening drink. "
Bottle (Batch ID 8277) poured into a tulip glass.
"It's great that we're getting such heralded beers as Hopslam in Florida. At about $17 a six-pack, it better be worth it! ;-)"
Bell's Hopslam Double India Pale Ale pours two creamy
A- Body is transparent bright amber and pours with a very small foamy white head that dissipates almost immediately after the pour. A thin collar remains the whole way down. No lacing is left behind in the glass.
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.
"Thanks to Sephiroth for the chance to try this one, after a great trade from the Midwest. Poured into a DFH pint at 40F."
"Finally got my hands on some of this. Pours out a very nice orange, lively carbonation, lingering off-white head that sticks to everything. Smells very nice. Hoppy (standard citrusy/piney American hops). "
Poured a lemon-yellowish gold into a pint glass. Inch thick creamy head that slowly settled.
"Served in a 16 oz. mug at Old Chicago in Okemos, MI."
I poured this brew into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was musty smelling and had a really thin head. The beer was a little bit cloudy and smelled really hoppy. It tasted really hoppy also as it is suppose to. I thought it was kinda grassy tasting. I did not like the beer but hop heads will go for it for sure. A great crisp summertime hop beer if you like that kinda thing. Not buy again
"This is a re-review. I've purchased a bottle this year and found my prior review to be way off from my current tastes. But that's what happens when we expand our palets, tastes change."
"Quick note before reviewing: I went to the website and entered the batch number just for kicks (I know this beer is fairly recent because it hasn't been long since I bought it), and the number came up as invalid. I noticed the site has been revamped recently, so maybe they're still having some issues with it. Either that, or this is a counterfeit beer, and my whole review is a lie. I'm hoping for the former."
A: Yellow/orange with a nice white head. Good lacing.
"A- One finger head faded quickly, deep relatively clear copper hue."
"12 oz'er poured into a pint glass... Pours a hazy gold, ambery color with a pretty thick and creamy white head. The head lasts all the way down for the most part, and leaves a bit of lacing. Smells of powerful hops, and it's really a great character, citrusy, bitter, and mellow, with some fruit. Tastes... well like a hopslam, great blend of hops in this beer, and the honey adds a flavorful undertone. Relatively carbonated, very fresh and ""energetic"" mouthfeel. This beer is damn tasty and drinkable, I'd have no objection to crack open one after another. But 9.3% ABV would get involved..."
Thanks to TheodorHerzl for the chance to try this.
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. 02/21/08. Batch 8277
"I broke down and coughed up the $14 for a sixer of this, and believe me, it's a steal. This beer is so incredibly good, it's rocketed to one of my top 3 DIPAs without question. This beer is incredible."
I'm a big fan.
"Well, it finally happened. I cracked open my first HopSlam.."
A - Pours copper with hints of gold. Ended up with a little less than one inch of white head. Retention was good. Lacing was also good.
Even with a slow pour this one has some considerable head. A white head sits atop this fairly blonde Double Imperial Pale Ale with very slight amber notes. The head doesn't last long but it leaves nice traces along the sides of the glass
"12oz. brown bottle. Batch 8283. Served in a shaker pint. Golden with a slight haze. Appeared to be bottle conditioned. About a finger of fine bubbled white head. Huge hop aroma along with some fruit. I get strawberries for some reason. That's a first for me. There is a good amount of malt, but immediately the hops jump out at you. Long, lingering hop pucker. There is more fruit in the finish. Hops are slightly vegetal. Alcohol is warming."
A beer worth its price indeed! At abt $16 a six pack this beer lives up to the hype...great label...great name...great brewery....great taste! I nice solid color for a DIPA; not too dark but not too light. a head that signals its hoppy nature. An explosion of flavor highlighted by the typical piney nature of an IPA but with a vibrant fruity taste. Four of these and I was inebriated! I had another IPA right before this and the stark difference was amazing. If you haven't had this beer....you have not had a Double IPA.
"A-Nice pale golden color, creamy head with nice lacing."
"Pours a golden hue into the pint glass, the smell is amazing. It has a lovely citrus/grapefruit nose that permeates through the taste. There is a bitterness I didn't like up front that was a little piney, but this brief taste is followed a very nice citrus and some sweetness finishing with a subtle bitter that is nice. "
Bell's Hopslam
12 oz bottle poured into a tulip. pours a lightly reddish amber color with a couple fingers of off-white head.
"I got this one at Canal Street in Reading, PA. Thanks to Dusty for getting some bottles even if the kegs didn't make it."
Thanks to Paul at Underground Bluz for getting this one on tap.
"Thanks to theformula for this elixir. Let me say that I've been looking forward to this for a while since I love DIPAs and I love Bell's. This didn't disapoint. I traded for a sixpack of this and of Nugget Nectar, and while the Nectar was good I thought this blew it away. So friggin' delicious that I almost sucked the first on straight down. "
"This one pours with an orangey, almost light amber color with a decent foamy head. Right off the bat it smelled like a sweet grapefruit. Very appealing. Also detected a citrusy, flowery smell, but man those grapefruits! "
"If you're a hop fanatic, I can't really imagine a better beer. And I am one, so it works out well. The appearance is good, although not really mind-blowing. Nice copper-amber color with a finger of white head on top that leaves a touch of lacing as the beer drains. Nose is incredible. Tons of piney hops hit you first, then a good bit of candy sweet malt as well. Unlike a lot of DIPAs, this one is definitely hop leaning; Bell's didn't seem to pour on the malt to balance it out, but really allowed the hops to dominate the flavor. But in a good way. Taste is amazing. Tons of piney hops again, some sweet caramel malt, grapefruit, and a touch of decidedly biting sweetness (some reviewers called it pineapple). The ABV is incredibly well hidden - not even noticeable in the least. Body is perfect for the style. Not syrupy, but thick and full bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, an incredible beer. One of the best DIPAs I've had, along with Southern Tier's Unearthly Imperial IPA and Dogfish Head's 120 (which is a much sweeter beer). Really a great one."
"Appearance: Pours a translucent, orangey body with a full, foamy white head."
"Appearance: It arrived a clear, golden color. Head had somewhat dissipated, but a solid coat of lace lined the glass as it went down."
"Bell's HopSlam pours dark orange with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There's no mistaking the aroma, it's hops, citrus, especially grapefruit stand out. The flavor is the same, all hops all the time. Citrusy and once again grapefruit like. A hopheads delight. Recommended."
1/21/2011:
"I picked this one up the Headkeeper in Greensburg last Friday, after being given a sample from the head chef. I consider myself a big fan of super hoppy beers and figured that it was definitely worth a review. "
A.. Goldenrod in color (a little darker than most dIPA's) pure white head with a little lacing.
On draft @ Bottoms Up Pizza 2/16/08
"Dark orange and hazy in color. Small head that doesn't hang on long but a decent about of bubbles (not too many but not too little) stick around the edges and a clean even lacing on the glass (note: I hardly ever mention lacing on these little blurbs but this is Hop Slam. Every little nuance is part of it's charm). The smell is VERY sweet and sour citrusy tang, one of those marihootchie strains that's got it's own name, a walk in a northern Michigan woods on a nice late spring day and a understated malt backbone. Upfront in the taste grapefruit. Before I go any farther if you don't like grapefruit-this isn't for you. Personally though, they're part of my breakfast at least twice a week so I'm right at home having this as the evenings night cap. That dry sour that gives you pucker power. There's definitely a combination of at least a few different hops given this a distinct character. Crisp with a nice medium body in the mouth. Leaves a slight sting on the tongue that lingers but down the throat is smooths all out with the honey and the malt giving a warm sweetness in the finish with a bit of alcohol burn to remind you that this is over 9% abv and 106 IBU's."
"Epic. I'd say that's the one word that can do this beer justice. Onslaught would have also been acceptable, but that's besides the point. I poured this one into the Duvel sifter and let it sit for about fifteen minutes while I let it warm and took in the aroma."
12oz received in trade from jdoncbus ... I had one.. my trading partner had the other ... we both thank you John. Mine poured into my New Belgium snifter.
I was eager to try it as I'm falling for hoppyness. Luck was on my side when it showed up at a place I don't normally shop. Expensive at 12.99 but it was a birthday purchase. Maybe 29 is the year I get serious about type face reviews and no more scratchy notes.
"Pours a nice cloudy amber color. The smell really reminds me of pineapple juice with a hint of hops in there. The taste isn't what I really expected. I expected more of a Smuttynose IPA type beer. The taste was pleasant though, tasted sweet like a fruit juice with the hop bitterness. Extremely easy on the mouth, no bite at all. not sure I'd want 6 in a row, but 2 or 3?, definitely"
Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for hooking me up on this one 
"Let me start by saying... the funniest part about this beer is that a year ago, I couldn't have stomached a sip. A year later, I bought a case of this hoppy goodness."
"Beer #31 in my 366 Days of Beer Quest, tasted on 1/31. This FINALLY arrives in VA, let's see what all the hype is about..."
"A guy brought this to me in my store so I could try A Bells beer which is no longer available in Chicago. 12 oz bottle, poured into a glass."
"Got this beer on tap at my local haunt and just had to try it due to my love of hoppy beers. The appearance of this beer is a light copper with a nice white head. The smell was very similar to other beers like this, very citrusy hop smell, but also had a sweet undertone. The taste of this beer is amazing. From the smell, you expect to be overpowered with hops flavor, but it is surprisingly smooth and had a slight caramel taste. This beer has a pretty hefty ABV , so you don't want to drink too many of them in one sitting. But, if you like hoppy beers, this is definitely one to try."
Draft. Pours a cloudy Amber with small off white head. The Aroma has lots of citrus especially grapefruit. The flavor is full of hops but also has a nice sweetness. This beer has real depth with fruit and caramel in the flavor. The finish is not to bitter and lingers nicely. Really nice and incredibly drinkable for a Double IPA. I need to comapare this head to head with 90 minute IPA
A -Pretty light honey copper with big head and coating persistent lacing.
"This beer poured copper color with a .5"" head which thinned quickly. The smell is very nice with with fruitiness and some of alcohol. The taste is great with hints of grapefruit and orange. This is now my favorite high alcohol (10%) beer mainly because it hides the higher alcohol with the intense hop citrus flavor. This beer is very good!"
"First off... A big thanks to, sigh. OK, fine. I mean, my name ends up in these, too, I guess. So thanks to spacecoyote for the bottle. There. I said it. Happy? And in the future I'll try to do better and acknowledge traders. Really. Honest. (No, this diatribe has nothing to do with spacecoyote - just with those who think it good to give credit for sources.)"
Thanks to dyan for the trade and ncvbc for the extra.
12oz. bottle.
"Light golden orange, not a huge head, but it leaves at least some lacing."
Poured from 12oz bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Poured a golden color with orangish hue and foamy white head nice lacing. Smell is dominated by citrus and pine hint of pineapple. Taste is dominated by grapefruit with some pine resin but not as bitter as a lot of DIPA because of its sweet malt base. Mouthfeel is creamy and a low carbonation feel but still carbonated. A pretty drinkable double IPA.
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle (Lot 8277)
Thank you monkeyknife for sending this one eastward. 
"My glass is glowing with shades of delicious copper-deep orange, and woody browns. Head isn't very large but there is already lace reaching to the top of my glass, not to mention the big yummy bubbles. Aroma is packed full of sweet candy orange-tangerine, creamy peaches, apricots, sweet berries/soft aromatic flowers....dank. Taste is a pile of happy hoppy. Mmmmm. Candy-like, not cloying, fresh and fruity with just the right amount of bitterness. Malts have a presence but the hops are certainly at the front. Nice smooth, grainy/resiny texture are quite nice. Drinkable indeed. "
"I got 2 bottles of HopSlam in a trade with Tilley4, thanks Jason!"
"This Bell's brewery has got some stuff going on. I've come on late to most of their beers, but so far it's been hit after hit after hit."
Thanks to Wasatch for this one...
I traveled nearly 200 miles round trip for a case of this beer. Overall I feel the trip was worth every second. Hopslam has an aroma that is compared to none. IT packs a nice punch but at the same time it has an equal hop/malt profile. One sip is not enough. Enjoy!!!
"Finally caved in and bought some. I actually broke my promise not to buy anymore beer for awhile until I bought this one. The big sign at the liquor store saying Yes, we have hopslam was too much for me."
"A - Pours a orange-golden color with a light-golden, two-finger head that fades to a cap and leaves nice rings of lacing around the glass."
I was not sure of all the hype when I was luckily able to try this on tap. This definitely did not dissapoint.
"I've often walked right past this beer at my local beer store. For some reason I blindly thought that this beer wouldn't really be worth a try. Well, was I pleasantly surprised when I had a chance to sample this beer on tap at Ashley's in Westland."
Purchased at Whole Foods on PST in DC. From at 12oz bottle into my trusty Goulden Draak tulip.
Gorgeous copper color with a huge yellowish head.
Picked this up as a single from a Wild Oats Market. Labeled at 10% ABV. Poured a golden orange into a tulip. A 1 finger off-white head with great retention. Carbonation is moderately active. Decent amount of thick lace left on the glass.
"A: Clean, golden/amber pour with a rich and foamy pale orange head. "
A - Pours a nice amber with a finger of white head that quickly fades. Good lacing. 
"A - Medium orange, with some suspended particulate mater. Medium ring of white foam around the edge of glass."
On tap at grumpy's.
"Another great beer from Bells. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a medium white head. Average head retention / good lacing. Smell is awesome. Floral hops and citrusy. Taste is great. This is the hophead's version of balanced: piney hops, citrusy hops and floral hops. None of the flavors are over the top and there is no hint of the alcohol (the bottle says 10%)."
Appearance - Burnt orange with great clarity and an off-white one-inch head. Solid head retention.
Truly one of my favorite DIPA's and it's about time I got around to reviewing it....
Poured into a wide mouth mug to maximize the scent. Appearance is a nice honey color with a soft head that fades quickly leaving some delicate lacing on the edge of the glass.
"A- looks pretty solid, light amber color with lots of bubbles, sticky white head on top, kept low by a gentle pour in a big glass"
Dark brown 12oz glass bottle. Green label showing a guy crushed to the floor by three hop cones. Pry off cap. Back label claims 10% ABV.
"Ive finally gotten around to reviewing HopSlam, one of my absolute favorites. "
This poured out a nice dark tan in color. The head was about 1.5 cm and made up of fine bubbles. It disappeared after a couple of minutes.
"Received from fellow BA phnphilly. Bottle say 10%, site says 9.3%. Not a big deal when you get that high I guess. Hear lots about this brew and love DIPA's so am quite excited to try this bad boy. Poured into a Snifter. Oh, cool label BTW."
"I'd been wondering when this beer was going to make it to NC and it finally did. It poured a bright gold color with a small head that stuck around. Aroma was hops, hops and more hops. This is a hophead's dream come true. I could pick up a good bit pf pine, citrus and even a hint of mango in the aroma as well. Taste was bitter up front with some alcoholic warmth mixed in. The finish was also bitter. The sweetness of the malt was there, but the high level of hop bitterness overwhelmed it at every turn, which was fine with me. Mouthfeel was light to medium. Drinkability was excellent, however, non-hopheads would probably find this beer undrinkable. Anyone who favors Double IPA's should seek this one out."
"Clear, thick orange color with a creamy sheet of a head; sticky bubbles making a ring around the edges and leaving some drippy lacing. The aroma is bursting with pungent citrus, peach, and tropically fruity hops. Some sweetness, pine sap, sugar cookies, and stinky weed. Citrus, peach, and apricot continue in the flavor, but in a very fresh, real fruit kind of way. A nice sweetness in the middle compliments the citrus perfectly, finishing with some orange rind. Its all fresh, oily hop juice...and its delicious. There's a little warmth in the throat, but this is very easy to drink for its ABV. Bitter, though not obscenely so, medium-plus body and smooth. Surprisingly drinkable."
"Pours a murky orange with a decent off white head. Nose is strong citrus hops. Flavor is so much grapefruit, it took me back a bit. Those thick citrus flavors are combined with firm hop tones. Feel is smooth on liquid and carbonation and it goes down easy. Nice to drink, though the citrus is a bit high. I am not sure if I remember it being like this when I had it on bottles a while ago."
De-bottles a lightly smoky golden amber stacked with a wet and sticky mess of ivory suds.
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a mixture of pine and citrusy hops. In the taste, primarily piney hops and just a hint of citrusy hops. A small bite, yet a mostly smooth mouthfeel, and a dry piney hop aftertaste. Big on piney hops and actually not as bitter as anticipated. Hides the alcohol and very, very good."

BAM - YES I SAID BAM!
Appearance: Dark golden/amber brew with a finger of head that quickly disappears. Decent amount of lacing as you go. 
Batch 8283
12 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Nice fluffy off white head that stands a fingers width. Slow recede and has some nice lace stickage. Color is a slightly hazy apricot golden orange. Nice bright color.
"a-- Clean copper color, head fades quickly"
"Sweet Jeebus, I have been waiting for this stuff to come back since the day I ran out last year. I must remember not to share any with my roommates this time. Live and learn. Sometimes greed is permissable. So, how is the 'o8 batch? Let's begin. Pours burnt gold into the chalice. The head, while it is there, serves as a nice marshmallow contrast to the rich hues of the beer's body. Immeadiately I can smell this sucka'. A good foot and a half and it is still unmistakable and plain as day. Yup, this is the Hopslam I remember. Deep floral aromatics with a sweet underpining of succulant malt. And yeah, even the honey notes dance around. Ugh, just delicious. And I haven't even tasted it yet. Wow, the hops literally race all around the perimeter of the tongue with spicy, resinous pitchforks, prodding at the sides and back of my buds while the heavy malt body cooly slides down the middle of the mouth. The balance on this bottle of jet fuel is stunning. It's drinkability is surely many a mother's ruin. THough a raging 10% a.b.v. it is nowhere to be found. Mmmmm, must buy more. I wonder how much blood I need to sell on a weekly basis to keep this in the fridge while supplies last? If you just skipped down to the end of this review, the bottom line is this is GOOD. And if you don't like it, no problem. More for me to buy. Cheers."
Thanks once again to mymrnngjckt for hooking me up with another awesome brew. This was part of NEPA BC split #13 as well.
"A: Beautiful golden honey in color and no haze at all. The head was as white as I've ever seen, which really surprised me. The bubbles were so small and dainty."
"This huge Imperial IPA pours a rich orange amber color with a steady stream of fine carbonation rising from the heart of the brew. The super frothy, almost creamy off-white head refuses to recede and leaves some towering walls of uniform lace. What an attractive brew!"
"slightly hazy deep honey amberish with an off white head that has decent retention and just okay lace. nose isn't as strong as you would expect from such a tasty, hoppy brew, but it is divine nonetheless. tastes of wet hops and fruit (apricot, passion etc...). also, hints of flowers, herbs and bubblegum as well as a faint fruity malt with some grains. the honey not only adds a little needed sweetness and balance and mellows out the booze and acidity a bit, i think it adds a little fullness and creaminess to the body. dangerously drinkable. definitely up there with the all time best of the best dipas. get it while it's fresh and enjoy it while you can."
"Honey - dark honey. Honey-amber? Thin off-white head. Aroma of green wet hops. Flavors of floral hops, apricot, and sweet grains. The honey added is well integrated - not too sweet, and it seems to lend a silky mouthfeel, or maybe I'm being misled. Alcohol is in check - not much intrusion. Good stuff. Two Hearted Ale meets the Incredible Hulk."
Beautiful golden pour with a small white head. Lacing all the way down the glass.
12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.
"A- Bright golden brown with 1/2"" of bleach white head after a semiagressive pour. This brew is totally transparent."
"12 oz bottle, batch 8283"
a: Pours a moderate off-white head with modest retention. The beer is a bright copper-amber in color.
I had this last year and tought it was so so but I must say my pallette must be maturing because I absolutely loved this years offering..Helping was the fact this is FRESH..This had a cat piss litterbox nose but when you drink it the clean hops jump right out at you with a surprising easy drinkibility..Not over the top on anything and this delivers a clean freshness...Like walking outside on a ski slope with pines around fresh air. The alcohol is WELL HIDDEN and you can find yourself in trouble in a hurry at almost 10% and the easy drinkibility of this one! AWESOME..Hats off Larry you nailed this one!
"08 release poured in a tulip. Clean, clear burnt orange with faom head. Not much rentention, but left a ring that laced perfectly down the glass."
Waited until I had it this year to review. This beer is as good if not better than I remember it.
I'm damn glad that I had the chance to buy this beer. 
"well, the only thing that really needs to be said about this beer is that it smacks you in the face with hops. hops, hops, hops. not much nuance to this beer, if that is your thing then this is the beer for you. I wasn't sure if I was drinking a beer or grapefruit juice until the 9.5% alcohol crept up. "
Thanks a bunch to markgugs for thowing this into a trade a surprise... I've wanted to try this for a while now.
I picked up a couple bottles of this at Thomas Liquors in St. Paul. 
This one comes courtesy of Grandcrudrew...
"Popping the top - grapefruit, pine and canteloupe. I'm used to the other scents but canteloupe is a new one. This pours a shade of amber I associate with the containment of prehistoric bugs. The taste is heavy on the grapefruit - and I like that end of the DIPA spectrum - with plenty of apricot, orange peel and a nice hot spicy background that reminds of Belgian IPA's. Not much of a malty body to start, but becomes a bit more prominent as this warms up and helps prop up the fruity bitterness. This finishes a bit dry for my liking and is a little lacking in layers. It's also a little medicinal on the very tail end, which is unfortunately what lingers. Even so, I keep coming back for another smell and sip. And another. If it weren't for the slightly unpleasant notes creeping in at the 11th hour, this might be toward the top of my DIPA list. Big thanks to Hoppymeal for the chance to try this (as an extra no less! karma). In spite of qualms, I'll come back if I see this on shelves."
A local bar got a case of this stuff in last night and since I haven't been able to find it anywhere else I decided to try a bottle. Expertly poured by the bartender into a Unibroue tulip. Bright cloudy orangish-tangerine color with a massive white head that took its time to fade away into a thin crown that stayed until the last sip. 
Poured from a 12 oz bottle.
12 oz glass served at mad mex.
Appearance. Nice orangy cloudy color. I poured to quickly but it's got a nice thick off white head and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.
"Poured this from a 12 oz brown bottle into my tulip glass. Appearance is solid, though not exceptional. Pure amber color with a minimal head and lacing. However, its unexceptional look is deceiving. Upon raising the tulip to my nose, I am greeted with one of the most sensational aromas my two nostrils have ever beheld. Absolutely unadulterated hops. Delicious fruity smells such as grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Crisp pine smells also sing their songs. Lying underneath all of this is honey. Rarely does a beer leave me in such awe before even taking my first sip. Taste does not disappoint. Hops like crazy. Super unbalanced, but really, a malt presence would just get in the way here. Mouthfeel is surprisingly perfect for this. It's nice and light considering the punch it packs. Great carbonation. Really, I wouldn't change this one bit. Extremely drinkable. This is a work of art."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, batch 8277"
Pours a cloudy amber with a slow forming one-fingered white head that slowly recedes to a small cap. Some sticky lacing is left behind.
12 oz bottle acquired as an extra in a trade with markgugs. thank you
"12 oz brown longneck bottle from Abe's. Haven't had a chance to try this yet, so i was excited to crack it open. Poured into a wide tulip."
"One can not write a review of this beer without mentioning the citrus hoppiness. The first time I sampled this brew last year I was knocked on my ass by how fruity it was. This year's batch is most welcome in my small collection. One thing I noticed, and this might just be me, but this year it seems a little more bitter, which seems to hide some of the citrus the more I drink. Maybe it's just palate fatigue, but by the end of the beer I don't get as much hop flavor as I would like, and thus the bitterness and the alcohol start coming through."
Tried it last year and fell in love. This one has some kick but is semi drinkable in terms of a double digit abv. 
"One of my favorites, this Double IPA shines through with a clear amber color that is more translucent than expected. The smell bombards your nose with hops and citrus undertones and a touch of malts. The taste slams your toungue with bitter hop tones that consist of grapefruit, pine, coriander, pineapple and a small backstop of malts. Wonderfully strong, great mouthfeel, and I would conclude that the drinkablitly for this beer (for me) is high."
"The appearance is a hazy, golden orange with a nice fluffy white head that falls to a covering. Decent lacing."
"Just picked up a case of this amazing brew. I got one six pack last year (it's a limited release) and loved every sip. When I went back to get more, it was gone!"
Batch 8283
"Pours a hazy orange color with a tight bright white one finger cap on it. The head fades fairly quickly, but leaves decent spotty lacing on my imperial pint glass. It is actually a little clearer than Two-Hearted which I find a little surprising. I can smell this beer as I pour it. It smells like I have hop cones under my nose. Pink grapefruit and resinous pine hit my nose with the power of a Roy Jones Jr. punch. There is a decent smell of pineapple coming though as well. Fresh citrus fruit and a deep pine flavor hit your palate up-front with a dry sweetness finishing off the beer on the back of the mouth. There is some slight sweet malt coming to the palate, but is pushed around by the heavy hop flavors and takes a back seat in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is very smooth and medium bodied. The high carbonation leaves a very dry sensation on your tongue. The drinkability is a little hampered by the high ABV and dry sensation, but is very high for just a beer or two."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden orange with a 1 cm off white head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma is brutally strong, piney and a little citrus. Initial flavor is balanced between the sweet malts and hugely bitter hops. Flavor of grapefruit is what i get the most of. Aftertaste is very dry from all the hops. Light to medium mouthfeel, almost no lacing, almost no carbonation, and the alcohol is well hidden. Very drinkable if you are a hophead, but for the rest of us its still worth a try."
yum yum yum yum yummy
"Poured into Bell's glass, and while pouring I smell a strong bouquet of grapefruit. I suspect it's just in my imagination, and glance over at the half grapefruit on the other counter. The grapefruit is embarrassed. It's all about the nose on this one. HOPS!"
"After some controversy over those who love and rate ""big beers,"" I'm attempting to think about this beer more objectively both within the style and among other beer in general. It's so hard when you love a beer like this one so much!"
Poured from the bottle into a snifter.
Acquired via trade from MuenchenerKindl
"Recently purchased a six-pack of this fine ale at the Liquor Barrel in Golden Valley, MN."
"Pours with a slight haze , smallish head , some lacing."
"Orange amber is color small head quickly dissipates to foamy islands. Great aroma as soon as the bottle is opened. I had high hopes for this IPA and I am not at all disappointed. Tons of floral grapefruit hop aroma with taste to match. Nice malt backbone gives it a just right sweetness to support the hoppy bitterness. I think candied orange best describe the middle of the taste. Finish is very hoppy and bitter. This is my kind of IPA, massive aroma and taste, full mouthfeel. Great drinkability."
"12 oz 2008 bottle poured into a Duvel tulip, batch #8277, labeled as 10 % ABV"
"12oz. brown bottle, purchased from Party Source, poured into a snifter. Batch 8278."
"A somewhat cloudy, brilliant orange color with minimal white head and above average lacing."
L:A nice bright orange that is very cloudy. Very small birght white head that disapears immediately.
Bought with much anticipation on 1/12/2008. Upon pouring notice that this years batch seemed a bit thin compared to 2007 batch.
"A: Slightly cloudy orange color, head is a creamy white."
Wow. That's all I have to say about this one.
A: Hazy amber color with a 1 finger slightly fluffy white head.
"Had this for the first time last winter, and am anziously awaiting it for their January?Feb realease."
"The appearance of this brew was a foggy dark orange color with great head and decent lacing. Smell was a fruity bouquet of flowers. The most hoppiest smelling beer i've had. This was a mouthwatering, cheek puckering experience in a bottle. Nothing packs more hops than this thing. A little bitter, but in a terrific sort of way. Creamy kind of feeling. Probably one of the best beers ive ever had."
Thanks to MuenchnerKindl for the sample
"January 2008, Batch #8277... I met Larry Bell a couple of weeks ago and let him know I've been waiting a year for this beer to come out again. So fresh hops aroma & taste... love this beer."
"Sunset orange with a small white head of foam that dies gradually and is reinstated by a quick swirl of my tulip glass. This sample was served to me at the Spinnerstown Hotel in Spinnerstown (outside of Quakertown, PA) right by the haunted graveyard. This brew is very hoppy with a small malt backbone of caramel and spice in the background. The various American hops really shine through in the aroma of this beer and the taste holds true as well. A spicy, snappy, hoppy treat of a beer with a sweeter hop note up front and a bitter, resiny bite in the back. This one is kinda the balls. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and well served to repeated drinking which lends a great drinkability to this hoppy yet extremely refreshing and smooth brew..."
"12 ounce bottle acquired in a trade from MuenchenerKindl, thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this beer"
Thanks to orbitalr0x for this great brew!!! Cheers!
Bottle lable #7690.
"a: pours a hazy gold with white foam, debris floats throughout (hops?)"
Delicious! That is really all I need to say about this beer. This was the beer that got me hooked on imperial IPAs. You can smell the hops as you pour. Pours amber/orane in color with a whitish head. Some alcohol flavor is present. Not overly bitter. Very smooth on the palate. Just amazing.
Thanks to franksnbeans for this one!
"This one pours a cloudy orange color with a medium head and has decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of grapefruit and grapefruit - actually, that's about all I get from this one. The flavor has enough malt to let you know that it's there, but it's almost all citrus and grapefruit hop flavors. Very hoppy. The body is medium/thick and the drinkability is ok."
"Look: Pours a hazy, murky, dark orange color."
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard pint glass.
A - Light cloudy orange with 2 fingers of white head and sticky lacing down the side of the glass.
"Re-Review updated from a ""B"" rating in 2007"
Tried on 3 separate occasions and finally decided to review.
Found at Capone's. Says here on the website that it is eight months old.
Copper in color with plentiful head. 
"Pours a golden orange with almost 2 fingers of creamy head that dies down to a layer sitting on top and huge lacing throughout. Smells of gynormous hops, pine, citrus and grapefruit. Tastes delicious. Huge hops, citrus, rind, grapefruit, pine and HOPS. Nice malty balance that lets this not be too over the top. I might not be getting the full hopslam effect since this is not a freshly bottled sample but this is up there and a delicious brew. Alcohol hides nicely and carbonation is perfect. No bitterness lingering. A classic."
"Very large mouth feel, excellent obsessive hop flavor. This is quite possibly the perfect American Double IPA. Serious flavor up front, smacks you like your dad's belt... then a long lingering floral hop experience through the finish. Wonderful mixture of some very organic flavors. This is my favorite beer of any that I have tried, and believe me, I've tried A LOT! Any serious hophead should hunt down a few bottles of this one and savor it for all it's worth..."
"Rejoice; Midwestern classic microbrewery in need of I2pa finally releases one and goes all the way, releasing it in six-pack damage the head format. The wait for this has been long in the making. I remember drooling over early reviews when it was served on draft at the Eccentric café. This ended up setting me back $15 for this sixer, a bit steep when you consider that works out to be about $4.50 a bomber. Still, this is a big beer that demands your attention, so what are you going to say, no? "
Got this one courtesy of SPLITGRIN with a number 7690 on the back of the label.
"This one comes courtesy of BARLEYWINEO, cheers! Date code of 4711 "
"Presentation: 12 oz longneck, label has a guy buried in huge hops. Indecipherable date code on the label."
Appearance: Hazy orangish color. Almost a green character as the aroma fills the room as I inspect the appearance. Good head which settles to solid lacing on the glass. 
"12oz. bottle, 2nd effort with this beer."
"Cloudy, bright peachy-yellow gold in hue; what a lovely color! It is like a tropical sunrise or something. Off-white foam, at the apex the head was almost two fingers tall. The bubbles quickly fell to a fizzy, soapy cap. Surprisingly there wasnt much lacing. The color of the liquid drives the attractiveness of the appearance; I do wish the head attributes were better. Still, this is a lovely looking beer. "
"A HopSlam indeed - whacks you 'upside the head with a huge dose of fresh, raw hops flavor. Bittering and bordering on a thick mouthfeel, but sufficiently reserved not to be too heavy. Hops stays forefront throughout, but manages not to completely overpower the senses. A well executed big hops beer."
Found a cold bottle of this at Martha's Vineyard-a bit of a surprise this time of year and something that I was looking to try. 
"Recieved this from brandoman63 in the brews-n-tunes summer '07 tour. Served slightly chilled in a snifter, from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a beautiful golden amber color, that was a bit cloudy. About a quarter inch of loose, bubbly white head formed in the glass. Head almost instantly faded into a ring of bright white lace in the glass. Smell: Smooth , somewhat aggressive herbal hop aroma, tons of biscuity malt aroma, pears, citrus fruits, and pine all rose from the glass. Taste: Bitter hops that slam the tongue, bready and malty , subtle pineapple and pear. Also some very well hidden alcohol. A pretty well balanced brew. Nice full bodied, somewhat thick but smooth mouthfeel. Mildly carbonated. A very drinkable beer. Very enjoyable."
Thanks to Jay23 for the chance to drink this Michigan beer all the way over here in California.
Appearance: This beer pours a very murky/ cloudy dull orange hue. The bright white head stood up to staggering heights but fell fairly quick leaving behind a nice web-like lace. 
"It's taken me a long time to get around to reviewing this one despite how many times I've had it, but that should tell you something :) This may just be my favorite American Double IPA. "
"From notes. Pours from the 12oz bottle a nice clear golden orange color with a half inch of bubbly white foam on top that leaves spots of lacing on the glass. Real nice clarity. Aromas are a blast of dense hops with an amalgamation of scents...floral, pine and big on the citric side as well with grapefruit standing out. Sorta sweet caramel in the background but the hop bouquet dominates here and really shines. One of the best aromas I've come across in awhile."
Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a full finger off white head that fades quickly. Spotty lacing observed.
"This was poured from the bottle into a pint glass. It has a hazy light copper color with a decent head that has good retention. The aroma is wonderfully hoppy and malty, blending to produce a pineapple like scent that is just fantastic. The flavor is strongly hoppy but balanced very well with the sweet malt so that the hop bitterness is noticed on the finish, but is not overwhelming. It has a medium body with moderate carbonation."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color like most IPA's. There is not a huge amount of bubbles that come up, but a generous amount. The smell of this beer is really terrific, lots of floral hops and special arrangements that I have never smelt before. The taste has five or six distinct hop tastes to it, but unfortunately never really develops any of them. You can tell that great time and energy went into this beer, but it seems like less time went into studying how the hops would react to each other, and whether or not they would all form together. I would still say this beer kicks ass, but the taste gets knocked as they forget that more is not always better. I'll definitely enjoy this again though."
Poured a medium hazy copper hue with a one finger creamy white head. There was good retention and sticky lacing.
"I think I am at the rapidly declining end of a love-hate hop relationship. I used to love these hop bombs, and now I often find them one-dimensional and hard to drink. This one, regardless of its high rating and great aroma/flavour, didn't really do it for me. What can I say about it? Massive grapefruit and pine hops all over the place. Balance is OK, but it's still a bitter beast. No astringency or soapy flavours, which is good, but not a whole lot of depth. Alcohol is very well-hidden. Refreshing, definitely a palate killer, and hopheads will (and obviously do) love it. "
"Twelve ounce brown bottle. Batch # on back label, which yields a bottling date when punched into Bell's online dB."
"A: Two and a half fingers of billowing head that dissipated ever so slowly, leaving in its wake a foamy lace. The beer itself was a transparent deep amber and burnt-orange."
Pours a hazy tangerine color with a sticky but thin off-white head. Carbonation bubbles rise to the top.
Thanks to hoppymeal and limesmut for this beast.
"Finally picked up this case after coveting it for about 6 months. Got home and poured one after a short cool in the fridge. A bit more bitter than i had expected, but this beer is exceptional. Great beer for fans of Pliny, Dreadnaught, 90/120 min IPA. Great beer!"
"this pours clear amber, leaving a bit of a fluffy white head. After a while, a ring remains and the foam sticks to the glass."
"This brew is a hazy orange/amber color with a medium thick cream-colored head that dissipates slowly. Thick coating of lace on the entire glass. Huge grapefruity hops in the nose, along with a touch of sweet malt. Medium-bodied with a rich hoppy character that is full of zesty citrus and some pine. The alcolhol is well-hidden but you can tell it is there. Some sweet malt and fruit flavors are underneath as well. The finish is nicely bitter and lasting, retaining the citrusy hops feel. Not one of the ""punch you in the face"" IIPAs but very good in its own right."
12oz bottle in pint glass
"I had this first at a Larry hosted event recently in D.C. (incidentally, go if you ever have the chance. Larry Bell is a great host.) I was most impressed with this beer during the tasting and wanted to get my hands on some again. Here's are my thoughts on a bottle provided by a friend from Virginia."
"Poured from the tap at Larry's to a tall thin glass. The liquid is a light gold with very good carbonation. The head is 2 fingers of off white thick fluff, It leave quite a bit on nice lace."
"Pours a clear copper color with nice big head that takes a few moments to dissipate. Big grapefruit aromas when you pop the cap with some pine notes lurking. Taste is relatively smooth citrus and pine hops with plenty of malts to give a sweet body. As it gets older the hops die off more quickly than I would have thought and it becomes a boozy sweet beer that does not reflect the fresh beer much at all. Mouthfeel is nice. A little too much alcohol to get a high drinkability score. A great DIPA, up there with my favorites. Fresh on draft must be excellent!"
"Man, what a beautiful head. Full, dense craggy bubbles that melt slowly to very sticky lacing and top covering white. Light, cloudy golden orange liquid."
"Bottled from batch 7806 and received in trade. I was very excited to receive this beer after reading so many glowing reviews. It has not disappointed. The aroma is big and the flavor is bigger. Huge citrus hop, lemon/orange and some pineapple and honeydew flavors. Great long lasting full flavor and it burps great too! Man, if Bells had California distribution, it would certainly be in a regular rotation for me."
Appearance - Hazy orange color. Fluffy white head that dissapates fairly quickly.
12oz bottle poured into a tulip.
A- About a inch thick white (or JUST off) head on a cloudy darker orange body.
Loved this beer.
Served from a 12 oz bottle.
"12 ounce bottle poured in to a snifter. Texas orange with a short lived creamy color head. Very clear. Orange pith, wet grass, simple syrup, honey, maybe maple are in the nose. Lots of tongue coatig grapefruit and tropical hop flavor the finishes with a pleasant bitterness. Flavor lasted from front to back for several seconds. It keeps going and going. Thin and light on the palate, a sixer of this could go down in no time. My new favorite Bells? It certainly doesnt beat out Expo, even though its more drinkable. Your night my last longer with Two Hearted. I think Hopslam beats it out though."
"Bottle courtesy of IMtheOptimator: Poured a slightly hazy yellow color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of citrusy hops is well balance with sweet caramel malt  the smell of this beer is really great and I can only compare with 3F dreadnaught in term of greatness. Taste is such a well balance mix between sweet caramel malt, bitter and citrusy hops and a great floral aspect to hold it all together. This is definitely something I will want and drink some more."
"No doubt one of the finest dbl ipa. The color looked like a orange neon in the night. The only reason I didn't give the appearance a perfect score, I have seen larger more intense heads on other dbl. ipa's. The taste had multiple levels of flavors. First wave of pine resin to coat your palate for the second wave of intense grapefruit"
thanks to demcorhip for this via trade!
props to murray's wine & spirits in milwaukee for supplying this great out-of-season double IPA!
"had this on-tap at three floyd's and numerous bottles by the case. poured a thick golden/orangey color with nice clarity. aroma was not overpowering as expected. fresh honeyed bread dough and floral, piney, citrusy notes in the nose. fruity aromas as well with pineapple and a bit of apricot. nice thick malt sweetness at the start is quickly overtaken by the ridiculous amount of hops in this beer which leads to a long, bitter finish that goes on and on. honey flavor is just right. a thick bodied and viscous beer but not too much so. luscious mouthfeel, but still some nice carbonation present. so well done it is hard to believe this is such a high abv beer. if this weren't over 9% i would have a few of these guys. alcohol extremely well-hidden. good fucking shit."
"12 ounce bottle, batch 7741, packaged on 11/28/06. Served in a snifter, the beer pours an amber/orange color with about a half inch white head which goes away pretty quickly. With a name like HopSlam, of course it smells like hops. Citrus (grapefruit) and piney hops dominate, with some malt in there. It tastes pretty much the same, but the citrus taste is stronger, with grapefruit, lemon and some orange in the taste, along with a piney/floral taste and some grain/malt. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with it being creamy and oily. Just the right amount of carbonation, too. The relatively high ABV isn't very noticable, and it's very, very drinkable. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer. I'd definitely buy this again."
"12oz bottle (I am assuming this a 2006 release) poured into a pint glass. It is copper in color with a small white head that recedes fairly quickly into a light covering. Also there is quite a bit of yeast from the bottom of the bottle that got stired up in the pour. The smell is very nice for a DIPA, hops and more hops. It is good mix of pine and grapefruit that yields a sweet bready malt smell through it all. The first sip is not as hoppy as the smell but very well balanced. It has an initial kick of pine but quickly turns to the malt and alcohol and finishes with a very nice bitter. It also has a slight medicinal flavor to it, but not overly strong. This is a good double ipa and doesn't get too sweet like some do in this style. The alcohol is just a tad warm for me, but not enough to say it is distracting. The mouthfeel is medium to thick and coats the mouth nicely. The overall drinkability is good for 9.3 abv beer. This is an excellent example of the style, not the best, but in the mid to top of the pack."
"Sampled a few different batches thusfar. Lovely hints of grapefruit and lemon on the palate. My only complaint is its a bit medicinal and herbal and I just dont like Double IPAs with that character. But, it has a lovely malt character. Wish it was a tad bit brighter, but its a lovely DIPA. Its no dreadnaught, but its a dawn good brew."
"Bottle into snifter. A: Bright hazy gold, creamy head that stuck around. S: Hoppy of course, very rich, lots of orange juice, raspberry, grapefruit, pine. T: Amazing. I've rediscovered the majesty of hops. More citrus and tropical fruit giving way to a balanced maltiness. Really incredible. M: Smooth, light carbonation. D: An absolute gem all around. For such a whopping ABV it's amazingly easy to drink."
Thanks to bditty187 for this bottle.
Appearance
"The quality of Bell's is delivered again. Perhaps Bell's best beer,! This is an excellent double IPA. If you love hops, you'll love this stuff. A great citrus aroma. The new batch is at 10% Alc and is very drinkable. This is easily one of my top 5 favorite beers."
"Served on tap in a 10oz flute styled glass at Flying Saucer in Charlotte, NC. Pours a murky rust orange hue with minimal head. No lacing."
12oz bottle received from grynder33 in a great trade.
"Sampled at the Lava Lounge in Waterloo, Iowa."
From a bottle into an over-sized wine glass.
"Wow, incredible beer. Very hoppy (duh)"
Had this Bell's product at Christmastime when I was visiting my family in Michigan.
It pours a golden orange color with a small white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice lace around the top of the glass. It is a little cloudy.
Incredibly aromatic! Could smell it while being poured from the bottle into my mug. Poured with a nice head and some lace that lasted throughout the mug. Slightly hazy amber. Predominant grapefruit with a bit of pine in the nose and flavor. Body is decent. Looong hoppy finish that later turns a bit sweet or turns on the saliva glands. Very good beer! Little much in the grapefruit department for me. Still....
"On draft at Vintage Estate in Youngstown, OH. Appearance is a golden orange amber color with minimal head. Citrus hopped IPA at its finest, you can really smell the serious amount of hop goodness. Taste is amazing very well balanced nice bitter flavor with that ipa finish. Highely recommend beer and would have again and again, if possible."
"Batch 7690 bottled on 10/25/06. Poured into a tulip. This beer is very cloudy and golden in color. The head is about 1 finger and dissipates quickly leaving some heavy lacing and stickiness all over the sides of the glass. Smell is floral at first - there is also some pine and a little bit of an almost pineapple like sweet smell, very interesting. This is an excellent tasting beer, even better than it's brother Two-Hearted, IMO. There's some grapefruit flavor up front which gives way to pineapple sweetness and it all ends with a bitter, dry hop kick. This is by no means the hoppiest beer ever, but it is incredibly well balanced for a double IPA. Mouthfeel is syrupy and delicious - the carbonation amount is just right. An incredible beer from my home state - this is an easy beer to drink, which might be dangerous since this baby clocks in at around 10%. Highest recommendation."
When it Bells it pours..I went from dreaming about Bells beers to having 8 of there beers in a months time.Lets see how HopSlam holds up.
"Was very excited to try this on draft at Rustico in Alexandria. It pours a deep, bright and very hazy orange color with a rocky two-finger bright white head that dissipates a little quickly. It settles into a fine foamy ring and leaves hints of sticky lacing throughout. "
"Gorgeous beer, a foamy, light head tops off a dark orange body that sinks into a lighter, golden color toward the bottom; looks like it's going to taste great. The head fades quickly, but sticks to the glass like flies on a spider's web."
"Ultra-hoppy ""Double IPAs"" such as this appear to be all the rage in the USA nowadays. To my surprise, I rather enjoy this fad. I tried this fine example on tap at my favorite pizza pub, paired with a spicy pizza. The bitterness set off the spiciness quite well."
"FOURTH TRIAL: This is a great beer for any hop-lover, although I have to admit that it's tasted a bit different each time I've had it. This time it was great, other times it's a bit too sweet for my taste. It pours a golden yellow with very little head (there is a good bit of lacing though). The aroma is slightly peachy with a lot of nice, clean hoppy citrus. The taste is similar, but there's a definite warming and you can taste the alcohol (not in a bad way). This beer is less malty that some of the recent DIPAs I've had, but the little malt flavor it does have is a nice caramel. The mouthfeel is full and smooth and it leaves a nice sticky bitterness on the back of the tongue. Overall, a great Double IPA."
Poured from 12 oz bottle:
"This beer should be served in a juice box (Buster Bluth, beware), it's so fruity and sweet and candy-like. Every sip is pure indulgence. The hop oil is so unami and rich that it's like bacon grease and kobe steak."
"Pours clear light copper in color with a thick white head. Perfumy, hoppy aroma has citrus & pine in it. Biscuity malt background. The mouthfeel is airy and medium-bodied with prickly carbonation upfront. Resiny hoppy front. Citrusy hops and bitterness abound. An inhale reveals malt and an ample supply of alcohol on the tongue. There's some malt underneath all the hop bitterness in the flavor but it's severly overshadowed by the impressive amount of hops utilized. Juicy hop burps ensue."
"I poured this into a DFH snifter. This beer pours very cloudy. I would have liked to see it cleaner. According to the BJCP, slight haziness is allowable if it is dry hopped, but this is a bit more than that. It doesn't seem to clear with time either. There is a huge hop bouquet even from a distance. Very strong citrus aromas, especially grapefruit, but slightly more bitter. The flavor is amazing though. It is not nearly as bitter as the flavor would have led me to believe. It is a dead ringer for actual grapefruit flavoring. The bitterness is only in the background, and there is enough sweetness to back it up. This is a great example of an Imperial IPA (except the cloudiness); perhaps one of the best i've had."
"Deep gold with only the slightest haze. Very small white head that scarcely made it to the table. Nice smells - sweet honeyed grapefruit. Taste is the same. Big in your face slam of citrusy hops. Nothing too piney going on here. Not at all cloyingly sweet like some DIPA's I've had, but the sweetness is there. Taste is simple, yet fresh and inviting."
"12 oz bottle. Been getting 6pks for around $13-14. Pricey, but definitely worth it. "
"Appearance: Pours a hazy amber color with a white, foamy head that leaves splotches of lace"
"This is the second time I've had this beer; this bottle was far better than my previous on-tap experience with this beer. All-in-all, I would recommend, but it is definitely not the best DIPA I've had lately; both Leinenkugel's Big Eddy DIPA and Smuttynose Big A are better."
"From the bottle into my Delirium Tremens tulip glass. Yessir, the HopSlam is another pretty beer. Amber-apricot color with a nice creamy-looking head which, surprisingly, doesn't last too long. Minimal lace on the glass. The aroma here is phenomenal. It's like a piney citrus explosion in my nose, and I can't get enough of it. Truly a delicious scent. Reminds me of the 120 Minute in a way. Large and in charge. More beers should smell like this. The taste is great too. Fresh and hoppy, with pine, grapefruit, and pepper flavors. Noticeable alcohol presence here as well. Quite tasty indeed. Nice, smooth mouthfeel. Hoppy bitterness all down the back of the mouth and throat. Nicely done. I'm not surprised that it's over 9% ABV, but I wouldn't have guessed it. The alcohol is noticeable, as I said, but not overwhelming. This would pair nicely with a spicy Thai or Indian dish, and might even match up well with a strong blue cheese like Stilton. Another good beer from Bell's."
Ahhh.
Poured into a tulip glass
"Poured carefully into a nonic, trying hard to avoid mixing in the copious amounts of sediment in the bottom of the bottle (almost as much as some Belgian ales!). The result is a golden-amber hued beer with minimal carbonation streams and a vibrant, sudsy head of just-this-side-of-white foam, sticky and thick. Juniper-infused citrus juice blend in the nose: grapefruit, satsuma, blood orange. A coy sugary sweet scent sneaks around underfoot. The taste of this IPA is B-I-G: big candied orange peel malts and big citric hop bitterness. Grapefruit pith and pinetar candy in the middle. Sweetroll breadiness at the finish. Substantial mouthfeel, slippery but not yet syrupy -- always a plus in my book -- with a slight pepperiness all around. Not bitter enough to be outstanding (I'm picky about this style), but this is without a doubt an extremely fine DIPA. Would buy again. Many thanks to zrrbrrt for the opportunity."
Received via trade with buckeyenation.
Pours a wonderful clear light orange color (with the exception of the massive amount of floaties). Aroma is out of this world. Fresh pineapple and other tropical fruits. Good frothy white head and decent lacing. Taste matches the aroma- just an assault of fruits and hop flavour. No astringent bitterness whatsover. Just amazing- trust Bells to accomplish that. Along with the hops is a sweet malt back bone that gives a rich mouthfeel. I would say that this is a balanced DIIPA despite the hops. Exceptionally drinkable which would be very dangerous. I would love to try this on tap one day. Alcohol is absolutely hidden. Finish is a bit spritzy from the caronation but finishes clean somewhat bitter. Best IIPA Ive had the opportunity to sample.
"Pours an orange, golden color with some little floaters and a huge white head. The smell is what really draws you in to this one. Big and bold! Citrus and pine needles slap you in the face. Taste is just as big of a wake up call. Hops, hops, and more hops, of course! It's like someone took an orange and soaked it in pine-sol and threw it in my face. I mean that in a good way. Bombs the palate, but that's why I'm only drinking DIPA's tonight!"
"Murky, yellowish sort of color. Good sized head. Healthy dose of yeast poured out of bottle. Big hop nose-extremely fresh-like newly mown grass. Fantastic hop flavor-like sucking on a cone itself. Great lingering grapefruit like flavors. Underlying sweet maltiness. Has one of the freshest hop flavors I have ever had-similar to Moylan's Hopsickle. Great body-very full yet extremely quaffable. Exceptionally drinkable and dangerously so. I just want to gulp down the hoppy goodness in this beer. Definately kicks butt!!!! Thanks to trep for this ""extra"" trade sample."
12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.
"HopSlam from Bell's poured golden yellow in body, topped by a towering bright white head. Lace remained on the glass, after the ale was finished. The aroma was a powerful blend of grapefruit and pine with a hint or orange. Flavors included orange peel, grapefruit, bitternesss, and malty sweetness. Body was medium-full with medium carbonation levels, and the beer coated the tongue."
"A golden wheat orange hazy hue of a body hosts a fat bubbley off white head at about an inch and a half that fades fast and leaves nice lace. Nose is a monsterois hop explosion. Very floral and an invigorating eye opener with wiffs of fresh citrus and spicey pepper hints. Splashes the tongue with huge surprisingly sweet ripe citrus tones. Very hoppy but bitter is not harsh but silky and longingly enjoyable. This beer is its own hop masterpiece. Nice real hop, long and fresh mouthfeel. Oddly drinkable for such a mouth bruiser. Your tongue will never be the same."
poured from a 12oz. bottle into a tall weiss glass (review from Batch 7690 - bottled late Oct. 2006)
12 oz bottle split with a buddy and poured into pint glasses. The color was a hazy orange with a small head. The smell was fruity and inviting. The taste was jam-packed with hops(what a surprise) but they were more fruity than bitter. The alcohol was perfectly hidden which made this go down quick. Very nice beer but I wouldn't buy it at $14 a sixer
"Andrew (orfeu) your the man giving this beer to me I thought I was gonna have to wait until May when Iam back home to try to get my hands on this.Poures a hazed peachy color with a tight well formed sticky white head,holy cow fresh hop aromas citrus fruit with underlying pine it really wakes up the sences thats for sure just amazing.Oh man just hop goodness here resiny but bright and flavorful citric fruitiness combined with pine/resin dryness just great hop balance....malt nowhere to be found but thats fine with me.Liquid gold here for a hophead its bright and flavorful with awesome hop complexity,again thanks alot Andrew this kicks serious arss."
"Draft at KClingers. Bright orange-yellow with a thin layer of white foam. Holy crap ... this is one of the biggest hop-fruit aromas Ive ever experienced, almost orange-blossomy. Follows with the same flavors, big and oily, tart and tangy, like an orange soda on steroids. (#2649, 1/14/07)"
Thanks to Warriorsoul for this sample! Sampled & reviewed on 1/14/07:
"Poured into a Duvel tulip at below-ambient temperature. Two-fingered head is rocky, pale tan in color, and exhibits both good retention and ample lacing. Nose is all but phenomenal, with yeast, citrus, and ripe fruit notes (pineapple, cherry, plum). There's definitely a hint of alcohol on the nose as well, but it is all but overrun by the rich, oily lupulin qualities. Appears in the glass as a hazey, golden amber in color, with just a hint or auburn - this ale looks better than most beers taste! There's plenty of suspended yeast here, too, and this never bothers me (I'm particular that way I guess). The first sip is like an epiphany, with sweet pale and rich caramel malts coating the tongue, followed by the bittersweet interplay of hop and malt, an even sharper yet-aromatic hop bite, a dose of mildly pungent yeast, with a palate-searing bitterness capping off the brief encounter. The alcohol bite is all but obscured by the juicy, fruity malt and sharp, bitter, and herbaceous hops. The finish is quite dry, yet here the alcohol plays a part, elevating the aromatics and adding some heat to the ale's considerable body. The herbaceous quality of the hops is somewhat unyielding, and this tends to introduce a very tangible vegetal character into a style that can sometimes be rather refined. The citrus notes of the hops are grapefruit, orange, and lemon peel. There's some green grapeskin and a very light touch of mint as well. The alcohol becomes more prominent and warming about halfway through the pour, becoming hot and spicy. Mouthfeel is medium-full, with the body being just about perfect (at least to me), not too full with viscous malt ala a barleywine but full enough to give the warming alcohol and blazing hops a solid oak-tree of a backbone. Drinkability is likewise exceptional: a beer this strong, bitter, and insistent could be a real turn-off for those who prefer milder ales and pale lagers, but there's tremendous balance and finesse exhibited here, which is everything I'd expect from Bell's. Very much a sipping beer, and not one I'd care to drink more of two of in a sitting, but probably one that I'd like to stock a lot of in my cellar! "
"Appearance: On draft at Kclinger's Tavern in Hanover, PA. It's like apricot nectar with a big, white, creamy head and awesome lacing."
"A very rare all 5-er for me, but this beers deserves that and more. A pale, hazed apricot colored pour wears a frothy white cap that lasts forever and leaves a thick crusting of lace on my goblet."
"Pours an attractive, slightly hazy orange amber. The aroma reminds me of taking a whiff of a generous handful of citrusy hop pellets, but the nose also features a nice touch of slightly fruity malt sweetness as well. Hop bitterness and grapefruit citrus hop flavor dominate the palate from beginning to end, though its never to overbearing (at least not for a double IPA anyhow). But there is a good deal of malt sweetness, with definate notes of grain and fruit, to balance. The bitterness is particularly aggressive in the finish. The body is fairly full with a slight, but sharp carbonation tang. Quite drinkable for how rich it is, not to mention the 9% ABV."
2006 Vintage - 12 oz bottle poured into a big wine glass at cellar temperature - About 45 degrees
Bells Hop Slam 12oz 
I paid $16 for a 6 pack...
12 oz brown bottle from 6-pack.
"Being a hophead, I had high expectations for this beer. However, as I started to review the characteristics of Bell's Hopslam, I grew a little concerned."
"Icredibly smooth yet deceptively powerful, the beer's highly aromatic hops are balanced with honey for a true Midwest-style IPA, dressed up in imperial clothes. Its ease to see why Hopslam is among the best of all American beers."
Pours from 12oz bottle a cloudy orange with a smallish head of foam that quickly shrank and then left no trace.
Sampled through the kindness of WeisGuy.

Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle
Ok so this is the best DIPA that I have had by far at least untill this point. 
Pours hazy copper with some light dregs making it into the glass.
"Hazy golden/copper color and a spotty off white cap that actually has some stick to it. The nose is fruity, spicy hops, citric, grapefruit and a strong alcohol tinge. Tastes of bitter, dry, spicy hops, pithy fruit characters, and an impenetrable alcohol burn. Barley malt balance, piney, and some resiny turpentine notes. Full body and medium mouthfeel has some chew to it followed by some cloying. The finish is good with fruity, peppery character but much of the alcohol carried over is a little overwhelming. Flavor is good but the alcohol burn makes this a hard one to drink more than one."
"Poured into a standard pub pint. A one finger vanilla cream head with bits of hop suspended in it. Fine carbonation, not a lot but its there. Very piney with a bunch of citrus. Slick citrus hops coat the tongue with a bite in the middle to back. Moderately sweet body with a long hop finish. Worth trying but not top of the heap."
12oz. bottle poured in a standard pint glass.
"A light amber color with strong visibility of carbonation. It has a quater inch white head, that has very good retention. What an incredible aroma, strong hop scents, with citrus, pine, and earthy fragrances attack the nose. Malt starts the flavor off well, then it blends into this intense hop flavor. The hops start slowly with a light citrus flavor, it then it gradually becomes more pronounced as it reaches every taste bud on the palate. A light feel on the tip of the tongue, but it gains heftiness as it flows towrds the back of the throat. Quite frankly, this is an amazing beer, incredible aroma, intense flavor (106 IBU's !), make this a must try beer for any hophead out there."
Many thanks to Sudsdog for this treat.
"Holy crap! I absolutely love this beer! Without a doubt the best IPA I've had. I can't wait until it hits Iowa City, if indeed it does (it's supposed to). Many thanks to my roommate, Dave (Hoptongue) for bringing this back home from his most recent beer excursion. Even though he probably isn't reading this... douche."
"One of the best beers I've tried even being on the expensive side, $14.99 for a 6 pack. Very, very hoppy with a strong grapefruit aftertaste that lingers for a little while. Nice carbonation and the alcohol does not jump out at you but at 9.30% you'll probably notice it more the first time you stand up. While there are a few other DIPA's out there for less $$, this is a hard-to-find item where some stores are only getting in a couple of cases for the whole season."
"Took the bottle from the fridge and poured it right into my glass. Cloudy yellow/light amber color with a whitish/yellow head. Good head retention. Strong citrusy smell - mostly like oranges, and this came through in the flavor a little as well. Almost tasted a little of orange rind with the hop bitterness on the end. Pretty well balanced bitterness and maltiness produced an above average flavor. Medium/full body with medium/light carbonation. Very drinkable beer for me. Only the 2nd DIPA I've tasted, and I liked this one much better than the first."
Appearance: Beer poured a nice cloudy straw yellowish color with a nice pillow white head. Nice lace on the glass.
"Presentation: 12 oz bottle, batch 7690"
"This beer pours out an attractive apricot-straw color that is likely cloudy from all of the hop resins. It was covered with about a half-inch of white head, that left belgian lace all the way down the glass."
"Aroma - Huge sharp citrus hops jump right out of the glass. Tangerine, grapefruit, orange, very well established hop character. Well done, very pleasant and meets all the marks for an Imperial IPA"
"Batch 7690, poured to a standard pint."
I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. I've drank so much of this stuff!
"Cloudy golden color with white head and modest amount of carbonation. Smell is a burst (or slam) of hops and as expected the taste follows suit. Lots of pine is noticable at first. Very resinous mouthfeel, almost sticky. Finished with grapefruit bitterness and some burn from the ABV hops combination. Not what i would call highly drinkable but certainly fits the bill for a DIPA."
"Pours a slightly hazy 18 karat gold color, with a thin one finger head. Decent retention leaves behind a bit of lacing. Looks innocent, and doesn't prepare you at all for the..."
"Two thoughts:Nectar of the Gods and Grapefruit Juice from heaven. That is what this beer is like. I love the total package. Very artfully crafted. The hops are HUGE! But, they're hidden behind a masterfully built malt base. Lots of citrus, pine and honey flavors going on here. What a great combination. A hopheads dream? I think so! The finest beer that I've tasted so far to date."
"Pouring this beer produces a huge, foamy white head of about two inches in a pint glass. Head rentention is excellent throughout the entire glass. The body is a very hazy amber color with a ton of what I assume are hop particles floating around. "
"I bought a single bottle of this and brought it home only to find it was just half full. After swapping it back at the store, I brought a full one back to drink and review."
"Reflecting on the $12 price for a sixer ($2 bucks a bottle), this really is not an overpriced brew. This puppy is loaded with a quality taste, and packs an alcohol punch."
"There was a lot of hype surrounding the release of this beer, and for good reason. This has quickly become one of my top beers and it never disappoints."
Finally getting around to putting my review into the system.
"Hazy, cloudy orangey sunset body, slowly drifting carbonation streams, topped by three fingers of various assorted sized bubbles. Excellent lacing."
"A - Pours out a copper color with a large, foamy white head. Leaves lacing."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a murky copper color with a huge three-finger off-white bubbly head. Sticky, foamy lacing is left on the glass. Smell is amazing... I can smell it from two feet away. Definitely all hops, mostly citrus (grapefruit) and slightly of pine. The taste is similar to the nose, obviously mostly hops. I have to disagree with those who say the alcohol isn't noticeable. Don't get me wrong, it is a great tasting beer for 9.3%, but it is noticeable. The mouthfeel is actually quite a bit lighter than I had anticipated and has a creamy consistency. This is a wonderful beer by Bell's and aside from the fact that it does have a substantial ABV, it is a very drinkable beer."
"Poured in to a pint glass. A hazy, coppery-orange with a small head which quickly fades."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass to find a body copper in color and cloudy. It is capped with a two finger head that had some staying power. It leaves chunks of foam on the sides of the glass as you drink. The aroma is outrageous, truly amazing. At first it was all strawberry to me, then some mango and other citrusy notes. Complex and wonderful in aroma. It is a great tasting beer! A citrusy sweetness backed with solid bittering hops. A tad acidic in its bitterness in the end. It is well carbonated and smooth in the mouth. There may be the slightest alcohol warming going on at the end, but I tend to think that it is the spiciness from the hops. Very drinkable, very crisp. Amazing the way the 9% is hidden, very. Excellent beer."
Pours out a semi-cloudy orange with some floaties. Fingers worth of white head that leaves just faint lacing. Those particles stay suspended until I drink them...only a few have settled on the bottom. 
"Radiant ripe tangerine with a sparse cloud of fine particulates and a few larger flakes that I hope are hop leaves (the beer murks up considerably with the final pour). The tight-bubbled cap is ivory in color with a faint orange tint picked up from the beer beneath. While there's nothing spectacular about the appearance, it's definitely solid."
"tasted from what may be my last bottle of hopslam ever while watching the playoff game, brewing a batch of hazelnut brown, and tasting with friends. I'm deeply grateful my friend was willing to sacrifice two bottles of hopslam for the tasting-- bell's is becoming precious here in illinois..."
"Pours a heavily clouded, dark orange-amber color with a small white head that quickly disappears."
Poured fro 12 oz bottle to a goblet.
Pours a nice hazy apricot color with a nice cream colored thumb sized head that does impart some lace on my glass.
"I had this big sucker in bottle at UJ's on the Manatawny a few weeks back. The beer poured a yellowish color, a bit cloudy with a thick white head. The beer has a big citrus, hoppy aroma that is very pleasing to the nose. There is a nice earthy, hoppy bite to the taste that really takes hold of your tongue but there is also a nice balance of sweetness in this that makes the overall mouthful very enjoyable and smooth. nice carbonation and body."
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow color, with a nice fluffy white head. The head fades slowly, leaving many laces. Tiny particles of yeast is in suspension."
"Pours a hazed deep orange color with a thick white head and sheets of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is a wonderful boquet of hops. There is a little pine in there, some citrusy grapefruit, tangerine, and lime, along with some fresh peaches, and a faint toffee smell in there. Taste is more of the same as the aroma. Mouthfeel is a little more thin than you would expect from an IIPA but still good. Drinkability is great, no sign of the alcohol and this definitely goes down easy. Definitely a great beer and I will pick up more of this."
Thanks oakbluff for hooking me up with this beauty!
"The color is a nice amber. Even with a careful pour there are floaties by the hundreds. Also no head, but probably because of my timid pour. The smell of hops is amazing. The floral and grapefruity aromas are delicious. The taste is also delicious. Aromatic citrusy hops give way to drying bitter hops. And your taste buds are officially fried. The only thing to do is have another. But be careful, as I learned the first time I bought this. It is way too easy to drink considering the alcohol level."
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into my Sly Fox pint glass.
"Received in a trade from mac300. Thanks, man!"
A- Cloudy amber with minimal head which disappears quickly leaving a minor lace around the edges. 
Poured from the tap and into a pint glass.
"Although DIPAs are not my session beer, this is an DIPA that deserves extended sampling. If you are a fan of the style, this beer is a must try. If you are not a fan of DIPAs but want to increase your ability to judge other styles of beers this is a DIPA to start with. No doubt about the hops in this beer. Had it on tap at the cafe, will have to compare later to the bottle version."
"I've been trolling the site for a couple of years and am a founding member of the magazine, but only my second review. Forgive me if amateur in nature"
Appearance:
"Interesting color, kinda breaks away from the typical DIPA look. Pale yellow color (not quite as pale as Victory's HopWallop). Slightly cloudy, but was clear before the dregs came out. Now it has large chunks of yeast in it. White head, 1/2"" initially, now a sporadic mess on top. Lace grabs the glass."
"Excellent looking beer here, blonde color with a white head that has great retention and leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is very nice too, plenty of pine and fresh grapefruit to treat your nose. Taste was very hoppy, as expected. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, various other citrus flavors were also noticed. Bitterness was certainly present, but not a harsh bitterness, was more about hop flavor than IBU's. Medium body with a medium carbonation pair quite well with this one. Very solid beer, I would definitely have another, wish I picked up more than a single."
Big thanks to hoppymeal for this initial stock. 
"Pored a cloudy,hazy pale amber with a huge white head that did not fade. Smell was off the charts cirus hops, thought I was in an orange grove. Taste was well you can probably oimagin, fantastic. Deep citrus and Pine, but not overwhelming at all. Complex dry finsh. Not overly carbonated. This is very drinkable as the ABV is well hidden and I could probably end up drinking too many before I knew it. Oh how I cannot wait for all these Bell's to be in NC!!"
"12 oz. bottle with a green label that makes it quite noticeable on your local beer store shelves. The picture on the label is that of a man wearing blue jeans and sneakers being crushed by 3 big green hop buds. I bet when he woke up that morning that he didn't think he was going to get crushed by giant hops that day. You'll also notice that the man has very hairy arms. That got me thinking that the man under the giant hops is either Robin Williams or Tony Shalhoub. Bell's isn't going to say because then they would have to pay rights to them for using their picture, even though more than half of their body is under giant hops. On the back is another green label with a mini paragraph about the beer and a Batch ID #. Mine was 7690 and that means according to Bell's website that it was packaged on October 25, 2006. It's initial release was October 20th, 2006. That might mean that mine was one of the first or second batches of HopSlam bottled. "
"App: Pours from a 12 oz. bottle with a delightfully playful and vibrant label, truly representative of the unique characteristics of this double IPA. The body is clear and bright, tangerine, orange in color and topped by a chunky white head that clings to the edges of the glass. Beautiful. Obviously nice carbonation before ever putting glass to mouth."
"12oz. bottle poured a sun burst yellow/orange color with a large white head and spotty lacing also lots of particles floating around. Lots of tropical fruit in the aroma, some pineapple and other citrus hop scents. Taste like my tongue was slammed with bittering citrus hops with a bit of a dry finish. Good medium feel and easy to drink for a big hoppy beer."
"Pours cloudy, with a bright gold color and a voluminous head that fades to a collar while leaving some sticky lacing on the glass. Incredible aroma packed full of different hoppy notes, such as grapefruit and mint. The aroma also has a nice bottom end to it, with honeyish, doughy malts right up front. The palate is huge and juicy, it's so substantial you could think it's solid food. Big, brash bitterness first off, which leaves active pinpricks on the tongue long after swallowing. Doughy malts form the base of the mid-palate, with grapefruits and hints of metals coming through as well. Some sweetness comes through (from the malts and the alcohol, I expect), but it succeeds in being delectable rather than cloying. Fine-bubbled carbonation moves things along the tongue. Very bitter finish that coats the mouth for a long time after drinking."
"A sixer handed to me by my sister in law and her husband for xmas...how friggin' cool is that. Thankfully, they live right down the street from Shangy's."
This beer pours out a nice white head that sticks around and has a small amount of lacing. The color is a nice orange and looks nice. The taste is mellow with some very nice hoppiness that's not too bitter. The mouthfeel is very smooth and nice to the palate. Overall it's great and I would like to have more.
"Upon pouring, it looked good until a hunk of sediment fell out of the bottle. I don't mind all the floaties, but that was a little gross. Otherwise, it was a light copper color with a little off-white head. Upon smelling - PINE! Wow, hops in abundance, and a little floral. Hard to detect anything beyond the hoppy smell. Good, but that's it. Of course, the flavor was similar, with very little sweetness. A little oily and yeasty, and the finish lingered all day. In the mouth it was very pleasant - surprisingly smooth, and gently carbonated. Overall, this was a good brew, and I didn't notice the alcohol until I got a little loopy later. The hops definitely quashed the alcohol presence. Pretty good..."
"Acquired via trade from northertimber, so a big Thank you goes out to him."
12oz. Bottle
"Into a pint glass, pours a deep gold, yellowed around the edges, carbonation floating around, a solid inch+ of fluffy, bubbly head, off white, with some great lacing, and lots of particulate matter floating around, probably the yeast. Mmmm, yeast."
Thanks to my boy Kyle for always hooking me up with good Midwestern beers.
A: pours a murky dark golden yellow with a small head that dissipates very quickly.
split a sixer with DrJay on a recent beer run to MI. boy am i glad i did!
"A - Pours a deep gold/ amber color witha na off white head. Some lacing going on, but not much."
"Pours a murky gold with a finger of white head, slowly dissipating. Strong citrus and pine needles in the noise, with pine needles becoming more pronounced over time. Slam is right for the taste; multiple levels of hop bitterness, maltyness in a thick body. It lights up sweet and bitter at the outset, levelling off to a creamy sweetness, and leaving a bitter tang at the end. Alcohol comes out more in the flavor than the nose, but I'm sure it acts to enhance the flavors. Very good drinkability, but the alcohol leaves a trail on the way down, so I don't have a desire to drink it rapidly."
"Clear, deep gold, just short of orange. The foam off the pour was a mixture of fine, creamy bubbles and larger ones that clung to the glass. The head fell somewhat, leaving some lacing behind. Throughout the glass there was a constant renewal of lace. Intense hop aroma. Grapefruit and pineapple give it a sweet-tart quality and pine resin keeps things interesting. It's a little powdery, floral and smells very fresh. Strong bitterness is kept in check by significant malt sweetness. The malt isn't really complex, but that's not the point. The hops are the point - and there are plenty in here. Grapefruit, tangerine, and pine dominate from start to finish. Quite fruity, actually. Bitterness lingers and there's alcohol warmth from the mid through the finish. Medium/full bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy texture. This stuff is great. Too many brewers forget about balance in this style, but Bell's has done a great job here. I could drink this all night (at least until the abv caught up with me)."
"I was apprehensive about this beer, namely because of its price, $14.99 for a sixer. I was rewarded, however when I cracked the cap open on my wall-mounted gem of a bottle opened. I got out a fine pint glass and began the pour. "
"From a twelve-ounce bottle packaged on October 25, 2006. This beer came into my possession via my highly trained local elite ninja underground case-splitting network. Thanks guys, you know who you are. Beer served in my ""Mondial de la Bière"" stange/flute/mug-type glass, a gift from Canadian BA Goldorak."
"Sampled from tap, poured into an unfrosted pint glass."
"First pour produced a slightly hazy golden tone, while the second pour really clouded things up. A creamy and thick off white head stuck around and left some decent wavy lacing."
"I like the Bell's Two Hearted Ale and when I spotted a single case of Bell's Hopslam in my neighborhood beer distributor, I had to purchase the case"
On-tap at the Blue Nile. Served in a 12 oz goblet.
"This beer, wow. The hops brings your taste buds alive. This high ibu beer does an excellent job of bringing a full body taste well rounded. To all that hops, and bells has done a great job with this hopslam. The aroma of the beer brings a strong fruity smell, but dont be scared this is not what you taste. Try the beer and let the hops take you away."

"Cloudy honey-apricot colored with particulate matter gyrating within, and a fine mist of bubbles rising up to a thin but mottled off-white and uneven head."
"Thanks to akorsak for hooking me up with two of these. I love it so much I almost regret passing one along to another friend =) I guess that is what advocacy is all about... sharing, right?"
"Pours a dark golden color with a bright white head. Had some kind of floaties in it as well that never settled. Unbelievable smell of pineapple juice and possibly grapefruit but on the sweeter side. Initial taste of sweet pineapple taste switching to a bitterness that was less than expected. The sweetness then kinda works it's way back in. Perfect carbonation, medium-light mouthfeel. Awesome drinkability for something this potent. Possibly my favorite in this style and only wish I would have bought more when I had the chance."
Batch 7741 picked up at corner beverage store. 14.99 for a sixer.
A: Batch #7741. Picked this up for $2.59 at B&B. Pours hazy orange with a slight reddish tint. Egg-white colored head. Foams up upon pouring and falls to a thin film. Leaves nice little rings on the inside of my glass.

"Batch 7690, obtained in Dexter Michigan in December 2006 and consumed that same evening. Pours a strong finger of yellowish head over a clear crown-golden liquid. Sediment retained in the bottle. Smells of pink grapefruit meat and oranges. Quite potent hops with a sugary sweetness playing minor support."
12oz bottle from Secret Santa jay23. Thanks for the opportunity.
"Served on-tap at the Brewhouse Grille in Camp Hill, PA. My comments on drinkability are taken from my comments on the bottled version."
"Two thoughts here. #1 - Whoah! Like chewing on a hop!!!!, and #2 - Whoah! Like chewing on a hop! Absolutely bright, vivid and in-your-face! Grapefruit! Pineapple! Pine-needles! All Pac northwest! One of the best, if not THE best, big-assed citrusy hop beers. Drinkability suffers a little bit, sure, but that's the trade-off for such a massively beautiful rendition of dripping, citrusy and piney hops in a glass. Hop-hazy as expected in the glass; dropping head. Alcohol can be inhibiting to drinkability, but never really exhibits itself throughout the first serving. Beautiful!!!!, but perhaps only for the initiated. Regardless, worth trying for the experience."
"Received from Wasatch in a recent trade. Nice caramel-orange hue, a thin head that holds up decently, and steady streams of carbonation visible. Loads of piney hop aroma and fresh oranges with other citrus fruit in the background. Very nice smell, reminds me of more west coast IPA's. "
A- medium copper with a soapy white head.
"Paler yellow than I expected, with lots of suspendies and chunky lace. Head was minimal and short-lived."
Can Larry Bell live up to the hype again?
Bell's- Hopslam
"I am glad I checked the Beer Yard website for this before trying to snag some in a trade. This really tastes like a West Coast Hop bomb & reminds me of Pliny the Younger. Big, big hop nose with a very hoppy taste. Some carbonation with the mouthfeel. This is a must for hop heads. Another stellar offerring from Bell's."
"On tap at JP O'Malley's in Allentown, PA on 12.19.06."
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.
Pours out like a pilsner with just a slight orange haze.
On tap as a seasonal beer at the ACME in Ft. Wayne.
I am not a huge hop head but this beer really hit the spot for me. 
Thanks to northernbrews for this much anticipated bottle of suds.
Served at Rich O's at the correct temperature. One finger of white head leaves a spiderweb of lace on the sides of the glass.The body is a rather clear brassy orange color. 
Poured from a 12oz bottle into a St. Bernardus Chalice (just because)
"Bottled October 2006, Sampled December 2006"
"Hazy copper color with a bit of sediment. The beer is topped by a thick, fluffy off-white head. The nose is dominated by citrus hops. Nice blend of grapefruit and mandarin orange. Little malt in the aroma. The flavor? Citrus, citrus, and more citrus. I would not call it a hop bomb, as the bitterness is not overwhelming, but there is a load of mandarin and grapefruit citrus with just a touch of pine midway. The malt is a subtle sweetness that accentuates the hoppy character. The mouthfeel is light and slightly effervescent. Remarkably, and wonderfully drinakble. There was a nice thread between some friends of mine a while back as to how this compares with the Two Hearted Ale. Very different beer. I prefer Two Hearted. This is still a nice offering."
"I cannot say enough good things about this beer. It pours well, not much head, great color, a bit cloudy or thick looking. The aroma is amazing, fruity, hoppy, and very enticing. The taste blew me away. I was expecting a big beer, and got one...now I can't stop drinking it. It has a nice balance, not too bitter, but it will ruin your palate for anything else. I could drink this beer all day and am getting worried about what I will be drinking when it is gone....that will be a sad day."
"Looks more like a plain jane pale ale than an INDIA pale ale. Some sediment floating around, mostly at the bottom. Dark gold to light amber in hue. The arom reeks of every kind of citrus. Very complex hop nose with a little malt in the background. The balance of flavor is tilting towards hop overlod. Only a special group of beer enthusiasts can handle it. Lemons, oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, nectarines, even some limes, lets not forget the light floral hint detected from this beer. The name sake is perfect for this beer. The palate is definetly cloying and syrupy and resiny. Just coats the tongue and lingers till it decides to leave. A beer with some attitude thats for sure."
Thanks goes out to Buck89 for this brew.
Admist studying for exams(I've got three tomorrow/today-its midnight) I find I needed some relief. What better way to sojourn in the calm before the storm than with a Double Ipa? 
"Wow, this one is sooo damn good! Fresh grapefruity hops on the nose, with some malty goodness to balance it out.. I actually have had hoppy brews, but this one is so well balanced and drinkable. Pours a clear golden color with a thick head and nice lacing. Smells of pine nuts and grapefruit. I could drink 6 of these and lose my mind in a heartbeat. A hop lover's ecstasy!"
"Pours gold to peach in color and hazy with a medium white head that quickly fades back to a thin covering. Aroma is big citrusy hops, grapefruit and a little tropical fruit going on, some sweet pineapple juice. There is also a hint of grainy-grassiness. Taste follows with some sweet pineapple juice flavor up front that blends into some grapefruit bitterness. The bitterness is nice and even graduating into a citrus rind dryness. There is the hint of what could be an alcohol burn, but it never quite gets to a burn, just on the verge, and then warms the throat with the dry finish. Light to medium in body, the malts are plentiful enough to balance the hoppiness and accentuate the citrus and pineapple flavors, but not overpowering to make you think of a dipa-barleywine hybrid. The bitterness is not a huge kick in the teeth but is still large and nice and even from about mid-taste thru the finish. Very good beer easy to drink, deceptively strong."
"Aroma: Like stepping into a hop field! HUGE I mean HUGE aromatics. The biggest whiff of the freshest hops I have ever smelled, seriously. Tons of chlorophyll. Like rubbing freshly cut grass between your hands when there turning green. Grape skin aroma with a ,now bare with me, a kinda body odor smell, yes like B-O. But not disgusting."
"Jumpin Jehoosefat! Someone swapped my Hopslam with ruby red grapefruit juice! The appearance not so much, but the smell and taste quite a bit. Appearance is fairly typical DIPA orange amber with rocky cream colored head and lace. The smell is grapefruit mostly, with some tomato and butter notes. Yeah, weird I know. Taste is ruby red grapefruit all the way. Crazy grapefruit. Soooo bitter. I'm a dyed in the wool hophead and this even puckers me a bit. God, it's almost like grapefruit candy or soda or something. Unreal. The tap version is sweeter and more of a pure pineapple juice, like a two hearted grandaddy from what I remember. This is just vicious grapefruit. One of the most bitter beers I have ever had."
"12 ouncer, no freshness indication, this was over $15 for a sixer, near Ann Arbor, MI. Pours cloudy orangy/apricot, near white head, that leaves nice, scattered and spotty lacing. Big and bold citrusy/resiny hop nose. Thick, chewy and smooth. Fine, fine stuff, god I love a world class DIPA like this one. Everything is in place here, nice job by Bells. Lots of citrus and hoppy goodness. Smooth and perhaps a bit more accessable and drinkable then the Stone 10th offering."
WowaWoowa! This is really a super premium brew. Not at all the aggressive hop demon evil gypsy potion I was expecting.
"This beer is amazing! I ordered a pint and didn't know that it was 9.3% alcohol. In fact, I didn't know until I checked on here. The beer is so flavorful and great that it is difficult to think that there would be so much alcohol. The nose is very fruity...mango and passion fruit. Taste is phenomenal. The malts are sweet and they pair well with the citrus hops. For whatever reason, they have managed to isolate and remove the grapefruit taste that is common in double IPAs. This little trick makes for a unique DIPA. Mouthfeel is juicy. Drinkability is awesome...beware the high alcohol because it is definitely under the radar."
A - Very hazy golden copper brew with about one finger of foamy white head that dissipates in about a minute leaving decent rings of lacing in its wake. Streaks of lacing up and down the glass. A pretty beer.
"Presentation: Long neck, brown glass 12 ounce bottle sealed with a standard brass crown cap which has the Bells logo on it. The main label projects a hoppy theme with its fresh green background, in the middle of which is a dude laid out apparently floored by three giant Hops. No freshness date or strength listed but the reverse label has an inkjet code of 7690 on it. Described as A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale. With a name like Hopslam, what did you expect?"

"Appears a slightly clouded apricot orange copper hue with a large white head leaves behind even streaks of lacing in my snifter glass. Aromatics have deep grapefruit peel explosions going on with a mild sugary malt presence with light grassy notes and mils biscuit malts with a huge alcohol presence in the nose. Flavor contains deep bitterness with the 109! IBUs bit at times each sip seemed to overwhelm me with the grapefruit peel oily feel to balance all I can detect is a very mild biscuit breadiness from a combonation of the yeast and malts complete coats the palate I just feel that it's a bit one dimensional with the citrus peel effect and boozy alcohol I'm down for a bit of some balance and I adore their Two Hearted so I figured they could pull off an incredible DIPA as well. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with strong carbonation and a sickingly oily texture tickles the nose with citrus pungency. Drinkability is mediocre for me an expressive and unique double IPA I'm just looking for more balance even within some huge hop bombs out there there's still a rediculous malt bill...after a bottle of this it would get hard to drink plus for 44 bucks a case I would pass on that quantity. I will continue to try I've already had it on draft side by side with Hop Wallop, kinda unimpressed with this supposed gem."
"On-tap at The Brew Kettle, Strongsville, OH - 11/26/06"
"I swear that when i poured this i saw a hint of green in there for a second...like the hops were pureed right intot he beer or something. In the glass though its orange and full of little sediment bits floating around, like dirty pond water (in a good way). Small white head and mena looking lacing. Very inviting. Smells like grapefruit and melons, which reminds me of 3F's Dreadnaught. I am excited, Taste is very bitter on the first sip, in a citrusy kind of way. Alcohol is very had to detect underneath. Flavors of honeydew, grapefruit, hops (wait, no hopsLAM). It's really the grapefruit-iness that stands out. Not too heavy or syrupy, just full bodied and slightly fizzy on the tongue. Very drinkable, which is a problem because i cant afford this beer."
"Glowing orange appearance. Slightly hazed. Bubbly ivory white head. Lacing is substantial and weblike.The nose of this beer pure and simple kicks serious ass. All the citric goodness of lemon rind and pink grapefruit pulp along with canabis and smokey pine resin. The taste translates all of that goodness from the nose onto the palate. The bright citric tones of grapefruit and lemon. And smokey, resinous, raw Mary Jane. Bitterness is not clean, but not real abrasive either. Kind of in between. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Body is a little better than medium. Toffeeish malt way in the background, but there nonetheless. A top notch IIPA no doubt. One of the absolute best as a matter of fact."
"12 oz bottle. This beer is a perfect golden color with a fairly strong carbonation hitting the surface. A finger of stark white head falls to a full coating over top. Clarity is fantastic on this brew. This brew glows it is so brilliant. Aroma is thick with sweet grapefruity hop. Very sweet and luscious. The caramel malt underneath is sweet as well, but with a alcohol spiceyness in there that breaks the sweetness of the caramel and hop up. It is very juicy. Taking a sip, I get a combination of grapefruity hop and an alcholol spiceyness. The caramel malt hits after the initial taste as a mild sweetness. It finishes with a pepperyness from the hop, along with a more mild bitterness. I really like the major sweet hop flavors that dominate this one. Mouthfeel is thick, with a mild carbonation as well. It sits strong but is not syrupy or offensive. This one is really working well for me. I enjoy the fact that the hop manifests itself more as flavor than as bitterness. It really is a beer that doesn't need to be sipped, but should be due to the alcohol. I think Bell's has a winner."
Thanks x1000 to nlmartin for the bottle. Poured into a snifter.
"Via trade with akorsak, batch # 7690. Hazy wheat colored ale with a solid head that laced the glass. Extremely potent hop nose full of grapefruits and citrus rinds. The head is solid and it leaves a lace all over the glass. The range of flavors from the hops is quite extraordinary; ironically the only thing it lacks is extreme bitterness (which I don't seem to miss). Loads of dried fruit, citrus fruit, pine, leather, bug spray, and HOPS. Maybe zeus, tomahawk perhaps? The malts are there but play a minimal role; they kind of taste like light rye malts. The finish is clean, leaving you only with the intense smell of hops up your nose and down your throat; this is a beer that really makes you smell like beer. The way the hop bitterness fades away reminds me of a wet hopped beer. Alcohol is undetectable. This is one beautiful IPA. The burps from this one actually taste better than certain beers I've had! I was surprised to find it's rated at 106 ibu; I would have guessed down in the 70-80 range like Pliny the Elder. This may be the first 100+ ibu beer I really enjoyed. Heres to many more!"
"Nice and pleasing hop aroma that initially began (and to some extent stayed) of softer resin. This was followed by a grassy quality and eventually settles with grapefruit. Additional hop qualities of flower. At times pick up a brief malt sweetness. No alcohol noted. Not overpoweringly strong, rather pleasant and soft, but there's an intensity (almost like body) to each whiff that feels powerful, and takes you back - like smelling ammonia."
"This beer pours a light transparent orange color with a small white head that quickly diminished leaving fine lacing and a tiny head. Lots of suspended floaters in this one, even after a careful pour. The aroma is heavy with citrus, pine, punch and pineapple. Taste is more of the same with a huge hop/citrus punch. The bitterness is nice, but reasonable for a beer of this magnitude. Mouthfeel is nice... smooth, playful on the tongue. HopSlam is surprisingly drinkable for a beer this size. If it weren't for the alcohol, I could easily enjoy a few of these. Nice beer."
"From the bottle, a recent (76--) batch."
"lots of initial head on pour on orangey brown. I grabbed this as an IPA, and then I find out quickly its a double hophead and higher alcohol than I expected. Its a bitter, sucking the leaf sucking the lime hop delivery that works and is satisfying aftertaste, not in your face or substantial malting as in other DIPA. My tongue was frozen later on. Good carbonation. Good but overated."
Fresh 06 arrival. 
served from a 12oz.brown bottle into a snifter.
I would like to shoot a special thanks to bax72 for this bottle of HopSlam. It is readily available in Cincinnati but I had drank my last bottle and was craving some more. This beer was served in my Imperial Pint glass. 
The best DIPA I have had....PERIOD...
"Muted light golden brown. Very closely resembling the look of a brown beer bottle well lit from the back. Puffy white capping of foam sits a top for a bit, then crunches down to a good bubbley skim and a good amount of lacing tickles the glass with a pattern of a receeding bubble bath."
Pours light orange and cloudy with a fleeting white head that leaves islands of foam throughout the beer.
"Here is something nice. The best characteristic of this beer is the aroma. I poured this into one of those big Duvel glasses to get my nose right in there. Rich, earthy, fresh, grassy, citrus, are all words to describe the aroma. So classic and comforting a smell. Pours a rich autumnal orange, the color you only see in changing leaves and campfires. Decent head that dissipated quickly. I saw that this beer is at 106 IBU's and while I can believe it, it doesn't hit you over the head with hops as much as I expected. It has such a rich and creamy malt profile that it is very well balanced (as opposed to a beer like Hazed and Infused where it is essentially hop juice). Speaking of flavor, there is a lot going on here. I can taste tons of fruit character: pineapple, citrus; along with great hearty breadiness. Hops are majorly present in the taste as well. I suppose that this is worth the 17 dollars a six pack I paid (crazy, eh? but I love that local craft breweries are not afraid to take risks and make beers like this -- thus I must buy them and support the efforts to make American brewing even better)."
Pours a cloudy gold with hints of red. Nice 1/2 finger head that left quickly. A smooth coating remained throughout. This beer smells awesome. Very piney on the hops side (I'd love to know what kind of hops are in here). Not much citrus or honey at all - all piney hops. The taste is very good. Very piney but not overly bitter like some DIPA's. The mouthfeel is great it bites at you all the way through. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 for drinkability is the 9% abv. Otherwise I could drink a lot of this stuff. Way to go again Bell's. These guys know how to make great beer. Now if I could just get up to Kalamazoo...
"The much anticipated HopSlam, given your older brother Two Hearted Ale, you have much to live up to..."
"Batch 7690 according to the label. Pours a cloudy brilliant gold color, with a thick rocky white head. Seems more golden than most DIPAs. Great head retention. Huge tropical fruit in the nose, pineapple, citrus, peaches, etc. Very fruity and bitter, with a hint of pine coming through. Nice spots of lace cling to the side of the glass. The malt character does not seem as strong as others in this style. The amount of pineapple and peach flavor is very interesting. Very juicy and bitter. Nice body, with carbonation that seemed appropriate. Unique."
Appreaance: Pours a nice cloudy orange with a small head that lasts and leaves lots of lacing.
V.06
This is simply a review of my first impressions. I must revisit after several more pints. 
"A - Golden/copper color. Pours a finger width head, that slowly mellows to a small ring. Some lacing , but not much."
2007 Release
a -- hazy golden orange color; light gets trapped in the glass; very nice
"Aroma: Grapefruit pith, orange rind, fresh citrus hop aroma. As it warms you get more resiny hop aroma and grapefruit candy slices."
"pours a bright copper with an orangish hue, it had a finger thick off white head that drops to a thin haze."
"This beer is priced at $15.99 per 6-pack in Columbus, not close to the cheapest DIPA but then again not the most expensive (Rogue Imperial or Goose Island Imperial IPA). Still it's a lot of money for a 6-pack. I opted for a single bottle at Whole Foods."
appearence: poured a hazy orange w/ a 1 inch white frothy head. Head lasted throughout drink and left a good amount of lacing.
poured into a tulipish glass
Bell's Hopslam
"This brew pours a hazy orange color. The head is one finger in height and recedes into decent lacing. The aroma reminds me a lot of Two Hearted Ale, but with some added pine. The taste is like drinking a pine tree. There is resin everywhere with some citrus balancing things out. There is no malt backbone to speak of; this is all hops. The mouthfeel is nearly full bodied, chewy, and has nice carbonation. Overall, I really like this beer, but I would choose THA over it anyday."
thanks mr. wilson
Pours a beautiful pale golden into my crappy micro-light pint glass.
Hoppy? Yes. Overly hoppy in a sprain your tongue kind of way? No.
"on tap at Maduro, 3$ during happy hour"
12oz bottle -&gt; imperial pint
"12oz bottle, batch #7690, bottled on 10/25. Pours a honey color with orange and yellow accents. The white 2-finger head is creamy and forms into a stiff cap that stays around after several sips. Copious strands of fluffy, sticky lacing cling to the inside of the glass. "
"Hazy orange hue, fine slice of bone white froth atop."
"Appearance: Medium gold color, hazy. Doesn't look like many-a DIPA. Small white head fades slowly, leaving ok lace."
"Deep orange with some cloudiness, a nice head on top, about an inch thick, white. Smell is mostly floral, strong and distinct. "
Damn nice looking DIPA. A light copper/gold somewhat hard too see too the other side. Nice white frothy head of great length finally leaves some sticky scattered lace down the glass. 
"Appearance: Bright gold, good carbonation."
A: Slightly hazy orange golden apperance with a decent white foam head. Good lacing inside the glass. Medium level of carbonation.
"Glad to get my grubby hands on this! Slight haze in a brassy orange body. Tight finger of dirty, off-white head. Nose is pure liquid hop flowers. It seriously smells like a freshly opened package of Simcoe/Centennial/??? flowers. Since I love this smell, I am in heaven right now. But, there's also a solid sugar honey malt background, along with some fruity alcohol. Bitter, acidic, hopslaught up front. Assaultive, but delicious. Hop burn stays, as sugary, tropical fruit malt swells and provides a hint of balance. The hint gets shrugged off by a dry, resinous, ganja-infused, bitter finish. My tongue is ""bruised"" but happy. Medium-body, with a mouth-lacquering feel. Dry finish. This stuff is good and worth the wait!"
Wow!
"Pours with moderate head, beautiful lacing, color is straw-like with a hint of orange. Smells incredibly fresh, which it is of course. A cacophony of citrus aromas combine with a sprinkling of pine, and a sweet booziness."
"Always look forward to trying a new double IPA, especially when it's from Bell's. This beer poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a foamy white head the coated the glass with lace as it quickly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, both citrus styles-orange and grapefruit pointing to more hops than the Two Hearted. The flavor was of hops, citrus orange and grapefruit with a hint of caramel. The finish on this beer is a bit astrigent and the hops bitterness figure heavily as well, while adding a slightly creamy body. Similar to other double IPAs, but definately has that Bell style to it. A great beer, but at the alcohol level and price per 6 pack, probably still drink more Two Hearted than this. For these styles, I really wish they would make four paks or use bombers."
This exciting beverage emerged from the bottle with an attractive orange copper colour to it. A decent head of dusty white billowed early but fell to a layer of spitty skim in short time. Gobs of lace cling in the aftermath. The carbonation is moderate and persistent. This looks like a good one. Clear and clean as well.
Kudos to Larry and the Bell's brewers. This is a great beer.
"HopSlam started pouring into the tumbler crystal clear. As the last of the bottle emptied into the glass a yeast or sediment cloud formed, it had the appearance of an inverted lava lamp."
"Tried this beer at Bell's, sounded intriguing. Have to echo what others have said, the stupid plastic cup they served it in really bothered me for some reason."
"Pours a hazy, cloudy pale maber with yellowish tints. Only produces a small ring of white head but does throw some lace onto the glassware."
Had a HopSlam on my trip to the HomePort. 
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Hazy golden color. Aroma has sweet vanilla malt and tropical juicy fruits. Taste has soft fruity hops, melon, mango and a bittersweet hoppy finish."
Canned 04/11/18 ‘SMALLS’.
Very smooth for over 10% ABV.
A: Opaque light orange with a frothy white head. Like a straight up Orange Julius!!!
"4 pack Whole Foods in Cleveland. Pours a clear orange/light copper colour with limited off white head. Aroma dank piney, citrus, slightly floral, creeping into sweaty, but deliciously so. Taste starts sweet for a millisecond before the pine bitterness slaps you with a sticky resinous blast on the back of just a touch of caramel malt. Finishes slightly sticky with palate coating bitterness that warns against consuming anything else for a while, yet not a punishing bitter, a wondrously tasty one! Absolutely great."
Poured into a snifter.
A great beer tastes great
L: Pours hazy golden with an inch of head that settles nicely
This is up there with the best ones in my opinion. Really juicy...nice and citrusy hoppy. Just got this on tap from a brewpub while visiting my Dad and home town. I hope I can find this again up in my neck of the woods.
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy golden color. There was a small off white head that leaves some lacing. Good hop nose. Mainly resinousy pine hops. Some tropical and citrus notes also. The taste is also very good. Resinous piney hops, along with some citrus and tropical flavors. Fairly bitter with no residual sweetness. Nice!"
"I received a bottle of Hop Juju in a ninja box from the Newbies! I've been looking for this one for a while, so my heart skipped around a bit when I opened the box. I always love trying new IPAs - but ones that are so highly rated, and for so long... well now."
Good color and nice head rentention. For a higher ABV I don't necessarily taste the alcohol but a nice smooth beer with definite hop finish with a bit of spice. 
Look- Pours clear golden orange with 2 finger fluffy white head that settles slowly
"on draft, served in a 10 oz wide topped glass"
Delicious dude. Dank as ballad and malty as malts go
"Brilliant copper amber body, clear with some haze from the chill. Three finger white, creamy head with some serious staying power. Nice sticky, web-like lace."
"Bright copper orange in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a short, creamy, white foam that reduced to soapy cap with medium low retention. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Boozy warmth intensifies through the middle and turned a little prickly toward the finish. Medium spicy hop aromas with light citrus notes and an underlying dankness. Medium malt and caramel aromas with and sweet, boozy notes toward the end. Medium high spicy and citrus hop flavors up front with caramel maltiness. Medium high, spicy and pine bitterness through the middle. Herbal and spicy hop flavors with expanding booziness and caramel malt notes from the middle to the end. Finished semi-dryly with lingering pine hop bitterness and sweet caramel malt notes. Well balances intense hop and malt character. Hop aromas and flavors are solid and bitterness is intense but not overwhelming. A NE IPA this is not. A great old school west coast IPA, intense, hoppy and tasty."
This beer has a thin off white head to a beautifully clear golden clear beer. 
"12oz bottled 2/12/18 (19 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 9% ABV 100 IBU. The beer pours bright golden amber with sticky off white head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is tropical fruit, citrus and earth. The taste is earthy, with tropical highlights and citrus rind. No trace of 9% ABV in the aroma or taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. To have this much feel and taste without ever going sweet or sticky is masterful. Overall, excellent. Recommended!"
Appearance - Pour crystal clear amber color with huge fluffy white head that will not go away. Lots of spotty lacing around the glass.
This beer is nearly perfect. Excellent IPA. It has a very smooth almost gentle finish compared to some other IPAs. Golden Amber in color. It has a great head on the pour. Quite excellent
100 IBU's. What have I signed up for?
"Look, golden and clear. "
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip
i enjoy this beer
"Wonderful beer. IPA's, in my opinion, are sometimes overly bitter, with a dominant flavor of pine resin. This was an aggressive beer, yet the flavor was more subtle, with almost grassy or fresh mown hay overtones."
Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Cigar City goblet.
"Tasted from draft. Pours a clear amber with slight off white head. Aroma is fruity with citrus and tropical notes. Moderate bitterness with nice malt backbone. Excellent tasting with flavors of grapefruit, orange, melons, caramel, toffee, pine. Exceptional imperial IPA."
"Semi-transparent amber appearance with white head that disipates slowly. Aroma is a mild hops with raisin and citrus. Taste is also a mild hops, raisin, and citrus."
Pours clear orange with quickly dissipating head.
My favorite all time!
"A truly great double IPA. It comes in at 9%, but doesn't seem boozy at all. Gorgeous orange-copper color and pours with a strong head that lasts. Nice hope profile - not overbearing, but strong."
I will always stop into fat heads late in the winter for lunch to have a Hop JuJu on tap. The South Side Fat Heads. I love this beer.
nice solid ipa that isnt east coast
"Pine, orange rind, brown sugar, grapefruit. Hops are faint. This bottle is two months old. Mouth feel is full and clean. Very nice."
not into dipa taste
Revisited 6/9/18
"Shared from a great beer friend. A gift of two 12 oz bottles. Bottle date 03/17. Fresh! Poured into my usual wide mouthed tasting glass. What a pour! An orange copper color with a nice white lacing across the top. Not really a head. No leftover residue on the glass. It's like a pine tree up one nostril and an orange tree up the other and a pineapple shoved down your throat. In a good way. To graphic? Very well balanced with all of the scents and tastes you should expect from an imperial IPA. I feel it's best temperature is chilled, but not to cold (45-50). It's one of my top tastings and that's with 25 years of experience in the beer business. A proud offering."
"I live this beer. The clear, orange beer gives off a singular scent that is the perfect marriage of grapefruit, orange, mango and pine. Every sniff brings one of the components to the front. The taste is pleasantly sweet with all the citrus and pine bitterness you would want in a beer. This is an amazing beer."
Bottled 2/16/17.
Smell: sweet oranges candied peachs sweet bready malt grapefruit zest pine needle.
"Poured from a bottle dated 1/30/17 from prager62. The beer pours a very clear, amber color with a small white head. The head dissipated leaving nice lacing that coats the glass. "
Poured a copper-gold body with one-finger head and lace that sticks around. Aroma is hoppy and citrusy with dirty earth tones. Biting hops and boozy medicinal feel but enjoyable with touches of grapefruit sweetness and clean finish.
"Holy Juju! This beer pours beautifully clean golden orange with a foamy sudsy bone white head that leaves a good ring and sticks well. In your face with dank pine and citrus the second the cap pops off the top of the bottle. You can smell that this is gonna be resinous and sticky! The flavor burst with that same citrus and pine, and a good amount of sweetness to keep the wonderful bitterness just in check. Feel definitely has that sticky richness to it. Nice carbonation, good medium full body, and bitter as hell. Overall, this is my kind of DIPA, and wish it were more readily available and accessible out here. Cheers!"
"Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into one of my pint glasses, this beer is a clear, medium golden/copper color with lots of streams of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continuously rising to the beer's surface. Has a creamy looking, slightly tan/off-white head that's well over an inch thick when first poured that settles to a thick, creamy surface layer of foam with very good retention, a thick ring of foam lining the inside of the glass, and good lacing. Aromas of slightly toasted caramel malts that gives way to big citrus, cantaloupe, and piney hop aromas. The taste is pretty much the same, with some slightly toasted caramel malt sweetness along with the aforementioned big hip flavors of citrus, cantaloupe, and piney hops with a decent bitterness. Good balance overall here. Has a slightly crisp, mainly smooth and frothy, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a very clean and slightly dry finish. A good beer all around."
"Murky caramel rust color appearance with good head retention and nice oily lacing. Fruity pineapple smell and flavor, with a nice malty resinous piney backbone. Can taste the alcohol but pleasantly moderated. Medium full mouthfeel."
Bottle dated 2/9 poured into tree house snifter. 
"Acquired this in a recent trade as an ""extra"". How is this an extra? Delicious! Great IIPA for a little cooler weather as the pine taste really stands out. Love this beer!"
"Wow this is good. Clean filtered look, Smells of juicy fruit and pine. Tasty IIPA reminiscent of Hop Stoopid but the tropical flavors are pumped up."
Lots of resin and bitterness. Was waiting for a burst of flavor and never got it.
Been wanting to try this for a long time. A man could get himself into trouble quickly as it is very slamable. Just hits all the right notes for a double. I would describe it but it's already been done.
"Dark copper color with only a slight head on the pour. A pleasant funky pine on the nose. It has a Bohdiesque flavor, the citrus pine and honey, but a bit malting, like Alpha King. Great mouth feel and a long finish. Overal, an outstanding beverage."
"Pale amber transparent body with a sticky, frothy off-white head. Aroma is fruity and grassy with a dash of toast. Flavor is full of resin flavor; sticky hoppy flavor with hints of fruit and a hint of a toasty backbone. Feel is smooth, sticky and medium-full bodied with a medium carb level. Nice to revisit after the NE IPA craze."
Poured from 12 oz bottle dated 2/6/2017. Thanks to @somethingclever for giving me a chance to try this!
"Pours a nice orange/ slightly brown as well, poured into a pint glass got a decent yellow head that released an incredible aroma."
"Missed out on it last year, just picked it up yesterday. A very dank and juicy smelling beer with a great look. Probably the best IPA from Ohio. Very smooth and easy to drink for an imperial."
This is kind of perfect. Pours a brownish orange with medium white head. Pour aggressively and the aroma opens up beautifully. Lusicious ripe citrus and tropical fruit. Very smooth and crisp mouthfeel. 100 ibu beer that drink ultra easy. Truly great.
"First had 2/29/16 at The Pour House. I was waiting for the Pliny the Younger release and was the first to arrive and found this gem on tap. While it wasn't as good as the beer I was waiting for, it was fantastic. Bitter, creamy, floral and could drink it all day, although I would pass out quickly."
"Chewy, dank..what you want in a Dipa. Warm rusty orange color with a creamy white head. Thick zest orange flavor lingers on the tongue hiding alcohol."
A double done right. Hop resins smack your tongue while their aromas fill the air. This was enjoyed on draft and vanished fairly quickly. I need more.
"Man Fat Heads makes some dank hoppy beers, this one is no exception. Review #2300. "
Received a growler of this last week. 
"This beer smells delicious. Looks clear golden color. On draft at the Brewpub, it tastes delicious on draft. The hop flavors are so delicious. This is one of the best Ohio beers"
I want to drink this beer everyday forever.
Been drinking all spring as I was able to get a couple cases in February. Fabulous beer with wonderful citrus flavors and fantastic finish. I did have one on tap at Fats Heads about 2 years ago and it had a nice head and went down smooth. Not too bitter but enough for me as I like bitter beers.
top shelf. love it.
"Had on tap. Big juicy DIPA. There's a sweetness that takes off some of the hoppy edges, while still remaining abrasive enough to remind you it's a DIPA. Delicious"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, courtesy of @Iron79head into a tulip glass:"
"Bottle: Poured a deep yellow color ale with a nice foamy head. Aroma of juicy hops with nice citrusy notes and loads of tropical flavours. Taste is an incredible mix of juicy hops with loads of tropical flavours, some light residual sugar notes and some floral finish with almost no bitterness. Body is full with good carbonation. Wish I could have access to this beer on a regular basis."
"Pours a clear light golden color with a white fresh head, juicy tropical smells and malt , taste is very good with citrus and tropical hops, sweet caramel malts balance the hops, highly drinkable slight bitterness and tasty ."
On tap at Growler Guys. 
"Amazing smell. Tastes of dank hoppiness. It's in your face and takes two or three turns to appreciate. But once you figure this one out, it's the only thing you want to drink. Wish it was available year round. Similar to Head Hunter, but amplified on all levels."
"Brilliant transparent copper color. Fluffy white created through a vigorous pour. A bright, citrusy aroma rounds out the simple nose of this beer. Smells absolutely delicious to all the hopheads out there. Piney, citrus, floral, mango and tropical fruit hops dominate the flavor. Its body is nice and medium bodied. This is a wonderful beer, get it whenever you see it."
"Pours a frosty, hazy golden amber. Lovely imperial IPA colorization. Foamy white head with a fair amount of lacing left behind. Juicy citrus, resin, and tropical hops with a dab of honey. Really powerful aroma. Yum! Pine and resin hop notes right off the bat in the flavor. Super juicy, incredible citrus and tropical hops behind. Nice and balanced and leaning on the sweet side. Mouth feel is full and filling. Slightly harsh carbonation on the back end, but otherwise great. Overall, a juicy, hoppy IPA that doesn't singe the tongue with bitter hops. Leans a little sweet and is easy to drink. Might be a bit dangerous with that combo at 9%, so be aware!"
This is one of the best Imperial IPAs I’ve ever had.
Poured into my favorite Lost Abbey long stim tulip bottled on 2 / 08 / 16. Pours a beautiful orange with a 1 inch sticky white head that clings to the sides of the glass like my children there chocolate Easter Bunnys.
"Look: the beer pours a light gold color, with a slightly off white head, and some great carbonation, alcohol legs are there and great glass lacing. "
Crisp clear amber body bordering on having an orange-itude to it. Small tight white head recedes to it's corners and colonies fate. 
12 oz bottle was poured into a tulip glass. 
L: Nice amber/gold color. 
"L - pours a dank, dirty amber. The kind of color you'd expect to find a cricket in at your local history museum gift shop. "
"The bottle was given to me as an extra in a trade, the date was scratched off so I'm guessing it's either past or close to past for it's prime consumption period. Regardless of this fact, this beer is the definition of a perfect IPA by my books and it shows clearly why it has won two gold medals at the GABF. I'm not going to jump into a detailed explanation of why it's so heavenly delicious, instead I want you to go out there and find it and drink it for yourself. Prost!"
Picked Hop Juju up in Florida and it was hard to find.
Very tempted to give this one a 5. Aroma was super fragrant grapefruit. Look was a golden-caramel. Taste was very hoppy/piney with the slightest sweetness. Taste stays with the pallet for a lil bit. This is everything I want in a DIPA. Fabulous. Hard pressed to find a better aroma/flavor combo.
L: Pours copal to amber.
"Bottle pour into a teku. Clear dark orange hue, huge citrus on the nose with taste following suit. Well balanced with a touch of pine. Enjoyable brew!"
"Don't consider myself a hop connoisseur, but this is how an Imperial IPA should taste! Perfect blend of piny and citrus, great great beer!"
"Hop JuJu Imperial IPA brewed by Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon, with an ABV 9.0% This brew pours out a deep amber color with a nice white head. This brew has the lot of the same smell as well as as the look of most IPA's on the market .I like how this brew has the same look an smell of most IPA;s on the market.. This brew also has the smell of most brews on the market. This is not a bad thing. This is this is same thing from most IPA's on the market. The smell of This IPA's Is the same of most IPA's on the,market . For the most part This brew is most like every IPA's on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. Most IPA's on the market. Not saying that is a bad thigh. The smell of Hop JuJu Imperial IPA, There is also a rich hopieness to the smell of this brew. The taste is rich, full bodied and clean. Overall,this is one of the most smoothness IPA's on the market. Overall I'm giving Hop JuJu Imperial IPA, a 4 out of 5/ I would buy this brew again. THANK yIOU Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon"
Enjoyed this brew at Fat Head's Saloon in Pittsburgh
"Oh my! Got half a bottle from a friend. Great color, lacing is still there. My smeller is OLD but I can smell good stuff. Taste is long and has lots going on. Nice to have friends huh!"
"Hop JuJu Imperial IPA - Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon. Poured from the bottle into a snifter, this beer's head is two fingers thick, with web-like lacing, and a clear amber body with a very slight reddish hue."
Standard good DIPA
"Surprised how much I enjoyed this, given that I've always been underwhelmed by Head Hunter. This one comes with a juicy citrus aroma that smacks you in the face, then follows up on your tongue. Cheers Fat Head!"
"Poured into IPA glass - nice foamy white head, solid retention, darker amber color with near crystal clear clarity. Minimal lacing."
"16.9 oz growler purchased at Trenton Road Take Out in Levittown, PA."
"love headhunter and when i got to try this for the first time, i was blown away! big dank nose followed up with juicy piney and dry hop taste that is out of this world. this beer will get you in trouble!"
One of the best IPAs I've ever had. Great balance and use of citrus hoppy flavors.
For me tbis beer is as good as it gets. It's so juicy and fruity. Tons of flavor that just keeps coming. Perfection!!!!! If you can get your hands on tbis beer do so. You won't be let down.
Bright golden body. Well made beer. Juicy citrus nose. Citrus juice/zest right away in the flavor followed by a blast of bitterness and some alcohol burn. Really tasty but you know it is 9%.
"finally got a Hop JUJU!!!! can only compare it to other higher-abv-ed IPAs but i have to say it is nowhere near the Hopslam or Pliny Younger. love Fat Heads but this version is not comparable, in my opinion.... i mean, it's not bad.... but i was expecting more, i guess....."
"The tropical aroma, light maltiness and mild bite from the boil hops is all very balanced. The alcohol takes a back seat to the wonderful hops flavor and aroma. One of the best IIPAs on the market. Too bad it is only available in February. Cheers!"
"A- Pours coppery gold, with a large fluffy white head"
"12oz bottle dated 2/22/16 poured into a DFH chalice L: clear tangerine color poured a finger of head that slowly dissipated with sticky lacing and heavy alcohol legs S: strong onion/cat urine aroma up front with a mild piney and sweet citrus finish T: wonderful balance of bitter hop resin and sweet sugary citrus with a slight onion dankness M: creamy and powdery, the softest DIPA I've ever had O: it's unfortunate that this is a seasonal limited release"
12 oz bottle poured into tulip. 12/8/16
Objectionable
look - golden clear color with slight head that goes away quick.
"Fat Head's Hop Juju is a beer I have been waiting to try for a while now. It won Gold at the Great American Beer Festival in 2013 AND in 2015 for the Imperial India Pale Ale category, which was one of, if not the most crowded category in the entire competition. This 12 oz bottle was bottled on 2/12/16."
"Got this in a trade. I'm in New England and have a bias toward the cloudy juice bombs that we have access to. When I first opened the bottle I was blown away by the aroma. It is super tropical with almost a candy scent to it. I poured it into my treehouse tulip and the appearance is absolutely beautiful, deep gold with a finger white head and good lacing. The taste follows the nose with tropical fruits and just a hint of pine resin on the back end. Mouthfeel is slick and oily like a dipa should be. Overall this beer is simply outstanding and ranks right up there with any of the great ipas out there. I wish we could get this regularly here where I live. Very well done!"
Bottle.
Look - Clear golden/copper type color 
12oz bottle that was bottled on 2/10/16 poured into tulip glass:
It has to be one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. Aroma just blows you away. Taste is exceptional as well
Poured from bottle into a Carton Brewing IPA glass. 
"Pours a gorgeous amber-orange. Nose is a blast of catty papaya, with a side of fresh cut grass and pine. The resin comes to the front in the taste, but it doesn't linger unforgivingly on the palate like a 100+ IBU beer can. I've heard people compare this to Pliny (in terms of characteristics), and they're not wrong, but the two beers are more like cousins rather than siblings. The hop profile doesn't strike my personal tastes as squarely as they could, but I get the love for this beer. Well done, Fat Head's!"
From bottle. Dark honey color. Good lacing and retention. Smell is best attribute. Wet dank hops. Bitter and assertive. Taste is just good. Bitter and a bit of sweetness from the hops. Nice sticky feel. Strong but not over-carbonated. Very good beer.
Poured into a 12oz snifter pours Orange Carmel color
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.
"An exceptional ImpIPA from the brewery that never fails. Perfect malt bitter balance. Stands with the best of them, seek this out!"
12oz bottle of the fresh 2016 release. Served in a snifter glass.
"Pours a golden amber hue with moderate head, little retention. Aroma is just mountains of tropical hops featuring mango, pineapple & grapefruit. Very sweet & inviting. Flavor is as expected, nothing rule-breaking for a high-end IPA with lots of intermingling tropical & citrus notes. Finishes very bitter with pine & grapefruit. Mouthfeel is oily & resinous."
"12 oz bottle. Pours beautiful clear orange, two finger white head fades leaving soapy lace. Fruity tropical citrus aroma. Taste of citrus peel, pine, sweet pineapple hops with light malt backbone. Very clean crisp taste. Finishes with some piney earthy bitterness, mild alcohol coming out in the end. Clean medium slick mouthfeel. This is an outstanding DIPA, reminds me of a juiced up Jai Alai."
A big thanks to Dan for this one. 12oz. bottle (2.10.16) into a pint glass. 
"Description: Clear with minimal head, the color is sort of a dark, apple juice or even burnt orange. The aroma is piney, fruity and dank all at once. It's like a pine tree had a beautiful baby with a mango tree. Taste? Man, this is good. Like the smell, this delivers a swirling bouquet of fruit, pine and an underlying dankness. There's a bitter aftertaste and finish but the way these flavors are all balanced is remarkable. For an IPA, it's a bit on the fuller bodied side and carbonation is medium to low."
Poured into a Bell's Tulip. Bottled 2/6/2016. Super Fresh!
"Appearance is beautiful. Thick head that lasts seemingly forever. Pretty, cohesive lacing."
"Hopolicious fresh out of a 12oz bottle. Little bit of tropical fruit , a lot of dank. Yum."
"So much pine, resin, and accompanying sweetness. Probably the best dipa I've ever had."
"Felt compelled to review since this is as close to perfect as you can get with a DIPA. Smell is amazing, one of the most pungent, fruity, dank beers I have ever put the sniffer to. Taste is just as good, this beer is no joke. If this beer doesn't rank in your top 10 for IPA's of all time then you should stick to coors light."
"Seasonal Imperial IPA from Fat Heads. Exceptional product. Extraordinarily easy drinking for such a big IPA. Touch of sweetness up front from the 9% and a very sound, bitter finish from the 100 IBUs. Brilliant beverage that is quite fleeting during its annual release unfortunately!"
12 oz.
"Tropical fruits , resinous hops , clarity and resins that chase you through to the finish which will make you suck air so it bring back the memories."
Beauty.
"first time I've tried this ale. first pour filled area with great aroma, absolutely love it. possibly the best ale I've had in years. will be heading back to their tap house for more on monday."
"Picked up at the release today and was bottled yesterday. Pours a beautiful amber honey color. Aroma is super piny & citrusy with notes of grapefruit and tropical fruit. Flavor is really juicy grapefruit, citrus and dank resiny hops. Has a really nice finish that's really well balanced for 100 IBU's. Leaves a great resiny hoppy aftertaste. Overall this is fantastic."
Amazing. Smell to aftertaste
"I thought i was doomed. the IBU is 100. the smell was so piney and full of grapefruit. i was sure this would be too much for me. the feel and finish were nothing short of smooth and sexy. unreal, so glad i was able to try this at the brewery no less, fresh from the tap!"
"Clear sparkling perfect amber, with a very large and active frothy head that retains for a while, but dies off to nothing."
"Nice well balanced,Imperial. look, taste , and great hoppy smell great daily Ipa"
On tap at growler guys PDX the other day.
"Served dark golden with minimal head in a snifter at Brewpub.... Smell was strong grapefruit with a sweet undertone... Taste was citrus with grapefruit tones.... Mouthfeel was nice carbonation... Middle mouthfeel was complete, allowing grapefruit and citrus to play on palate but not overstay their welcome in the aftertaste... This beer is amazing on draft!!! Have had in bottles and never experienced the same reverence as I did today on draft!!! Highly recommend!!!"
"Good DIPA. Very floral kind of sticky, but a solid taste. For IPA Slayers its worth the conquest"
12oz bottle poured into an Idle Hands tulip.
This is the best dipa you can get-- cakes on pliny or heady
Beer bottles 3/4/2915 (2 months):
Poured Hop JuJu into Belgian Tulip.
Aroma and taste nice but too balanced for me
Look - Hazy when cold. More orange than most. White medium head. Lacing does not stick around.
"A strong pour only gets about an inch of light tan head. Head fades to a rim skim in about two minutes. Body is classic golden honey in tone. Nose is big and juicy with tons of citrus just bursting to get to you smeller. Almost like smelling hoppy orange marmalade. Zesty and bright as the flavor jumps on the tongue. Strong grapefruit tones are mixed with piney, prickly notes. This is a very bold beer with a powerful bitter bite all throughout the body of this beer. This is really a hop lovers dream just a bitter blizzard on the taste buds. Only drawback for me is that the alcohol is just a tad bit hot, but not at all off putting. Wonderful overall."
"Excellent all around. The aroma is a bit better than the taste for me, but both are on point. A bit more bitter than the DIPAs I'm used to, but I like that. No cloying sweetness, just an endless hop assault. Well done."
"One of the best imperials I've ever had. Huge tropical fruit with perfect amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel a bit thin, but other than that, close to perfect."
Look: Goldy locks in the light with an amber tint
"Look: Golden goodness with inch and a half a snowy white bubbly foam. Head dissipates rather quickly. Leaves a phenomenal trail on the glass. Smell: Pungent tropical fruit on the nose Taste: Wowaweewa! Juicy tropical fruit dominant the palate. Piney resin on the front. Feel: Medium body, chewy at times, frothy. Overall: A delicious IIPA all around, the fruit aroma flavors are phenomenal. Another pour please!!"
Good beer but I enjoy Fatheads IPA better.
12 oz bottled 2/4/2015 and poured into a teku
"Didn't like this at all. Was month old , but bitter"
exceptional beer. lives up to all the hysteria. 
"Candied oranges, pineapple & sticky tropical fruit. Guava Guava Guava. "
"This is one of my absolute favorite IIPAs . Huge citrisy, hoppy start and a mild almost malty finnish"
One of the better Cleveland offerings IMO. Nice Juicy IPA!
"Fantastic aroma and flavor, superb bitterness and no abc bite."
"Delicious, right up there with the best of the best"
"Just not my cup of tea. Perhaps it was just too old. I got extreme bitterness with very little sweetness. It was a bit flat, with not much carbonation. One I definitely wanted to try, but I would not seek it out again."
Hoppy nice bitterness citrus notes really drinkable
"12 oz. bottle poured into a Chimay glass (bottled on 2/18/15, had on 3/18/15)"
"Solid double IPA, one of the best I've had (well not quite in Heady territory). Great aroma and taste."
"Very glad to get this from a friend of a friend in Ohio. Look is beautiful in the glass. Smell is great. Taste is very juicy. For an imperial ipa, this is very easy to drink. Smell is a great mixture of pine and citrus. The lingering of pine thru the finish is amazing."
"Wow!!!! what a great beer, tropical fruit with a touch of pine"
Great beer by Fat Heads! Can't wait to get this bad boy again next year!!
"The flavor of this DIPA is heavy on tropical fruits, watermelon, grapefruit, tangerines and oranges. Nice stiff caramel backbone but this finishes with a garlic and chive spiciness that is not my favorite."
"Deep amber color with some hop haze and a big white head that laces the glass like crazy. Aromas are big and bold bringing tons of tropical notes, light citrus and pine. Taste starts slightly sweety, hoppy tropical notes, mid palate citrus and light pine. Finish is bitter with juicy resinous hop sting. Little sticky on the mouthfeel with a medium body which carries those hoppy resins over the palate. Super juicy DIPA which blends the whole spectrum of hop flavors. I've never had a bad Fat Head beer."
"Lots of tropical fruit and citrus. Dank and weedy. Pineapple, grapefruit, melon."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/12/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, passion fruit, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon/orange zest, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying or astringent bitterness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky/resinous mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA style. All around outstanding complexity and balance of bright and juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate malt flavor; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. An incredibly delicious offering."
Bottle: 2/09/15 and poured in a tulip glass.
"I get why people enjoy this. Smooth, piney, caramelly-sweet, American barlerywine-esque. It's just not for me."
"Very clear, active, golden amber brew. Topped by a decent snow-white head, with great retention and leaving nice flat fields of lacing."
I have had this beer before but never this fresh. 12 oz bottle with a date of 02/09/15. What can I say!? It's like drinking a mouth full of tropical fruit with a resin/piney finish. It's simply fantastic...can't wait to deliver some to MD for my brother to try it.
Sent as extra. Will Def be seeking out more of these!!!
Thank you very much @FlakyBiscuit for these! Although he has created an addict now....
Apart from the typical accolades the only critique is that the finish is a tad syrup-py and lingering.
"Just a delicious IPA. Fairly dank, robust bitterness, juicy, and a swift hop kick in the butt. Wonderful piney and tropical aroma. Complexity abound. Very deserving of its accolades."

A: clear deep gold with a couple of fingers of off-white head... left some arms of lace draped down the glass
Make dogfish head 90 minute taste like trash.
"Didnt really impress me or blow me away. Tasted like a typical DIPA that I've had a thousand times before. Didnt really get any specific hop character - citrus, pine, etc....Was a little sweet up front and had some hop bite in the back. Mediocre beer for me at best. Not sure what all the hype is about."
"Hop explosion. Citrus, floral nose, juicy. Piney resin dankness on the palate. Big beer."
Smooth for a DIPA. Great hops. Delicious!
"APPEARANCE (4.5) - A honey amber of perfect clarity with half a hundred tiny, tiny bubbles crawling sleepily toward the top of the glass at any given moment. Upon a measured pour I drew half a finger of foamy, white head in a tight configuration of a myriad of those same infinitesimal bubbles. Clumps of chunky lacing clung to the edges of my tulip as I gulped this beverage down (and I indeed I did crush this magnificent beast maybe a bit too quickly)."
"Cleveland is a great beer town, and this is my favorite Cleveland beer."
"Re-reviewing this beer again. Because it's a goddamn juggernaut of hoppy orgasmic goodness. I think I'm going to be broke before the local juju dispencery runs out of my ""medicine"". Hops galore."
My perfect DIPA. I had it initially extremely fresh and less than a week old. Randomly found two more bottles in a store and bought them up quick. It was still fantastic while still being a few months old. The smell is intoxicating and the hop flavor is perfect.
Wow!! Fat Heads has hit this out ouf the ballpark!!
Fantastic. Easy drinking but doesn't compromise the big hop flavor. Clean finish
This is beer is simply remarkable. For me it captures everything a DIPA should. The color is vibrant golden red (found myself gravitating towards as if I was a bug heading into a bug zapper.
"Very good...very tropical...very balanced...very close to a beer potpourri...very, very much on on the list for another..."
L: awesome
"Probably the best DIPA I've ever had. Bursting with flavor and aroma complete with every juicy fruit imaginable creating fruit scents and flavors that I didn't even know were possible. This beer is nearly flawless. Could not put it down, nor could I remove it from my nose. Simply perfect."

A: [3.50] Pours a caramel color. There is very limited head on the pour. After a few seconds it is just a ring on the edge of the glass. The bottle has a date code that I can't figure out - but I know that it is only about a week old! Bottle lists the ABV 9.0% and IBU 100.
"12 oz. bottle poured into stemless wine glass. Bottled exactly two weeks ago (2/9/15). Purchased on a recent visit to Pittsburgh, $13.99 for a four pack. "
"A bright copper-orange color. Very clear. A big foamy off-white head that dissipates soon, but leaves a film and some spotty lacing behind. "
Highly anticipated full Monty of hop indulgence is all that!!!
"Pours a deep orange, amber in color. Wasn't expecting it to be as dark. Aroma is strong, could smell this right away, tropical fruits, mango, peach, and some pine. Taste is delicious. Follows the smell almost completely, but less piney, which is a good thing in my book. Nicely carbed. Great job fat heads."
"Bottle from Joe. Thanks man. Pours beautiful deep clear copper with a creamy two finger off white head. Big juicy grapefruit aroma, some pine, onion, big florals, orange rinds. Flavor is lots of fresh orange rinds, bitter and dry, pine, sweet juicy mango all around. Body is resinous with a very dry finish like Head Hunter has, plenty of carbonation, makes you want to come back for more. Excellent brew."
"Pours very clear, and is amber in color with a reddish tint, with a medium head that does linger a bit. Smells strongly of citrus and pine. Has a strong citrus and hops taste that covers your whole mouth, very aggressive in the hops area. Overall, if you want a strong hops forward IPA this is it!"
12oz bottle poured into pint glass.
"The beer comes in a light ruby/rose color, very clear."
Simply exceptional. Effortlessly captures what they were going for and exceeds expectation.
Appearance: Hazy orange-amber color with a two finger off white head
L: Poured into a standard pint glass. A slight dark amber (burnt sienna color) with carbonation slightly rising through the sides of the glass. Small white head (1/8 inch max). The color is outstanding.
"Exceptional. I've had their amazing head hunter, but hop juju delivers on so many new levels. Go find it."
"The aroma on this beer is unbelievable... the best thing I have ever smelled in my life. Tastes like heaven. Exceptionally crafted beer. If the hop goddess has nipples, this is the milk."
"Waited a long time for this one! Poured a 12oz into the Spiegelau with a clear, golden amber body and a fluffy 2 - finger eggshell head. Nose hit me from a foot away. Big pine, orange, and a mess of juicy, sticky aromas that might defy the norms. Hint of dank, astringent aromas. BIG ASS PINE followed by a grapefruit/stonefruit pucker. Ample bitterness. Tremendous hop explosion. Strong enough malt presence (never overpowering, but present) and some noticeable booziness with some time in the glass. Medium body, slick finish, lingering pine, clean as hell. So right. Did I mention it was bottled 8 days ago on 2/9/15. Oh Fat Head's... you've done it again!"
A - Golden clear
"Case from the 2.13.15 release day at the tap house in cleveland. bottled and packaged that day, wow!! awesome beer!"
"Very resiny, pine, grapefruit, and savory Amarillo character in aroma. Moderate caramel malt sweetness."
on draft in 12oz snifter glass
Really Fantastic!
My all time favorite Beer
"this is amazing on so many levels. for one, all this hop character with so little bitterness, its incredible, maybe one of the most dramatic ive encountered. honey colored is fitting, because its honey textured hoppy too, extremely west coast in nature, dank and drippy with hop goodness. i dont get as much tropical fruit in this as others apparently have, more pine for me, spruce even, springy and pungent, with a real taffy sticky front end feel but fully resolving in the finish, aided by strong carbonation and a medium body that feels delicate for how big this is. i appreciate a big ipa under 9% abv too, it allows me the ability to enjoy several of them without the consequences of doing the same thing with one at 10% abv. i would describe the hop profile of this beer as less distinct than expected, given the hype. i thought for sure southern hemisphere fruitiness and all of that, but its not really there. its got more of a northwest hop character, just done better than most others, which is always great to see. this one and the head hunter are both amazing. these guys appear to be really onto it with their hoppy beers. id love to try some other stuff, looks like they do a ton."
Look: Crystal clear honey with a medium white head. A pretty beer. 
Awesome hop pyramid of love
BOTTLE: 12 fl oz size. Brown glass. Fun label art. Branded orange pry-off pressure cap.
"I gave my rating awhile back, but I figured I needed to put the notes on this as well. "
Bottle date is not legible...
I can understand after having this beer why Fat Heads won the gold for this recipe..
From notes
Poured from a stubby 12oz. bottle into a standard pint glass.
"A great beer enjoyed with good company. Medium amber with a thin head. Nice fruity nose, which translates to the initial taste. Mango, grapefruit and a touch of pine. A reasonable bitter dry finish. Overall a very drinkable beer with plenty going on."
"Thank you Nick. Pours a clear medium amber with a thin white head that settles to a foamy cap. Good lacing. Subtle aromas of tropical fruit and citrus with sweet malt notes. The taste reveals what the aroma hinted at - mango, pineapple, grapefruit up front with a bitter pine resin kick on the back end. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink. Overall, a top ten DIPA if I've ever had one."
"Bottle to tulip glass, no bottle date"
"Phenomenal beer. Gold medal winner, well deserved."
"I poured this beer into a glass, it has a dark orange color body with a foamy, sticky head. The aroma is grapefruit and skunk hops. The taste just blasts off of pine and citrus hops, it also has a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is great and leaves a hoppy after taste. Overall it is one of the best dipa I have had."

1783rd Review on BA
I don't get the hype. Way too bitter.
This is a re-assessment because the first time I had this I was sick.
"Straight from a bottle, date indecipherable. Lots of tropical hops, and lots of sweetness. Doesn't strike me as overwhelmingly malty in its sweetness (which, for me, is good—brews like 90 Minute or even Maharaja tilt too much toward malt for my taste). Honestly, feels like it belongs more in the company of Undercover Investigation Shut-down or Bigfoot than your average IIPA—but then again, I'm more of a West Coast IPA guy, so fans of East Coast style might find this more familiar. Either way, pretty tasty."
"Fat Heads Brewery & Saloon - Hop JuJu Imperial IPA, poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
I live in California. There is no reason why I have any prejudice for or against this beer. It's a matter of tasting it and providing a review.
"Bottle graciously provided by the people at The Daily Growler in Upper Arlington, OH. Poured into my Abandon Brewing snifter."
Bottled 2/13/14
Head quickly recedes to a collar. Body is light amber color. Small lacing around.
Appearance: a deep reddish orange color. good clarity and a small white head that fades to just about nothing
Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle acquired in a trade with mps
"Wow. Wow. Wow... How can I review this thing when after taking a sip I feel like Olivia Wilde just gave me kissing lessons à la her and Joaquin Phoenix in ""Her""? My sweet hell is this sucker just good on all levels. Piney like a thriving redwood, and then just straight smooth like a Kennedy in court."
A: Slight hazy dark amber hue with hints of orange teasing on the side. the color of sunsets. off white egg shell head hangs around for a little bit.
Big thanks to CircusBoy for this one.
poured 12oz bottle into snifter. 
A - 12oz bottle dated 2/26/14 into snifter. 2 finger white head left some decent lacing. Sunburst orange. Noticeable sediment 
"Amber orange pour,slightly cloudy,1 finger of tawny head,spotty lacing."
"12oz bottle from the 3-6-14 batch. Pours a dark hazy burnt orange with amber tones. The nose is delicious: ripe pineapple, oranges, pine resin, and tropical fruit. Thankfully, taste is not nearly as sweet as I was fearing from the nose. A very refreshing fruitiness quickly gives way to an intense but controlled bitterness, a bitterness that's in line with grapefruit rind but not overpowering."
Bottle shared by mendvicdog. Thanks Pat!
A- Darker than norm golden honey. Thin lacing. Translucent
Fantastic head retention! Head is creamy and wispy. Brew is cloudy tangerine color. 
A - Pours a clear copper with a one-finger foamy white head. Nice lacing.
"A - Copper color, clear, with a light tan head that forms then fades quickly. Minor lacing."
"Poured from a bottle into a Goose Island tulip. The pour is hazy, golden-orange, sports two fingers of fluffy white head, and is loaded with floaties. The nose is not as pungent as I anticipated, but still quite assertive and dripping with fresh oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and peaches."
12 oz bottle poured into a snifter
Served from a 12oz bottle into a Lost Abbey Teku. No freshness date.
Appearance - The poured a copper color with very little head or lacing around the sides of the glass. 
"Hop Juju is a clear dark orange color, like crystalized burnt amber. The head is off-white and plenty creamy. It rises to one finger in height and retains about half of that for the duration of the session, leaving good webbing interconnecting the lace."
"As a recent fan of hop head's ipa I couldn't wait to try this even higher rated imperial ipa. This ale pours a almost red copper color with a significant slightly off white head that gives way to a slight film and little lacing. The nose is an awesome hoppy bomb with tons of citrus, grass, and pine notes. There is a little malt sweetness for balance but it is very subtle in comparison to all the awesome. This beer is great. Not the best imperial I've ever had but damn close. Wish I could get it in Michigan."
"A-Cloudy amber orange, slight carbonation, one finger head that lingers."
12oz bottle from zrab11 (big thanks!). A thorough search revealed no apparent bottle dating but I beleive this to be an early 2014 release. Served in a Burnt Hickory snifter. 
Big thanks to seeswo for this. Bottled 03/06/14.

12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter
Appearance is a orange amber hazy color with a half finger head.
"Fatheads Hop Juju . . . A reckless use of hops !Poured into a pint glass this beer produces an orange sunset glow. Some floaties too, I like to see that. Aromas are caramel, pine, and very pungent citrus notes of mango, grapefruit and pineapple. Taste is very good but also unique. Warming start to finish. Pine up front and citrus in the end. Has a caramel sweetness too it as well. Feel is medium to full bodied and very sticky. Overall amazing stuff"
A: Pale copper/amber with a small white head. Great lacing.
Let’s see what all the hype is about. Cheers!
Appearance is good looks like it's going to be smooth. Golden with nice whitish head.
A twelve ounce bottle dated 01/30/17 poured in a 13oz. tulip for the review. 
"With the unmistakable ""Citra"" hop character- it appears at first sniff that the brewers at Fat Head's have sold their soul to the devil. Irresistible to hop-heads, this deeply resinous taste is accompanied with enough fruit flavor to make any punch bowl blush."
"12oz, 2/14 bottling"
A - Pours a deep orange with a thin head
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 02/26/14. Served in a DFH IPA glass, the beer pours a hazy orange color with a couple inch off-white head that stayed around a long time. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is great, the brew smells mostly like citrusy (orange peel, oranges, tropical fruit, melon) and pine hops, along with some caramel malt. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some herbalness and apricot flavor along with a good bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and coating with moderate carbonation. I think it's a pretty good Imperial IPA, I'd certainly buy this again in the future."
This. Beer. Is. Perfect
"This is truly one of the best DIPA's I have ever had. It pours a rich and heady copper into the snifter. I have this beer in bottles and on draft. I have had several different batches in bottles. It is very consistent. First off, it is a kick you in the teeth hop bomb. Where this beer excels is the balance of malt and in your face hops while not giving off that blatant alcohol burn. This beer is fantastic. As a reference, I am a big fan of Heady Topper, Russian River, Three Floyds, Stone, Founders, and Bells. Fat Heads Head Hunter and Hop Ju Ju are just two reasons why Fat Heads is now a cult favorite."
"Big thanks to SteveOldrati for hooking me up with this. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. The brew appears a dark burnt copper color, fairly clear with less than a finger of off-white cap that is quick to fade leaving patchy lace."
"Pours a pretty, golden orange with a half inch off-white head. Some lacing is left behind. Smells of citrus fruits, honey sweetness, and some floral/resin hop flavors. Taste is the same as the aroma. Smooth across the tongue, not overly bitter, but a bit sticky on the lips. Overall, a great new offering and I'm glad I was able to give this a try!"
"One of the best noses on a beer I've come across. Lovely, full-on floral hops. This is a super classy DIPA, no juvenile, bitter hop bomb. The hops are huge and resinous -- on the pine side more than tropical fruit. The hops are well-balanced with a chewy malt that gives the proceedings a nice solid backbone. Great beer."
Poured from a bottle into a tulip shaped glass. Date on bottle is a bit f'd up but i think it says 2/13/14 which would make it about 3 weeks old.

"Enjoyed at Yellow Brick Pizza in Columbus, OH on Feb. 21. Reviewed from notes."
"Wow. I picked it up because it's an Ohio beer, but this is absolutely amazing and I wish I would have picked up more than a single. The citrus aromas and flavors are phenomenal. I love IPAs and DIPAs, and this is the best I've had, and maybe even the best beer I've ever had! The mouthfeel is perfect in regards to thickness and carbonation, the bitterness is perfectly complimented by the orange flavor in the taste, and this one is bold, but somehow reasonably balanced. This goes down incredibly easy even given the high ABV as the alcohol is masked. This is the beer I've been looking for...."
Bottle > Snifter
"A. Copper, orange/gold hues. Slightly hazy. Soft white head fades to a thin cap. Thick screen laces very nicely."
"A: Pours a bright apricot orange, fully translucent body. Beige frothy head builds up and rushes down but leaves great lacing. This pours beautifully."
"Bottle into teku. Pours dark orange, clear, with a single finger off white head that hangs around for a while. Smell is amazing, tons of pine, more pine, some tropical fruit, some peach, dark fruit, some slight Carmel. Taste starts sweet with nice fruity hop flavors, tons of pine resin, some pineapple, some apple, subtle vanilla, small but good malt caricature. Texture is as expected, thicker than your average ipa but very drinkable. Overall I really really liked this, loaded with flavor, and amazing on the nose. I've heard that it's essentially a head hunter on steroids, yeah that exactly right, lots of tropical fruit, tons of piney hops, timid malt presence. It's certainly imperial, and am amazing representation of the style"
All right. Let's see what this hop juju hoopla is all about.
"Thanks, Tyler!"
"First time bottled and I missed the release. Luckily, I have great friends who were able to get some! Fresh bottle poured into a Weyerbacher tukip glass..."

Bottle aggressively poured into a tulip
Aquired in trade with RayOhioFelton.
Acquired via trade. 12 oz bottle poured into Spiegelau glass. 
Appearance: A billowy head gathers above the amber liquid and leaves multiple strands of lacing down the side of the glass
A: reddish orange hue with barely any head despite a vigorous pour. Whispy crown does linger though.
Had the last glass on tap after rushing home from work. Was the best beer of the night.
Been trying to get my hands on this beer for what seems like forever. Was finally able to pick some up at Fat Head's (Pittsburgh) this morning. Words cannot express my excitement. Less talk. More drink.
Thanks to Wowcoolman for sharing this one at Retsinis' tasting.
"Pours a clear orange color with a medium white head that burns away steadily. Short strings of lacing. Piney hops, citrus and malt in the nose. Medium body with a moderately bitter hops flavor that has grapefruit and pine notes. Sweet malt in the background. The finish is hoppy with a citrus aftertaste."

"Thanks to CaptCleveland & fiver29, the best two traders in the Midwest, for sending me bottles of this new brew one day apart. If it's anything like Head Hunter...sign me up. 12 oz. bottle poured lovingly by my underage daughter. "
"Been waiting to try this beer for a long time, I usually catch every specialty release at Fathead's Pittsburgh but this one has always eluded me. I was thrilled to hear that it won this year's GABF Gold medal, and it beat my favorite 3F's Permanent Funeral out in blind tastings. This sample is super fresh bottled on 2/13/14...I love the packaging and the artwork on the label...""a supernatural beer"". "
Fat Heads Hop Juju
"Served in a tulip at Yellow Brick Pizza on 2/20/14. Reviewed from notes, with updates from recent tastings. The appearance is a beautiful combination of amber and orange with a touch of haziness to it. The head was minimized by the bartender, but I could see a nice thick, white head during the pouring process."
"This stuff is flat out amazing for an IPA... The appearance and smell start you off like a normal high class DIPA would. Golden in color, with wonderful tropical notes to make you anxious for that first sip. Oh my, was it a great first tip! Amazing fresh hops meets wonderful citrus and tropical flavors that balance perfectly! This beer has already skyrocketed up to my favorite DIPA and i've tried a handful of the big ones outside of Heady. I can see why this won gold at the Great American Beer Festival! I only hope Fatheads boosts production for this baby, because it is about to be the Pliny of Ohio!"
"From bottle to nonic pint. Thanks, CaptCleveland for sending this dankness my way!!!"
Juju!
12oz pour into snifter for $6.50 at FH brewery.
Had a fresh bottle and had it on tap. 
Poured from 12oz. bottle into tuliped pint glass. Date of review is 2/14/14 (Valentine's Day) 
"Absolutely outstanding beer. I poured JuJu into a 16 oz. snifter and the first thing that hit me was the aroma. It was huge amounts of a blend of citrus flavors. I had to take several smells of this before I even had my first sip, and even after, I still couldn't get enough of the smell of this beer. The taste followed the smell, with a bit of pepper as well."
"This beer is incredible! It pours a beautiful orange and the nose is off the charts with tropical fruit and citrus notes. There's a bit of pine in the finish, but this is tropical all the way and hides the ABV too well!"
"This is just one of those beers that can't get any better. All the components are there for a big West Coast style DIPA. This beer has joins the ranks of the greats in the category. Citrus, pine, smooth. It has it all. If you like HT, you will love the JuJu. For such a big beer, you cannot taste the alcohol, making this one dangerous brew. I normally don't drink a second big beer like this one after the other. I drank three. If I could, I would drink this beer everyday. It is literally liquid gold. I thank the beers gods of North Olmstead for bringing this beer to life."
"On tap at Fathead's in Cleveland, OH about 3 days after it was released."
"On-tap at Fat Head's in N. Olmsted, Ohio"
"Served at on tap at 3R6P in Delmont, PA,"
"Very nice looking copper color on this beer. The head is thin and white leaving behind just a touch of lacing on the glass with a small amount of retention. The smell if loaded with a bunch of hop aromas that range from resin to pine to fruit. The taste of the beer is very good too, nicely balanced sweet malts with a punishing bitter finish. The mouthfeel is oily and kind of heavy too. Overall this beer is a tasty, it's a hop bomb for sure, but if you're a hophead you'll love this for sure."
Served in a chilled beer glass
served on tap in pittsburgh fatheads
"On-tap at Three Floyds. I really dug Headhunter, so I was excited to try this one. Served in a half-pint."
A - Golden orange and transparent. Poured with two fingers of white head that had ridiculous retention. 
Picked up a growler at the Pittsburgh location.
A- Pours a bright amberish orange color with just a tiny bit of haze to it. Head is a white foam that becomes a layer of bubbles on top of the brew. Head leaves some really nice layered lacing. 
On tap at Fat Heads.
Fatheads Hop Juju 
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, mango and peach citrus. In the taste, pine like hops and dehydrated peaches. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine like hop in the aftertaste. Kind of summery with the nice fruitiness in the nose, but pine hops in the taste."
"An interesting double IPA with a very malty edge and bitter finish. Smells of floral hops, much caramel and honey and autumn mornings. Taste is very caramelly and sweet. Honestly it smells a lot better than the taste. JuJu goes down smooth but comes back for a bitter bite that allows you to really feel the alcohol. Two pints though and I felt like I had a full meal. Overall I would say it was quite good but a bit too rich and bitter."
9-1-2010
"Had on tap at the Cleveland location. The menu notes: Double IPA brewed with incredible amounts of hops giving this beer supernatural hops aroma, flavor, and bitterness. "
"Got this at Fatheads in Pittsburgh on tap, the only place you can get this stuff. Pours a deep amber orange, no carbonation, thin light lacing around the top of the glass."
Had on draft last night at Fat Heads in Pittsburgh. Joe is the best bartender there and we also mixed this with Head hunter to create quite an awesome IPA.
Well another phenomenal Fat Head effort at the Double IPA festival. 
"Review from notes taken earlier tonight at the brewery. Poured into a clean, clear pint glass. Notes from brewery: Double IPA brewed with incredible amounts of hops giving this beer supernatural hop aroma, flavor and bitterness. It's witchcraft on tap like a temporary hop tattoo on your tongue."
I was able to try Fat Heads take on a Double/Imperial IPA there on 9/25/2009. The beer menu stated that it had an ABV of 8.7% and 100 IBUs. Fat Heads served it to me in a 12 oz. Snifter.
From a 16oz can from 9/18
I wouldn’t describe many double IPAs as crisp but this beer is crisp and delightful with citrus hints and a nice hoppy bite.
16 oz beer poured into a nonic pint glass canned on the 9/18.
"Six weeks from canning... Orange haze, perfectly uniform throughout, nice lacing. Smells like melons, taste is a little more piney/dank than expected, but it works nice. Good feel, nice brew"
On tap at McGillicuddy's
"Almost clear golden color with off-white head. Aroma has resiny, piney hops with a sweet malt background. Taste starts bitter upfront, slightly astringent, quite harsh and resiny. Medium plus body with medium carbonation. I expected much more from this one considering the hype but it's a quite basic DIPA with intense bitterness and not much complexity."
Poured into a snifter/tulip/wine hybrid glass
Very smooth and fruity NE DIPA. Similar but not quite as hoppy as a heady topper. Definitely one of my all time favorites
Canned 7/24/18
Poured from a can into Teku glass; dark amber color not very opaque. Smells and tastes hoppy with a crisp and piney finish. Felt more like a west coast IPA than a typical NE IPA but great feel nonetheless. Would recommend Fiddlehead if you are in the Burlington area good stuff happening there.
Draught pour at Pastoral.
Best I've had tied with Heady Topper. Wish I lived closer to Vermont. New England is killing it.
"Bottled 7/26, opened 8/12. Pours clear amber, no haze, with a thick off-white head."
"Opens with a massive froth that settles into an extremely cloudy amber body. Upon the initial pour, their is a substantial mango nose. There is little lacing once settled; the head is flimsy and loose. Take a slow sip; there is a blanket of lemongrass, pineapple and pepper overwhelming the palate. Maybe, a little sweetness in here? No bitterness either. This is a wonderful DIPA from an excellent brewery. (See My Review.) That said, this one is not for the novice."
"Extremely smooth double, one of my favorites of all the NE IPAs"
Light gold color with a faint haze. Moderate head which retains the rim bubbles throughout. Nice semi-blanketing lace. 
Overall a great west coast meets east coast. Mostly translucent with the slightest haze. Clean and crisp. Tinge of fruit but mostly piney. This tasted like a slightly toned down version of Maine Dinner to me.
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear straw color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Light grapefruit hop nose and flavor follows - tart grapefruit. Higher ABV (8.2%) is hidden $3.99 for a 16oz can from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Had on tap. Pours hazy, orange tan in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is melon, tangerine, and grapefruit rind. Heavy bodied, bitter with low carbonation. Great ipa..will get this again."
"Good DIBA. Loads of alcohol at 8.2%, but showing lots of fruit along with the typical peel and resin flavors. Nice fruit with a round, resinous, and clean finish. Definitely worth the try from Fiddlehead."
This beer is very good. Considering that Fiddlehead is one of the original NE IPAs this beer still rocks. Super dense mouthfeel /body. Yet crushable. 
"Been wanting to try this for years. Finally distribution has reached me. Honestly, for me, better than Heady and Sip (I love both of them!). They are of similar style but Second Fiddle seems more balanced. Don’t expect haze because it’s more of an amber color but has that NE soft mouthfeel. Smooth aggressive tropical hops with balanced malt mix so well.. Crisp and well made this an easy drinking treat."
"Malt Bomb.....and one of the most overrated beers I've ever come across. If you are expecting a NE style hoppy brew, you will be sadly disappoined. Everything about it is par to sub par....oh, and did I say Malty? Thin for its weight, cloyingly sweet and slightly boozy. Picking up diacetyl, as well. This beer is oh so West Coast 2008. Say a prayer and bury it!"
"Great beer. Better than the first fiddle. 13oz draft $7 at The Fix in Worcester, MA."
nice taste but not a standout
"I loved this beer! It's so subtle in aroma and taste, nothing too overpowering. I thought it was just right. Totally sessionable in my opinion. Hard to believe this is a double IPA. 3 of these and I would be blackout drunk. Let the good times roll!"
L: a very clear golden yellow with a huge head when poured into a can glass. 
"Pours a medium orange color, slightly hazy with a frothy two finger head."
"4/23 ""bruuuuuce"" "
I agree with the most recent reviewer maybe the batch is off. 4/14
"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass (3 weeks old). Appearance is a fairly transparent orange brown with one finger think head. There is a beautiful floral hop aroma with grapefruit, green hop, honeysuckle, and hay notes."
Super crushable for 8%.
"16oz can. Pours a slightly hazy brownish orange with over an inch of fluffy head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is lots of grapefruit and pine along with floral notes and more citrus. The taste is a nice blend of the citrus and pine. Grapefruit is the most noticeable fruit flavor, but there is some berry and tropical fruit notes as well. Good deal of malts towards the end with a piney and grapefruit finish. Medium body with a dry mouthfeel. Some alcohol heat. Pretty balanced, all things considered. Worth seeking out for sure."

"Dated 3/27/18 on the can, less than 2.5 weeks old."
"Pint can (3/22/18) ""Your cat died"" on bottom.poured into a long stem Treehouse glass."
"Tight clinging lace head slowly leaves a tapestry as it flows back down into a Amber-hued golden body. Nose is robust - hints of rind, bright flowers, and a menecing aroma of resiny dankness. Taste is well balance, but a little thick. Palette gets hit hardddddd. When freshly poured it is a wonder with an assault of ritz cracker malt tempered by an almost peppery combo of marmalade, grass, and pine. Nuances do come out as it warms allowing citrus and weedy dankness trade turns. Overwhelming to have more than one - unless you make the mistake of pounding one before you realize what hits you."
"Wow, this is spectacular. Pours a slightly hazy amber with a thick white head. Smell is oily/hoppy and strong. Taste is sharp and bitter but with a pleasing aftertaste. The bitterness flows away to a sweet floral flavor. Feel is excellent, mouthcoating but not heavy. Overall, this is a must try when you can."
The Best Vermont/American DIPA. Get it if you can.
"Real smooth , great hops , light. Not many better than this."
Poured from a tallboy can into a tulip
"Tasted with a date stamp of 10/7/17. From the very first look, smell and taste I knew that the BA rating was worthy."
"Solid New England IPA--juicy with a nice citrus, fruity nose. However was expecting more in the way of taste complexity."
Solid.
"First had poured from pint can, gift from friend, stamped on bottom “TAB 09/12/17,” into tulip pint. Although a big fan of New England IPAs, wherever brewed, I’m a bigger fan of beer diversity. So I very much enjoyed this outstanding West Coast(-style) IPA, from Vermont of all places."
Amazing beer. Great smooth taste - highly recommend. I like it more than Sip of Sunshine.
More balanced than Sip of Sunshine.
"Having a 16oz in a tulip glass. Amber color with just a hint of haze. Two finger and long lasting head. Smells super dank with daisy flower and tropical fruit. Tastes of pine, subtle sweet malt, bitter citrus rind, and fruit. Kind of on the light to medium bodied with light carbonation. Doesn't feel like 8.2%. The finish is a bit short lived but all around a nice IPA."
16oz can in a fine stemmed tulip glass.
"Pours a nice gold color with about two fingers of head. Head lasts a while before breaking, then left with a nice bubbly ring. Some lacing is present. "
Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass. Thanks Steve for the hookup.
Typical VT IPA (which I like a lot). Great tasting beer that I routinely fall back to. Never ceases to satisfy.
"Amber pour with two finger head. Classic malty IPA, not quite as fruit forward as some of its neighbors, a little bitter on the back end, but very well rounded nonetheless."
Overall i thought this was a great beer and up there with Mastermind.
"Rich golden copper color, loads of hop haze, light tan head. Dank, piney hops on the nose - and do I detect a significant malt presence?"
Canned 10 days ago.
Nice juicy hoppy all the way through. Great nose.
Punting to a 4 for the look since I drank straight from the can. I do love a chilled Vermont IPA in a pounder. One of life's pleasures. I just assume it's a beautiful shade of golden orange that wows. 
Was very happy to finally find this one. Poured from a can slightly cloudy with just under a fingers worth of head that laced the glass. The smell is a very earthy and hoppy full of pine and grass. The flavor has a very welcomed bitterness like piney grapefruit with a slight malt backbone. The feel is medium bodied and has a good amount of carbonation. I am glad to be having an IPA that isn't scared to throw some hop bitterness into it. Wonderful!!!
Poured from a 16oz can into a speiglau IPA glass. 
"This was solid. Nothing too crazy, nice hoppy flavor and smooth."
"Pours a deep amber, slightly cloudy with a two finger off white head that left lots of lacing. Smells of citrus fruits and pine-real strong aroma. Tastes of grapefruit, orange, orange rind, mango, pineapple, mild malt presence and pine. Finishes very slightly bitter, light to medium bodied and carbonation, slightly dry and oily mouth feel."
16oz. can into a Surly teku. 
"16 Oz Can, Fresh, Thank You Hunger Mountain Co Op"
"Orange-brown iced tea color, with beautiful, beautiful lacing and head. Just skirted like a bed. Love it. "
A: The beer is yellowish amber in color and is clear with a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high off white head that settled down but left a layer of bubbles covering the surface and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass.
Disappointingly thin and weak on flavor.
This is OK be of the smoothest drinking DPA's I have ever had.....Great underated beer...
"beautiful deep golden, crystal clear look. no haze here. clean look leads to clean taste. there is a richness in the flavor that is incredibly unique. I really like the taste on this beer."
"Thanks to HozerSr for the can of this! The beer pours out as a hazy orange color with a solid white head on top with a sticky lacing. The smell right from the can is insane, tons of hop aroma, it's beautiful. The taste is pretty awesome too, soft yet bitter and citrusy. The mouthfeel is smooth with a soft carbonation. Overall this beer is excellent really glad I finally got to try this one."
"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a hazy orange color with a one finger foamy white head that dissipated within less than about 45 seconds. Light stringy lacing slides into the beer. The smell has a big burst of mango, pineapple, oranges and lemons subtly intertwining to produce a nice blend of tropical to citrus flavors. The taste had big bittersweet burst of the previously mentioned flavors coating my taste buds extremely nicely to lead into a nice wet citrus to tropical aftertaste and quick finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sipping quality about it. Carbonation runs nicely as an DIPA allowing a decent harshness but nothing to take away from the bitterness. Overall, as an DIPA, this is an awesome beer to partake in."
"Look: Dark orange, clear, with big fluffy head. Medium carbonation."
16 oz. can dated 05/24/2017
"Pours a rich honeyed golden with a lacy white head atop,a menacing look for sure.A mix of grapefruit and tangerine-like hops really come thru in the nose,a slight bit of grass is detected as well.Man the fruity hop profile going on here flavor-wise is astonishing,passion fruit,grapefruit,mango,with a grassy finish pretty much close to every hop flavor profile you can get!A little sugary sweetness in the finish to let you know it's a DIPA and you have a hands down top 5 of the style I have had,awesome."
"16 oz. can poured into an IPA glass. 4-pack canned 3/1\17. Only available in Vermont. Just one of the many sought-after Vermont Double IPAs like Heady Topper that are unfiltered and have a ton hops added into the boil. Not much is said about the beer on their website, so let's just dive in."
I strongly believe that this is THE best IPA- DIPA that I have ever had....period ! Should be a 100 on the rating scale. Delicious. Thank you Fiddlehead Brewing Company for this magnificent and delicious DIPA !
"Appearance: A nice bubble show builds the head to two fingers and there it sits, squatting atop the hazy amber colored liquid, clumps and dots of lacing hang around"
A 16 oz can poured into a tulip glass.
"16 oz can 1/13/17...Wall of Sound...poured into a tulip. A travel gift from Rick. Aroma is pine and grapefruit. Taste? Like chewing on a grapefruit pine cone dipped into a little sea salt. Hops are still present after 3 months, though I can imagine how powerful they are closer to canning. Bitterness, check. Tinge of heat...yes. The mouthfeel is close to full, things get a little sticky as it warms, and the carbonation is medium. Overall, a highly recomendded IIPA. Fiddlehead does not dissapoint."
"Can dated 4/19/2017 poured into a Trillium snifter. The hop aromas blossomed from the can as it was poured. Beer is a hazy apricot color with a finger and a half of off-white head that had good retention and spotty lacing. Aroma is stonefruit, oranges, pine, malt and slight alcohol. Taste is a very balanced IIPA with stonefruits, citrus, pine and moderate malty backbone. Mouthfeel is medium and substantially carbonated to the point of prickliness, with a dry alcohol finish. Overall this a world class IIPA that is more West Coast than its Vermont brethren. It is amazingly balanced, and worth picking up if your lucky enough to do so."
"Pours a hazy orange, some fluffy head."
Look is deep amber with moderate to light haze. Nice semi-fine head that fades and leaves ascetic lacing on the glass.
This is definitely the best beer I've ever had. Superior quality DIPA!
Tall can w/ 2-3-17 stamped on the bottom...
good balanced beer. Some nice hoppy bitterness balanced with a malty back bone. Could be a little happier and riddled with citrus or piney or anything really for my taste. But overall a solid safe beer
16 oz can (12/30/16... dedicated!) poured into my (original) Gandhi-bot snifter. Pours a dark honey- darker than most of the other NE DIPAs I have been blessed enough to consume. 
Great. Might be better than Heady
Can
Type: 16-oz. can
"Pours a hazy reddish orange. Smell of light tangerine. It's soft. It has some tangerine sweetness but also some grapefruit. It's dry and pithy. Kind of has some sticky resin to it. A little bit of that oily citrus fruit peel. It's a really nice beer, but I don't find the hops particularly bright. It certainly plays second fiddle to Mastermind in Fiddlehead's catalog."
"Pours deep orange with a thick layer of fog to it. Head foams up to two fingers in height and white in color. Head retention is good. Lacing is fair. Aroma is orange zest, mango, and pine hops. There is a rich biscuity, bready malt quality as well. Flavor profile is orange zest, mango, payapya, with some pine and resin hop stick to it. Malts really cut throw the hops, and come in the form of biscuit and bread notes. It has a large presence to it, yet is still balanced. Mouth feel is filling, with a thick DIPA texture to it. It has a little bit of graininess, and fizziness as well. Overall, a sublime DIPA that features plenty of popping hop action. The malt notes are great, and really bolster this beer into a thick, experience of a DIPA. "
"Wow, really good"
I'll get this at least once a year.
Poured from can into tulip glass at home-
appearance- Dark orange amber in color and very hazy (almost turbid). Pours a foamy three inch head.
Canned 04-01-16. Drank 04-08-16.
First had 3/31/16 at home from Eric F. It's a heavy hitter in the DIPA war in the northeast. Really nice citrus bitter finish. IPA's and DIPA's are the greatest thing to happen in the northeast America's since the pilgrims.
Poured into a tulip.
Fantastic.
Can received in trade with Ian. Thanks! One of the best beers I've had to date.
Always a treat to have this one. Once again a perfect taste and feel. Nice smell of dank hops. Very juicy taste on this. Pours a nice bright orange and very smooth taste.
from can into snifter
Review from BeerAdvocate magazine issue #111
"On my trip to Vermont this was one of the best IPA/DIPAs I had. I actually found it better than SoS and Heady. This slightly orange beer had a burst of grapefruit on the nose and even more grapefruit when you taste it. The only aspect of this beer that isn't world class is the mouthfeel. I thought it was a little thin and a bit too much carbonation. It could have gone down a little smoother. I, however, feel very lucky that I was drinking the beer the day it was canned at Fiddlehead. It doesn't get any fresher than that!"
Fiddlehead is definitely climbing the ranks of best breweries in Vermont in my opinion. Second Fiddle is up there with the best IIPA's anywhere. Comes in the ever popular 16oz can.
Outstanding!!! Top 5 ever. Its a regular Saturday stop when in Vermont. Highly recommend it.
"Very solid DIPA. Would absolutely drink again. Very hop forward, definitely a beer to drink fresh. My last one was about a month old and was not as good as the first."
"Really great double IPA here. Very easy to drink for being over 8% and excellent, clean finish. The hops came through very well on both the palate and the nose making this beer a real pleasure to drink and enjoy"
This beer pours a beautiful hazy orange with a light white head. The smell is citrus and mango/melon. The taste is very nice. Starts off with a very grapefruit citrus flavor and ends with the mango and melon. Mouthfeel is somewhat light for a DIPA but not horrible. Overall a very good beer.
Many thanks to Millerbuffoon for this can. Canned 5-13-16.
"Poured 16oz can into snifter. Clear, deep golden orange with a 2 finger white head. Nice retention that leaves a thin cap and webs of lacing. The aroma of hops blast you with a punch of floral and pine, grapefruit, other citrus like tangerine, and a few tropical notes. Some aromas of light sweet malt. A nice flavor of grapefruit, citrus and pine followed by tropical notes of mango and passion fruit. The sweeter malts bring up the middle. Finishes with a nice citrus and bitterness. Seems to be just right and the carbonation really fills it out. Finishes with resin and sticky dryness. Delicious IIPA that reminds me of New Glarus Scream."
From the 3/11 canning. Just a superb beer. The juiciness has faded some but still great. 
"Undated bottle into pint glass. Hazy gold color with an off-white head. Initial impression is pine hops, tropical fruits, balanced by a little malt. Slighly bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Refreshing and smooth. My first offering from this brewery, and I'm impressed."
"Thanks, Pearpicker!"
"Excellent beer! Very smooth for a Double IPA. Pours a golden murky orange. Awesome flavor burst of orange, mango, and pineapple. One of the all time greats in terms of IPAs"
"Pours murky orange with a nice head. Wonderful fruity with a light hop finish aroma. mango, pineapple, citrus and Carmel to a light hop with a faint light pepper finish. This beer is top notch. Far from a second fiddle."
"Hazy golden color; minimal head. Nice bouquet to the use - fruits and hops. This double IPA is very well balanced with pineapple, citrus and hops. Not overpowering and very easy on the palate. Slight bitters from the hops; medium body. One of the best DIPAs I've had!"
"This is one of the first Top 250 beers that I ever had so my rating and review are largely based on nostalgia. With that said, I had a few this summer and they were Great!"
OH YEAH. Lucky to be in VT during silent can release. Canned 4/1/16. Poured into Lawson's tulip glass.
"We picked up 4, 4 packs at the brewery on a recommendation. We've already spent a lot of money on 2 cases of Heady Topper and 2 cases of Sip of Sunshine. I should have gotten two cases of this as well. This is one outstanding DIPA with great color and fruity finish with a good amount of bitterness."
"Easily one of the best DIPA's I've ever had. So fruity, loads of mango, pineapple and passion fruit with hints of candy floss and a nice caramel backbone. ABV is very well hidden and goes down with a touch of dryness. So fortunate to have had the opportunity to try it and highly recommended to any fan of the style."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange/gold with a fantastic scent of floral and hops. For a double IPA it has a modest hop taste with floral and citrus hints. It also sits very well. Similar to Fiddlehead IPA, but certainly hoppier."
"This beer is everything I want a DIPA to be. Not overly malty/sweet, and lets the hops shine through. Not overly bitter and the ABV is very well hidden. Tons of fruit on the nose and body. Super creamy body and finish. This one hits all the right spots for me. Definitely one I will come back to again and again."
"Slightly hazy dark orange color. Nice lacing and half finger white head. Smell is definitely sweet pine, and sweet tropical. Very sweet resinous hops that make your mouth water. The taste just brings out how much of a big beer this really is. Pretty malt foward, big hop resin with not that much tropical notes. Maybe some very slight pineapple but that's about it. Overall a big, solid DIPA. Wish the sweet tropical notes in the nose carried on to the taste though."
Hazy pumpkin orange color. White head with lots of lace.
16 oz can was poured into a pint Spiegelau glass. 
Excellent. Maybe a little too fresh..if that's possible. One of the best beers I've ever had
"Juicy NE hop beer. Nose of citrus (orange, grapefruit). Taste of pine resin but super smooth in drinking. Dangerous for a 8%. Lacking the bitterness you would expect for a DIPA (esp having it after Pliny the Elder). Nice lil surprise from a trade. Definitely wouldn't mind having another pack of this in the future"
Look: Amber with two fingers of nice white head.
"This beer pours a very cloudy golden amber color with a huge, fluffy bright white head. Retention is amazing and there are a ton of webbed sheets of lacing. Smell is outstanding. Fruity, earthy, piney and dank. All the staples of a great IPA. Taste is the same, but there is a touch of sweetness that provides a little more balance than the smell would lead you to believe. Still aggressively hop forward with lots of bitterness. Feel is perfect. Very soft and pillowy with a little bit of prickly bitterness, but still sooo smooth. Overall this beer is top notch. Did a blind tasting with this, Heady, SOS and Lambo Door, and this one actually came out on top. It has that piney dankness that the others lack, but still manages to be so soft on the mouth feel. World class!"
L-Pours more amber than gold with a huge 2 inch plus frothy white head. Lacing is excellent and lasting.
"16 oz can. Opaque orange color with finger white head, fades slowly leaving soapy lace. Big juicy and piney hop aroma. The taste of this brew is a cross between juicy citrus and resiny pine hops. The pine wins out with lots of dank bitterness through the sip and dry finish. Just enough caramel malt backbone. Medium, very soft mouthfeel. This is a delish bitter IPA."
"Another one of my favorites from Vermont! Definitely on my top 10 beer list. It has amazing bitter hop flavors with a subtle malt background. Drinkable? YES! Wish I could get my hands on this stuff more often. Thinking about moving to Vermont, just so I can have access to beers like this on a consistent basis. Salud!!"
"I have drunk this side by side with Heady Topper, Pliny Elder, and Sip of Sunshine and this brew is a bit more bitter with hints of grapefruit. I really liked this beer, but several beers ahead of it on my top list. I'll drink it."
"Poured from a can 9 days old. This is an IPA that seems to trend more to a huge malt base as the hops a a bit tempered. I get some dankness, chive, herbal notes, orange creme and tangerines. Mostly the deep caramel, honey, grain malt base shines through."
Delicious super fresh
"A very nice brew for those who enjoy a dank piney resinous brew with hints of ctrus and tropical fruit. Poured dark orangey, nice head, nice lacing down the glass as I sipped this tasty brew. Usually I dont really like the dank and piney stuff, but this had just enough citrus flavor to balance it out. Overall better than your average East Coast IPA."
Had this one up at the brewery - a little place off the side of a highway in VT that is combined with a great pizza place. It was the perfect pizza beer. Hoppy and semi-dank with noticeable compliments from the maltiness of the beer. Wish that it had further distribution.
"Not sure if anything smells better than a fresh ipa or dipa. But anyway pours a dark orange. Smells very piny and tropical. Good mouthfeel, clean and fresh. No can date. But I'm pretty sure this is from the 12/31/15 canning. 4.25/5"
Cracked open a few of the 12/31/15 can release..
"Probably my favorite canned dipa. Love this beer, especially with a great slice of pizza. Lots of pine and citrus, much darker appearance than you would expect for a dipa.good amount of Dank piney notes will still being citrus and orange pith. Very crisp and easy drinking beer."
Birthday beer for me. 10/09/15. Into tulip. Your trip is short. 
"hazy orange in color. couple fingers of head, leaves some lacing. drinking it the day after it was canned so im especially pumped on this one! "
Review #233
Another great VT DIPA!
Very earthy and robust ipa. Nice flavors and excellent overall.
Look - A gorgeous golden honey color. New England haze. Looks great in the glass. 
"Not quite the hoppy sensation and smell of some other New England DIPA's, but still a well rounded, fantastic beer."
My first taste of the much hyped second fiddle. 
Pours a beautiful hazy golden orange color with a big foam head and frothy sticky lace that displays excellent retention. 
"Pours a hazy orangy Amber color. Has a funky citrus hop aroma. Flavor is nice. Notes of tropical fruit, citrus and a funky hop finish. Leaves a slight bitter citrus aftertaste. Overall very nice."
"Bready with a slight titanium and math algorithm, swedish fish, and other fish too. Mango and tropical fruit notes, and a treble clef. Come on, what is wrong with you people reviewing this beer. It is an awesome double IPA, what does a ""wet plant stem"" taste like? Dank???? Are you beer advocate reviewers going to Vermont and smoking weed???? Anything tastes great if you've been smoking weed. Cheetos and vanilla ice cream notes...."
"16 oz can poured into a snifter. Nice balance of pine and citrus flavors and the excellent, creamy mouthfeel you would expect from a Vermont DIPA. Worth seeking out!"
"Dark orange with crusty off white, clingy head. 4.25"
"Amazing. Just happened to luck out to a release when visiting the area. Heady Topper, Sip O Sunshine, and Second Fiddle all on the same trip. Ooooooo!"
"Oct 2015 can, opened Nov 2015"
A- Deep orange with fluffy white head
"Traded for this with a friend a few weeks back up at the Cloverleaf. Never had this before and never heard of Fiddlehead either, as none of their offerings are currently available in this neck of the woods. After enjoying this beer immensely, I can say that I'm the better for having it and at some point, would make the trek to Vermont to get more of this on my way to Hill Farmstead and Lawson's Finest. Amazingly, this beer was on par with those brewed by those big boys!"
Fiddlehead Brewing Company a newer company on the block here in Vermont seems to be pushing the brink on making outstanding AIPA's. Mediocrity doesn't show its face in this beer either.
"Love this beer fresh, beats heady and sip at the moment. Resiny juicy hops bursting out of this beer."
"The beer has a hazy dark orange color. The aroma is grassy and vegetal. The taste is creamy, grassy, vegetal, bubblegum, fruity, and has a clean finish. Tastes a lot like the IPAs from Tree House. Very good stuff"
This is easily on of my top 5 IPAs I have ever had. And I had it in a Blind taste test so no hype just amazing hoppy but balanced greatness. So smooth So balanced. Fantastic!
"Hazy orange beer with a sticky head. Really good nose, fresh flowers, cut grass, orange, pine apple. Taste is grapefruit, orange peel, lemon, grass, white peach, hay, somewhat tropical and a deep bitterness in the after taste. One of the better DIPA I've had."
16 ounce can poured into a snifter.
"Pours an absolutely beautiful hazy honey yellow. The nose is tons of citrus, some mandarin orange and lemon most notable. The first thing I notice on the first sip is just how amazing of a mouth feel this beer has. Up there as one of the best examples of a creamy mouth coating yet silky new england ipa. The taste begins with a blast of citrus, nice blend of orange and tangerines, before a nice wave of grapefruit and pine rush your taste buds for a long finish. The aftertaste leaves orange and grapefruit lingering. Quality beer."
L: Very nice looking beer; a nice hazy copper body with a full white head with a decent lacing.
"Got a 4 pack in a trade. Drank right out of the can, so right to aroma and taste. Aroma is of tropical fruit bubble gum. A fruit forward ipa with a nice balance of hops, malts, almost a creamy feel. Problem for me was the finish was a bit watery. Def good, but more hype than anything. For me, Sip of Sunshine blows this away in that style."
I absolutely love the feel. This IPA is not going for the 'cleanest'. But it is one of the creamiest IIPAs out there. Not malty. Just beautifully delicious.
"I tried this on tap at Siptemberfest, enjoyed chilled in a glass."
"Pours a clear orange with half finger head and lots of lacing. Aroma is sweet, crisp, biscuity malt with some caramelized tangerines. Nice balance between sticky sweetness and crisp bread notes. On the taste, that sweetness is balanced by garlic and herbal notes. Not very fruity, but I do get grapefruit pith mid palate. More bread and crisp malts. Mouth feel is medium. Sticky in some places. Crisp in others. This is a well crafted beer. I only wish it had more fruit."
"pours a nice orange/yellow color with a slight white head. This beer smells and tastes of fruity hops, oranges, slightly bitter, and has a nice lingering malty base. Overall a very nice IIPA."
A great display of a DIPA
One of the juiciest beers I've ever had. Got it 2 days after it was canned and is one of my favorite IPAs ever. Really impressive
"Stunning D/IPA action - ample fruits, pale and tropical, provide lotsa juiciness. Hops bring appropriate citrus and floral notes, with bittering becoming bolder with subsequent sips. Body is lean and taut, but with a hint of chew on the back-end. Ample carbonation is soft and plush. 8.2% abv hits just right. A real winner..."
"Straight pour from a 16oz can a constricted-top wineglass. This was canned nine days ago, according to the date stamped in black ink on the underside of the can (“9/4/2015 SHIP OF FOOLS”). It’s been kept in good conditions and chilled in the fridge for about 48 hours. "
Poured a pint can into tulip at 40 degrees... hazy brownish orange. Nose is subtle compared to other DIPA whales but pleasant citrus and dank orange dominate. Tastes as such. Grapefruit lingers after initial piney punch. Light carbonation makes it easy to drink despite its almost full body syrupy consistency... However I feel full after one. Excellent brew.... Can't say enough about it. Glad I have a few more. Yum!
It started out a little so so but as this high quality brew warmed it really got quite tasty. Vermont keeps kicking out great beers! I recommend this awesome tasting IIPA!
"L - 4.75 - Deep, dark hazy orange. I can see the resin from here! Beautiful fluffy head with lasting power."
Such a good beer!
"Pours a slightly hazy, light amber color with a whitish-tan head that leaves the slightest bit of lacing around the glass. "
"Had it side by side with Heady and SOS and I have to say this was my favorite of the three. Drank straight from the can . Lots of grapefruit, piney and citrus aromas. Lots going on in the taste grapefruit, mango, citrus, slight pine, minimal bitterness. Currently my favorite canned beer."
"Pour is mostly clear, light hop haze, darker orange amber in color with lots of white head, some large bubbles, long lasting retention and thick lace. Nose is a bit of sweet malt, caramel and lightly doughy, faint touch of clean grain, with a citrus/resin balance hop presence. Flavor is more sweet, biscuity malt, sweet caramel, grain mid palate, slightly metallic, back end is strong citrus, light resin than the nose, quite bitter and fairly high acidity, body is a bit fuller, assertive carb, bitterness takes away from the citrusy finish."
"The beer is a bright and fairly pale orangey amber color. Fairly hazy liquid. The head is off white and sudsy. Very good retention with some lacing. The aroma is peaches and grapes with tangerine and pineapple. Lots of sweet fruitiness. Mild pine in the background. Light caramel, pretty mild malt character. Taste follows the aroma. It’s quite low on bitterness for the abv and general hoppiness of the beer. Lots of sweet hop fruitiness. Probably a bit low on bitterness for my taste. Finishes mildly dry. Light and smooth feel. Solid DIPA."
"Tasted side by side with a Heady - my first introduction to the Vermont IPA style. Both we're delicious, but this took the cake. Amazing aromas. So much rich passionfruit, grapefruit, bitter and also juicy citrus. Also, tons of pot. Grassy and floral and dank. Balanced bitterness, great mouthfeel - you can taste the water that makes this beer. Loved it! Would seek it out to try again."
"One of my favorite dipas,almost better then Heady!"
16 ounce can sent to me by cavedave. 6/25/15 canning date. 
16oz can poured into a globe.
"Poured from a tall boy that was canned on 6/25/15 into a snifter. I had it the first time on 6/27/15, so my tasting now and recollection of how damn fresh it was then will be taken into account. "
Shockingly balanced. Very good with nice sweet flavor from malt and tropical fruit hops. Pineapple explodes on aroma and that's the primary flavor I get as well.
3 wk old can pored into a Teku glass
This is exceptional. Can't get enough.
"is there maple water or maple syrup in this beer? it's a nice IPA, but wow the hype train is crazy!"
"Exceptional beer. Burnt orange and hazy, this was darker than expected. However, the citrus hop profile keeps the darker (crystal?) malts in balance. Smell is awesome - some tropical fruit but I get somewhat bitter citrus, maybe tangelo. Taste follows and alcohol is well-hidden. Different from Heady or Sip - I would say it's the most fruit-forward of the top VT DIPAs."
"Smells fantastic. Taste is very nice as well. Piney, sticky, dank, a little sweet. The alcohol is very well hidden in this one as it's quite easy to drink. For a double not overly hoppy but very well balanced. Sturdy malt backbone to balance out the hops. This is very well conceived. I'd be a regular consumer if this was an option. Very nice."
"Very tasty brew. I had a friend in VT. She asked about Heady and was told they were sold out ( no surprise ) but they suggested Second Fiddle. They were dead on. Very similar, excellent - excellent flavor that seems to get better with each sip. I did get some Heady recently and while I'd still give Heady the nod its by a hair. A thin hair at that. This is a fantastic beer. If you're ever in VT make this a stop."
"Another fantastic offering out of VT. Drank this one in a blind test with Sip and Heady and chose this one by a land slide. Nice golden orange color. Fresh, ripened, fruit- peaches, grapefruit, tangerine in the nose. Has a nice bitterness to it up front until the citrus blast rolls in and dominates. Fantastic brew. The only negative comment I can make is with the packaging. The cans are paper thin aluminum and I have had a couple cans puncture on me."
"Solid, but not in upper echelon, IMO. Nice golden appearance with eggshell white head. Light danky hops, honey and candied fruit smell. Taste was similar and sweet. Nice bite from the hop. Overall, just solid."
"A: Cloudy, burnt orange, with a thin, foamy white head."
"Heady killer. As balanced as heady with one of the most pleasant noses I've had the pleasure of enjoying. It's been a little while since I've had fresh heady, but second fiddle is the clubhouse leader right now until I can get my hands on some."
"Great ipa, good earthy hops and a good hop bite"
"Drank fresh on day of canning. Great beer, very simliar to Heady Topper!"
I prefer their regular IPA
I changed my mind.
This is one of the best IPA'S available in a 16oz can. Very earthy hop bomb. Something about this one kicks my ass.Hahaha.
"Cloudy orange brew, topped by an off-white head of excellent size and fantastic retention, leaving behind copious amounts of lacing."
"The flavor and aroma has both citrus, earth, and almost the taste of dirt and grass. There are flashes of a great beer here and it is hopped to all hell for those who like that, for the sake of doing it. The balance of the hops isn't quite there, but its certainly enjoyable and has a wonderful smell of musk melon."
Better than Heady and SOS.
Poured from a can a month old into a tulip glass. Thanks to MakersNeat for the can.
Wish i had more is all u need to know!
"16oz can poured into a Fiddlehead stemmed glass, almost a teku but not. Enjoyed on May 14, 2015, reviewed from Tasting Journal. "
Not sure if I got a bad 4 pk or what but the smell was a little off to me and taste the same. Not quite chemical but almost like overpowering fresh grass clippings. Maybe that's how it's supposed to taste?
"In a wide-ranging night of IPAs, this one was fine and good, but not world-class, imo."
"On tap at Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock, VT. Served in their Snifter glass."
"A good beer, but doesn't stand up to so many of the other VT DIPAs."
Can: Poured a bright orangey color ale with a nice large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh floral hops notes nice citrusy notes and no bitterness. Taste is also dominated by fresh citrusy hops notes with limited bitterness and light residual sugar notes. Light fruity notes could also be detected. Body is pretty full with good carbonation. Very well brewed but lacking a little something to be placed among the great VT IPA.
Look: Deep golden color; cloudy and opaque. Big 2+ finger off-white head when poured; dies down slowly leaving an uneven layer of foam on the surface of the beer. Lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Near perfect!
"Pours cloudy with a good amount of carbonation. Tall head. Smells piney and peppery with citrus aroma. Taste is bitter bitter and hoppy. Not as much of the citrus shining through, but some orange. Bitter and dry aftertaste with the peppery malts and hops. Overall - well done and tasty. Pick it up if you can."
Great IPA ranks up the with Heady and Sip of Sunshine
New find at the American Craft Beer Fest in Boston. Quite delicious. Can' wait to try in greater quantities with a cleaner palate
Can picked up at Julios yesterday somehow... shared with Rudzud and kyle.
Thanks to JLindros for sharing.
"Drank on tap at Lord Hobo, Cambridge, MA"
The perfect IPA. I just revised my review up. Just had it again and it’s one of the best executed IPAs. I drink this beer at least several times a year and it just gets better. It holds up against any type of IPA. Perfect blend of NEIPA and West coast bitterness.
"Thought this one was great fresh, certainly one of my favorites"
Canned 5/14/15. A week old today. 
My new favorite DIPA! Perfection.
It the voice of Rock -The Second Fiddle has come back into my hands.. What a beer I must stay. Get it if you can.
Right there with Heady in my opinion
"Hands down, this is one of the best DIPAs Vermont has to offer. I can't say enough good things about it! I was lucky enough to obtain this in a trade."
Thanks to angrybabboon for four of these bad boys.
"Awesome brew! like a miniature Heady, just excellent."
Pounder can poured into snifter. The brew appears a hazy golden copper with a rich pillowy finger of head that is slightly off-white.
"Huge thank you to hoppypocket and tom1010101 for each sending me a can of this at the same time. One for now, one for an all star ipa showdown coming in the next week with the boys from work. "
"Pours very hazy bright yellow gold color with a massive 2 finger foamy off white head that was full of bubbles, dissipating very slowly, leaving excellent foamy lacing and rings as it went down."
"Hate me, but being a native Vermonter with so many good beers to choose from, I tend to go the ""Heady is overhyped"" route. In my opinion, Second Fiddle takes the trophy for one of the best VT DIPAs. Not overly bitter, but a tad citrusy with a thirst quenching quality, this one is right up my alley."
Just cracked this after a heady. Maybe it's just me but I might like this a little better. Big fruity smell and taste in this one. The mouthfeel is one of the best I've drank. Tons of hops with just the right amount of malt. This to me is one of the finest VT ipas out there. Well done!
Pineapple/melon hop notes with a balancing bitterness. Maybe some orange juice and guava as well. Big juicy hop bomb that is well balanced. Plenty of malt but it doesn't get in the way. Not overly sweet either. Well made DIPA.
"My buddy Mike picked this up last weekend as he bought every beer in VT and brought it back to MA (he paid no tax on his return....Dept of Rev....call me if you want his address). This was new to me and such a great surprise. Fantastic DIPA that was hazy, but had such a great florally taste with perfect hoppiness. I see comments saying it isn't Heady Topper....if that is the required bar, many will fail. This though was once again fantastic - you folks in VT are killing it."
Consumed 5/6/15; canned 4/24/15
very awesome IIPA.. love to try it back to back with HT. very east coast style
Thanks to @tom10101 for sending me this amazing dipa
Canned 4/08/2015. 
Too much haziness for style.
"I fear I got to this one too late, 3/10 canned date. I'm sure it's fantastic fresh, but just like their regular IPA there's a real steep drop off."
"Aromas of possibly every fruit cliche imaginable . . . Lovely nose to this beer. Feel is slick and smooth, just the right touch of carbonation. Taste is citrusy, piney, grassy and an ever so slight oniony finish. Bitterness doesn't last long and finishes clean. Second Fiddle reminds me more of Surly Abrasive, less of Fat Heads Hop Stalker and maybe a bit similar to Heady minus the oniony finish. Terrific beer."
"Compared to other northeast IPAs I feel as though Second Fiddle is more balanced. This is a very smooth brew, strong hop presence but not overtly bitter or piney. Just really tasty, not playing second fiddle to the big boys at all. Dark copper color, nice creamy, sticky looking head and retains well. Taste is delicious, finishes very strong."
What a great surprise! From the land of Heady Topper comes another wonderful DIPA. Very well balanced and perfect mouthfeel. The hop attack is somewhat muted but nearly perfect. Well done Fiddlehead.
Poured from a can dated 2/24/17 into the test glass
This is a fantastic beer . I'm interested to see how it holds up in a blind taste test against other world-class IPA's. Stay tuned.
Amazing zing a kick you in the ass hop flavor
"From can. Pours a darker bronze with solid head. Ok retention. Great lacing. Nice smell. Bitter hops, but not as assertive as I'd like. Taste picks up what the nose doesn't quite bring. Vibrant bitter hops. Some grapefruit and some peel. Nice and smooth. Very good beer and incredibly drinkable."
"Pours a clear, golden color with a large cloudy head with great retention and leaves tons of lacing. The nose and taste are both very hop forward with lots of citrus rinds, pine and some tropical fruit notes. there is a nice malt profile balancing all the hops, but it is in the background allowing the hops to be the star. The nouthfeel is smooth and round but with enough carbonation it keep it incredibly drinkable. Just a great example of the style!"
"Metallic. That's the word. There's a rogue metallic note that sneaks into both the nose and palate on this one. The nose is still quite good. Mixed with some green hop notes, wafts of pine, and a touch of tropical fruit, the metallic notes don't seem so dischordant, I guess. The palate is where it does the greatest damage. It combines with fairly strong carbonation levels to give a sharp, shrill punch to the brew. The actual flavor is hard to pin down, as it's not so much piney, certainly not tropical, and not quite earthy (though it hints at the latter). It's just too sharp is all I can say. Can't imagine how this one is held aloft with some of the better VT hop bombs."
"If this was the 1st NE style IPA I ever had I probably would rate it a little higher. It seems to be just a little off on the balanced/ backend side for me, compared to the other IPA's in its class.... But overall a great great brew that I would stock regularly if I had access to it!!"
"Next to Heady Topper this was the best beer I've ever had. Smells fantastic piney and orangey. Nice thick head and laced down the glass. Taste was a mouthful, I got citrus and pine notes and a smooth bitterness from it. It gives Heady a run for its money"
"A: Golden, slightly hazy. Large frothy white head"
I honestly think it's the best DIPA coming out of VT right now.
Thanks to Devman171 for sharing this one
Canned 3/20 consumed 3/27 from a snifter.
"Golden, burnt orange in color. Turbid. Delicious tropical fruit forward dipa. Minimal biscuit malt backbone. Grapefruit bitterness in the finish. Very dry finish. Lives up to the hype for the most part."
"Pours a hazy, dark orange color with great head and decent enough lacing. A bit more malty than I might like in a DIPA but that ""might"" be due to the fact that the cans I had were roughly 6 weeks old."
"Heady Topper is the baseline for VT DIPAs but… though they're similar, there's something about this that's unique and special. Piney and resiny. Huge hop taste, but less citrus. May be my new exemplar what for a VT DIPA is."
Double IPAs don't get better than this!
Pours a cloudy golden hue with blonde highlights. This is the only Fiddlehead DIPA that I have not had.
Great beer. Happy to have received this one on a trade!
"Great body on this beer, its a massive juicy DIPA. So smooth and exploding with great citrus hop bombs. very very balanced, its exploding with flavors yet the bitterness is just right to make it very very drinkable. Easily one of the better DIPAS i have had lately."
A nice DIPA but a little too malty for me and lacks interest-- plays second fiddle to a lot of other New England DIPAs!
"I am impressed with this beer. Not the top of my list but close. And that, my friends, is a good thing."
"From the can... this beer pours a fairly deep orange amber color with very good retention and considerable sticky lacing all around. On the nose, there is a lot of sweet tropical fruit, navel orange, and light pine. There's really a huge presence of sweet tropical fruit on the nose. The flavor profile isn't as intense, though it's still pretty pronounced. Also, while the DIPA IS a bit on the sweet side, there's more than enough hoppy bitterness to counter and balance that sweetness. The beer actually dries out pretty well on the finish, and finish is pretty clean and fairly bitter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a long, bitter finish. The beer definitely delivers plenty of flavor. Alcohol is pretty well integrated into the flavor profile. It was somewhat noticeable initially, but the beer seemed to open up a bit and smooth out some as it sat in the glass. "
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass.
"When this in a growler, this is great. None of this can crap."
"wonderful dipa. pine with a bitter malt backbone. heady,2nd fiddle,gandhi,julius,green"
"Can poured into a CBC teku. About a week old, so still good and fresh. Nice appearance, medium amber-orange in color, with an inch of healthy white head; good retention and lacing. Good aroma, thick with citrus and pine hops, notes of ethanol and a firm malt base. In the taste, oily hops that didn't quite come through as good as in the aroma, off-balanced by thick toffee malts, and a twinge of neutral alcohol. Not really a malt bomb, the hops were definitely there, but it was just a little too off-balanced, coming off pretty average for the style. Body was medium, mouthfeel was unctuous and a bit stiff with booze at first. Decent overall, but pretty basic stuff...kind of baffling that there's such a hype over this."
"The date on the bottom of the can says 1/21/15. Consumed on 2/5/15, making this one about 15 days old. That's pretty freaking fresh considering I got it as a surprise from a friend who's not much of a beer drinker who got it from a friend of his. . . ."
"Thanks to world-class, bat-shit-crazy Joe_Grizzly for sending me a wicked ton of good beers that hit my step on Tuesday with enough force to crack the concrete. 16 oz. tall-boy can dated 12/10/14 with something green on the label…I was looking for a stringed instrument, but this looks like someone’s acid trip. I like it. "
"16oz can, dated 1/21/2015. Served in a Lawson's snifter 2/3/2015. Thanks to Joe for these cans."
12/31 canning
"You have to try this beer, it's pretty near perfect. Clean flavor full"
Malty backbone with a smooth feel and some fruity tones. blah blah blah overall a great brew
"Can dated 12/31/2014 obtained as an extra from awesome BA, kingston2. Thanks Mike! "
Absolutely incredible beer. Stood out as the best DIPA amongst some solid competition. I've yet to come across a more enjoyable beer. Nearly perfect.
"Can shared by Lunch. Thanks Paul. The beer appears dark orange with an inch or so of white head. The aroma offers citrus, hops, pine. Plenty of malt backbone to support the hop character. Pine and resinous hops with notes of oranges and a touch of assorted tropical fruits. Also present is a subtle onion / earthy character - not terribly distracting, but sort of lurking there in the background. Medium bodied with a touch of sweetness. Overall, solid, but well behind the stiff VT competition."
"Many thanks to Steve, for providing the can!"
I had this after heady. I personally like this better than heady. It is just like heady but smooth and had a better feel to it. I would still prefer pure hoppiness over this
"I was over at The Fridge yesterday to mark the occasion of my 5,000th unique check-in on Untappd when co-owner Futty asked me if I had CANsumed this one and if not, whether I would like one in furtherance of The CANQuest (TM). Mais oui! The date on the bottom reads: ""12/31/2014"" meaning that it is EXTREMELY fresh and as such, he made me promise to move it to the head of the line, rather than leaving it in the queue. Avec plaisir!"
This is the best fiddlehead beer to date. Smells and tastes fantastic.
I felt it was to light of a flavor with not enough impact to the pallet
Wow!!! One of the best dipas I've had!
A--Nice orange/yellow color with about a one inch head. Looks delicious
Amazing beer. Nose is dank and tastes backs it right up. Find this. Drink it fresh.
"Citrus, grapefruit, orange peel, great mouthfeel, smooth, a bit of a hop bite but not at all bitter. So well balanced and drinkable, the alcohol is just so well hidden. A supremely made DIPA and one of the best i've had. I could drink this nightly and not get tired of it or too filled up. Hop lovers delight!"
Can shared by Curran tonight.
Aroma: strong citrus and floral hop notes some pine. Overpowers any malt (in a good way).
"A smoother HT, great hops and well hidden abv"
A-	Great copper color with enough haze that you can’t see through the glass. Nice three finger chunky off white head that recedes in a minute. Small specs of lacing are left stuck around the glass. 
A pour from a can produced a hazy orange liquid with a nice white foam that produced modest lacing. Bit-o-citrus in the nose but not incredibly pungent. The flavor made me smile: a bowl of citrus laced with subtle pine. Perfect. Did not pick up on any dank hop character as I did in the Mastermind and IPAs. Low bitterness on the back end with a light touch of malt. 
"Pours a gorgeous, completely hazy orange body with thick foam though minimal lacing. Aroma is bursting with Vitamin C, flavor is pulpy and fleshy orange. Bitterness is suprisingly restrained."
"From the one pint can dated 12/23/2014. So darn fresh on January 1, 2015."
"i really really enjoyed this one. great color, smell, and taste, with very little alcohol taste. everything you ever wanted in a DIPA!"
Sensational.. Creamy hops.. Wonderful balance.. Incredible in EVERY way!
"Cloudy and dull appearance. Good nose, fruit and citrus with subtle pine. Decent flavor with a strong boozy taste with a subtle soap finish."
"A: Pours a semi clear amber, nice white head and really good lacing"
Poured from a can into a tulip
"Received a can as a gift from a friend. Excellent DIPA. Poured into large tulip. Almost clear reddish yellow with one finger of pure white head that leaves a small trace. Aroma is spicy, floral, slightly resinous. Taste has some citrus combined with flowers, resin and lots of freshly picked sin semilla. Feel is just about perfect...slightly dry and appropriately carbonated. Overall, another awesome DIPA from Fiddlehead."
Best beer ever. Most balanced ipa created. Heady was the best until this beer. Unbelievable nose taste will stay with you for hours. Love it
The best DIPA I've ever had.
Canned 08/07/14
The beer comes in a reddish amber.
"Fresh can 3 hours old. Staring dinner and poured just now. Beautiful color, head fades fast but leaves great legs on the glass. Glad I got two cases. "
On tap in Waterbury the night after an Alchemist truck sale. There was a free keg. 
On tap at the brewery. Served in a taster.
can gifted from a friend who was visiting family in vt. dated 8/7/14 so bear that in mind (pushing 4 months old)...enjoyed from a bt willi
Poured from the growler into a tulip.
"Premium greatness in a can. Even better over time, as well. The only thing I don't like is the can itself. It's kind of boring compared to the IN YOUR FACE beer held inside. Other FIddlehead cans visually bring it and I know this one can too!"
"16 oz. gifted from Dr. T. Kanhsil in late 8/14, canned on 07/10/14, poured into my Gandhi-Bot snifter glass and drank over an hour"
Can poured into a pilsner glass
Poured into Tired Hands taster.
"Bright orange, small head fades fast, laces really well down the glass. Largely citrus aroma of grapefruit, orange, and citrus pith. Taste follows through with pleasant grapefruit and citrus dominant flavor. Touch of doughy malt and caramel keep bitterness in check and bring great balance. No sign of the ABV. Medium body, creamy on the palate and a pleasantly dry finish round out a nearly perfect mouthfeel. Overall a top tier DIPA that brings big citrus flavors and great balance to the hop experience."
"Look: hazy dull orange, Big head"
"Really good Double IPA. Similar to Heady Topper in a lot of ways, some argue its tasting better...."
"A few of us had a blind taste test against heady topper, which we all love, and second fiddle was the unanimous winner! WOW"
"i never tire of these vermont ipas, each one always better and fresher than the next. this one is a bright honey color with a tall and lasting head snow white and persistent. the nose here is just great, citra hops and something else in the C family, maybe centennial, it has that woody bitey bitter undertone behind the citrusy fruity hops on top. i like the layering of the hops here, and find the beer beautifully balanced, not with grain but between bittering hops and late kettle and dry hopping characteristics, well scheduled. i also find it scary drinkable at over 8% abv, it drinks more like 6%, with no trace of alcohol in aroma or flavor. the body get just a little sticky for me, a tiny bit filling, but the flavor is so good and fresh it keeps me sipping quickly. i was extremely impressed with everything fiddlehead had going on my recent vermont trip, just blown away how far they have come in a year."
"Can from the brewery shared by MrBarleywine, thanks for the hookup Mike!"
Poured on tap at the brewery into a tulip Fiddlehead glass.
Second Fiddle has done to Double Sunshine what Double Sunshine had done to Heady Topper.
Appearance - Pours hazy bright orange. Full color. With slight foamy white head. 
Very very very very similar to gandhi bot.....multiple samples would be needed to differentiate the two in a blind taste test. Edge Bot!
Sampled at Vermont Brewfest.
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, canned on 7/10/14. Pours a murky orange with a two inch white head that leaves behind amazing lace."
"Had this in Burlington, VT. Went looking for cans of Heady Topper (a fool's errand) and ended up with two four-packs of this bad boy. Not a bad consolation prize!"
Poured from a 16oz can (canned on date: 5/19/14) into an oversized balloon/tulip glass
"Always considered it in the same class as another VT double not to be named here. Kind of sad to see it go mainstream but alas, it needed to be shared with the world and so it is. Get a can or three or better yet, get to the brewery, hope they are pouring it, and get a growler and some world class pie next door. VT life at its finest."
Cheers to markgugs for this one!
"Fourth and final can of this beer, for now. Dated 5/19/2014."
"Nice aroma, solid hop profile but leaning toward pine rather than juicy. Way too sweet. Almost sticky. No idea why anyone calls this a Heady killer..."
16oz can picked up in Vermont during beer madness last weekend. Date on bottom reads 5/19/14.
"16oz. can courtesy of Ineedabeerhere (thanks Joe!). Served in a tulip nonic. Pours a translucent copper with a tight, quarter inch, bright white head that eventually settles into an oily slick. Some spatters of lacing are present during the tasting. Nose expresses, citrus, piney and flora aromas, with some earthiness towards the back. Taste follows nose; however, the citrus notes are bit less present and the earthy/herbal character is more present in the foreground (I thinking I'm getting Simcoe here). Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Another solid VT DIPA in cans. I tend to gravitate towards the more citrusy end of the spectrum; however, this beer is quite solid. I'd buy this on a regular basis if it was locally available."
Tasted 4/25/14:
"Served from the tap at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT. To put it simply, this is definitely a top echelon IIPA that deserves to be ranked with the the likes of Double Sunshine and Heady Topper."
Was lucky enough to grab a growler of this fine brew. 
This VT crafted DIPA is fantastic and I for one honestly don't see why this underrated on BA. Pours an opaque glowing honey tangerine that just makes me think of a fantastic VT DIPA. My first impression of the smell is straight citra hops with simcoe in the background. Citrusy grapefruit and tangerine jump out and are followed by a nice piney resiny backdrop. Taste is just as the smell would indicate- citrusy grapefruit and tangerine up front (Citra) followed by a piney resinous harmony (Simcoe) that makes this brew sit on my tongue in the most pleasant of ways. I honestly don't pick up on much malt at all which I love and it makes the wonderful hop profile stand out all the more. Even with the lack of a malty backbone this beer is not overpoweringly bitter in the least and I must tip my hat to fiddlehead on this one. Truly a hop forward beer and one that I believe should be getting more praise and by no means plays a second fiddle to any DIPA in the area. Strongly reccomended!!!
"Let me preface by saying that I was very excited to get a chance to try this at the brewery. I am very much a fan of Fiddlehead and think they are the premier under the radar brewery in Vermont right now. And, being a big fan of their last DIPA, Mastermind, I thought I'd love this as well."
Wow!!! This is spectacular stuff. Picked up a 4-pack at the brewery. Packaged on 12/18 so it's only a few days old. Beautiful golden-copper color with a fluffy white head. What really shines with this beer is how pleasantly fruity and slighty sweet the hops are. Incredible flavor lingers on the palate without being cloying. I'm very happy there are three more cans to enjoy.
As a stand alone this beer was solid but sometimes you just have to blend you own beers and these Curiosity Fourty Four really enhanced the beers they were mixed with.
Thanks to JLindros for sharing this can.
"Canned 1/12/18, thanks to rudzud"
Canned 1/12/18; drank 2/21/18 @ the Yarchives. 
Really tasty as with most treehouse. Pours golden with light lacing. Aroma tangerine and dank. Taste follows the nose with citrus. Big fan of treehouse.
Fantastic hop combo that perfectly balances dank and citrus. This is my 3rd favorite of the curiosity series and a top 10 treehouse ipa. Thrilled I had a chance to try it
"This was the best Curiosity I've tried from Tree House. Sadly, I only had one can to try."
"Canned on 1/24/18, Enjoyed 2/4/18. Acquired in a trade for some fresh OH cans."
L: pours clear yellow with a finger of white head
"Wow I thought this was just great!! Not always a huge fan of galaxy and amarillo hops, but the extra dosing of citra really carries this beer over the finish line! Very juicy and wonderful!"
"How fortuitous to pick this up the eve of my VT ski weekend! Too bad the conditions were icy as shit. Oh well, at least I had good beer!"
"absolutely beautiful looking beer, dope can as well. pours out a hazed golden orange color, finger and a half of bright white head is dense and creamy and decorates the glass nicely. this one is hugely aromatic, while pouring im picking up pulpy OJ and grapefruit juice notes, shoving my nose in the glass there is a good amount of bubblegum, sweet bready malts, some danky green character, minty herbaceous notes. on palate is creamy tangerine orange, peaches, grapefruit peel, spicy pineapple, mango, guava, melon, soft bready malts and that sweet bubblegum pop. subtle smack of pine and grapefruity bitterness on the finish keeps it balanced and rounded. mouthfeel is oh so soft, goes down really smooth and no hint of booze. this is a masterpiece in my book!"
First
"L: amber gold with a light haze under a 1.5"" white blanket of foam"
"A: The beer is quite hazy yellow in color—too hazy to see if there is any visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that quickly settled down, leaving a narrow collar around the edge of the glass and some lacing down the sides."
"Between MN distribution & a good trading partner, I’m rapidly becoming a huge Pipeworks fan. This is the latest 22 oz. bomber to show up in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Split with my wife. "
Pours a slight hazed golden color with a white head. Smell had citrus and mango. Taste was fruity with alot of mango the honey muted the mango puree is a good way very tasty. Slight bitter mouth feel with a pine like feel had and orange and mango finish.
"White head. Lace. Golden orange color. Clear, not hazy. "
"Pours an almost clear only slightly hazy amber/orange with a huge pillow of white head that sticks around and leaves fabulous lacing. Aroma is sweet ripe tropical fruits. Flavor is honey and fruit, no bitterness to speak of. Feel is thick for the style with a medium amount of carbonation. Overall a nice beer that (IMO) needs a little more bitterness in the finish to offset the sweetness of this beer."
"Features honey and mango puree, and Citra and Mosaic hops..."
"It's funny to me that this is one of Pipeworks' highest rated beers, while their stouts haven't made top 250 - funny how the world spins."
Pours an effervescent honey color with a thumb+of eggshell colored head. Great lacing & head retention
Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Teku.
Lots of honey. Alcohol is hidden but I can feel it after half the bottle which I like. Worth getting and will buy again.
A-a clear light orange with three fingers worth of white head
On the nose and taste I get mango and grass. Finish is funky
Bomber bottled recently in past couple weeks but no date available.
Released 6/8/18; drank 6/15/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"2018 bomber poured into a PW Willi. Pretty dark in color and super clear/filtered. White head develops and sticks for a moment. Sticky lacing as I move the glass around. Not much aroma going on to be honest. Flavor is disappointing. No honey or mango at all. Pretty standard imperial Ipa. Feel is sticky and medium bodied. Overall, this is disappointing. Literally got none of the flavors advertised."
"650ml bottle, purchased fresh, poured into a Pipeworks Ninja teku glass. Enjoyed on 8.3.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
On tap at Beer Temple
"Love their beers, they play more on rhe malt side of things but definitely in balance. Wish i had more than one to sample. A bit dry in the back end and floral/fruity on the nose."
"A - Pours a bright opaque orange with a 1/4"" white head."
Appearance - The beer poured a murky orange-yellow color with white bubbles crown and glass. 
Straw color with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with a fruit accent. Taste is also hoppy with a fruit accent. This was not as flavorful as expected
Look is a hazy grapefruit/orange color with 1.5 fingers white head.
Currently #175 in the Top 250 beers list and #5 in the Top Illinois state beers list.
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pint 6 fl oz bottle on August 2, 2017."
"This beer looks incredible and smells even better. Nice bright yellow with great lacing. So much mango, sweet honey, and tropical notes of pineapple and other fruits. Taste definitely comes through on the honey with the mango taking the back seat. As an imperial IPA, this is super well-balanced with the sweet masking the bitterness of the hops. Definitely one of Pipeworks best."
L: Pours nice golden hue with lacing that sticks around for majority of beer
"Poured from the bottle into a taster. Sweet, with detectable honey. A big DIPA - resinous hops, didn't pick up a ton of mango. A bit too sweet for my taste."
"I'd heard great things, but ultimately felt a little let down with Sure Bet. It is decently hoppy, but came across a bit too sweet for my taste. Still a pretty solid brew, but I've had much better Pipeworks."
I've been wanting to try this since I had my first bomber of NvU which began my pipeworks obsession. Finally able to get it on draft. 
"What is there to say that hasn't already been said about Sure Bet. This beer is one of Pipework's best offerings, and the latest batch is once again on the mark. A big, dank hop aroma pours out of the glass, and the taste of mango and honey are very well balanced against the bitterness of the hops. Feels great to the palette, well balanced carbonation and not too sticky. As others have said, very similar to the Fish Series of DIPAs from Pipeworks, and I wouldn't be surprised if the (formerly) puking unicorn grows fins in the future. An excellent offering that is well worth its rating."
Pours a bright effervescent orange color with a nice white head. Head dissipates leaving a thin white film on the beer and a ring of white head along the outside of the beer. Tons of sticky lacing on the glass. 
"Been a while since this one was released. Although technically not a fish brew series, it is hard to not compare. I'd say not quite up to par with Spotted Puffer or Emerald Grouper, but Sure Bet easily holds it's own. I was expecting a bit more mango, but not a bad thing what I tasted, which was a tropical fruit bomb. Beer is wonderfully balanced, the fruit and honey offset the bittnerness perfectly. The boys at Pdubs really know how to brew kick ass imperial IPA's!"
"Like most Pipeworks DIPA, a fun try but nothing I'd seek out again. One of the least boozy tasting of those I've tried, and it smells lovely, but the mango comes across as a bit gimmicky in the taste."
Many thanks to Blue-dream for the opportunity to try this beauty.
A: Amber to orange. Light khaki head. Clear in app
"Easily one of the best IPA's I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. The honey and mango is subtle, but it adds just a hint of sweetness that really separates this one from other beers. It absolutely deserves its high rating here. I will have to trade for this one again"
Too sweet
"I really enjoyed this brew, Square Grouper is a little better but not much. I definitely recommend trying one of these. Super full of flavor that does not disappoint."
"Look - A super hazed, honey type color. Resembles mango/peach juice in the glass. Awesome looking stuff."
22 ounce bomber poured into a snifter.
"This is outstanding. Most definitely one of Pipeworks' very best DIPAs, in an area that they make plenty of different offerings. Looks amazing, a hazy tangerine with a delightful foamy head. Orange juice on the eyes and the nose. Big ripe mango from top to bottom. The mango and sweet balance of honey really plays well with the tropical and resiny hops. Leaves a satisfying warm aftertaste, with a medium body just adding to the juice factor. Top notch."
"Spiegelau IPA glass. Poured a cloudy, murky, orange with two fingers of off white head. Aroma smells of mango of course, with other citrus fruits and slight sweetness in the background. Taste is huge hops with mango being front and center. Honey sweetness with malt and slight bitterness following. Overall? Damn I want another. That is what I think of when I think of an IPA. It's a delicious start to the weekend."
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, two finger white head, fades in a couple of minutes to a thin ring, coats the glass. Juicy citrus aroma jumps from the glass. The taste full of big orange juiciness, near perfect level of sweetness. Grapefruit and orange peel hop flavor carries through and finishes with a touch of piney resin. Full soft mouthfeel with dry finish. Overall outstanding IPA, one of my favorite by Pipeworks. Sooooo juicy, wanna just pound it, but that would be a mistake."
"Not their best, but another solid DIPA offering from Pipeworks. Reminds me of some Three Floyds bombers. Starts out juicy, then finishes with a strong, hoppy bite."
"Looks fantastic - hazy orange with a 2 finger white head. Tastes just like it smells - mango, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, hops, pretty boozy. Finishes a little bitter, spicy. Pipeworks doesn't miss with their IPA's."
"L - foggy copper orange, nice head, beautiful lacing"
"looks and smells terrific with mango and the citra and mosaic hops very profound. initial hit to the palate is what you smell, but it finishes a bit too bitter for my liking. i would have been good splitting this bomber and enjoyed it more due to sweetness and bitter finish. still a great brew, but it's not at the top of my pdubs list."
22oz
"Hazy orange pour with two fingers of dense white head. Good lacing down the glass. Quite simply, the aroma is incredible. The mango unquestionably hits you first, I smelled it the second I started pouring. With that you get the citrus and tropical smells you expect from citra/mosaic. On the taste, it reverses, the hops take charge with plenty of citrus and juiciness. The honey and mango add a sweetness and balance out the hop character. Mouthfeel is a smooth medium-full body with medium carbonation. There is a lingering bitterness of the back of the tongue. I have to say, this is my favorite Pipeworks, which is an impressive feat!"
looks amazing.. one of the most hazy beer I have seen
Pours a turbid orange color with a finger of an off-white head. Looks like mango juice and something that would come out of the New England area.
"22oz bomber poured into a snifter, no batch or bottled date unfortunately with the new PW bottling. "
Simply amazing. Possibly my favorite DIPA... This one is a sure bet to be sold out if I'm at the store before you.
So freakin delicious
Poured into whatever IPA glass I have available (I hope I can get a Pipeworks drinking device real soon btw)
"The scent is pretty basic. Sugar, mango, resin and citrus. The honey becomes much more apparent in the taste with an initial rush of sweetness along with the mango and sugar followed by bitter resin, dank hops, dry leaves and a prolonged flavor of more honey. It has a viscous body and mild carbonation that works very well."
"s-mango and booze, most pipeworks big ipa's are boozy. the mango and booze are fighting for a top spot in this one."
"Looks very opaque and cloudy with slight head but wicked lacing on glass. Aroma is definetaly tropical fruit with mango (duh) and bit of dank citrus. Taste follows with that mango fruit (but not as much as I thought I'd pick out) and an earthy floral dankness. There is also a very pleasant peppery spice in the finish, probably from the Mosiac hops...but I like it! "
Reviewed from notes.
Not sure when this was bottled but I poured into a tulip glass and got almost no head and minimal lacing. 
"Pours bright yellow-orange with big pillowy head and lots of sediment. Smell is very tropical and sweet, light citrus, and mild melon notes. Taste is loaded with sweet citus, bold mango, and sweet tropical fruit. Body is light and dangerous at 9.5% abv. This is definitely a different DIPA that is light and sweeter than your average high gravity brew. Very tasty and worth a try."
Looks like OJ...hoppy aroma and nice smooth citrus and fruit palate! Great stuff!
"Pours a hazy golden orange. Nice white foamy head about an inch and a half on an aggressive pour. Smell has a lot of citrus notes with notes of Mango, lemon, pinepapple, and grapefruit. Taste follows suit, nice mango sweetness upfront with a nice tart lemon and grapefruit taste that follows. Finish is a subtle hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and juicy. Overall this is an outstanding beer. Juicy and balanced. Pipeworks is a force to be reckoned with."
"I loved the murky, opaque pour of this beer. Nose was incredible, as tropical and citrusy as most of the best DIPAs are. Mango flavor is on point, I just couldn't get over the very peppery and spicy finish. Has to come from the rye malt but it almost ruins this beer for me."
Surprised at how much I enjoyed this beer. Damn good.
Lots of fruit and tropical notes in this one. Also very opaque with lots of sediment. The beer tastes better than a 4 but the appearance lowers my overall score
"Perhaps I just don't get it. That's possible. But this pours viscous, not just hazy but dull, little head retention or leaving. It's opaque and ugly. Yes, kinda like mango juice ... But we're adults and this is beer, right? No accomplishment in just dumping a bunch of puree in your beer. Aroma is hot, a lot of alcohol. Flavor is hot as well, but the mango comes in along with a very peppery bite. The nuances of the hops are lost. The feeling is heavy, thick, almost chewy. It's good but seems really unrefined. Tired Hands Mago Tago does a similar thing with a great deal more finesse."
"Pours a thick clouded orange color with a thick foamy head. Smells like mangoes and citrus. Taste is mangoes with a finish of Grapefruit. Mouthful is thick and creamy, with low level of carbonation. "
"Looks like Mango juice when poured except for the nice head on this beer. Smells of Mango, hops and papaya. Taste is just like it smells with a sweet smooth taste up front followed by a well balanced hop bitterness finish. Medium mouthfeel and leaves you wanting for more."
"It looks pretty crappy, but that's where the gripes end. It's a murky goldish brown with little head or retention. "
Poured into 12oz snifter.
this beer is great. cant see through it at all. Great Mango flavor.. a little back end booze but not much..
"Square grouper is my favorite pipeworks beer so I was super excited to try this version. Sure bet fell flat in comparison. The addition of mango makes it too acidic. Still good, but Square Grouper was mind blowing."
bomber bottle poured into HF wine stem.
"This is an amazing beer. Cloudy hazy orange colored pour. Nice head. The aroma is off the charts, the mango! Taste is incredible, similar to grouper with a hint of mango. Mango isn't as strong on the taste as the aroma. Overall one of the best IPA's I've ever tasted."
Big Thanks to @Kevinpitts for this beauty!!!
"Honestly, quite a bit better than I would have expected, given the age. The mango is still quite prominent in the aroma and to a lesser extent in the flavor, although there one gets the sense that it is just barely covering up old, oxidized hops."
taste like Divided Sky from 4Hands
Back to back to a crimson snapper and its just a much more bland puree beer. Slightly disappointed
"Hazy unfiltered appearance. Plenty of Mango/Orange on the aroma along with other citrus fruits. Taste follows the nose with huge mango with some sweetness towards the middle. Thankfully the hops also lend some lingering bitterness on the finish. On the meaty side as far as IPAs go, which I like."
Loved it...one of best beers ever
"Mango is overpowered by the hop bitterness. Pretty good but I think Square Grouper was actually better, the mango doesn't add much to this beer, just adds a slight mango smell/taste which is then overshadowed by the rest of the beer."
"22 ounce bottle, batch #573-574 into a snifter, some into a teku glass."
"Haven't had Spotted Puffer, but this is my second favorite beer in the Square Grouper ""tree."" Mangoes give it a nice creamy flavor that works well with the malt. You still get plenty of tropical flavor as well. This stuff goes fast for a reason."
This beer is a hazy grapefruit mango brew that is the best IIPA by Pipeworks. I love the hazy IIPAs and this beer does not dissapoint
"Serving: 22 oz. bomber poured into a tulip. This is batch 573 bottled 11/30/14, making this just over 2 weeks old. "
"Pretty good, similar to Square Grouper but with a bit of that ripe mango sourness."
"Pours a beautiful mango orange, hazy, and a frothy two finger head of foam."
Just great. Perfect amount of hops and mango. A bit bitter but in a good way. Not overly sweet Def top 5 Pipeworks ever. Maybe top 3!
"Perfect appearance, and slamming smell of citrus. Taste is a pow of fruit and hops. I would give this a perfect 5 but however there is a long delay and then leaving me a bitter finish. If it weren't for the bitter in the end this is a perfect double IPA. Still pretty awesome and a must have!!!"
Look: Hazy orange with a thick white head. Looks like mango juice. Great looking beer.
First review written.
"22 oz. bottle, with Batch #573 - 574 printed on the label. The latest DIPA creation from the masters at Pipeworks; expectations are ridiculous for this one considering it's current high ratings. "
"This is one amazing beer, but I must say I am quite bias of Pipeworks."
"Murky and opaque, dark orange with a swampy brown tint. Several fingers width of creamy foam, white with a dripping crown of lace ringing the glass."
Great IPA. Nice sweet hoppy flavor. Delicious.
"Simply put, this beer is amazing. If you dig beermosas, this is it. So much mango it even looks like juice. This stands up to any iipa out there and one of the truly great brews ive had in a very long time. Kudos to Pipeworks, they kill it once again."
"In line with what I gave two somewhat similar and similarly phenomenal DIPAs, I'm gonna say that this is the Pipeworks DIPA to beat. Hopefully this or some other variation of Square Grouper becomes part of their rotation. Definitely world class."
"Wow! These guys have done it again. If you enjoyed Square Grouper, you'll love this one, as good if not better!"
"My favorite from Monkish, after 40+ beers from them tried."
"Wow, best hazy triple ipa i have ever had. So flavorful with the galaxy presenting a tropical fruit cocktail juice bomb. Mouthfeel is so creamy and delicious no bitterness at all and well hidden alcohol taste at 10%abv crazy. I know its super limited if your lucky enough to have tried this consider yourself fortunate. Glad i got 6 cans to go."
A 16 fl. oz. can with no canned on or best before date. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.
Well if that ain't something!
"Slightly hazy golden color with off-white head. Aroma has herbal hop notes, orange rind and a light astringent fermented fruit note. Taste has oranges, tea notes, leafy hops, medium herbal bitterness on the aftertaste. Medium minus body and carbonation."
"Pours a fairly clear orange, with soft, thick foam."
L - 1/2 finger fleeting offwhite head atop a translucent orange body.
"L - pours a startlingly clear amber orange! What happened to the swamp water NEIPA?! Big fluffy head that leaves behind craters of giant bubbles and inconsistent, sticky lacing. "
"A- hazy gold, half inch white head"
Pours dark orange and haze. Aroma is straight up orange juice and feels so creamy. This is all Mosaic all the time. Loved the taste and aroma. Really nicely balanced without being overly potent on the orange notes.
"Appearance: With a nice bubble show, the head builds to two fingers above the hazy honey colored liquid; nice stickage and a patches of lacing"
It is like a hoppy dole fruit cup. Very balanced. Extremely drinkable with NO alcohol taste what so ever. I just wish it was a tad more hazy looking but all in all a perfect beer!
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery.
"Medium gold with a slight haze, tall foam head left lace sheeting down the glass... Aromas of fruits, berries, tropical, and the like, plus some pine, adding something slightly herbal to the nose... Flavors of the same - fruity with a bit of pine... Medium-light feel, smooth, soft, ample carbonation... A nice vehicle for the Mosaic hop..."
"Pours a hazy medium orange color with a well retained half inch head that left lacing all the way down the glass. Smells like tropical fruit juice. Tastes of pineapple, mango, sweet citrus, papaya and sweet malts in the background. Mouth feel is medium bodied and on the dry side, finishes with a lingering moderate bitterness, moderate carbonation. Overall an excellent beer."
16 oz. can in trade from DAN THE MAN. Poured into Belgian ale glass.
L: Hazy apricot and honeycomb hues with a generous white foamy head
Nice cloudy yellowish orange color on the pour with a 1 inch head. Smells of mango and pineapple. Taste is a pineapple bomb with a lingering bitter finish. Flaked oats give this a nice thick mouthfeel. A fantastic single hop beer.
"Got a can of this. Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a golden orange with a slight haze. Aroma is off the charts: earthy, orange, apricot. Mouth watering. Taste follows through with hints of papaya and mango as well. Mouthfeel is medium plus with a surprisingly dry finish. I don't know what these guys are doing but this beer is phenomenal. Keep it up Sand City!"
From a growler poured into a tulip glass...
One of the strongest all-mosaic beers I've yet to consume. Huge candied stone fruit up front that finishes with notes of herbal tea. Medium-plus mouthfeel; very slick and oily with a medium-dry finish. Look out for Sand City - this brew is phenomenal.
Fresh can poured into a flute.
"I love Mosaic hops and the funkiness that they bring. Great taste, super smooth,this is one of the smoothest beers I have ever had. Another excellent beer by Sand City."
"From the can released not even a week ago, pours hazy yellow gold color with a thick creamy looking off white 2 finger thick head which was packed with tiny bubbles. The head did not budge for a while and dissipated very slowly, leaving outstanding thick foamy lacing and a layer on top that looks like clouds from an airplane. The lacing was so thick it stuck to the sides where I could run my fingers through the foam and make a smiley face. It also left thick rings to round out the perfect DIPA appearance."
The beer comes in a deep gold color to amber with medium haze.
"Funny, I've had the regular Mofo 10+ times and while great, I always found it too hop slick with the Mosaic just a bit too aggressive. This, though, is maybe the most perfectly balanced mosaic brew I've had. "
"The single most exciting showcase of the Mosaic hop I've had to date. No malty flavors, just wave after wave of the full-on, middle-of-the-road and the most subtle flavor characteristics of Mosaic. This beer is absolutely unreal, incredibly delicious and complex. The best SC offering to date."
"before I even get into this review I will openly admit that I suffer from homerism...after all being from a beer wasteland like long island where GABF gold medals don't seem to translate as well from the local taps as they do in a festival where ppl consume 900 beers in a 4 hr session, it is exciting to have a brewery making beer that's worth talking about (and hunting down). sand city is what we have been waiting for."
Appearance - Pours opaque orange with thick soapy white head that lasts forever. Light spotty lacing.
"By far one of my favorite hazy IPA's from Trill. I feel like i say that every time i try a new one. This one is a beautiful yellow amberish hue with tons of haze. It has an amazing aroma coming from the dry hopping and hops combo which they killed. Citrusy, dank, notes of mango, grapefruit, subtle sweetness but also malty enough to balance great with the hops creating an almost perfect mouthfeel. Love you Trillium!"
"Bright, tropical gold appearance with a creamy, thick toothpaste head."
Tall can 11/29/17...about a month in the can
L - murky brownish orange with a floofy head that quickly and loudly dissipates. Pop Rocks. 
Thanks to JLindros for hooking me up with a can. Like him I just haven't come across this beer somehow.
"SOmehow eluded me all these years, this one canned Setp 28th"
Thanks goes out to TheManiacalOne for this brew.
Cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a mild citrus. Taste is also a mild citrus without any hoppyness that is a little thin.
"I was lucky enough to have gotten an entire four pack from my friend John's trip up to the NE. It looks cloudy and yellow, and smells of floral hops. The flavor is more balanced than other trilliums I've had. It's fruity, bitter, almost sweet, and has a medium lasting bitterness on the end. Nit-picking, it's not my favorite trillium, but still far better than most other brews."
Canned 7 days ago. 
Can dated 3/29/17. Poured into Behind the Veil Teku glass.
"L - hazy orange, head of large bubbles fades quickly"
A nice brew.
Pounder Can > Snifter
16oz can poured into a teku
Churchkey during CBC 2017.
Look: Hazy pale gold. With a thin white head. Mild activity. 
Cloudy like all Trillium unfiltered beers. The color is dirty gold. Modest head which settles to the finest film of bubbles. There's a few spots for lace. 
"Pale golden, thin head, and very small lacing. Aromas of intense grapefruit and dank resin. Notes of grapefruit pulp, citrus peel, stonefruit and pine. Medium, feels thinner than you'd expect, dry and crushable. It's good but it's lacking depth and it's an ugly beer."
"This is super dry on the finish, reminds me of a reisling."
"This is one of the better beers ive had. I had the privilege of enjoying this from a large can ""crowler"". Amazing flavor taste and believe it to be actually better than the phenomenal reviews this beer possesses."
"I was told this is the closest hop profile to Headroom which I have yet to try. If this holds true, Headroom is bound to be incredible. Galaxy+Mosaic is always a winner but the additional hops here add a higher complexity to the flavor which I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Good double IPA, more bitterness than I expected from a Trillium DIPA. I was not disappointed with its taste, but did not have the smell/aroma I was looking for. "
"Look: .75 in head, Dark yellow to orange in color "
Had this at the tap takeover at Rare Barrel as part of SFBW. Well ran. 
"Poured from a can, canned on 02/07/17. Poured 03/09/17"
"Fruity, light bodied, hazy double IPA. Not sap or resin."
Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 2/7/17.
"Canned 02/07/17, so two weeks ago."
One of the first brews that I was lucky enough to get from Trillium. They hoppy beers are all very legit and this imperial is by no means an exception.
drank 11-03-16...canned the week before. awesome!
Nice golden color. The mouth feel is nice and smooth and crisp. Carbonation is moderate. Orange color coming through on this. Very crisp and smooth.
"16 oz can. Hazy orange pour, thin white head fades leaving a few rings of lace. Aroma and taste are dank n weedy with bitter citrus peen and piney hops, some fruity and herbal notes as well. Finish is semi dry, very bitter. Medium soft feel. Not super juicy like so many NE IPAs. Citrusy and dank and bitter in a delicious wat."
A draft straight from the brewery in Canton. 
"Canned 10/4/16, pours extremely cloudy orange color with a 1 finger foamy off white head that was full of tiny bubbles and faded very, very slowly, leaving sticky lacing coating the sides as it eased down. The clarity was perfect New England style IPA with the cloudy orange looks."
"had this on tap at Five Horses. pretty typical looking trillium. pungent aromas of orange, peach, a bit of peppery dankness. on the palate is pineapple, mango, orange, pine, mango, citrus peel, and hint of bready malts - everything coming together really nicely and the balance is right on point. a bit thinner on the feel than I anticipated, and I think a little bit of booze slips through as a result. overall this is one absolutely delicious beer!!!"
"Really nice DIPA. Has some of the characteristics of the popular NE style DIPAs - tropical fruit nose, some mango and pineapple flavors. What sets this one apart is a very nice dryness and some subtle hints of spice. Nice hoppy bitterness."
"From a 16oz can, dated 10/04/16. Served in an imperial pint/nonic."
16 oz can dated 10/4.
Boozy. Very malty too.
"First Trillium IPA. Pours hazy, bright yellow in color with minimal head. Taste is orange, mango, and a bit of breadiness. Nice and juicy. Heavy bodied and slightly bitter. Great introduction to brewery. I will get this again."
"Poured a murky orange color with a thin amount of head that dissipates quickly. Smell is dank fruit, I get peach and melon with a bit of pepper. The flavor adds citrus to the peach and melon with all that followed by some floral peppery bitter finish. This is a smooth Double IPA with a crisp finish. It's a little different than other Trillium IPA's I've had but just as good. I love the balance between ripe fruit and spicy bitterness. The feel is not as juicy as their others as the description says but fits the flavor profile."
Pours a completely opaque orange color. Thinnish white head dissipates leaving sticky white lacing and some spotty foam on top of the beer. 
"Pours hazy gold, smells citrus and fruity. The taste starts of bitter, then there is a wash of candied orange, some grapefruit, and an undercurrent of stonefruit and tropical at the end."
Canned 10/4/16. Consumed 10/10/16.
Juice bomb!
"Pours with a nice head with no lacing. Aroma hops,citrus and earthy notes. Taste is "
"Was pleasantly surprised by this one. Great IPA. Nice color, flavor. Definitely able to hang with the big boys. You hear a lot about Vicinity from Trillium, but I think I may actually like this one better. Def must try."
"16oz can, poured into a Trillium etched snifter glass. Enjoyed from a fresh can on 8.23.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
Opaque yellow-orange with a large fluffy foam head.
A pounder can poured into a tulip appears chalky pale golden in color with a white cap that fades leaving webby lace.
Made the trek to Trillium n Treehouse last week and will def do it again. Picked up 4 brews from Trillium n all were stellar including this one. There isn't one thing about this brew that will blow you away - its not a Treehouse style juice/hop bomb but as you drink it you'll appreciate just how well its done. Super smooth and drinkable. Nice flavor that has long legs. You really need to drink a few of these to truly realize what a great brew it is. Well done.
White head. Golden yellow color.
16 oz can poured into can glass canned on 8/9.
Canned 8/10/16. Had on 8/27/16
"Canned on 08/10/2016, consumed on 08/26/2016."
"Look: Turbid, yellow, nice head with lots of lacing"
Can poured into Sam Adams glass
"Bright yellow orange with a white quickly dissipating foamy then fizzy head. Blast of tropical fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, mango, peach on the nose and palate which last through to the end of the beer. Moderate to light mouth feel and carbonation. Great drinking DIPA!"
16 oz. can dated 08/10/16
"Pretty sure I've run out of unique adjectives to use for Trillium brews. First time having Scaled Up, and it was a very solid Trill - I wouldn't put it at the top echelon of their stuff, but it's still big murky goodness that I'd love to repeat."
"Excellent beer. Poured an opaque, but bright orange with crazy dank and citrus flavors on the tongue. Those same aromas erupted out of the glass as well"
"Another juicy, creamy, flavorful offering from Trillium. Pineapple bomb!"
"Bottle pour into a teku. Typical Trillium hazy look, nice combination of citrus and dank flavors, solid but not exceptional mouthfeel. A definite step down from other hoppy Trillium offerings but enjoyable none the less."
"What a beer! Trillium knows what they are doing. Reminded me a little of Ghost in regards to look. Hazy, golden yellow. Super fruity Aroma. Sweet taste. Where ghost has a bit of a bite, this has a sweeter finish. Dangerous beer that could be drunk over and over and over..."
"This is not my favorite Trillium offering. I love the way these beers look all cloudy and murky. The aroma on this beer is great per usual for trillium. The taste follows the nose, but really missing some bitterness and/or maltiness. Other than the citrus, mango, and fruity perceived taste, not much else there. It drinks a tad thin and there is no lingering mouthfeel."
"The aroma offers green mango, tangelo, bready malts, orange flesh."
"Overall probably the best beer I have ever had. Poured from a 750ml into a snifter-like glass. Hazy, murky, cloudy yellowish orange. Immediately smells of mellow citrus, grapefruit, mango, strong peach, subtle orange, sweet melon and gentle hops. The taste is a pure juice- peach and mango dominate and yet the beer is so complete. Amazing mouthfeel, very complex and decently thick for a dipa. If you are into fruit bombs, you honestly can't do much better than this."
"Sooo, i had what was reported to me as being a ""good"" batch, no shitty hops here"
"someone said it best ""like a mimosa""..... hell yes! but natural and with no fruit juices like BP has been doing, turning it all novelty n sh*t....."
"Everything you would expect from their beers. Unfiltered, tropical, and delicious. I got a lot of citrus notes from this one and the taste was really balanced."
"Trillium makes incredible beer, enough said. This is another great example, and one I will try to find again. Cloudy, light golden in color, and a dank, citrusy nose. Taste is even better, and goes down clean for an IIPA. Love this brew."
I got the 1st batch of this Scaled Up and it was good but from what people are saying this 1st batch wasn't as tasty and fresh as the later batches... that is this isn't rated as high from me. Still a solid beer.
Another amazing Trillium IPA! Tons of citrus hops on the palate but you know their coming when the aroma hits u in the face when you pour it into your glass!!
"Quite possibly my favorite Trillium offering I've had to date (and that says a lot). It pours with that amazing Trillium haze. If you like a good IPA, the brewery is spot on and this is one of their very best."
"22oz bottle purchased at the Congress Street location. Extremely turbid and cloudy, more yellow than orange. Aroma is fantastic, reminds me of a mimosa or maybe just orange juice, extremely juicy. The flavor is also nice and citrus juicy but also alcohol. This is a great beer don;t get me wrong but I think i preferred their pale ale and IPA. Both were just as juicy without the wallop of alcohol and the much higher price tag."
L: Hazy and cloudy burnt orange with a very thin white head
Thanks Mike! 3 week old bottle so still really fresh!
Looks like a fresh glass of orange juice and tastes a bit like a brass monkey
"Bottled on 1/8/16, consumed tonight, 1/30/16. 750mL bottle poured into a tulip as usual. Again, Thanks for picking these up Ryan !"
The first time I can taste a bit of alcohol in a Trillium.
Consumed 1/29/16
"Dammit, how do they do it? The look is a slighty-slighty hazy orange/nectarine with big foam but not the thick typical Trillium foamy look. Aroma is ridiculously amazing, as expected. The mosaic shines and mango/galaxy juice pours into the nostrils. Its stupid good, for some reason I keep thinking nectarine/peachy juice - one of my favorite noses. Taste is on point tons of straight juice, less danky and more resin but still smooth as hell. Mouthfeel is a thinner than most of their other big abv imperial ipas.. wouldn't describe this as pillowy but more hop forward and in your face. Still an awesome beer."
"This beer is too dang peppery for my liking. Especially because I loved the way it looked, crazy hazy unpenetrable to light. But in the end w any beer it's gotta be about the taste and w the peppercorns aftertaste and linger I pass next time. It's all good love the brewery happy to try it"
Looks like a glass of orange juice with a medium white head on top.
hello.. thank God for batch 2.. that is why I didnt rate after batch 1.. knew JC needed to dial it in.. wow.. just a juice bomb with that amazing Trillium dankness I love.. amazing
Got this bottle in a sweet trade!
Cloudy as hell. Smells like Trainwreck mariiuana.
"Appearance: pours a yellow to honey color. a two to three finger head, good retention and a big frothy lacing. super hazy and cloudy, completely opaque. "
"Wow, that is really good. Excellent flavor, good double IPA bite, nice lacing, wonderful smell. A sipping beer to savor. Would definitely drink again."
"A: Hazy, bright yellow, light straw colored."
"I'm from CT, relatively close to NEBCO, so I've been fortunate to have the hoppy stuff those guys crank out for as long as I can remember. "
Thanks Kevin for the gifted bottle.
"Bottle. Pours like your standard Trillium smoothie. Turbid as it gets. Thin white crown. Aroma is that Trillium hop milk I have had many a time before. Just a concentrated mix of several tropical fruits. You got your pineapple and apricot and guava and nectarine and 33 different types of citrus fruit. A bit of earthiness. Dank and Nelsony in a lighter regard. Sweet glazed doughnut malt. Flavor is sweet, juicy, fruity hop ooze. Not high on bitterness as far as Imperial IPAs generally go. Big feel; very creamy and textured. Like an Imperial Stout on the tongue. If I am in the mood for Trillium hop sludge, this one will suffice like any and all of their Pale Ales, IPAs & Imperial IPAs. Looks like the character of beer is staying true to their form down in Canton."
Superlative!!
"Extreme haze, bordering on opaque. Resembles peach juice."
Pours a super hazy yellow/orange color. Maybe the most hazy Trill beer I have seen. Big tropical hop nose on this one. You can smell it as soon as you crack the bottle open. The taste is loaded with grapefruit and tangerine. A slight bitter finish to this beer. A great offering from a great brewery!
Super orange like hoppiness and great carbonation with haze. I really love everything about this beer.
750 ml bottle was poured into a pint glass. 
Poured from a growler filled today at the canton brewery into a tulip. 
"Picked up a growler at the new Canton facility. Heard the first batch of Scaled Up was good but didn't have the house characteristics (read: super wet dank haze) Trillium is known for. After trying a sample of the second batch, I knew this was a different beer. Poured like OJ concentrate with a nice pillowy head. Smelled amazing, like boozy fruit juice. Taste was that of a classic New England IPA....juice blanket. Perfect carbonation. My only gripe would be the booziness and my lack of self control."
"Bottled on 12/17/15 so not super fresh, but it doesn't matter. Pours a hazy orange yellow color with a thin white head that leaves blotches of lacing around the glass. Smell is loads of pineapple and mango, with some citrus. Taste is full of pineapple and mango. Sweet malt helps elevate those tropical fruit notes. Bitterness is there but only slightly. Helps with the grapefruit in the back end. There's some dankness in there too. Alcohol is barely noticable. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. That signature Trillium feel. Kinda sticky though and carbonation is kinda low. Overall, an amazing DIPA. Trillium really knows what they're doing with hops."
Poured from bottle to a snifter. 
"Poured 1/11/16 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery on 1/9/16, into an imperial pint glass."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle. Poured the hazy yellow orange color into my glass. The nose had lots of citrus fruit aromas orange seems to be the strongest. The taste is also of citrus with many other tropical fruits in the mix here mango, papaya with a slight hint of bitterness from the hops in the very back of your mouth. Another good DIPA from Trillium."
"Pours an extremely hazy yellow-orangey color with a thick head that dissipates throughout drinking. Smell is tropical juicy, thick with hoppy aroma. Taste reflects much of the same, heavy on the citrus, orange, mango, grapefruit flavors. Feel is extremely smooth. This is a delicious juice bomb, one of my new favorites"
Poured from 64 oz growler. This may be the haziest beer I've ever seen. It looks like a cloud saturated with peach juice ready to rain. Only problem is zero head retention. Wide array of citrus peel in the smell. A mix of orange and grapefruit juice in the smell as well. Grapefruit forward with a bit of dank pine. Feel is fresh squeezed juice for days. Great beer.
Pours an extremely murky bright orange color with a 1 finger white head. The head is gone quickly but there's some good lacing. 
"Look: Slightly hazy, soft orange-gold in color. "
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"pours a hazy yellow, lots of carbonation sticking to glass and rising up. almost like pineapple juice. smell is very soft and citrusy. tangerines, pineapples, and peaches with a slight sweet but dry malt back bone. taste follows the smell exactly, with the addition of the bitterness of the hops and some dank weed. frickin tangerine juice for daysssss though. feel is just like every other trillium beer I've had: kick ass. awesome DIPA, no alcohol taste at all, great mouthfeel, and most importantly great taste."
"The first batch I had of this from Canton poured clear and had a malty taste, and was one of my least favorite Trillium beers."
"750ml bottle served in a tulip. Pours a dub orange with a slight haze to the clarity and a half-inch, frothy, bright white head. Great nose - bright citrus fruit notes, rind and a hint of spice. Taste consistent with nose - tangerines, rind and a kiss of an earthy/herbal quality to add some complexity. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a pleasant, even carbonation and a kiss of acidity. Overall, another solid DIPA from Trillium. Not my favorite simply because they have so many outstanding offering; however, really fresh and quaffable."
"Pours orange, unfiltered and hazy with a two finger head. Smells of spicy hops and citrus. Flavor is sweet and bitter, hoppy and smooth. Quite smooth. Spiciness and hoppiness stand out the most here. Citrus still present, but dominated by the rest of the flavors. Alcohol is well hidden. Overall, really nice - but their more citrus-forward IPA's I personally prefer."
DANK
"Peach, papaya, mango, biscuit malt, grapefruit pith and rind. Tropical fruit juice in the front, pine bitterness on the back end. The sweetness is balanced by the bitterness. Semi creamy mouthfeel. Pretty awesome."
"A moderately aggressive pour yields a slightly hazy golden orange brew with 2 fingers of rocky white head with good retention that leaves moderate lacing. Aroma is peach, pineapple, grapefruit, a bit of pale malt, and a whiff of alcohol. Taste follows the nose, fairly juicy upfrobt. Dank with peach and pineapple upfront, more subdued mango and citrus, a touch of pale malt. A moderate bitterness; finishes fairly dry. Medium body and carbonation. It is probably 85% of the haze that I expect from Trillium but has all of the juiciness. It really seems that they have dailed in the new facility at Canton as this beer is excellent."
Poured from a 750mL bottle into a pint glass. Thanks Steve for giving me this. 
"I am late to the Trillium bandwagon, but have been to the Fort Point and Canton locations over the last month, and picked up a few bottles of this after trying in the Canton taproon on 12/19. Impressive beer. Not my all time favorite DIPA but an amazing beer with a lot of fragrant tones, more sweet than bitter, but very very hoppy. I can get used to drinking this."
Another great offering from trillium. Not my fav DIPA by them but def up there behind upper case and artaic. Very impressed with the new Canton facility as well.
2 fingers of dense fine white head. Excellent lacing and good retention. Hazy honey colored body with tons of visible slow moving carb. 
Bottle dated 12/17/15; drank on 12/20/15 in a teku glass
Grabbed a couple bottles on 12/19/15
"Poured from a growler into a tulip. Great smell, pineapple, pine, a little banana? whipped cream head with fairly small bubbles that fall away. Orange and hazy. Good bubbly mouthfeel, not a ton of body. Tastes of pine, a little maltier than many American doubles, some apricot, a little smoky and some peppery heat to end things. Almost has a whisky finish. Great, great stuff."
"Interesting. All I get is aggressive peach. Not as overly-aggressive as the grapefruit in Grapefruit Sculpin, but not as well-balanced as the apricot notes in Julius."
Super fresh Scaled Up purchased on the bottling date of 12/17
"Canned on 02/20/2018. Wow this beer did not hold up well. I got a 4 pack when it was released and found this guy in the back of the beer fridge. Floaters like crazy. Taste is off. This beer 2 months old is a 3/5. But I know I loved the other 3 cans, so I’ll give it the rating it deserves. Just don’t drink this thing old."
Can from Byronic
Hazy mustard orange-yellow color with a finger of white head. 
"Moderate pour yields a 3/4 inch white head over a very hazy golden body with some nice lacing. Head dissipates down to a ring in a few minutes, but comes back nicely after a few swirls. Very nice nose of tropical fruit and citrus, with a bit of floral attributes as well. Taste of tropical fruit, tangerine, orange, and a bit of lemon near the finish with a bit of citrus pith on the finish. Nice feel and overall, they need to make more of this for wider distribution! Maybe this will be produced at the new Lawson's Finest Brewery in Waitsfield, VT? One can only hope. Cheers!"
A- this beer pours a this orange juice looking hazy delight with an off white head that lingers
"Pours a nice and hazy golden orange with about a finger and a half of fluffy white head. Small cap and collar on break, and some lacing. "
"pours out very hazy, nice dense bright white head leaves great lacing. aromas and palate are green and danky - earthy herbaceous character, pine needles, hop burn, acidic grapefruit and orange juice, citrus peel. its pungent but bordering on being harsh. this got better after it sat for 1-2 weeks."
Canned 4 days ago
"Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a hazy dark pear-like semi-pale burnt to muddy orange color. Finger’s worth of white foamy head started and dissipated at a decent pace. The aroma had some mango, passionfruit, citrus, grapefruit pith, danky sweet onion, with a dusty resinous backing flowing over a soft yeastiness. Some orange zest and honeysuckle slide in underneath. The flavor takes all previously mentioned aromas to coincide well blended and still exacting the sweet, bitter and zesty portions flowing all along my tastebuds. Its a freefall in the aftertaste as it just seems to flow so smoothly in a liquous crushing semi-sticky finish, different, but I like that. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability about it. Mild carbonation feels good and the bitterness is there, but seems to just slide. Overall, what a great DIPA that I would love to have again."
Poured from 16 oz can (canned 12-12-2016) into an Aslin Beer house glass
"16oz can, purchased fresh at the brewery, poured into a Trillium Congress Street Becher glass. Enjoyed on 12.20.2016, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"Hazy, turbid orange-gold pour that is the hallmark of the style. Aroma absolutely explodes from the can - bright citrus and pakalolo. Orange juice, papaya, grapefruit, apricot and nectarines come powering over your palate leaving behind a robust and pleasant fruit-stickiness. Hop bitterness makes itself known but doesn't disturb the citrus overload. Super soft mouthfeel ends the proceedings."
"Wow! Just wow. As a fan of NE style IPAs this one just topped my charts. I poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass to find a deeply opaque golden straw color with a solid finger high head. It is impenetrable like a dense fog and emanates a complex dank, juicy rich aroma of pine and melon and apricot - a real treat for those who enjoy a juicy beer. The mouth feel is soft and oatey with a somewhat moderate bitterness for a DIPA. The flavor perfectly compliments the aroma by offering slurry of citrus and dry apricot with a hint of pine. The malt gives way to the hops but this does not detract in any way. I really like what Trillium is doing and this collab matches their sensibilities perfectly. I rate this high for the category because I think they have taken the hazy juicy IPA to somewhat of an extreme and managed to eke out a superior product. I earnestly look forward to hunting this one down again."
"Thanks a ton Kevin, as usual!"
Can poured into fluted snifter.
"Very hazy beautiful yellow with hints of peach. Nice white head. Orange and melon but a ton of green hop somewhat resinous pine hop character. Great beer. But not sure how I feel about the lupulin powder. For what is probably a low BU beer, the powder seems to provide a little of its own harshness."
good but the powder is weird. leaves an aftertaste that wont go away like slim fast.
Super hazy. Some orange in it plus more fruit I can't quite tell.
L - Hazy orange with two fingers of white head
Can shared by Zack. Thanks! Happy NYE! 
"Adding the Lupulin Powder almost seems like cheating. It makes the IPA so full of hops flavor you can't help but like it. The question I have though is ""when does beer stop being beer and become a larger more basic category of flavored fermented beverage? Still, it's delicious. Tastes a lot like Julius to me. Very juicy, easy drinking hop bomb. Ton of citrus flavor."
Wow! Picked this up via trade in Treehouse parking lot and it was worth it! Gave up 2 Green for 1 can. Great decision! What an amazing concoction from Trillium.
"Smells like a Lawson's beer, looks like a Tree House beer, tastes like a lesser batch of Double Sunshine, the kind that tastes bitter with buttery notes without the tropical blasts of flavor."
Canned 12/12/16. Consumed 12/24/16.
"Cloudy, particulate-laden light yellow color with just a sudsy white crown by way of a head."
Served on tap in Burlington in a snifter.
"I initially drank this side by side with some Fort Point, and preferred the Fort Point, but I keep coming back to this - the more I drink it, the more I like it."
"Had on tap. Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color with minimal head. Taste is lemon, melon, and wet dank hops. Medium bodied, slightly bitter and dry--especially compared to other Trillium beers. Solid, but there are several other Trillium beers I would go to first over this one."
A little darker color than most of the trilliums. More of a burnt orange.
"Pours a rich dark orange, hazed with a one finger head. Aroma is powerful right out of the gate; orange citrus, mango, pineapple, spicy earthiness. Taste is tropical, smooth, heavily dry hopped, plenty of bitterness, but not so much to out-do the insane drinkability. Full bodied mouthfeel. This is a great collab with brewing styles present from both Lawson's and Trillium. It may be leaning toward a Trillium IPA, but this is one of their strongest recent collaborations."
"Drank on tap at Trillium Brewing Company, Canton, MA"
"Pours a hazy golden orange, like mango flesh. Not terribly aromatic. Minimal amount of tropical fruit emanates. It's super light and soft. A little cantaloupe melon character. A semi-harsh astringent earthy finish. It doesn't feel as big as a 7.7% beer, so it does have that going for it. Glad I only got one can of this."
"Pours a super hazy pale orange in color with a finger of white head. Aroma has mango, citrus, and stone fruits. Taste hits the same notes but adds some melon and solid and lingering bitterness. Medium body and moderate carbonation. An excellent beer, it has the typical Trillium character but adds a solid bitterness."
"One of the best Trillium beers I've had! Bummer it's a limited supply, maybe they can re-boot in the future, but I would see them doing something different. I'm glad they're starting to collaborate with other NE breweries."
"Lighter, pale golden yellow in color. Turbid in appearance. Lemon, papaya, pineapple, grapefruit pith and pine. Light cracker malt. Bitter, dry, resinous finish. Medium bodied. Sweetness held in check by the bitterness. Pretty solid. Reminds me of a traditional double dry hopped Trillium IPA."
"Astounding collaboration from these two. Turbid orange, soapy head with light lacing. Smells like weed, tropical fruit, dank hops abound. Taste isn't far off from the smell, very dry and quenching. Top three Trillium offering this year along with IwanttoBU and Dialed In w/ Pinot Gris."
This may be my perfect IPA. Super citrus. Smooth. Bitter. Crushable!! It's always the way.. Find an incredible brew and it's a one off. Hats off to Trillium and Lawsons' for one incredible double IPA.
One heck of a balanced East Coast Cloudy IPA! Nothing to complain about here. Pure enjoyment! Citrus in taste and smell. Up there with the best IPA styles I have ever had.
Bought 16oz cans from the Canton location on 12/12. Poured into a rounded glass hotel tumbler.
Can poured into trillium glass
"I'm not going to sit here and pretend to tell you that I can tell by the taste that they added the lupulin powder at 11:34am on a partly cloudy Sunday, but I will say that this is an amazing beer. It's as hazy as possible, awesome smell, and an absolute bomb of juice. One of my tops. Hopefully Lawson's and Trillium make it again or collaborate on another project soon. 5/5."
16oz can filled yesterday. 
A great collaboration with Lawson's on this one. Trillium was due for a great collab in the recent months as others weren't quite up to the standards that they usually run on. An amazing brew without a doubt.
"Absolutely love this concoction - poured smooth, incredible aroma (very dank and strong), incredibly smooth with an citrusy aftertaste. Definitely one of trillium and Lawson's best!"
L: Poured into a shaker pint glass. Got that Trillium opacity that you don't see in many other brands. Careful or you'll lose your keys in there. Color itself is pale golden. 
16 oz. can dated 12/12/2016
Just didn't work for me. Muted nose. Bitter taste and chalky feel. Needs more time
Absolutely fantastic. Smooth finish and great juicy flavor all around. You can taste the juicy hops they put in this one with every sip. Hands down one of the best beers I have had.
"This the first beer I’ve had from Sand City. Came in a 5oz pour as part of a flight at the brewery. Had a beautiful, hazy orange hue, smelled of tropical fruits and citrus. Immediately hits you with the tropical fruit once you sip it - big papaya/guava/mango flavors up front thanks to the Galaxy hops. Probably the best thing about this beer, though, is how ridiculously smooth it is at 8.2%. Big hops and bitterness are there, but toned down to a pleasant point. Definitely a new favorite of mine."
This was the first Sand City I've tried. Acquired at a trade in line for an OH release. Loved it. One of the few IPAs that can hold it's own when compared to the better OH and Tree House stuff. Galaxy and Nelson combo is a total winner. The papaya and tropical punch of the Galaxy is complimented and framed by the tangy white grape juice and raspberry tones of the Nelson. These hops work wonders together and both shine through without competing in any way. Will definitely be hunting down more Sand City libations.
"Can poured into a tulip. Hazy/murky golden orange with a white head. Lacing rings the entire glass as I drink. Smell is fruit juice with grape and wine notes, no malt smell at all. The taste is like a bubbly tropical juice with a splash of wine in it. A medium slick feel with a bite in the end. Very good showcase of these two hops and I look forward to some more sandcity cans in the future. Cheers."
"Trillium's Dialed In is one of my favorite DIPA's ever, especially the Sav. Blanc. variant with Galaxy and Nelson. So imagine my delight when seeing some good ole' Aussie/Zeal introduced to the 3rd One series release. And man does it deliver. Nelson is so damn unique with that big sweet white grape nose. So dominant, pungent and cutting followed by that typical galaxy passionfruit peachy tropical vibe. Mouthfeel and finish is smooth as ever. If you are into this hop combo, it's an experience. Killer brew."
"Great showcases of down under hops, better mouthfeel than the best OH combi imperials. Quite fantastic. Just a hint of sweetness to round out the balance of flavors."
Canned 2/18/17. Enjoyed 2/24/17. Acquired in a trade for OH DDH Broccoli.
"Canned 1/18/2017, it pours cloudy gold tan color with a 1-2 finger off white head which faded very slowly and left great foamy lacing coating the sides with rings as it went down."
This is clearly a 4.5. The Long Islanders tend to inflate the ratings...
"Just an incredible beer. Super smooth at 8.2%. I love the hop combination here. I was blown away by the first ""one"" beer and they just get better each time. So awesome to have these guys on the island."
"Canned 2/18/17. Another beast from Sand City. Power of one is no step child in the one family. Pours super merky golden. Two finger white head which fades slowly with great lacing. Taste is awesome! Danky hop start ,galaxy, light citrus, mango and very light white pepper finish. Exceptional DIPA. Look forward to more of the one family from sand city."
"can from this morning's release into a glass on this balmy 60 degree mid February day. as w one and infinity plus one, this is another killer w just a new hop angle. juiciness at its finest. super dank fresh hop w big galaxy fruit bursts and a really excellent Nelson finish. as good if not better than the other 2 incarnations of this beer."
"An 8.2% DIPA brewed with Galaxy and Nelson hops - far as I know, canned either yesterday or today, 2/19/17, as I picked it up at the brewery release this morning but there is no canning date on the can... Having this shortly after having their Washed Up IPA, and the New England-stylings are very similar - looks the color of grapefruit juice, opaque, washed out gold, with a finger-plus of lacy foam that left some trails of lace down the glass. Aromas on this were of the ""dank"" citrus type - suggestive of a variety of pale fruits, but with something of an earthy edge. Flavors in line with the nose, dark grapefruit pith and musky white wine grapes - super-plush and smooth, well-carbonated and clean-finishing - again, the bitterness is moderate but tighter than their Washed Up IPA, and the sweetness mild, but there was something of a Sweetart-like tang on the finish; nonetheless making for a clean-finishing drink that is easily follow-able by another..."
"L - love the name. Pours a soft, gentle haze like pineapple juice. Quickly dissipating head that leaves sticky lacing behind."
Poured into a 12oz pilsner glass via growler from OH
OH and The Answer should be collaborating more than once a year. So damn good.
"The beer pours a murky yellow with a small white head that doesn’t last very long. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of white grapes, dark grapes, blueberries, pineapple, and melon. It tastes of white grapes, dark grapes, blueberries, pineapple, and melon. It is very soft and juicy, very crushable for the abv. This is a great offering from Other Half, I liked it better than last years Answer collaboration."
Tall can......3/8/18....this is a collaboration w/ The Answer brewery
"L - milky haze, slightly better head retention than most OH (or maybe it has something to do with me pouring out of a growler, while I usually get their cans?)"
"They need to brew this regularly, absolutely delicious!"
"L - now that is some straight mango juice. Goddamn that glows beautifully in the evening sun. Creamy, oily head. "
Enjoyed on tap at the brewery.
This was an exceptional IPA. I had it on tap at Extreme Beer Fest 2018 and wish I could get more!
Pile of crowns... wish they had it more often. Really special brew from a fantastic brewery. These guys are on the cusp of becoming one of the most sought out beers of the east coast. Phenomenal fluid.
A- Golden color with a huge amount of haze.inviting.
Canned 5/10/17; drank 5/27/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"Awesome beer! Pale gold, totally opaque - another beer that looks like grapefruit juice - tall head of foam left lace trailing behind and never lost its foam cap... Aromas of juicy citrus and orchard fruits, nice and ripe, fit to be plucked... flavors of soft sweet fruits follow, tropical, citrusy and lush... Creamy soft and medium weight, plush with carbonation... Like a beer fruit creamsicle... Got impressions of orange, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, and more... Features Citra, Mosaic, and Nugget hops; 5/11/17 canning..."
"Picked this up when it was released a couple of months back and finally got around to sitting down with this tonight. Even though I'm from New Jersey, I've worked in the Big Apple for 5+ years now and am so pleased and proud as to how big the beer scene there has become. It's breweries like LIC Beer Project and offerings such as this that have changed the game and after finally having a whole can of this, it's easy to see why people enjoy this beer so much!"
"My first beer from these guys - and in full disclosure, I'd never even heard of them before receiving this, which speaks to the number and quality of brewers we beer nerds are blessed with, because this is world-class."
"Absolute killer DIPA, probably one of the best ever made"
"Let me start out by saying that I'm a HUGE fan of Other Half and Singlecut, but this is the best IPA in New York. Easily right up there with NE big boys. Absolutely outstanding. Look forward to drinking this again"
"I noted a change in color between cans, from a hazy golden to more amber. the taste anyway is always very tropical and juicy"
"Hazy golden/straw appearance. One finger of head that dissipates fairly quickly. Huge ripe tropical notes on the nose, mango, peach, maybe pineapple? Taste follows with a touch of earthiness & pine on the back end. A low to moderate bitterness that fades. Super drinkable & delicious. One of my favorite DIPAs in New York."
Had to review this one.
"It pours a super cloudy neon orangish gold color with a short white head that leaves very little lacing. Taking in the nose is a thrilling and complex experience in it's own right. Peach, apricot, and mango are followed by some floral notes and big dank earthy tones. "
Canned 8/26/16. Consumed 8/31/16.
"Outstanding DIPA, I couldn't find any flaws to this one."
The beer comes in a medium plus hazy medium gold.
It tastes better than it smells for sure. The beer is very dry and gives the hops room to be subtle and nuanced. There's a lot of mosaic in the taste and a very pleasant earthiness (maybe from the nugget?) that isn't super common in these hazy/juicy ipas.
"Excellent beer, multi-dimensional with so many layers. Love the dry taste and juicy taste. At 8.5 alcohol not detectable at all."
"Undated can purchased 8/27/16 at LICBP. Cloudy yellow pour with sticky white lacing. Beer is sweet, citrusy and slightly grassy. Alcohol isn't present at all. Clean and slightly bitter finish. A fantastic offering from LIC."
L: pours thick dark orange hazy with a big head
Poured from a 16 ounce can dated 2/21 so about three weeks old. 
LGA 2 LGB - Other Half feat. Monkish
"The beer pours a murky yellow with a medium sized white head. It has low carbonation. It smells of orange rind, mango, melon, and white peppers. The beer tastes of orange rind, mango, melon, and white peppers. It’s full bodied with no bitterness, but quite boozy. I did not enjoy this beer is wasn’t well balanced and had an off putting peppery taste on the back end."
No canned on date.
"Drank on tap at Trillium Garden at the Substation, Boston, MA"
Thank you CanConPhilly for this
"Canned 2/21/18, Acquired on release date 2/24/18 from brewery, Enjoyed shortly after. Poured vigorously into the proper platinum teku."
"MAgic. Kern River strikes again. Dry, crisp, hoppy and not too boozy. As someone who has lost a bit of taste for DIPAs, I enjoyed this very very much."
22 ounce bottle poured into a tulip
L: Dark gold color and hazy. Good amount of thick white head. 
On-tap.
"Pours a slightly hazy almost amber color with a good amount of white head and good retention. The aroma is pretty muted but gives off a bit of pine, dank grass, and hint of citrus. Malt backbone is pretty breadlike with a good amount of caramel, almost too much comes through on the taste, and some spice notes from the rye. Some mild heat from alcohol present and takes away from the hops. Fairly dry which helps some with accentuating the hops but lets the alcohol come through. Overall a fairly average IPA."
Was lucky enough to have a friend I trade with send me some of this. While it was a nice crisp hoppy IPA as most Kern River hops is....it wasn't anything crazy different. Worth drinking but not going to any trouble to track down
"Slightly disappointed in this one. I guess I was expecting it to be as good as their Citra IPA. It's still very good, and muy hoppy (and I love the look of both this and Citra), but probably nothing I'd go out of my way to pick up again."
Poured a yellowish orange malty color. Had a nice thick foamy one ounce head. Smells slightly malty with mild grapefruit smell. Taste is very resiny with slight grapefruit smell and mainly alcohol. I do not think this beer is very well balanced and do not understand the hype. Just another DIPA to me.
Slightly hazy gold-amber with a moderate off-white froth that fades to a thin blanket and some sticky random lace.
"L: Light pumpkin, apricot, and honey hues with a thick white head and ample lacing"
"light straw color is not particularly inviting, nor is the light malt nose. Light carbonation, light hop and light malt make for a very well balanced and easy drinking ipa that is not particularly double in abv or flavor but subtly comforting warming and Kern"
"Kern River strikes again! If you were a fan of the collab with Knee Deep (Deep Rivers), this is right there. Outstanding fruity and juicy aromas and flavors, easy to drink, clean and delicious. Cheers!"
"Copper and yellow color, full inch of head. Aroma was primarily citrus (citra) in its hoppiness. Plenty fruity."
"Deep apricot colored pour with a creamy finger of khaki head, lacing on the spotty side."
"Served in a pint glass poured from a growler. Pours a dark amber with a nice head, about 1 finger, that dissipates into lace around the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus mixed with pine. It is medium bodied and highly drinkable. Feels good going down. A really good DIPA that hides the alcohol content well."
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Half Acre tulip.
A: Golden yellow with off white head. Good retention and some lacing.
Thanks to APreacher for the bottle!
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass in high elevation Libby, Mont. Reviewed live. No bottled-by date readily apparent. Got this bottle up in Montana from my buddy Kojevergas. I confused it with the Winter Rye Ale."
A: pours a clear golden-yellow with a finger of white head that fades into a frothy ring with a little lacing.
"1 pint 6 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap acquired at a local beer store and served into a New Belgium stem-goblet in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Expectations are extremely high given its current ratings, the hype, and the reputation of the brewery itself. No ABV is listed on the bottle. Label is okay. "

Pours a beige head. Color is a clear dark golden orange.
A long time want by me and generously given to me as an extra by cocoapuph. A little over two months old at this point.
Poured from bottle into pint glass.
"Pours a bright orange with a small amount of head. Slightly cloudy apperance, minimal lacing left behind. The nose is chock full of hoppy goodess in the form of grapefruit, pine, citrus, and a dash of earthiness. The taste includes some honey and sweet malts to pair with the assertive hop profile that features citrus, pine, and resin. The taste becomes very bitter as it finishes. The body is somewhat big with medium carbonation. Overall, a very tasty DIPA, a little heavy for my liking but still very good."
"A: One-inch just off-white head, light-golden color, decent carbonation, good lacing"

Just picked up a couple of super fresh bottles today. My first time witht this brew.
22 oz. bottle received in the 2012 Birthday BIF from futhurgone; Thanks Rob! Big want of mine. Poured into my Bell's tulip.
Kern 5th pours a light amber color with a big white foamy head. the smell is citrus and pine with a malty bread backbone. the taste follows through with big hop flavor and a maltiness that balances it out. the mouthfeel is a littl heavy for the style with high carbonation. overall this is a good ipa.
Poured from 650ml bottle into a tulip glass. Pours burnt orange along with a big white head. Beautiful lacing that lasted throughout. Aromas of sweet and floral hops along with malts. Flavors of smooth and riseny hops. Slightly bitter backfinish. Meidum mouthfeel and decent carbonation. I quite enjoyed this DIPA from Kern River. Happy 5th Birthday!
From 22oz bomber to snifter on 2/4/12
Look: Pours a yellowish orange color with a 1/4 inch off white head and good retention with some spotty lacing
"22oz bottle poured into a tasting glass. It poured a bright orange/amber color with a thin, bubbly white head scattered across the to of the beer. Great color to it. "
"A: Orange-yellow body, larger white head caps it off, nice sudsy lacing left behind on the glass."
Had to choose this as my first review. 22oz bottle poured into a Weyerbacher tulip
Growler
Pours a murky dull orange with a big 3 finger head leaving excellent retention all the way down the glass.
Big thanks to Sean for sharing this one. Served in a Cigar City snifter.
Growler shared at a tasting at MrHirschybar's place. 
Poured into an over-sized Mother Earth Snifter
Fresh January 2012 batch...in fact the place I drank this had received cases the day after bottling...
"A - This beer pours a hazy light-golden color, a bit like a light raw honey--unfiltered, a bit cloudy--straw colored. It has a large, 3-finger, yellowish-white head that diminishes to a much smaller, thin head over time. The head is almost describable as neon in color--as if the amount of hops used in the beer gave the head a slightly neon yellow tinge. Very beautiful and different for a double IPA. "
"Pours a typical dipa color that you've read about many times--golden, mildly cloudy. It looks great."
Pretty clear amber gold. Pours easily to a half inch head. White foamy head with lots of lacing. 
A - Orangish colored beer with a decent white head that left some nice spots on the side.
"22oz bottle, thanks to Gorefiendus!"
A huge thanks to hamilton23 for sending this bottle my way. 
Big thanks to Exiled for sharing this bottle. This is a beer I have been looking forward to trying. 
693rd Review on BA
"golden amber color being presented to me right away. There was some haze and cloudiness to it, There was a nice three finger high head of white foam that capped the top of it,"
"At the time of this review, this is the #11 top American Double / Imperial IPA on the best of lists on beeradvocate.com. Ultimately an underwhelming IPA though."
"Huge thanks to schmoopsbeer for getting this bottle out to me. Served in a Russian River ""TION"" glass. "
22 oz poured into a tulip glass. Big thanks to DearthVader 
Its enough when my favorite double IPA and overall beer is Kern's Citra but can lightning strike twice? Well I would think after drinking this beer that it can.
"Bottle shared with starrdogg, thanks Matt. I think we both agreed this beer was good, but WAY overhyped."
Bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. An unexpected treat from DearthVader.
"Big thanks to Thome50 for this bottle, shared with Dreadnaught33"
22oz bottle into pint. 
"Chilled bomber into a glass. Thanks, John!"
"Shared with Klym, SundaySour, and family on a weekend session! Ah the weekend, at last. "
"A: Pours a lovely golden brown, maybe two shades lighter than the bottle itself. Head is full and excited at first, but dies down into a 1 finger head and simmers lower. Beautiful lacing for a DIPA. This looks good."
"Poured a cloudy orange/copper. It's a GREAT head that finally dissipates after a few minutes but leaves a sticky heavy lacing. Oily hops purely smell of CITRA that is what is EXPECTED from a CRAZY West Coast Imperial IPA. Very Hop Foward with a Great Malt back bone that gives a wonderful mouth feel. Couldn't get any better of a body with the Hops that have been used. Like I said, Very hoppy bitter taste, BUT! Enough body to give it a nice ""swirl"" around in the mouth without having it leave so fast. I LOVE THIS BEER. If KRBC's CITRA (which I never had, but WILL this year for sure since there bottling it) is even close to this, I could understand WHY they have such HIGH ratings! I LOVE THIS DIPA. I bought 2 bombers and went back for another 2 the next day at Liquor Mart Whittier. Come to find out they were already SOLD OUT! The finsih has a Nice long hoppy, oily ifinish of Citra hops and VERY FRUITY! A touch of Flowers but this is pure Citrus and Fruits! A+"
On-tap at the Bruery 3rd Anniversary fest. I had to go back for at least 5 or 6 tasters of it because it was so good.
"3 bombers received in trade with soughtbygod, thanks much Thomas."
Big thanks to Mike over at Glendale Whole Foods hanging on to a few bottles for me since I was out of town when this arrived.
Another great CA IPA and big want from Brian. 
Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass.
Looks great. Thick full head. Sticks to the glass as it dissipates. 
Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a hazy orange almost hay color. Very nice sticky white head with tons of lacing.
I've been looking for this one for awhile without success so I was pretty happy to run across it by chance at my local bottle shop.
Tulip glass.
Pours a light golden orange. Big white frothy foam head. 
Bottle consumed at the brewpub because they didn't have anymore on draft.
3/2/2012
First off this particular batch I believe to be 8% not 7% abv as listed.
Picked this up today because I love Just Outstanding so I knew they would be doing great things with their anniversary brew.
"I heard about this one from the Kern River Brewing Facebook page, when they stated their Anniversary beer was to be released at their brewery on Friday May 13th and it was going to be an 8% ABV, 78 IBU DIPA using Facloner's Flight hops. And once I heard it was being bottled, I knew I had to get some bottles."
A- Aggressive pour produces a 1-1/2 finger white head that recedes rather quick and leaves some pretty nice lacing. Beer is golden in color
All around one of the best DIPA's I've had the honor of putting in my mouff...
"22 oz. bomber,"
"Thanks to Rick at Old Town Liqour for stocking some great IPAs. Picked this up the other night and was down right impressed with it and felt it needed to be reviewed. An inch of head on an agressive pour into my Stone pint glass. Color is pretty much what you would expect from a DIPA. Smell of mango, pine and a little sweet butterscotch. Mouthfeel is amazing and the taste is ... Well its outstanding! Think of this beer like Port Brewery's Mongo meets Firestone's Double Jack. Easily competes with Pliny in my book, cant taste the alcohol and at 8% thats dangerous. I picked up 2 more bombers today cause I know they wont last long. Highly recommended!"
"This is an amazing beer. It was just released yesterday. And it is by far one of the best DIPA's that I have ever had. It had a thick frothy slight off white foam that dissipates rather quickly, but leaves real nice lacing. It is Dark orange in color, and smells wonderful. It has plentiful hop character when you drink it but is nicely balance by the malt. I would recommend this beer to any IPA lover out there it is a winner."
Pint can dated 10/12/18 poured into a tulip at 44F. 
"From a 16oz can, dated 10/03/18. Served in a spiegelau-style IPA glass."
It is what it is. My favorite Bissell Bros. brew.
"L: beautiful can, looks like a monster energy drink. Pours a nice hazy yellowish orange. Although head is very minimal."
"excellent beer, plenty of pineapple, tangerine, and grapefruit. very smooth and soft with a touch of doughy malts and green herbal and piney character."
can thanks to jacob
Draft at the brewery
"An outstanding DIPA.  Juicy and glowing. Just a bit of alcohol on the taste, which I appreciate and want in a dipa. Hops linger in a pleasant manner."
Serving: Can
"This one’s as great as any you’ll come across. Thick, juicy, full flavor hopped. Wow."
"This one pours a super super hazy light orange color, with a small creamy head, and lots of lacing."
"Tasted in a Rastal Teku from a one pint can on June 29, 2018. Brewed with Equinox, Citra and Amarillo hops. This beer is a celebration of impermanence and embracing the beauty of the passing moment. Enjoy with friends and loved ones, being content and present when you do."
"L - can art reminds me of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Hm. Pours a thick, juicy, downright dense-looking head. Solid dark orange haze glaze. Very appealing to look at. "
"Burnt amber color, hazy with a finger head. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Soft papaya, a hint of lemon rind, hops, and pine on the nose. Big, sweet and juicy tropical fruit flavors! There's some resin along with brown sugar and vanilla flavors. The bitter hops hit your tongue at first and then the soft, sweet flavors follow balancing the flavors beautifully. Full bodied with a creamy texture and smooth carbonation. My favorite Bissell Brothers yet!"
Fantastic brew. Tasted its best about 2-3 weeks after canning date. This is where it found its balance. 
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass. Appearance is juicy, opaque, and hazy orange/light brown in color with one finger thick head. Smell is excellent with notes of earthy hops, orange juice, tropical fruit (pineapple and guava), oats, resin, and dank hops."
"Let me start by saying this beer is very good. However, the nose is very weak and that is a huge deal for me. The flavor is citrus with butter finish. Not extremely dynamic. I'd say that I would have liked this beer more if TH and Trillium didn't exist!"
"Appearance: Murky and cloudy, the color of honey, with a two finger head of foam; nice persistence and a few shards of lacing"
Holy Shit. This is a definite 4.75.
"exceptional longevity. I had one in the fridge for 6 months, cracked it yesterday and it tasted just as good as the day I bought it."
Cloudy dark orange color. Abundant white head and a lot of lace. Pretty beer.
A Pours a hazy golden yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap
Very thankful that this was brought back to me. I've wanted to try this for a while
"A- nice murky amber orange beer, white head that sticks and leaves nice lacing"
16 oz. Can
"16 oz can. Cloudy deep orange pour, the finger frothy white head w decent retention. Huge citrus peel n floral aroma. Taste is filled with citrus peel and some dank grassy and herbal notes on the back end. There is a lingering dank bitterness with apricot. Medium soft feel glides. This one is special"
"16 oz can - a gift, so maybe a month old"
"Golden-straw, milky haze, creamy head. Smells like pineapple, tropical fruits, grapefruit... Sharp fizz, pillowy and a dry-ish finish, thick... Rind bitterness, spicy, and citrus. Lovely."
"Poured from 16 oz can into tulip glass. Pours a very hazy, tan-orange color, almost grapefruit juice-esque, with a medium-sized bubbly head, leaving a small amount of lacing. A few sniffs and this beer gives off a great nose of citrus juice, tropical fruits including mango and maybe even a bit of papaya, all followed up by a soft malt backbone. This NE-Style IIPA tastes of the same tropical and citrus juices as the nose, a warming malt note, and a bit of a spicy hop finish. Wow. Can't say enough good things about this beer. I have heard so much about Swish, but Nothing Gold deserves a ton of accolades. Keep these NE-style IIPAs coming!"
"Darker than their other IPAs. More malty too with a tad of smokiness. It's good, but not a true juice bomb. Creamy mouthfeel and overall a great beer."
"Had on tap at the brewery. Simply fantastic beer. Top 5 from Maine easily - up there with Swish, Epiphany and Dinner. So smooth and full of flavor. BB had 5 or 6 beers on tap that day but I kept getting more of this because it was that good. Excellent"
10oz pour at the source.
Golden orange in color. Crazy turbid in appearance. Mango and papaya fruit smoothie. A tad on the sweet side but who cares. This is super drinkable. Balanced bitterness. Crazy good.
"16oz. can from Brewery: this one pours an opaque darker golden color. There was a small off white head that left little lacing. It has a good nose. Lots of tropical fruits: orange, pineapple, mango, perhaps some others (there’s a lot going on there!). The taste is good. It has a subdued bitterness. When you first sip it it seems a bit subtle, but then the flavors start to come alive. All kinds of tropical hop flavors combining to make an excellent tasting beer. I didn’t know this was going to be available the day I went, but I’m glad it was there. Another superior offering from them!"
"another beauty from Bissell! very tropical-fruit-forward.... dark gold-ish, almost heavy-looking liquid in the glass. orange and papaya and pineapple. super easy to drink, almost sweet with a back bitterness that surprises. very rich."
"Idk, this might be perfect"
"10,Oz pour into water glass"
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (my trusty JK stemware). This was canned within the last week—8/26, I believe, which would make this can four days old at the time of consumption. It’s been refrigerated fairly consistently. CAN’T. WAIT. "
"Pours a bold orange with a one finger head. Smells of sweet orange and mango. Tropical. Flavor is bitter, with citrus following. Spicy and hoppy. Nice full body. Overall, pretty solid showing from Bissell - this is a really nice beer."
Completely opaque dark orange
This was absolutely wonderful
"Although not as amazing as Reciprocal, I still very much enjoyed this one. Another very solid IPA from the surprisingly nice people who work a Bissell Brothers."
"Has such a different appearance than most beers, very hazy and a great pungent aroma. Drank many cans over a months period and thought it changed drastically tasting the best at tis 3-4 week old mark. Something about Bissell Brother beers is that they age very well even though your ""supposed"" to drink hoppy offerings as fresh as possible"
"Pours a nice 3/4 inch head with a very hazy body. Nose of all kinds of tropical fruit, Taste follows nose up to a point where it turns bitter. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, a nice stab at a New England style DIPA."
"Thanks to @jebbeerfish for sending my way! About one week new and poured from the can into a BB style unstemmed goblet. Tropical fruit hops fill the air as I pour. Color is hazy, opaque amber with 1/2 finger fluffy white head. Great, sticky lacing. Taste bursts with tropical hops...mango, tangerine, cantaloupe and nice bitterness that lingers with cracker-y malt balance. Excellent mouthfeel...seek this one out!"
"This has to be the best alternative to Swish during the summer months that Bissell offers. Very creamy mouthfeel with loads of tropical notes. The appearance is what is might arguably turn off some. While cloudy is what one can expect from a NE brew, the haze in this is almost completely opaque, rich in dark orange. Great beer nonetheless, that I'd turn to on more than one occasion."
"Poured from a tallboy into a shaker pint, the beer is a opaque, orange-tan coloring, almost caramel colored, with a low profile, bubbly, off-white head. Aromas of orange rind, pineapple, melon, dried grass, pine tassel, pepper spice, peach, and mango. Fruity and dank nose. Flavors are juicy and spiced forward, with an undercurrent of peppery notes consistent underneath the pineapple, orange rind, grapefruit, melon, and mango blend. Grassy and piney follow, still spiced and herbal, but with a solid dankness building, as well. Well balanced, on a big, chewy body. The aftertaste is more of the juice blend, equal parts citrus and tropical, with a solid acidity building. The finish is slick, slow, and with a lingering sweet and resinous linger. Big beer."
"Yellow orange color with a moderately foamy fizzy head that dissipates quickly and doesn't lace much. Nice dominant orange, pineapple, and apricot on the nose and palate. Nice moderate to fill mouth feel and carbonation. Fabulous new BB release, not as good as Swish but still great NE DIPA!"
This beer pours opaque dark orange. The smell is of dank citrus mango. The tastes follow the nose with mango citrus and a nice bitterness that goes through the finish. I thoroughly enjoyed this DIPA another great creation by the Noah. Seek out this beer.
"Pours a murky, brownish orange color with a 2-finger off-white head. The color is rather off-putting, but not quite in liquid poo territory like Buccolia. Leaves some decent lacing. "
I previously rated this one...now reviewed 11-18
"The description of an ""apricot hop bomb"" is one I'll agree with and not try to improve upon. Had it from the tap and the carbonation was perfect. Really interesting dark color."
"Poured into a tulip, looks like a glass of apple cider, brown and murky. Almost no head at all."
"This has got to be the absolute worst looking DIPA on the planet..... Just a murky, brownish yellow haze, similar to like an glass of apple cider. Once you get past that the overall beer is fine. A nice balance of spruce and citrus both aromatically and the taste. Finishes on the bitter side."
Pours murky orange with a nice head that clings to the glass. Citrus and light hop aroma. Nice citrus start fresh juicy apricot light hints of pineapple with a pine to a hoppy finish. Very well made. Excellent double iPad.
"Apricot hop bomb. Amazing thick mouthfeel. Slight spicy zing on the finish. Ridiculous beer. Thanks again BB! The description here is wrong - it's not spruce tip. Equinox, citra and Amarillo DIPA."
"Canned 6/10, poured into a snifter on 6/12:"
"Looks and smells good but more on the sweet carmel malt side! Taste was on the sweet malt side as well, the hops were there but for me not worth the hype IMO."
On tap at Himmeriget.
Given to me by a friend.
On tap at Burial Beer Co. in Asheville. Interesting to find something from Other Half this far south and they did a collab with Burial on another beer called Sangies.
"Pours a very cloudy yellow gold color with a one finger head. Aroma is pungent with grapefruit and lemon notes. Taste is similar but a pineapple note that come through in the finish. Really fantastic combo. Malt is light and bitterness is light to moderate. Feel is very smooth and creamy, hence the ""oat cream"" designation."
Trying to get caught up on ratings.
"Bought this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 4/28 with ""WET DREAMS"" (really?) written above it. Uncomfortable feeling aside, this was an amazingly smooth beer that was taken to the next level because of the addition of lactose from the Daydream in Green. It didn't feel like there was any alcohol in this as the sweetness and fruit flavors took hold from the get-go and never let go!"
"Hazy golden with orange hues, small to medium white head and nice lacing. Soft citrusy hop aroma. Notes of pineapple, citrus pulp, tangerine, orange, and oatmeal. Medium, creamy, fluffy and dry. Really nice hazy northeast IPA."
L - Hazy orange juice which yielded a generous amount of head
"This beer is extraordinary. Pours a hazy yellow-orange, smells of fruity oatmeal. The feel and taste are both very creamy. Taste combines oats, cream, and mosaic fruitiness into a delicious package."
A: hazy flaked oat orang juice
Wow. Double Mosaic Dream just got creamier. This is amazing. Fluffy mouthfeel with the same DMD profile. Other half seriously knows what to do with mosaic hops.
"A combo of Daydream in Green and Double Mosaic Dream. Brings the oats and lactose from Daydream and the Mosaic from Double Mosaic into one... Medium gold, organic orange juice-looking beer, with a big off-white foam head and lotsa messy lace trailing behind... Aromas of orange and blackberry preview similar elements on the taste... Juicy, fruity, fluffy, and soft - some of the oat comes through on the taste, but mostly on the feel... Plush carbonation and feel, smooth and airy... Another great venue for the Mosaic hop... 4/28/17 canning"
Love the beer. Confusing name. It seems as far as branding that the only difference between the double mosaic dream and the double mosaic day dream is the word DAY.
"KAPOW!!! There it is!!! This is the one...HUGE mosaic hops blast through bigly, but massive balls on the backend to support the insane dosage of hops. the oats in these double dry hopped bombs really just makes it and I suppose that hint of lactose must be helping as well cause this has some magic to it. Best Other Half for me to date."
"A 12 fl. oz. can, canned on 24th September 2018 with a drink by date of 5th November 2018. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass."
"12 oz can poured into a willybecher glass, canned on 9/24."
My second favorite of the Society and Solitude series 7-11. A solid offering for lovers of IPA. New Zealand based hops prevelant in this brew. Drinkable.
Bought in cans a few months back it’s criminal that I just opened my first! If they’ve fallen off at all they must be unbelievable fresh because I can’t find anything wrong with this!
Very smooth. Pillowy soft body. White grape and light citrus notes on the nose. Balanced sweetness with only a hint of bitterness on the back end. Easy drinking DIPA.
Growler from the source.
"Almost fully opaque, except around the edges, this mainly displays hues of orange and light accents of yellow, and is topped by a moderate to large beige foam leaving some solid layers of spongy lace on the glass."
"Good looking IPA, lots of legs with a thick white head. Smell was wonderfully hoppy, but was missing something. Taste was perfectly hoppy, slightly tart and malty that was just wonderful with a tremendously smoothe drinkable feel."
"Lovely DIPA enjoyed from a 750 ml growler purchased from the source. Sticky head. Grassy nose. Fresh citrus with the characteristic HF light and frothy malt body. Tart, puckery mouthfeel. Super drinkable. Love it!"
Meh OK nothing special. I've had 2 better DIPAs tonight
"Pours a hazed yellow to amber color with a froth, medium sized head."
Surprising amount of pepper
"Ordered at Ambulance Brewhouse on a lightly raining afternoon. I came to beat the rush, because it will most certainly be gone a few hours after i finish typing this."
12 oz. Can canned on 4/16/18 opened on 4/22/18
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a big fluffy white head. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of orange, lime, kiwi, white grapes, and grapefruit. It tastes of lime, kiwi, white grapes, grass, and grapefruit. The mouthfeel is medium light. A good easy drinking IPA from Hill Farmstead."
"Poured from 12oz can into tulip glass. Nice cloudy NEIPA with a trace of head. Nelson hops strong on the nose and prominent in the taste. If you like Nelson, this is the beer for you."
"Holy amazing shit Batman. When you take amazing well water, a fine malt backbone and scintillating south of the equator hops and let the best in the world ferment that out you got this. As if the first 8 iterations, this one hits the bullseye."
"At the Mule Bar, Winooski, VT. This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a crisp juicy pale orange color. Bar pour’s kind of slim white head dissipates immediately leaving some speckled lace running here and there. The aroma started off with thick sweet orange juicy pulp. Bitter citrus rind accompanies nicely. Subtle sweet grassy to lemony notes hit as well. The flavor leads with pure bittersweet juicy orange pulp. Grassy notes come back in a nice balanced fashion. No aftertatse. Balanced bittersweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body. ABV seems well hidden. Decent smoothness. Overall, really nice juicy DIPA that I would love to have again."
"Not sure what went wrong with this batch (or these fills) but the beers I got aren't worthy of these scores. Typical soft HF feel and beautiful hazy color but this is incredibly vegetal, definitely something wrong with the hops. Maybe this was just a one off keg or bottom of the barrel fill but it's hard to drink really."
On tap at Armsby Abbey
Enjoyed on draft at Parker Pie. Poured into a Hill Farmstead large goblet.
"The Jeffrey, NYC."
Refreshing smooth IPA.
"Pours an opaque golden orange color with a finger of fluffy white head. The head settles into a film, leaving some splotches of lace along the way."
"had this fresh last fall....an amazing combination of earthiness, pine, and citrus. Hill continues to be elite at the traditional east coast style ipa when the shift is towards the haze bombs. They don't need to shift and this proves it. I will seek this out again and it was just fantastic."
"12 oz. pour at Doc Ponds in Stowe, VT."
"Absolutely phenomenal. Among Hill farmstead best beers ive had to date. Beautiful NE style IPA bursting with floral hops, nelson is especially present but not overwhelming. Amazing and clean, much lower sweetness than other NE ipas, a great beer"
750ml growler poured into a tulip glass. 
Had this a month past it's prime and still wasn't disappointed. There is definitely some different about these beers. Ever bit of solid as Tree House and Trillium- but better in it's own way.. Back on the hunt for other Societies.
"Had this a few weeks ago in a trade, thought I had rated it then but I guess after downing a growler I was a little hazy. My first HF brew and I wasn't disappointed, these guys do it right! Nice orange beer with white head. Smelled tropical, citrusy, dank aroma. Taste followed suit, very enjoyable and I look forward to trading for some more offerings from this fabulous brewery."
750ml growler poured into a Hill Farmstead taster.
"amazing when consumed within 2 days - quicker than S&S #4, which for me required almost a week in the growler before the bitterness came into balance"
L: Murky pumpkin and apricot hues with a healthy white foam head and moderate retention
"hazed juice appearance, tons of lace clings to the glass, beautiful looking brew. nose wasnt overly pungent, but very pleasant none the less. soft tropical fruit notes, peach, pineapple, magno, tangerine, some grassyness and white grape apparent as well - beautiful medley of fruit blending with earthy dankness and pine. mouthfeel is absolutely lush. excellent beer - highly recommended!!"
"On tap at the Farmhouse. Hazy orange body with a big fluffy white head. Smells of tropical fruit, orange hops, and a little booze. Tastes big. But lots of tropical fruit. Immediately resiny. Tastes like Nelson hops. Sweet. Moderate bitterness. A little bit of an oatmeal grain flavor in the finish. Medium heavy. A touch too sweet for me, but quite tasty."
Growler shared by Dr. Moll. Thanks man!
Draft and growler.
Hazy really pale yellow color with white head. Aroma has dank and earthy hop notes with some slightly spicy malt notes. Taste is grassy and herbal with a medium bitterness and a bit of alcohol on the finish. Medium body with medium minus carbonation. Quite good but not really up to the hype.
"A: Yellow, cloudy, white head, not murky yeast slurry!"
Poured from a 12 oz can into an Alesmith tulip
"Pours hazy golden. One finger white head. Light lacing. Aroma of citrus and pineapple. Taste follows the nose with dank, pine and Mellon. Great dipa."
Look: Yellow hazy with medium white head. Has low carbonation.
Pours a hazy gold with a very fluffy three finger head. That head lasts for quite a while before breaking. Excellent lacing. 
"Nothing too intense going on here (regular brownish mostly yellow pour, regular bitterness, regular booze flavor), but perhaps a little light on the flavor overall."
Great taste. Unique hoppy taste although I can tell it's from the Fiddlehead family.
"Can dated 10/16/17 into pint glass. Pours a hazy yellowish-amber with an off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Initial impression is juicy citrus, caramel, tropical fruit, pineapple, and a slight pine-y hops bitterness. Very smooth, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is quite hefty; carbonation is on the light side. Finish is sweet fading to a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue. Very, very well done."
Fucking perfection!!
"Smooth, fruity with a great subtle bite throughout the front and back end flavor. Tried the flagship IPA and their oat/wheat IPA as well in the taproom this weekend, and this one blows them both away by a mile. Love this."
Smooth a bit too fruity.
Cloudy straw color with moderate white head that desipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with a hint of citrus. Taste is a nice balance of hoppy and citrus that is very smooth.
"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a hazy burnt grapefruit yellow to orange color. The head dissipated immediately leaving some messy sticky lacing clinging to the glass. The smell started off with juicy grapefruit leaning towards the pulp side. Bitterness comes from the pine and has a slight underscore of citrus rind to balance. The taste reels in the sweet grapefruit and brings about a nice settling clean bitter sticky pine. The aftertaste is quick, sharp and light grapefruit with a crisp finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a clean crisp sticky grapefruit and slightly resinous feel coating my tongue. Overall, this was an extremely well done DIPA that I would love to have again."
Nice but not second fiddle
"Poured a beautifully bright and only slightly cloudy yellow with a full head of nice white foam. Aromas and flavors are bursting with pineapple qualities: it truly tastes like biting into a fresh, sweet tropical pineapple while on the beach of an island paradise. For a beer that doesn't have any added fruits or juices, this is the most pineapple flavor I've ever encountered in a brew; it's not cloying or too sweet though. There's some bitterness on the back end of the creamy and lightly effervescent mouthfeel. Just wonderful."
Beautiful cloudy yellow-orange body. Thin white head. 
Drank 8-9-16. Canned 7-8.
Can into a snifter appears a hazy pale golden yellow color with a white cap that fades leaving spotty lace.
Nice IPA.
Not bitter. Nice fruity fresh hops. Savory like quality on the finish.
Beautifully done. Very bright and smooth hop forward IPA by Fiddlehead. Had a great amount of tropical fruits and smooth taste. Nice golden yellow look as well.
White head. Hazy straw yellow. Lots of lace left.
"Canned 9/30/16, drinking 11/16/16. Poured into a teku, the beer is a bright yellow gold with a slight hazy and a thin white film, after the initial head quickly fades, leaving nice lacing. "
"A well built imperial IPA. the aroma is filled with orange juice, tangerine, resin, a little mango, and white grape. The flavor has more grapefruit edge with a little pepper toast and apricot. Light bodied and very drinkable. Heck of a beer."
"Growler shared by Mike T. Thanks a lot man! Pale yellow body, mostly clear (which seems unusual in a NE IPA these days), half inch of soapy, bone white head. Aromas of tropical fruit, juicy, resinous hops. Bubble gum, pineapple, mango, alcohol finish. Tasty."
Can poured into a sam Adams glass
From a Can.
Poured from a 12 oz can into a Nonic glass. Canned 9/9/16.
Can Date: purchased 10/15/16
Poured from 12 oz can dated 9/30/2016.
Thank you jhavs for this
"Has great juice flavors, good carbonation and very drinkable. Reminds me of a tree house Julius but a bit weaker taste. Overall a great DIPA. Will get more."
Can dated 08/19/16.
Citrus bomb in aroma. Taste is a little too punchy and slight Booziness. A good double IPA but not in the top class.
"Hazy, and a fair bit lighter than the average DIPA, more golden yellow with less brown or amber in the blend. Strong citrus flavors, with pomelo and grapefruit dueling with pineapple. Also a bit of pine and resinous bitterness, enough to balance some of the fruitiness without muddying the waters too much in terms of flavor. Really nice DIPA, with a long finish reminiscent of a pineapple juice cocktail."
I like this beer much better than second fiddle. much more citrus forward with nice Nose and overall great flavor and body. good beer I would go back to. worth a try for sure
Can received in trade with Kevin.
"Poured alongside a lot of other very high rated IPA/DIPAs during a ""battle beers"" session with friends. Pours a fairly turbid light yellow. Really good orange notes on the nose and the taste with just a slight bitter finish. This beer held its own amongst some extremely heavy hitters, finishing right behind King Julius on everyone's list. Was the surprise of the night. Would love to know how easy this beer is to get, as it is stellar."
3 wk old can.
A: Cloudy bright orange/yellow with a thin white head that dissipates quickly.
"Pours a semi hazy orange lemon hue, with a semi tight head. Strong peach and pineapple on the nose and the palate. Little bit of sweetness, almost a honey tone, and unmistakeable hop oil and resin. Moderate carbonation. Very tasty brew! Also, VERY cool can, and 25% of sales goes to a children's hospital. Cheers to the kids!!!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a white head. There are floral and tropical hops on the nose. Citrus and pineapple. Great balance. Same in the palate, tropical with pineapple and lemon. Very good. Glad I was able to try this beer!"
"I had this fresh and from a growler after it had sat for 2 weeks. It was a little better fresh - but when fresh had a really strong licorice flavor. After it waited a bit, it seems to mute the licorice that I remember (there was still some for sure though), which let some hop and other cirtrus/pineapple flavor through. Very good DIPA."
"While not on the same level as Second Fiddle (which still stands as one of my all time favorite IPAs), this is still a fantastic DIPA from Fiddlehead. I miss the black & white mad scientist cans though..."
"They just happened to have mastermind cans in stock when I stopped in. Pours a cloudy yellow, with a smell of grapefruit and floral hops. The taste is a good balance of bitter hops and citrus flavors. Not overpowering bitterness for a double IPA."
"Lucked out with a release when I happened to be in the area. I had heard great things about it and was not disappointed. Although I must say I like 2nd Fiddle a tad more but I know they are very different beers. I have some beer geek friends that had never had it either and there ratings were all ""damned good"". I would absolutely buy it again and again and with so many decent beers out there in CRAFTLAND Saying I would buy it again is not easy."
From a can dated 8/5
"Look and feel aren't great, but taste is straight pineapple juice and very drinkable for 8%. Batch from 8/5 was lucky enough to grab a case of these cans"
Had fresh out of the can at Fiddlehead (well technically the pizza place next door after buying it). Served in a pint glass it's a touch hazy honey gold color with a fluffy head.
"This beer pours a very hazy bright golden color with a dense one finger white head that sticks around for a while and leaves lots of webbed lacing in it's wake. Smell is very strong pineapple, orange pith, dank green herb, a touch of sweet malt and a tinge of alcohol. Taste is exactly the same. Definitely pineapple forward. Feel is light and juicy with a tinge of alcohol on the finish. Overall a very good beer. Not on the same level as Second Fiddle, but I would certainly drink this again."
"Poured from a can into a snifter, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, golden-yellow coloring, with a low profile, foamy, clingy, white head. Aromas of orange rind, pineapple, lemon zest, grapefruit, some earthy notes, and subtle floral hops characteristics. Flavors are juicy forward, a sweet and rich blend of mango, orange, pineapple, melon, and grapefruit, with subtle grassy and bitter hops at the end. Smooth and slightly dry bodied, chewy throughout, which helps to support all of the juicy sweet notes that last through to the aftertaste. Slightly acidic, smooth, slick finish, with a linger of tropical fruit sweetness. Good beer."
"Smell is sweet malt, citrus, onion, and pineapple. Taste is pineapple, citrus rind or peel, and some grapefruit. It hides the 8.1% abv very well and is a solid double IPA."
"A good friend brought this to me when he went up for the Vermont Brewers Fest. After bringing home as much Second Fiddle as theyd let me buy a year ago, I was anxious to try this new beer from this underrated brewery. LOVED it! Will make a trip to buy as many as I can for myself ASAP!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden hue. Looks a little more watery than its fellow IPA counterparts. The aroma stands out right away, just bursting with orangey citrus. It does not disappoint with taste. It's like biting into a freshly picked Florida orange. Mastermind is a tremendous IPA, and certainly far and away the best Fiddlehead beer that I've had."
"wonderful aroma as soon as I opened the can. pours an almost transparent yellow. No joke, this beer truly tastes like pineapple juice, Such a different wonderful flavor, my only issue is the thin mouthfeel but otherwise this is an awesome brew and def better then a lot of their other offerings"
"can dated 6/24/16...cool design! slightly hazed golden straw color, dense white head leaves great lacing. definitely looks different than your typical IIPA but nice nonetheless! "
L: Warm peach and apricot hues with minimal haze and a fluffy white head
"Very good beer, but not what I expected. Pineapple dominated the taste for me."
"Straw gold pour with a light head; nice hazy look to it. Aroma is all acidic fruit - pineapple, some lemon - mixed in with mango and guava. I've never used the term ""juice-bomb"" before...and I won't start now because this was a pineapple bomb. In that sense - gotta be in the mood for that island fruit because the taste profile is dominated by it. Malt probably keeps The flavor somewhat restrained but isn't really noticeable. Finishes with a pungent gauva-like aftertaste but, again, this baby screams pineapple. Fruit-forward IPA if there ever was one."
Pours a cloudy golden straw color with a 1-finger white head. Good retention on the head and leaves a nice crown of lace as it dissipates. 
"Pours hazy light golden, thin white head, leaves a little soapy lace. Big juicy citrusy aroma, light malt. Excellent hop forward juicy taste, light sweet malt. Silky soft thin to medium mouthfeel. Such a light bright tasting IPA. Delish!"
Pleasantly surprised by the Mastermind. I was hoping to score second fiddle agin but this is a refreshing change. A summery brew it was pleasant to sip on Mastermind at the winery across the street with live music mowing down an outstanding pulled pork sandwich from Bluebird BBQ.
"I was a little let down by this. I was expecting more from all the build up. Fantastic mouth feel and well attenuated as an IPA should be, but the hops were barely there for me. Very light tropical notes with a tiny bit of citrus. Not at all what I would expect in a DIPA. There was also a little astringency, almost medicinal taste, with the alcohol apparent. Their Second Fiddle DIPA is way better, in my opinion."
"Can dated 6/9/16; drank on 6/14/16 thanks to CBC Westford; I like this much better than the Second Fiddle for my tastes; light body, fresh, hoppy but carrying a hidden 8.1% ABV, sign me up anytime"
"Happened upon a four-pack of this brew at Craft Beer Cellar in Westford earlier today after work and just couldn't wait to crack one open to see how it stacks up to one of my absolute favorite NE IPAs, Second Fiddle! Fiddlehead is one of the best breweries I've visited in my 6 years of drinking beer; insanely fresh samples (once got a taste of Second Fiddle that was kegged that day and had just been put on before I came in!), a good gift shop and very friendly staff. A great thing about this beer in particular, though, before I get into the review proper, is that 25% of the sales go to a charity supporting the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital. Can't beat that."
Amazing citrus nose. Hazy orange. Love the feel in my mouth sticking around after every swallow. This is another excellent Fiddlehead.
canned 06/09/16
Had this last batch fresh out of a can in a tulip.
Poured from a can into a tulip. Slightly hazy yellow pour. More tropical than piney but maltier than I prefer my IPA's. Worth searching out overall but there are better NE IPA's available.
"Pours opaque copper with a two finger head. Smells of sweet tropical citrus. Taste is a rush of pear-like flavor and citrus, quickly into somewhat brash bitterness. Somewhat dry, and pretty light. The more I drink it the more it tends to lean on the bitterness. Overall, not bad. Maybe a little less than I was hoping for, but not bad."
Canned 10-30-2015 - Consumed 12-18-2015
"Aroma and Appearance: It pours a cloudy golden yellow colour with one finger of foam and some slow rising bubbles. The aroma is sweet dough, mild lemon, caramel and lychee with hints of biscuit and a floral overtones."
12oz. can into a Hop Showers glass. 
"Positives: appearance, feel, clean finish; quite smooth for a double IPA"
Need to give this another try. It was a 3 month old can and I think it wasn't treated well temperature wise. Very bitter flavor. Not the melon bomb sans bitterness I keep hearing about.
Review from notes (drank Aug. 6th)
Another winner from Fiddlehead. This is the 3rd IPA I've had from Fiddlehead and all have been excellent. Nice aroma. Nice hop hit up front that's just right followed by amazing fruity flavor. Great beer from a great brewery. A must stop whenever I'm in VT.
"Very light in color with a huge citrus nose. Pineapple, mango with a hint of pine. Taste was much of the same, very high citrus flavor, mango and pineapple. The pine in the aroma becomes a bit lost and the body seemed a bit thin, possibly due to the grain bill used? Overall a great IPA and I'm glad to have gotten to experience it. I really like what Fiddlehead is putting out there."
"12oz can, didn't see a date, but was brought back just a few days prior from Vermont. Poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Thanks to Steve for his generosity. Enjoyed on 8.17.15, reviewed from tasting journal. "
"A: Soapy, white, 1/4 finger head. The liquid is a soft orange-y color. Opaque with a very slight haze. Though murky, it is definitely an attractive beer. "
"A:light golden color, with a little head. S: Tropical fruits and some lemon peel. T: Pineapple, some passion fruit and some lemon zest. M: That nice creamy FH mouthfeel. O: Just a solid imperial IPA. So different than second fiddle on the taste, but still just as tasty"
"Excellent brew! a top notch, hoppy brew that has you seeking another. These guys can brew some good beer!"
12oz can poured into a globe.
"Looks like grapefruit juice in the glass. Straw color and totally opaque. Aroma is grapefruit, pineapple, melon, slight grassy notes, and very juicy. The juicy citrus and tropical fruit play nicely with the bitter, grassy hops. This beer is a month old and the hops still taste fresh. I get some pine resin as well. Not too sweet. The mouth feel is soft, almost pillowy mid palate then finishes very dry. Slightly over carbed. I've only had a can or two each of the top IPAs, but I would put this right up there with Green and AGE and prefer it to SoS."
Can date of 7/17 so...
"Incredible nose. Pine and citrus. Unlike any IPA I've had. Nice IPA flavors. Pineapple, grapefruit, fresh, green pine resin. Malty backbone and creamy mouth feel. I note a subtle velvety presence of oats. Terrific."
Pours a nice unfiltered straw with a nice head.
Huge thanks to jkrug5 for this extra!
"Canned 8/7/2015, bought the next day at the brewery. Props to Fiddlehead for a very efficient system. We drove by to see 300+ people in line, and gave up, only to return an hour later. The line had dissipated completely, but still, anyone who wanted a case got one. Super quick and I actually felt like these guys were happy that people were getting to try their beer, unlike some of the bigger names in the area. "
tasty pineapple goodness..
"Light colored double IPA that looks almost like a pale ale. Great citrus/juicy flavors, but not your typical NE hop bomb that is so common among highly rated NE IPAs and DIPAs. No question that this is the best tasting beer that is predominantly hopped w/galaxy hops, at least that I've ever had."
Looks and tastes like a fruit smoothy... pineapple-kiwi-melon. Outstanding. I want more.
"lighter/pale yellow (lighter than most DIPAs) with plenty of carb. juicy pineapple/citrus notes in the nose. Taste follows, drinks really easy for a double. Great brew."
"I love straw colored IPA's and this one fits the bill. Poured into an Upland snifter, very opaque. I get a very unique hop aroma and taste from this beer. Balanced and not boozy at all!"
"Had this on tap, served in a snifter. Bright orange coloring, not much head. This is a cantaloupe bomb. It's sweet and tropical; but more than anything, I get a smack of cantaloupe. If anything, that's what makes this beer special. An enjoyable DIPA that didn't disappoint me, but didn't blow me away either."
A masterpiece.
A: Pours a very pale clear yellow with minimal white head and decent lacing.
12 oz can poured into water glass canned on 7/24
Got a bunch of cans from the last release and heard so much hype about it. I honestly don't think it is that great or even worth going out of your way for. I think second fiddle blows this beer out of the water as do most of the others. Overall it is good. . . its just missing something that makes it great like the others in its class.
"Sweet malt and hop on the nose. Smooth buttery mouthfeel with waves of hop complexity. Fiddlehead does it again, in its own style."
Uber fresh cans side by side with hopcelot and other half galaxy. straw yellow. nose is pineapple and citric hop. super tasty. super drinkable.
"we went over to get this for the release, and by 1030 or so in the morning, there was a line that wrapped like a snake around the building. there was no way we were waiting in that, i thought for sure all the beer would be gone, so we gave up on it and went elsewhere. to my amazement, when i got home, a friend of mine offered me up a can, since he had scored that day and was feeling generous. lucky me, we shared this a few ways, and all in our party were very impressed. the freshness for one, consuming hoppy beer on the day it comes out is always a treat, but this one is a real unique brew too. it has a super pale color to it, looks like a hazy pils in the glass, with an airy white head over an inch tall and fading only slowly. it smells like amarillo and citra, maybe mosaic, its hard to say for sure if there is more than a few varietals in it, but the nose is amazing. ive been getting pineapple juice from these hops lately, and i got it pretty strongly here too, but there is also notes of mango, aloe, lime zest, and cheerios. pretty basic stay out of the way type malt base, very light body for a stronger ipa, and quite clean in the finish. bitterness is moderate, or rather aggressive but just balanced expertly by the sweeter oily elements of the hops. somehow lighter and more drinkable than others, and with no appreciable yeast flavor going on, unlike many of its vermont counterparts. a beautifully done brew, perfect twist on the style for hot weather, and a beer i was real thankful to get my hands on. these guys are really putting out some delicious stuff lately, wow!"
Poured from a can dated ten days old into a tulip glass. Thanks to MakersNeat for the can.
Very nice Double ipa. A little caramelly at the finish. Very drinkable beer.
One of the best DIPA I've ever had.
Pretty much right off the bat you can smell that this beer is special. It has a really unique hoppy aroma that is very distinct and interesting. The flavor is outstanding. This is one of those beers that you sit and rock your head back-and-forth in disbelief. It really is that good. 
was 11/19/14 so it was by no means fresh but still delicious. I imagine the smell and taste were better fresh. Still world class
Delicious! Extremely smooth and aromatic.
"Every bit as good as Heady Topper in my opinion, and less challenging to acquire, at least in 2014. I even like the 12-ounce can, though I would not object to a 16-ounce repackaging. As good a beer as I have had the pleasure to enjoy. Can't wait for your return."
Outstanding IPA! Really looking forward to trying more Fiddlehead in the future!!!
Simply put this is one of my favorite ipas. I wish they were pumping this out every couple of weeks.
I got lots of lime on the nose and the mouth. a truly unique beer! Loved it!
"Had a few cans that were double-topped and lost all carb. Shame. Great DIPA, probably top-10 in Vermont (which says a lot)."
Good Vermont DIPA
"I could tell it wasn't quite to my top NE IIPA standards in that the appearance is a light lemon yellow as opposed to the apricot color ive come to associate with concentration and complexity... It is hazy though, as it should be..."
"Great VT ipa, leans to the pine side of the hop profile"
"12oz can. Pours a hazy medium yellow gold, with a small white head. Has a very piney citrus grapefruit aroma. Taste is similar with a nice citrus grapefruit tangy hops flavor, mild biscuit malt with some caramel notes as well. A medium body on the palate, good carbonation. Finish is sweet citrus, pine and grapefruit tanginess, with mild malt and caramel notes, slight dry finish. A good tasty solid all around brew."
"Look is a slightly opaque straw yellow color with a thick white head that lingers. Sticky lacing on the glass. Smell is tropical, pineapple-heavy. Taste reflects the same, nice tropical, hoppy, bitter offering. Pretty smooth mouthfeel. Very nice beer"
"Straw colored with a thin head. Partial cloudy. Spatter lacing. Nice malt nose with a tropical hops. Thinking pineapple. Flavor isn't quite up with the nose, but is tasty. Well balanced. Nice feel. Solid beer."
I was fortunate to get several 4 packs of this during his October release from a friend traveling in Vermont. This beer is amazing! 2 weeks in the can showed explosive hop character and reminded me of a tropical hop punch! I added Fiddlehead to my Vermont trip for next year because of this beer. I actually prefer this over Heady Topper now. Get you some!
"From 12/14/14 notes. Thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing a can of this, it wads very good. 12 oz. can into a pint glass."
"This is a good beer. I got this one on a trade. Thanks to a great trader! It is definitely interesting. It reminds me a lot of pseudosue, but not nearly as thick a mouthfeel and a little more lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue. "
Bought it cause some guy in VT said its the better Heady Topper. Tasted like pineapples. I wish i bought more than 1x4 pack on my trip.
"This beer is a muddles dark yellow/pale orange color, extremely thick as some swirling sediment settles, and initially this actually develops a sort of sediment cloud that dissipates to form the complete opacity that it finishes with. The head is an impressively strong and sizeable pure white one, a crown that never drops below half a finger and leaves chunky lacing in good volume."
"Maybe I was expecting more but this one is kinda meh. Trillium does it better, it's called Congress Street."
"Very hazy, looks like pineapple juice. Smells tropical and minty, mild pine. Taste is fantastic and unique. Mild mint, ton of tropical flavor, tangerine, lemon lime, grapefruit, kiwi, minimal bitterness...awesome stuff. I could smell and taste this for hours and get different flavors. Crazy complex, very very easy drinking. Great mouthfeel."
12 oz. can poured into a snifter.
"Mastermind pours very yellow. Being from New England, it reminds me quite a bit of Captain's Daughter. They are very similar with the edge in look going to Mastermind"
"Canned on April 7. I don't know if Fiddlehead has continued to refine this recipe over time, but they clearly have it dialed in now. First had this back in October 2014. I liked it then, but didn't love it. Had a two day old can last night and it was incredible."
"The color, aroma, and fruity finish of this beer is unbelievable. New favorite beer"
Enjoyed poured into a modified tulip.
Absolutely sick. Beats heady. Wonderful color. So much tropical and citrus and pineapple.
"Better than, and harder to obtain than Heady. Best beer I've ever had."
"A very hazy, unfiltered pale yellow. Looks like I peed after a long night of drinking. Sorry. Huge puffy cloud white head. "
"One of the most balanced and flavorful double IPAs. Still backs a bitter punch, but is well rounded to make it an enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"A-	It has a nice hazy straw color, with a thick bubbly off white two finger head. As the head recedes it leaves a nice thick lacing all the way around the glass."
"thanks to Rob for this, shared with tenderbranson69 enjoyed chilled in a willybecker."
Bottle: Poured a pale yellow color ale with a generous pure white foamy head with excellent retention and good amount of lacing. Aroma of fresh juicy hops with nice grapefruit and tropical notes. Taste is also dominated by loads of juicy hops notes with fresh tropical fruit notes as well as some grapefruit. Body is light with good carbonation. World-class IIPA indeed with almost no bitterness and loads of fresh hops juice.
Solid but not sure what the hype is about. Stick with your local DIPA.
I gave this beer a perfect sore because it did everything I wanted to in terms of what I think should be.
The beer comes in a golden orange color.
"This beer is Matt Cohen's (Fiddlehead's) best brew ever, and should be renamed Masterpiece. When you open the can, hints of pineapple, and citrus come oozing out, getting your taste buds ready for a treat. It has a bright yellow color, not gold, and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. Mastermind IPA is currently my favorite beer, and is on the same level of greatness as Heady Topper."
Spot on in every way!
"Thanks to baybum for this little can of a beer. I’ve been rolling around in glorious, world-class IPAs the past couple of weeks, so I’m looking for one more. Greedy, I am. 12 oz. black and white can with a 10/23/14 date (yeah!) dumped into my Creature Comforts glass that I’m growing more & more fond of. "
This poured out as a hazy orange color with a nice thick head on top. The smell of the beer has lots of hops on the nose. The taste of the beer has a subtle sweetness with a good bitterness and a slightly herbal spice finish in there too. The feel is creamy and smooth. Overall its a solid brew.
"10/02/14 canning date. Lots of pineapple and resin, hops starting to oxidize a touch. Lots of sludge at the bottom of the can."
"I just don't get the hype with this one. Four pack canned on 11/15/14, purchased for $11 on 11/26/14 close to the source. Second batch in a row I find it to be harsh and over carbonated."
Poured from a 12oz can dated 10/9 into a LA teku.
"This one tasted like baby aspirin or Smarties; some serious powdered orange candy notes in the nose and, more prominently, in the taste. Poured from the can as the second to last beer in an epic tasting featuring lots of HF growlers, a sip of sunshine, a pseudo sue, and a fat heads. Not the star of the evening, but quite memorable."
Many thanks to angrybabboon for the chance to try this.
2014-10-21
Suoer fresh can thrown in as an extra on a trade. It had a very Tired Hands IPA-esque taste to it. Definitely enjoyed it immensely
I poured this beer into a glass... 
"12oz can. Dated 10/9/2014 at the bottom. Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass 10/21/2014. Should be better than it was the last time I had it, when it was about 6 weeks old.."
"Poured from a 12 oz can purchased at Beverage Baron in Barre, VT on my vacation. Date on can is 10/2/14."
"Got some eight day old cans from a friend. Wow. It was so fresh (how fresh was it????) it tAsted like I was drinking from a growler. Color a bit odd, almost creamy white, but unfiltered which is how I like it. Taste lemon zest for sure. Very original, super high end and super easy drinking for 8.1 percent. A real playa in the VT brew games!"
"This beer is extremely drinkable for an 8.2% beer. Tastes juicy, clean finish. Wish this beer was made more frequently. It's up there with the best IPA's I've tasted. Has a Hikl Farmstead type feel to it."
Can from Fiddlehead.
"Can. Pours an opaque orange/yellow color. Big, fluffy, lasting head. Loads of snaked lacing. True to Vermont DIPA form, this brew is excessively hopped with new varietals. Hops on the nose have nuances of green onion and bubblegum. Grass and citrus and lots of tropical fruit notes. Very exciting nose. Flavor starts off green and herby. Grass, onion, weed, moss. Then comes the parade of tropical fruits that are specifically peachy and apricotty. It finishes with a serious bubblegum, clementine and tangerine flavor medley. I love the hops used here...what are they??? Medium body and softer carbonation. Bitterness is lasting and sneakily powerful. Light hint of alcohol. This is up there with some of the best Vermont DIPAs I have had. I actually prefer this to their newly acclaimed 2nd Fiddle. Boy, here comes another VT brewery!"
Consumed 10/15/14
Creative IPA with strong citrus notes and a clean finish. It will leave you warm all over. My go-to after a crappy day in the office. Folks stand outside the brewery for 30 minute waits every time Fiddlehead announces they're releasing more cans of this delicious brew. 
Look: A hazy golden straw with burst of orange through out. Reminds me of Nelson from alpine. 
12oz. can poured into a snifter glass. Canned on 10/2/14.
"Canned on 10/9/2014. Pours a tangerine hue with a hazy clarity and a quarter inch, loose, white head that dissipates into a soapy slick that coalesces around the edges. Nose expresses citrus, pineapple and rind. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a subtle piney quality and a slight candied flavor to the fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a crisp carbonation and a pleasant acidity. Overall, another top-notch IPA coming out of the Northeast Kingdom. I think I may prefer this one to Heady, but falls a little shy of Julius."
"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a tulip. This was canned on 10/2/14 (date stamped on bottom of can), so 12 days ago."
Poured from one day old growler
A-slightly hazy golden color with a nice white head and good lacing
Call me crazy but I think this is overhyped or I drank a bad batch. Scent & look are great. The taste is a sharp vt cheddar cheese. Cheese! This tastes like a sharp cheddar cheese. Thankfully I like cheese. No need to pair this with cheese. Cheese. This is cheese.
"Can from MrBarleywine, thanks for the opportunity! Dark straw color with a decent sized bubbly white head that sticks itself to the glass on the way down. Pine, green onion, resin with faint tropical fruit hop aromas especially at initial pour. Malt, yeah maybe a hint of bread or cracker. The flavor does hold a bit more maltiness but there is a solid hit of pine and resin and just a touch of tropical fruitiness. 8.1 % but extremely quaffable. I quite like this beer, second fiddle is a bit better in my opinion, but I could never turn this beer down."
"Tastes like a lavender lemon drop, and is so refreshing and unique. Lightly hazy with bright citrus notes. 2016 Batch 1 has a more muted flavor profile than past releases. Still my favorite Fiddlehead beer!"
"Wow. And when Raul says, ""wow,"" he means ""wowie to the zowie."" This is an interesting one, my children."
From a 12 ounce can into a snifter.
From a 12 oz can.
Just under four weeks of age.....
"I purchased a 4-pack of cans at the Fiddlehead Brewery, and can say the BA rating of 97 for this is exactly 3 points too low. It tasted incredibly close to how I remember Heady Topper, and maybe even better. We're headed to Stowe, VT 2 days from now so I'll be anxious to try this side by side with Heady. I'm not even sure if I'll be able to tell them apart, but it'll be fun trying."
UNIQUE. It's getting harder to say that these days. Go Matty O. Getting Masterminded with The Full Cleveland capped HopJam oh so sweetly. :-)
"Wow!!!! This beer is right up there with Heady Topper and my fav Abner from Hill Farmstead Brewery. I live in NY and it is at a minimum 2.5 hours away to get any of the fabulous VT beers. This one is worth the drive!!! Very smooth with nice piney, citrus flavors. You can't really tell you are drinking an 8.1% beer."
Nose was slightly citrus and little dank. taste was very tame with a tad of maple at the finish. hard to fathom that this was a dipa. It was disappointing
"This was excellent! I could smell it as soon as I opened the can and it smelled great, like standing in an apricot field in May, light, springy and happy. Having gotten accustomed to beer of this ilk being a somewhat cloudy orange, I was surprised as how clear and pale it was, more yellow than anything else. But the taste put aside any fears of this being a lightweight. It was awesome, following the nose but going beyond that. It was very fruity, light and happy with a good sweetness that never went over the top. No hint whatsoever of the 8.1% ABV. I would gladly take another case of these any day!"
"Pours a cloudy, golden color with a nice head and a few floaties. You can tell it's going to be juicy. The smell is strong, full of citrus, with a bit of dank as well. The dank comes through a bit more in the taste, but it's still mostly citrusy hops and it's strong! Its lack of bitterness is notable given how the amount on hops. Mouthfeel is great. It's a fantastic beer. I have to admit, I was a little shocked as I had never heard of this beer before. You don't try some new, unknown beer very often and get a real, world-class DIPA."
"L - clouded, small head, miny sediment chunks sink to the bottom"
awsome.....wow.....its so fresh and so citrusy and smooth..awsome mouthfeel and very easy drinking im kinda blown away
"Cans purchased at Fiddlehead Brewing Company in Shelburne, VT."
ours a cloudy blonde color with a light orange hue into my glass. Two-finger head to boot. I haven't tried any of Fiddlehead's stronger offerings.
"Color is straw/light orange. Pours cloudy, almost opaque with the good stuff. Medium head falls to a small sticky ring. Aroma is orange/tangerine/lime with some cannabis and pineapple; a little sweet malt and alcohol in the background. Taste is similar, orange dominates early, then becomes dank and finishes with a trace of hot alcohol. Mouthfeel is like crawling into a hop sleeping bag. A lot like Heady but has some interesting hop character of its own. The only real fault is a touch of hot alcohol - smooth that out and it would be damn near perfect. I want to taste this alongside Heady soon."
Awesome DIPA! Very similar to Heady and Lawsons DS. These Vermont IPA 's are all in a class by themselves.
"Pour is bright golden amber with a light haze and lots of tight white head. Nose is sticky caramel, slightly stale grain, a bit resinous and good bit of grapefruit and citrus. Taste is a bit cleaner, less grain but it was a bit stale in the nose, still some sweet sticky malt foundation but not overpowering, loads of citrus and dusty grapefruit, resinous hops mostly cleaned up. Light body and moderately carbonated, gentle bitterness through the finish and a soft feel."
"This is a spectacular double IPA, definitely in my top 10 along with HT, SoS, DS, Abner, and the Trilliums and Tree Houses. OK, at least top 20. Beautiful color, incredible nose, and a mega-blast of flavor, plus one of the coolest labels."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, canned on 8/21/14. Pours a cloudy yellow, with a one inch head, that leaves behind plenty of lace. "
Date: 08/27/14
Very smooth double IPA. Not over the top hops.
Poured from can into large tulip glass
"Today 3 of us did a comparison tasting of 4 IPA/IIPA's brews: The brews were New Glarus Scream, Revolution Anti Hero, and Fiddlehead Second Fiddle and Mastermind. Second Fiddle came out on top with a rating of 5.0. Two of us feel it is the best IPA on the scene today. Scream came in a solid second at 4.5. It was a surprise to all three of us because we had not had it before. Great nose, nice color, great taste. Very Solid. Anti-Hero was well liked by all three of us and came in at 4.25. But Fiddleheads second brew Mastermind did not quite live up to our hopes. In at 4.0."

"Fiddlehead Brewing Company - MasterMind Double IPA, poured into a DFH Spiegelau IPA glass."
"What can I say. Fiddlehead has done it again. Another masterpiece dipa. Possibly the best dipa to date. Huge hop aroma. The taste definitely carries over from the smell. Lots of galaxy hop taste in this one. Super excited that they released this in cans.. For all who venture to vt for the monster heady topper, this one is on par if not surpasses the hoppy flavor. Honestly I wish fiddlehead was more consistent with the dipas they put out."
Fortunate enough to grab a couple growlettes of this new brew in Shelburne. I was given the impression that this is a smaller-batch brew that wouldn't stick around for very long. This is a new DIPA from Fiddlehead hopped with predominantly Galaxy hops. Should be interesting. Served in a Fiddlehead snifter.
This is one of my favorites from BG.
"Growler purchased at Brew Gentlemen in Braddock, PA."
"A - Hazy, nearly opaque orange body, milky, with a moderate light, almost white head, and extensive lacing."
"Pours cloudy gold. All citrus on the nose, tropical fruit, tang. Taste is all juice with some citrus rind bitterness at the end. Texture is smooth and soft, very quenching. Great beer!"
"really tasty double from these guys, seemingly mostly if not entirely mosaic driven, i liked it a lot, but not as much as their base ipa, which is one of the best of these hazy east coast styles i have had in awhile. thicker than the ipa, denser, but still with a smooth uniform haze without any visible particulate in here. awesome aroma from the hops, juicy and more sweet than bitter by a mile. pineapple and lime, even mango to this, really fruity, a little better in the aroma and the flavor for me, the malt picks up midway in the flavor, and it starts to interfere a little bit. still the hops dominate, it just ends up a little unresolved i think, like it needs a higher IBU count or something, it lingers long, and while oily and hoppy, is also thick and sweet. there is a bit of booze sting here, not harsh at all, but really pretty evidently strong. less carbonation than the regular ipa too, but in a beer like this i dont really mind. impressive overall flavor profile, but this one seems less unique and perfected than their ipa, and represents more of the bandwagon type of hazy ipa, it didnt wow me the way the regular one did, but still, this is as good as any of the ones people are freaking out about..."
"Hazy colored north east style DIPA. Big juicy fruit flavors , such as grapefruit and pineapples, Low bitterness, tons of tropical aromas, absolutely delicious !"
Hazy lemon with white foam. Sweet fruity hoppy aroma. Complex sweet and bitter hop taste that is layered. Sophisticated DIPA and a pleasure to drink.
"L: yellow hazy with 1"" head. Good retention. "
Look out Tree House.
"L: Darker orange yellow hues like pineapple, orange, guava juice with an ample white head and incredible lacing"
Look: Deep orange and very hazy
"Hazy. Tries it's best to replicated what TH and Trill are doing. It does a good, not great job. It's a great beer, slightly locking in hop and mouthfeel."
750ml swingtop poured into Brew Gentlemen stem glass:
Poured into a large Cognac snifter I got at Bon Ton from a 750ml BG swing top growler.
"Pours a semi-clear, liquid gold color. Honey. Not turbid, but not clear. Truly speaking, this should be the definition of ""hazy"". Micro-particulate hangs in suspension, upon close examination. A very fat finger of completely foamy off-white head. Head hangs around for a while, and leaves sticky spots of lacing on the glass."
"Tasty and well-balanced. Not as hoppy as Congress Street and others, but really tasty except in direct comparison."
Hazy tangerine color with a thin head.
"Amber orange pour. Solid Portland Maine IPA. Very good for IPA. Has quite a bit of bitterness, and a strong finish with aftertaste of hops. Not as strong as Heady Topper."
8/11/18...pours bright brilliant gold with ring of white foam. Citrus nose. Malt forward flavor. Chewy mouthfeel. Surprisingly bready in the background. Gravitates towards being a pale ale. Tasty.
Semi-transparent straw color with a white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a hoppy with a citrus accent. Taste is also a hoppy with a citrus accent.
"Burnt gold pour, 1 finger of head, small specs of lacing throughout. Floral aroma,mango, light peach, resins. Fairly sweet, stronger mango/melon note, light astringency, pineapple, resin, sweet malt. Medium body, drying finish."
"Finally after 3 years got my hands on a 16 0z can that survived a friend's 2 wk vacation unchilled. Pours a beautiful gold, dark on top, light on bottom. Has a nice white foamy head that leaves bubbly lacing behind. The aroma is rich with flowers and tropical fruit. The taste follows with an earthy bitter follow through. The mouthfeel is creamy."
"Pours amber orange with an active head during pouring which fades to a small fluffy off-white head moderately quickly and clings nicely to the sides of the glass leading to significant lacing during drinking. Aroma is of grassy, citrus hops with a bit of dank thrown in. Taste follows with a big burst of grassy hops with citrus & touches of light sweetness of peach, floral, & caramel malt. Each sip ends with just a hint of biting bitterness. The taste overall reminds me somewhat of Heady; this is not a juicy fruity NEIPA, but it is an excellent IPA with great flavour & mouthfeel."
5/17/18 canning
"Very juicy and citrusy. Slight haze, but not overly done to be lumped into the “NE IPA” style. Delicious and scary crushable 8.0% DIPA."
FOUNDATION EPIPHANY DIPA 5/31/18
"On tap at Nocturnem Draft Haus in Bangor ME. Pours an opaque burnt yellow color with a nice, persistent head. Initial impression is a huge dose of tropical fruits - mango, orange, grapefruit, peach, and probably some others in there - nicely balanced by malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and sticky; carbonation is perfect. Alcohol is well hidden - very easy to drink. Finish is smooth and gentle - very little residual bitterness."
Packaged 3/7/18. Opened can — could immediately smell the hops and citrus — and poured into a Foundation Belgian-style glass. 
Love the hop presence in this one. Juicy but still has a bite. Smells awesome. Slight over carbonated mouthfeel but very good brew.
Mad good
Can from jerkstore
Poured into a 16 oz ribbed IPA glass canned on 3/07/18. Pours a dark yellow orange with a pretty massive amount of floaties. Has a good size 2 finger head that leaves plenty of laze.
"Outstanding IPA! Waves of hop flavors keep coming at you. Long, long aftertaste stays with you like a faithful dog. Hazy, golden and unfiltered. Foundation's Venture is a great beer. This double IPA ups the ante."
Maine IPA done right
Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.
"Out of a can into an imperial tulip pint glass, canning date was illegible. Poured a hazy orange with floaties with a nice white head that quickly dissipated leaving some lacing. Smell was citrus with a touch of melon. Taste was similar but less citrus and fruit than I expected. Smooth and easy to drink, but there were a few off flavors and overall I found it more of a decent IPA than an outstanding one."
16 ounce can dated sometime in September. My bad for waiting on this one. Poured into a tulip. Poured muddled orange with rosy highlights. Finger of head with good lacing. Haven’t seen an ipa out of a can lace this well. Th nose is huge citrus and tropical sweet fruits. 
Pint can
One of the best brews out of Maine. My go to IPA.
"Epiphany was great. Had this on draft. Mouth feel was incredible on this. Smell was fantastic. Super fresh, super crisp. Juicy smooth taste. One of the better ones I've had."
Hazy light orange with two-plus fingers of off-white head. Nice lacing.
"A very turbid, dark yellow appearance with a thin 1/2 finger of head in my snifter. "
Growler picked up from the brewery yesterday
"16 oz canned on 8/30. Thanks to the @dirtystayout for hooking me up! Beautiful bright orange body, nice inch and a half of fluffy head that left ample lacing on the glass and some cloudy remnants/ring around the glass. Incredible smell to this one, very citrusy and sweet, a little piney. Nice bitter taste, grapefruit and orange rind. Full mouthfeel and perfectly carbonated. This is a really well made and tasty beer. Wish I had easier access to Foundation Brewing. This would be a regular for me."
8-30-17 Poured from a 16oz can into pint glass. Thanks so much Ryan for this can. 
"This is a very good DIPA but for me it shouldn't be on the top 50 IMO. like i said its really good but not better than others I've had from Veil, TH, Tired hands, Tripple Crossing...Just to name a few!"
A-1 finger of white non sticky head atop a clear light golden brew. 
"Look: a clear orange to an auburn color, one inch head, no real lacing"
Best beer they do by a lot.
16 oz can date 6/19/17
"As the #3 rated Maine beer, I expected a lot from this one and was pretty disappointed. I had this out of the can and it was very fresh (5 days old). It is very light in color, clarity and mouth feel. Very little head. The taste is nice off the bat, but left a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall, slightly better than average DIPA."
"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a nice looking hazy orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. The smell had a resinous and piney oily bitter hoppiness. The taste had an amplified sweet to bitter resinous oily hops. There’s a sligh bitter orange to grapefruit aftertaste with a sticky palatable finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with sipping to sessionable quality about it. A decent pounding on my tongue of harshness but nothing overbearing. Overall, I say this was a very nice DIPA that I would have again."
"Beautiful beer! Pours a somewhat clear straw yellow to orange with a nice white head. A bit of haze, possibly chill haze tho. Nose is bright! Crisp tropical fruits like mango and guava, pungent citrus like grapefruit pith and orange peel. Taste is a thing of beauty! Guavas, mangos, light pinnaple, grapefruit juice and peel, oranges, lemon zest and sticky gummy pine sap/bark all wrapped up neat on a nice pale malt bed. A bit of stickyness that transforms to a nice creaminess on the mouthfeel. Crisp and super clean finish. If you were to close your eyes you might thing you were drinking a hazy juice bomb but you're not! This beer is one of the finest IPAs/DIPAs I've had to date. "
On tap at the brewery. From notes. Reviewed 11 September 2015.

"One of the often forgotten ""Best IPA's"" on the East Coast! Try you will like it if you enjoy a citrusy and smooth IPA. Terrific brewery and only 10 minutes of Route 95 (Maine Turnpike) in Portland, Maine. Really friendly and welcoming staff. :)"
"The beer pours the expected hazy orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is pretty nice as well, as I get considerable tropical fruit, orange citrus and a hint of dank weed. The flavor profile replicated the nose pretty closely, but it wasn't quite as ""juicy"" as I was expecting (given the aroma profile), and the mouthfeel seemed a bit thin. Also, while the alcohol was generally well integrated into the flavor profile, there was a bit of a bite on the finish from the noticeable alcohol (which I guess isn't a huge surprise, given the abv. in this beer). Drinkability is pretty good otherwise, and frankly, I was surprised by the 8% abv. (I would have guessed something in the low 6% range)."
"Deep golden, orange hue, light haze, big white head and tons of lacing. Aromas of citrus, mango, pine and dank. Notes of candied grapefruit, orange pulp, mango, pineapple, pine and dank resinous greenery. Medium body, slick slightly oily on the palate in a good way, coats with a lightly bitter finish. Amazing DIPA, straight forward and beautifully done."
"Poors two finger white head that fades slowly. Deep dark orange coloring. Nice lacing. Aroma is pine and peach and pineapple. Taste f orangepeel , peach, grapefruit, floral, citrus, lemon/lime, grassy, minty, herbal, sweet malts, pine on the back bone. nice balanced and yet complex. Excellent DIPA. Look forward to more from them."
"had this on tap at a maine tap takeover. nice looking brew. notes of bright orange, peach, grapefruit, floral, pithy citrus peel, lemon/lime, grassy, minty, herbal, bready and sweet malts, pine on the finish. really really nice balance - mouthfeel is medium bodied, pretty solid. overall this is a clean and balanced brew, and I definitely appreciate that given the current craze for one note beers that may be massive in flavor delivery, but fail to come together as a whole in the end. I would definitely buy this if I had regular access!"
Pours a clear yellow/orange with minimal head and thin lacing. 
"Pours a nice orangey light amber, little haze, a few floaties, two finger bubbly head that reduces to a halo and a film. Nice lacing."
Very Good beer . Not swish but what is. Surprisingly the color is a light amber and fairy clear. the clarity scared me . I though i was in for a tasteless beer but this now was solid good hoppy floral aroma great bitter/hoppy goodness on the palate. great beer
Golden orange color...grapefruit and mango smell with spicey overtones. Taste is citrusy sweet at first with nice piney bitterness at the end. Awesome flavor.
"Look: Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass. Pours a deep orange golden color, and leaves a finger of head. Leaves a nice white foamy lacing around the glass upon drinking, with a moderate amount of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. "
1-24 can drank on 2/9/17
"Tall can, 1-24-17 (?) on the bottom, but hard to read."
"Love the concept, not west coast not northeast, its own creation. Golden dark rustic looking Ale, good mix of fruity piney bready flavors. Nice crisp full bodied Ale."
"Look:Clear, yellow, with a nice sized head that receded quickly."
Not super fresh but must not hold up very well compared to the Hoof beers I'm used to.
Canned 6-28-16. Drank 07-08-16.
"Got this on 12/22 from my Maine connections (kids). Golden orange on the pour with minimal head. Smell is the awesome part of this beer orange, tangerine big time. Taste is compatible with the smell. Good feel not great. Overall I rate better than other top rated D/IPA from Maine."
Good
Tendency for head when pouring but the bubbles are not dense. From 16oz can into tulip. Most of head dissipates quickly. 
"Just told my wife I had an epiphany, she looked at me awaiting further commentary but I just walked away leaving her guessing. This was about 15 minutes ago she's either left wondering, or just assumed it was my randomness coming full force, either way I'm cracking number two, onward and upward."
Had this on tap at the taproom.
"Semi-hazy amber-orange with a fizzy white head that quickly recedes to a fizzy bubbly ring and then completely dies off, looking not far off from spiced rum."
"From a 16oz can, dated 09/12/16. Served in an imperial pint/nonic."
My favorite from foundation by far. Definitely up there with some of the top Hop offerings around New England but still a step behind some of the best out there from TH and Trillium etc.
From 16oz can into a chalice glass.
This beer for being an 8% drinks exceptionally smooth and easily. Generally being in preference of session ales this beer surprised me and quite frankly scared me. It drinks with a big citrus and floral character in both the taste and the nose while the body is significantly lighter than what would be expected. The body while supplying fair mouth feel is a smooth and light pedestal to display this Hop forward IPA on.
32oz howler from the brewery in Portland Maine
"On tap at the brewery. Pours hazy orange with fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is tropical fruit, citrusy hops and bready malt. Body is full and smooth. Taste is of tropical fruit, citrusy hops, bready malt and sunflower seeds. Finish is long and semi-dry. Good overall."
"Poured from a tallboy into a snifter, the beer is a deep, slightly hazed, orange-gold coloring with a foamy, clingy, white head. Aromas of orange rind, dried grass, tangerine, peach, pepper spice, and some floral hops characteristics, too. Very aromatic. Flavors are more tropical fruit forward, with notes of pineapple, melon, and mango joining the orange, grapefruit, and peach, all on a bready backbone. Hops characteristics are still grassy, but with a little more herbal twist to it. Smooth and full bodied, with a fruit cocktail and herbal aftertaste. The finish is light, effervesced, and slightly dry. Good beer."
One of the best that Portland has to offer.
"I had been waiting a while to try this one and I'm definitely not disappointed. It pours hazy with hues of copper and gold. The nose is very nice with tropical fruit, pine and citrus aromas. The taste is a delicious mango explosion. The mouth is dry yet still juicy. It features a very nice pine bite that balances the flavors exceptionally well. This is definitely a world-class beer that deserves more hype than it gets."
Poured a nice burnt orange amber color with a white head
Great beer love everything about it. My number 1
Nice taste explosion
"wow! clean and crisp. slight bitter in the middle, dry(er) at the finish and taste buds dancing around at the first sip... sorry, was reviewing after the stunning first sip.... very nice tropical flavors. nothing completely punching the lights out but a very stable, clean and crisp brew. for 8%, this is a nice, easy-to-drink brew...."
Was finally able to make it up for a release. Great orange color with a creamy white head. Citrusy nose and taste. Mouth feel was a little different than I anticipated. Overall really impressed and glad I finally got to check this one off the list
"Big thanks to @walderek for this Solid, Glorious Maine Offering. My first from Foundation."
Pours a cloudy orange/light copper color with a small foamy head.
"Dat Piff!! Definitely a ""Maine"" IPA. The way tropical juicy notes mix with dank resinous hops is amazing. Seems very well made and sits clean on the pallet."
"16 oz can. Pours cloudy deep apricot orange, thick white head slowly fades, rings of lace. Ripe tropical fruit aroma, mild citrus. Light caramel malt sweetness met by bold bitterness, pine and dark tropical fruit with some woodsy grassy hops in the end. Super dry bitter finish. Medium slick mouthfeel. Very good IPA with great balance and an array of hop flavors."
"Draught @ Foundation: This one pours a hazy orangish color. It had a frothy off-white head. Nice nose. Some pineapple and other tropical fruits, as wel as some citrus and pine. Taste is very good. The bitterness is a bit subdued. Very malty. Pineapple, citrus, tropical and pine. Very nice!"
"Poured from a can bottled 2/16/16 into pint glass. Pours a medium orange hue with a thin white head and great lacing. The smell is first of grapefruit, Caramel, and maybe some cantaloupe, honestly it smells great. The taste is much of the same with the grapefruity flavors dominating at first, but then you taste the sweetness of the grainbill to offset it you can tell there are some oats in the bill it almost taste gritty sweet. The mouthfeel is great, feels like how you would expect a Dipa to feel, thin to moderate with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall a great Maine offering right up there with dinner id expect(have yet to try). 4.5/5"
Look - murky orange in appearance with a nice big fluffy head. A good amount of yeasty botanicals at the bottom which was the only dislike for me.
Simply. Best Double IPA period.
"Can shared by Curran yesterday, thanks dude."
"Pours hazy bright yellow in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is wet hops, cracker, orange, and tangerine. Very well balanced and not overly bitter. one of the better IPAs I have had in a while. First beer from Foundation and it has me curious to try their other stuff."
"One of the best in Southern Maine. Fruit with hoppy pine undertone. About as smooth as it gets. Brewery is a great place to hang and sample all their beers. Can't stop, won't stop!"
Canned less than a month ago.
From growler filled at brewery.
"Fairly murky appearance, not quite at the pure pulpiness as other East coast DIPAs. Orange with a modest head bearing quite good retention."
"Hoppy, hazy, and delicious. Great IPA. Drink it fresh. I can never decide which I really enjoy more... Epiphany or Substance (from Bissel Brothers, next door)... There can be some slight variation from batch to batch, but they are both really solid."

Can into glass. 2 weeks old
"A - Hazy gold body with a large white head, leaves tight lacing. Large floaties perhaps from the aggressive pour from the can. "
This is wonderful. I would put it on par with Heady and Sip Of Sunshine....most excellent. The balance and flavor is perfect. It is both sweet / citrus like with just enough bitter bite. Very hazy look / color but I prefer that in a beer (I like lots of body and chewiness). I have rated over 500 beers and I would say this is probably in my top 10 or 20.
"The world is a better place for beers like Epiphany. Just an amazing DIPS, with a gorgeous color that approximates the stripe on the can, a delicious hop aroma, and a beautifully smooth finish. Not as magical as the first time I tried Heady Topper, but in the ballpark!"
"One of the best beers I have ever had, someone told me to try this because it was better than MBC Lunch and they were right. Epiphany is an amazing beer and a must try for those who enjoy NE Hops"
"Big, dank hops jump out of the glass on the aroma. Grapefruit and pineapple juice lead the way with oranges, papaya, and apricots. Its hazy and juicy like the New England IPAs, but it nice a really crisp malt backbone that smooths it out without getting too sweet and allows some pine, resin, and earthy bitterness to add a completely different layer to the beer. Top ten IPA for me. Trade for it."
Nice look and smell. Pine and fruit. Smell of pine and juice . Mango. Light body for an ipa. Enjoyable. Would have again
"Wow - I don't know what else to say. Damn this is one tasty brew. Really blew me away. Amazing - fruity flavor that go's on forever. Totally love this beer, can't wait to get up to the "
Can into tulip. 12/29/15 year of the piff. 
"The smell of the beer filled the air as soon as I cracked open the can, and the flavors backed up everything I was smelling - great DIPA from Foundation, the citrus and hops work in perfect harmony to produce a clean, very easy to drink beverage."
"Smooth mouth feel, citrus notes. To me it tasted a little like Julius, this is a nice beer, tastes like a Tree House Style beer but a little crisper"
Shared an Epiphany last night with three friends. Shared Fruit Machine and Alter Ego with them as well. All beers were excellent. 3 out of 4 of us preferred Epiphany to the fantastic beers from Tree House. Epiphany reminded me of the Tree House beers but it seemed slightly cleaner / smoother.
"This beer is excellent. Visited the brewery last week, so the beer is very fresh. look is orange with a two finger head when poured from a 16 oz can into a 20 oz tulip glass. There is some lacing. The head disappears to a film that does not cover the entire top of the beer. The smell is magical orange or tangerine with an added acidic citrus sent. The taste is orange on the front and citrus (not grapefruit, not lemon, not lime but intense citrus blast on the roof of my mouth). Feel is smooth and easy. Overall - one of the best."
Amazing
"A friend had given me a couple of cans of Epiphany and I was quickly hooked. I noted the similarity of it with Lawson's Sip of Sunshine. Being a Vermont resident, Lawson's is somewhat more available to me. But I was intrigued with Epiphany, drove to Portland and grabbed a case. "
One of the best beers I have ever had!
Foundry pouring the best beers in Western MA.
L: Somewhat hazy with minimal lacing and slight foam
POurs a nice golden Amber color. Has a citrusy hoppy aroma. Flavor is bright and clean citrus with a balanced finish. Overall this is a really really nice beer.
"World class IPA, for sure. Beautiful orange-gold body. Dank citrusy and piney aroma that waters the mouth. Taste of apricot, mango, orange, papaya with a soul-satisfying level of juiciness. Finishes with a bitter aftertaste that's crisp and dry. Unreal beer that I hope to have again someday."
Look - That awesome New England hazed look. Gorgeous murky orange color. 
"Pours a light golden, good level of haze, thick fluffy head with tiny bubbles. Nose is fruity and dank, almost like Sculpin on steroids...a bit of earthiness mixed in as well. Good level of body, sweetness from the alcohol mixed in with a nice bitter bite. Solid IIPA, definitely enjoyable and a bit more of a slower sipper."
"It is a hazy orange gold. A soapy, 3 finger egg shell white head. It doesnt have a long retention, but leaves some spotty lacing and leaves a thin layer on top. "
Big thanks to SomethingClever for this
"A double that is very drinkable, but has a tart finish and a sweet aftertaste. Not really what you are I am looking for in a double. There's no hop finish that just keeps hitting you like some of the other great doubles. The hops are overtaken by a juice flavor it seems. Overall a decent double, but the hype seems to have carried it a bit."
Great brew! Hidden gem in Portland. I'd be happy drinking this anyday!
"This is their signature beer and it's easy to taste and see the reasons why. It's not readily available and when they have a release one had better get there early!!! Smooth, nothing overwhelms the senses except the overall greatness of what their brewer has done and what this beer is. I am 70 years old and don't have the smeller I once used to. If it wasn't for that it would rate 5 fives from me. I have never rated a beer this highly. Can't get enuff of this stuff."
"the color is copper orange with a medium body...it has a lot of sediment(yeast) that comes across very messy in the glass...I usually am charmed by turbidity...but these yeasts are big, not uniform in shape and settle into a rather big pile in the bottom of the glass..."
"My biggest compliment is the mouthfeel, definitely doesn't drink like an imperial; Drinkable. Served draft in a tulip but left with that metallic taste I get from drinking out of a bottle. Good beer, well crafted, little more dry hop and a different malt profile makes me happy happy though."
Draft poured at the brewery
Awesome
Damn solid DIPA! Lots of fresh fruity citrusy hops! Nice and dank with no lingering bitterness! Loved it!!!! Would love to find again!
"L - ever so slightly translucent. Dark, which I like, but not hazy enough!"
A: Pours a glowing apricot color with a one finger bone white head. Light strings of lace down the glass with each sip. 
"Tasted this one about a month after canning. Perhaps it would have been better if tasted sooner, but I wasn't impressed. Though I rate it at 4, I feel like it doesn't taste much better than most beers you could find regularly at the package store."
"Great beer, really enjoyed it."
Shared with JLindros.
"Pours very little head, hazy murky hidden orange color."
Look: pours 1/3 inch head with small to medium bubbles. Orange-amber color. Almost clear; not hazy.
Had gone to Portland and Boston on Beer safari and was looking to tour Allagash and try Bissell Bros. Then of course since Foundation was right next door...
Had a flight at Foundation while hopping around the four breweries in that little slice of heaven in Portland. This beer was so good I had to get a full pour (visited back in the summer so I'm writing this review from memory).
From Notes: Bright orange almost glowing with a great citrus nose. The taste does not disappoint. Great citrusy hops and a slight bite. One of the best DIPAs I have tried in a while and right up there with Dinner in my opinion as the best DIPAs from Maine.
"A remarkable IPA. Fruity, lightly bitter, well balanced. Lives up to its name."
"Beautiful orange beer, it smells citrusy and tastes citrusy. This is the juiciest IPA I've had, and I love it. I've had it in cans, on tap, and in growlers. It's super smooth and drinkable for being 8%, the alcohol is buried beneath the orange and pine. An awesome beer."
"Anymore, any mention of anything ""northeast"" or ""Maine IPA"" automatically sets the bar pretty high. As a pocket of the beer making populous employ the newest and most coveted hops on the planet, their special tropical tang and citrusy bittersweetness evoke thoughts of sherbet and IPA."
Matt at Woodstock Hops 'n Barley hooked me up
"Pours golden cloudy and orange with a one finger head. Smells spicy, hoppy, citrusy, lightly floral and sweet. Taste is crisp, bitters, lightly sweet from what tastes like citrusy juice... delicious with bready malts. Finish is bitter and dry, like a real DIPA. Overall, really impressive and delicious. Love the beer, love the can design. This beer is still relatively young, and deserves a boom."
"Growler filled at brewery on 10/10/15; drank in a 16 oz tumbler on 10/11/15; my personal expectations that came along with the look and smell did not exactly match the fairly bitter taste which underwhlemed me. Still a very good ""Maine IPA"""
"orange copper color, light head that fades quickly, nose is on the dank side (in a good way) not as bright an floral like others of it's ilk. Slight oily mouth feel that lingers behind a bit. Def up there on the list though, well worth grabbing a few."
"very solid IPA. Mouthfeel is good. Its a touch sweeter than the style of IPA i like(from Tree House and Trillium). Malt is present- can taste some alcohol.. Needs a bit more ""juicyness"" for me to love it.."
Clear orange color with light white lacing. The smell is primarily citrus and earthy hops. Taste is more earthy hops with a well balanced bitterness that lasts on the finish. Overall a solid/good beer.
"On tap at Mckays restaurant in Bar Harbor, Maine. Poured into a large willy type glass. Pours a super hazy orange-yellow, with a small head that slowly fades and leaves no lace. Aroma is huge citrus, with grapefruit and fresh orange juice, along with a very slight dank. Taste is great, with lots of the same from the aroma, followed by a tiny bit of pine and resin, a sweet middle, and a nicely balanced bitter finish. Mouth is about perfect, medium body, somewhat dry, clean and refreshing. Overall, this is up there with Dinner as my favorite IPA from Maine."
Poured from a 10 day old can
"Excellent beer! Pleasant non-aggressive mouth feel. Light on the bitterness. Amazing hop bouquet--flavor is a phenomenal blend of tropical, citrus, and pine. Great beer"
Poured from a can filled on 9/9 into a tulip:
That's amazing. Great nose and it's so citrusy :)
L- sorta hazy orange. nice looking beer but im not ooh-in and ah-in.
Amazing. Simply amazing. Delicious malt and hop character. Does not taste like an 8% double IPA. Very very very very amazing. One of the best I have ever had.
3 days old on tap and in cans at the brewery
Huge shout-out to Goblinmunkey7 for the acquisition
A - Pours a hazy medium orange color with a thick lacing ring.
What I judge every other DIPA too. This stuff is phenomenal!
"Another pillowy fluffy north east ipa. Pours a light Orange/ dark yellow. Hop residue floating around. Smell is delicious. Citrus, floral, with subtle pine. When is somebody going to make a candle smelling like these hops. Taste is more of the same. Mango, lemon, pine, and flowers. Delicious. Feel is soft and blankety. A hint of bitter on the finish. Juicy with a subtle dryness. Fantastic beer."
"Had on tap as Armsby Abbey, and was delivered to me in an Abbey snifter. The beer was mostly clear, light-amber hued, orange, golden. About a finger of bubbly white head. Nose was full of tropical goodness and backed by a minor malty alcohol-tinged sweetness. Loved the smell of this beer! The taste doesn't deliver on the greatness the smell promises: tropical notes are more muted. I tasted a light apple flavor as well. Overall, it was a good beer; but I was expecting a bit more."
16oz can.
"Big whale from Foundation in my book. Mosaic and citrus stand out. Amazing beer. Nose is sick. Can't say enough about this hidden gem. If you're ever up in Portland, stand in line for his beaut. Just DO IT!"
"Another Portland tropical DIPA that's just off the charts! Tropical fruit, piney finish, not overly bitter"
STYLE American IPA | ABV 8.0% | AVAILABILITY Year-round
"Wow! It's nice to enjoy an IPA that lives up to the hype. I'm big on the 'nose' of IPA' & IIPA's and this one ranks up there with the best of the best. Mango, pear & tangerines. I hate to use the term 'complex' but this one is surely that. Thankfully I have 3 left to really figure this one out. Well done, Foundation!"
Appearance: Slightly hazed orange-gold. Relatively light. Head is bright-white and creamy. Decent head retention leaves a small cap and collar for the duration. Eventually drops to a few clumps. Some solid lacing. Notches and a few splotches.
Poured from a 3 day old growler.
I love the Great Lakes Brewing 2X IPA and someone recommended this because of it. This is probably my favorite IPA ever. Just awesome citrus and piney notes to a wonderfully thirst quenching beer.
"I'm giving this beer the score that I am because it is easily among the two or three most intensely potent hoppy beers I've ever had. Think Lawson's sip of sunshine level aromatics, but with nectary mosaic and spicy Ella bursting out rather than straight citra. For me, it's actually a little too intense. The level of spice and the mosaic character make you want to suck on your tongue after you've swallowed it, which I love, but it is bone dry at 1.009 and for me, I could use a bit more body to back up the incredible hop profile. I'm Giving it the high score that I am bc it really is a stand out beverage and it deserves attention, but personally I wish they'd take the hopping schedule they've come up with and make something with a bit more character in the yeast/malt department. Great beer though if you like to get smacked in the face with peaches and mangoes. I've had it from cans that were a couple days old as well as on draft and I found the draft to be a bit more balanced and drinkable (this was also an earlier batch). Either way though, great beer and worth hunting for. More in the stone dryness/clarity department than in the tree house/trillium/HF cloudy, juicy New England trend. I'd love to put it next to Dinner as they both finish very dry and I feel like they have similar hop profiles."
"After a friend landed a few of these and was kind enough to share... it was having Epiphany that made me realize how many good beers are coming out of New England in 2015. Put in on the list... and try it out. Foundation is doing some good work... and nailed it with this one. Tasted a high hint of pine in the finish... so ranks just under some of my other favorites (not a huge fan of pine)... but if I ever come across it again... its going in ""the cart."""
Cans poured into nonic pint taster glass.
"I like a big nose & a strong palate... this is quite delicate & very light, easy drinking, smooth for a double IPA so perfect for high ABV, social drinkers!"
Nose of a hopped up Pilsner. Smooth citrusy sweet finish and overall just stunning.
"5/27/15 can enjoyed on 6/10/15. Smell, oh man that smell. Head died off very quickly (poured into snifter). Something about the body just isn't doing it for me. I was hoping it might be just a tad bit more ""chewy"". Great lacing. Reminds me a lot of Jade down here in NC from Foothills Brewing. I'm not sold on this as being an ""all that ipa"", it is solid though. I'm glad I have three more to test out ;)"
I was fortunate that a coworker went to Maine and was generous enough to get me a couple of cans. I was told they are $4 per 16oz can.
On tap at The American Craft Beer Fest Yesterday. 
Had with the Troller at Beer Fest. This beer is fantastic. Perfectly hoppy and balanced . Awesome.
"Big thanks to my main maine man, gary for the awesomely generous extra! Enjoyed from a beer hunter willie b."
Not much of a head but it leaves ample spots. Dark gold color with a touch of haze. 
"Smells unbelievably good, tropical fruit and citrus with orange being the most prominent. Taste follows, orange was the most noticable but very fruity, dry and smooth finish, easy to drink. My favorite double at the moment, can't get enough of it."
"On tap at the brewery on May 1, 2015. Recent batch. Fresh one coming in a week or two."
"At first smell it is so deliciously pungent. Strong dank pine upfront with a beautiful blend of citrus fruit. Drinks really smooth and nicely dry, not as in your face with flavor as aroma but still really refreshing and crisp. Wish this was a beer I could always get, was real nice surprise in my latest trade."
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Foundation Brewing Company, Portland, ME"
Great citrus character throughout the beer. Awesome mango/pineapple/grapefruit nose. Super smooth citrus hops flavor. Real easy drinking too. Top five for me.
Fresh cans. This one's on the top of my doubles list. Love the citra hops. There is a lot of fruit flavor going on. Incredibly smooth and not too malty. Don't expect any bitterness
Burst of tropical fruit juices with a small piney bitterness that blends in perfectly. I was not expecting such a refreshing and unique DIPA but now I definitely need more.
Another awesome Maine beer. Swish and Dinner get all the praise but this is just as good. Maybe even better?
"Phenomenal ""Maine IPA"" "
"Look was ok. I usually like more haze and cloudiness. The small and taste were excellent, but the mouthfeel is where this brew really shines. This has to be the thickest feel of any pale ale I've ever had. Overall this is a solid brew and I highly recommend."
"Incredible fruity bomb. No bitterness, smooth throughout. Is it weird that it still tastes great warm?"
Pure beautiful hops. Heavy handed on the hop side but not out in any way. Perfect
Pours a hazy golden orange color with a 2-finger off-white head. The head is gone quickly but leaves a crown of lacing around the top of the glass. 
Pours an amberish orange with a moderate off white head.
"Had this on 2015-04-11 in Lititz, PA from a bottle."
16 oz. can poured into a snifter.
"I love Foundation and love IPAs but I think there are slightly too many fanboys rating this higher than what it deserves. (I believe canned about 16 days ago) Cloudy golden color, good head and leaves a solid lacing on the glass. Smell is very aromatic but more fruity and sweet, not the bitterness I'm fond of. Taste I'm torn on; the lacking bitterness of the NE style IPA can be a hit or miss, and I think this is kind of a miss. Very dank and resinous on the mouth but it's kind of biscuity finish is not what I prefer."
"The aroma offers juicy orange, lemon, tangerine zest. A bright and juicy aroma also with some dank qualities in the back."
A: Pours a golden color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice frothy cap that leaves a ring of lace down the glass
Wow. This is a MAINE IPA.
"The hoppiest, juiciest IPA out there!!! Orange, pineapple, burst from the can. Edging the line of too bitter, but never crossing that threshold. Glad the brewery is right down the street."
"Light orange color, small head dissipating to a thin film. "
"Can. Excited for this. Maine is making some noise. Pours a clearish orange color. Medium, frothy white head. Aroma is very, very hoppy. Definitely going for the New England über-hopped IPA style. Columbus, Cascade, Citra, Ella and Mosaic; what a team. I get a very fruity, yet still aggressive hop profile. Apricots, oranges, pine, melon. Sweet, candied malt really props up those hops; who have their own assertive sweetness, too. Flavor is notably potent. I got such a stressed flavor of apricots. Apricot, nectarine, citrus-blend. Finishes pretty coercively. Malt is candied sugar-hop decency. Light alcohol. Very bitter. It's a great beer but I feel like it lacks some of the hoppy intricacies of my favorites. Still, this is a memorable IPA or Imperial IPA."
Complex rich hops provide a robust smooth flavor with pine resins and citrus undertones. This is a quality brew up to high Maine craft standards!
"5 oz. tasting glass on tap at Great Lost Bear in Portland, Maine."
Holy smokes delicious! Pour me another
This beer is amazingly tasty from first taste right through the finish. Everything is just right.
A - Pours a fairly cloudy but extremely bright/light golden yellow with a finger+ of near white fluffy volumnous head. Great lacing and retention.
Another great IPA out of Maine!
16 oz can poured into Speigelau glass
Very smooth and enjoyable taste. I actually liked it more than Swish from Bissell Bros
The most juicy IPA I've ever had.
The aroma is pure juice! This beer is fantastic.
"An extremely tasty DIPA and really glad that Foundation has come out with this. Juicy and quaffable with a very nice nose, the only criticism I can barely muster up is the head and lacing - both of which are there, but just barely. It starts out with a nice finger thick head on the initial pour, but regresses into limited to no head, maybe a couple dots of lacing here and there. "
"This is a remarkable IPA for the fruit flavors it brings forward. Unlike others which feature Grapefruit, this is much sweeter at the start before the more bitter back-of-the mouth takes it down. It is great in its own right and I like it for providing a new take on a popular style that feels like it is starting to get repetitive."
"Incredible. Usually let down by new beers, but this one far exceeded my expectations. Super dank and full bodied."
"First off, I'll say that I love the vibe and the people at Foundation. I tried this beer when they released the first pilot batch on Black Friday and thoroughly enjoyed it, but thought it drank a little hot. This one is really drinkable. "
Served in a tulip at the Great Lost Bear in Portland.
"Canned 7/4 so about 7 weeks old. Beautiful hazy beer as Trillium always does well. I love the soft feel as well. Almost creamy. Smell is a bit light but that’s probably due to the slight age on this one. Taste wise, it’s the first NEIPA that I wish were a little lighter. I can taste the booze and it’s a very full beer. Flavors are unique in a good way and the only thing that would help it would be if it were a little lower in abv I think."
A little too heavy dense of a beer for me.
"Wonderful white wine aroma right away on the nose, which give way to the Nelson and Galaxy hops. Classic New Englang mouthfeel. Hazy to the point of opaque."
This was better than I was expecting. I do think generally like IPAs with added juice but it completely complimented the hop profile and was super juicy but still balanced.
Canned 2 weeks ago.
"Quite subtle grapes - I felt like the pinot gris had a far more distinctive taste and texture to it. These variants seem to have more of a tropical fruit and soft, sweet taste to them than any specific actual wine-like notes to the taste. The dry finish is a nice clean change from the other sweet IPAs I've had - no lingering aftertaste. Thumbs up there."
"Look: Yellow, turbid hazy with a thin white head. Has low carbonation."
"Smell: Tropical fruits pineapple, mango, guava. Mandarin oranges, peach. There's some white grape along with some earthy musty qualities. A hint of Braeady maltiness. The nose is a nice mix of tropical fruits and earthy white grape notes."
"Bit too much wine juice for me, looking for them to dial this in and it will be amazing and shit."
"160z can purchased at the Canton brewery stamped 11/01/17. A gold color and citrusy nose. It seems that the combination of hops and Sauvignon Blanc must have combined with a very similar taste profile. Flavors such as pineapple , mango and grapefruit are evident with the grapefruity dryness on the finish is much like the finish of a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. This beer was a pleasant surprise for us. Enjoyable, tasty flavorful and easy drinking."
Canned 3 weeks ago.
Can from Eric
"Pours dark yellow, very hazy with small white head. "
"Pours hazy orange with thick head and very sticky lacing. The nose is citrus with some floral and hops. The taste is beautiful, very fresh citrus mix with a dry hoppy hit, some nice sweetness on the back end with a hint of grape. Getting a mild bite with zero alcohol considering this is 8.5% you would never know it, very smooth and clean. The feel is light to medium with some dryness on the finish. This is a well done beer, great flavors all around and just a pleasure to drink."
"After trying DDH Congress, DDH Summer, DDH Sleeper, and Galaxy Fort Point, this was best in show. Vibrant colors, murky inviting haze, lots of juice, negligible bitterness and easy to drink."
A must try if you ever get the chance.
"Really hazy dark yellow color with off-white head. Aroma is really hoppy with dank notes, sweet grapes, overripe pineapple and grassy hops. Taste is sweet at first but continues really dry with intense hop notes. Dank, grassy, unripe grapes and pineapple, really fruity but dry. Medium body, really dry, well carbonated. Overall it's a really nice take on a NE DIPA with really well hidden ABV."
Excellent!!!! By far one of their best beers.
Opaque orange-tan with a light foamy airy head that collapses to nothing uncannily fast--a lot of my Trill IPAs have been like this lately.
"Pours a pretty hazy orange, soft, off white foam."
"Got two cans from John's recent NE trip. It pours of typical trillium haziness and a yellow fizziness. It smells like a wine/beer mixed up concoction. The taste is very similar with a solid, juicy DIPA, which is great on its own, but becomes muddled with the grape juice added. Since I don't love wine, its hard for me to love this beer, the rating reflects me feelings."
"This beer pours a completely opaque cloudy golden orange reminiscent of orange juice. The head is late forming, two fingers, fluffy and white. Retention is above average. The head eventually settles to a half inch ring around the edge of the glass that lasts the duration. There is a bit of spotted lacing left on the glass."
"L - love the colors on the Dialed In labels. So simple and minimal. Really attractive shade of blue too. Pours a faintly milky, pulpy orange haze. Surprise! "
"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a quickly dissipating finger’s worth of white foamy head that left some sly sticky lacing. The aroma starts off with sweet to bitter danky hop oils moving slowly over some grape juice (sharp yet sweet, sly bitter). Danky sweet onion, super subtle pine. Tropical fruity juice. The flavor leans to the sweet danky onion side allowing the hop oils to create a slick sweet free flowing juicy to hop oily aftertaste riding on into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a nice sipping quality about it. Moderate carbonation with a sly stickiness about it nuanced by some sharp to semi-oily yet slick feel, now that’s quite different for a DIPA. I’m guessing the sauvignon blanc grape juice flowing all about, is that what is doing it? Me, I’m not sure. Overall, a fabulous DIPA that really ""dials in"" well in the aroma and flavor with a different sort of feel enacting itself on my tongue. Of course, I would have this again, and can understand why a fair amount of people aren’t going to like this. Those grapes change up the ""feel"" on the tongue, so be ready for it."
"16 oz can poured into a teku glass. Canned on 3/5/2017. Dialed In is a rotating series of double IPAs that have wine grape juice added while the beer is in mid-fermentation. This one features the sauvignon blanc grape, a white varietal that is known for being bone dry with earthy or grassy notes and is a very popular varietal from the Marlborough region of New Zealand. The folks at Trillium thankfully dry-hopped Dialed In with the New Zealand hop Nelson Sauvin to complement the earthy but crisp fruit notes of sauvignon blanc. Other ingredients include Pilsner malts, flaked wheat, and Galaxy hops."
"Thanks to my buddy Sal for the Trillium tasting night. Consistency throughout beers sampled - all have similar characteristics- juicy, dank, pale, light aroma, and a medium + body."
Big thanks to HighLowJack for sending this one! Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Poured from a 16 oz. can into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.
"Typical near orange hazy trillium pour, smaller head. Vinous aroma, white wine, grape, hoppy, citrus peels. White grape, grapefruit taste, light white wine, rinds, hoppy, faint cracker like malt. Medium body, drinks far lighter than 8.5."
"It's been a long time since I've bothered to review a beer but this one was worth it. Just phenomenal. Drank six cans over the course of a couple months since its release and the evolution over that time has been fascinating. From its early days as an ultra dank and bitter, highly aromatic fruit bomb to its current state that has lost some of its crazy hop freshness for a deeply integrated grape character. The complexity is stunning. Fresh stone fruit characters and melon are in play with a touch of mustiness. "
"Hooping and hollering for their third birthday, the beer makers of Trillium turn to wine flavors for their celebratory IPA. Imperial in its status, the hops of Nelson Sauvin for a tangy, wine-like zing and then layered with grape juice for a taste to appease both sides of the drinking aisle."
"Pours burnt orange. Two finger white head that fades slowly. Nice lacing. Aroma is citrus, tangerine, grapes and white wine. Taste follows the nose. Excellent DIPA. Love trillium look forward to more from them."
1st IPA from Trillium. This is definitely a juicy IPA with a good amount of hops. There is more bitterness that comes out as the beer warms up. Overall a very solid beer that's worth trying!!
"Pours a turbid peach color with minimal head. Nose is juicy and bright. Citrus to the forefront including oranges, tangerines and grapefruit pith. Light grape juice can be detected. Taste juicy upfront, all the citrus plus a bit of lemon zest. The grapes make a appearance midway through your taste and carry this beer to the finish. Grape juice as well as more of a sour grape skin taste dominant the back end of this beer. Very wine like to its finish. Medium bodied with a tart crisp clean and dryer finish. Enjoyed it a lot."
"If I wanted to drink wine, I would drink wine. I did not like this at all."
"Pours a peachy foggy, haze without much opaque-whiteness to it - just a bright hue of peach. Head formation is slim, only foaming up to a finger in height, and recedes into the beer almost as quickly as it forms. No lacing left behind. Aroma is loaded with citrus notes - orange, tangerine, and mango - right from the start. There is an underlying note of grapes as well. Flavor profile is teeming with citrus notes: orange, tangerine, mango, lemon zest, and papaya. Biscuit malts and raw grain provide a tether for the hops to balance them out. Grapes mingle around the citrus and malts to add another layer to the flavor dynamics. Mouth feel is very much juice-like, with a consistency something like a regular grape juice. That is to say: smooth, and medium-thin with just a touch of grain. Overall, a flavorful DIPA that has quite a lot going on. The hops are plentiful and flavorful, and refrain from any bitterness. "
Great IPA but not one of the best offering from Trillium. There is moderate bitterness and moderate flavor from the juice additives but I don't think they come together in a perfectly flawless way. This is still a very good beer and should be picked up if you come across it.
"Canned 3/9/17, so a week and a half ago. "
"Canned 03/09/17, it pours cloudy gold color with the typical New England DIPA looks, which leads up to a 1 finger foamy white head that stuck around for almost a minute and then just went down and dissipated quickly, leaving good spotty lacing. Looks like fruit juice in the best way possible."
16 oz can dated 3/9/17 (one week old)
"16 oz can, dated 3/9/17, poured into a teku"
Let me just say it - I love Trillium brews and this is one of their best. I've enjoyed all of the different variants. This one might be the smoothest and so full of flavor. Layer after layer of flavor. So damn tasty. I feel lucky to be close enough to Trillium to get up there several times a year. Great stuff.
"I fear this one is too old, canned 12/8/16 & consumed 3/6/17"
Poured on tap at veil brewing joint event. I was not expecting this to be so well balanced with multiple layers of complex flavors. Great test for the palette
"16oz can, purchased from from the brewery, poured into a Trillium Congress Street becher pint glass. Enjoyed on 12.27.2016, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"I loved it. I've had all 3 versions of their Dialed In, and in general I prefer the Pinot Gris version of it but this one works perfectly too. The grape juice works incredibly well for a DIPA."
Appearance: Pours hazy and goldenstraw with a one finger white head that quicklyfades to a ringlet; some strands of lacing linger
"Classic NE hazy IPA with citrus bursting out of the nose. Taste is tart from the SB juice, but it doesn't overpower the citrus and hops from the base of the beer. Finishes clean with a slight pucker. "

"Canned 12-08-16. Drank 12-11-16. ""1-(719)-266-2837"" Say It Isn't So."
poured from a 16 oz can into a modified Aslin Teku. canned 12-8-2016. 
"This was a very interesting brew for sure. Poured the beautiful haze color that we all expect from Trillium. Aromas of both fruit from the hops and a little grape comes through. At first I mostly got fruit on the palate from the hops, but the grapes came out more and more as this warmed. Really enjoyable and fun to drink"

A visually beautiful beer. Golden orange with great lacing and light head. 
"pours a gorgeous very hazy yellow (arguably murky, but not the murkiest beer i've seen), head dissipates extremely quick into nothing. some nice lacing on the glass as you drink. smell is huge nelson hops, lots of dry white wine, coupled with some citrus zest and a grassy note, no malt on the nose. taste starts out like carbonated white wine, then the flavor transforms seemlessly into the green and earthiness of those nelson hops. then the galaxy notes shine through with big candied orange and grapefruit, all over a very light crackery malt. feel is perfect: thick from the heavy dry hopping but very carbonated to break it up and make it crushable. killer brew."
"The Dialed In series is amazing. Pours hazy, caution light yellow in color with one inch head. Taste is peach, light tangerine, and big Sauvignon Blanc grape. Light bodied, slightly bitter and high carbonation. So incredibly smooth. Love the way Trillium integrates wine with ipas. Trillium does a lot of amazing things, but this may be the thing they do the best. If you like wine or not, this is an amazing beer. Seek this out."
"Look: very turbid with little chunkier, nice head though, light orange color"
"Oh dear me please drink this beer every time you see it. For those of you who don't know the neighborhood, Trillium's neighbors are one of the best oyster producers and seafood restaurants in Boston (Row 34), and I expect the motivation for this beer came from seafood pairing."
"One of the more fun Trillium DIPA - this one is just gorgeous to look at, and I love the explosion of Nelson overload. Just one of the many reasons to love this brewery."
"Better than the last batch of Dialed in. Tasted great and. Definitely get the wine in this mixed in perfectly with the hops. Poured it into the dialed in balloon glass and smelled awesome, but the hop and aroma together were very well. Another great Trillium beer."
Revisited on 6/9/17 from a can dated 3/09/17. After three months being in the can it held up incredibly! Amazing DIPA wish I had another!
Poured into a taster. Unique offering and one of the best from Trillium. Nice Galaxy on the nose and the Nelson Sauvin in particular plays well with the Sauvignon Blanc juice. Outstanding!
"HOME RUN- to start.. I love Trillium, Galaxy Dry Hopping, and Sauv Blanc.. so I knew going into it this would be a big one for me.. nose is amazing citrus aroma with hints of white wine.. taste is Nelson, aussie white wine, columbus dank and galaxy pineapple.. right there for me.."
Beer was consumed 34 days after bottling.
The acidity of the grapes takes over
"Fresh bottle, poured into snifter."
"Super cloudy, no head... smells like orange juice....."
"Poured from bottle into Spiegelau IPA glass. Color is the typical orangish yellow you;d come to expect from ta Trillium IPA. Smell coming off of it gives me mango and other tropical fruits with a little hint of the Sauvignon Blanc grapes coming through a bit. Taste is excellent, not the same juice bomb I'm used to with other Trillum brews, but the Sauvignon Blanc juice really comes through and the mouth feel is wonderful. Really glad I was able to try this one."
"750 ml bottle. Cloudy light orange with thin white head, fades to a lasting ring, little lace. Big juicy aroma with tropical fruit, pineapple. Tropical fruit juicy taste but with a lemony character which is likely the grapes. Medium soft mouthfeel. Nice twist on a juicy IPA."
Fresh bottled drank 4/15/16 in a Trillium chalice
"A - Poured an opaque, cloudy bright yellow, orange towards the centre, with a thin layer of white head."
"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Trillium snifter. Thanks Steve for picking this up for me. Bottle date is 3/16/16, first batch. "
"Typical appearance as their other beers, hazy and straw colored. This one was not as turbid as others. Overall this beer was a little below their (Very High) average to me. I did not enjoy it as much as some of the others."
750ml bottle poured into a snifter.
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color. Aroma is juicy citrus. Flavor is big juicy citrus, lots of hops and a great lingering hoppy citrus aftertaste. Overall this is absolutely delicious!"
Look - Pineapple juice 
"Another home run by trillium, i mean at this level its hard to find fault. I found this marginally hotter than SWU, and somewhat less juicy, but when comparing OJ with other OJ, its hard to complain. Amazing in every aspect of the trillium bar. As a side, i got grapes i guess, but wildly overwhelmed by the dry hops"
"As much as Trillium sets themselves apart from so many other breweries, so too do the Dialed In brews set themselves apart from the rest of the Trillium lineup."
I was lucky enough to pick this up at my first visit to Trillium's Canton location.
"Poured from a 25.4 oz bottle into a teku. Pours nicely, with just the right amount of carbonation to create a nice head. The drier, slightly bitter, sauvignon blanc grape juice provides a very interesting contrast to the extreme juiciness from the hops. It is a very unique, but tasty, brew from Trillium, as any anniversary beer should be!"
"Appearance of fresh pineapple juice...is that pulp? Certainly the haziest beer I've come across from Trillium. Aroma of pineapple, mango, passion orange and grapes grapes grapes. Taste is mouth-watering juicy. Certainly tropical and humid, but there's that wine/grape to figure out. Hits you in the back of your cheeks. Great DIPA that breaks from the mold."
"My mind was blown. Bringing a lot of complexity to the IPA game with this one, not surprising from Trillium. The aroma is a beautiful Sauvignon Blanc, with lemon peel. Taste just gets better and better as it comes to room temp. Incredible fruit in this one. I was expecting an interesting beer, puckery mouthfeel and dank hops with some crazy complexity make it one of the best beers I have ever had."
"L: Soft and hazy golden, peach and straw-colored hues with a thin white head and moderate retention"
Absolutely fantastic. Bright yellow color. Huge tropical fruit nose with a hint of white grape. The flavor is a balance between passion fruit/pineapple and the white grape/melon. Hint of booze on the finish as it warms due to the minimal malt presence.
750mL bottle poured into a Trillium balloon glass. 
"This was a fantastic beer. Cloudy lemon appearance. Coarse egg shell that quickly dissipated - similar to a sour saison (kind of unique). The smell was very juicy. The taste knocked my socks off, I mean wow. Citrusy and juicy and soo smooth. I find most NE hazey hops to be much less smooth, kind of sits on stomach. The grape juice did not necessarily stand out, but melded with the hop profile and provided the world class feel. I was very over impressed. Trilliums game is on POINT!"
"Bottled for Trillium's 3rd anniversary on 3/18/16; I had previously tried the beta batch Speed Dial; while I like this version much better overall, I will say that the addition of Galaxy hops detracted from the white wine grape taste to some degree; overall a very interesting and unique DIPA, I think Trillium is on to something with the Nelson hops and wine grape addition combo"
"Bottle shared by Curran today, thanks man."
"Pours like orange juice, super opaque pale orange in color with a finger of white head, retention isn't too great. Aroma is pleasant but subdued, white wine notes with a touch of tropical fruit. Taste is subdued as well, there are moderate white wine notes and some juicy tropical fruits, namely mango, but the flavor is quite subdued. Good mouthfeel medium-ish body and moderate carbonation, pretty typical of Trillium beers. Overall, I'm underwhelmed, it's not a bad beer by any stretch but I just found all the flavors very muted. I enjoyed Speed Dial quite a bit more and had higher hopes for this beer."
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"A very unique IPA. I recall being floored by the nose as the smell of grapes, tropical fruit waft across the pizzeria patio. Having the standard dirty hazy look that all of NE falls over trying to do, the feel of the brew was of low carb, however, the taste shined forth as the addition of the juice mid fermentation gave it the taste of a vinous IPA."
750ml bottle. Served in a snifter glass.
Jesus. 
"Interesting concept here, was really excited to try it. First off, great color, very hazy, typical Trillium in that regard. The aroma is very juicy, lots of orange, grapes, very inviting. The taste is where this loses me as I feel like the hops and grape juice play well off each other. Pretty bitter, never really changes as it warms. Overall, nicely done."
750ml bottle dated 03/18/16
"750 mL bottle. Very hazy pale yellow/orange. Yellow at the top and orange at the bottom. Smells sweet. Tropical fruits. Lightly dank. Not sure if I'm imagining the grape juice, but something is fruity. Taste definitely has some sweet grape juice. Starts tropical and fruity. Pushes into a resiny and grapefruit hop. Fairly sweet. Low bitterness. Medium heavy body. It's different. Not bad, but a little sluggish."
"Lots of citrus. Smells dank and juicy. Tangerine, orange zest, orange rind and pineapple. Pine bitterness on the end. Classic Trillium creamy mouthfeel. Grapefruit pith. Short, balanced, semi-dry finish. Delicious."
64 oz growler was poured into a tulip glass. 
"Pours orange/white hazy unfiltered with a one finger head. Smells of oranges, peppery malts, and sweet sticky citrus. Taste is a bitter bite, followed into the citrus mixed with the wine. The wine gives it a light sour flavor. Cracker-like malts. If you're used to Trillium IPAs, the Sauvignon Blanc is definitely a noticeable difference from the norm here. This beer does a lot of things right, the aroma and appearance are great, but in the end I may prefer a little more of their traditional style."
"This is a very interesting beer. Like someone else said, ignore the sauvignon blanc juice description. The smell at first threw me off, but as you start drinking it the smell makes more sense. This is very juicy IPA with a good amount of bitterness. What makes it interesting is when you take a sip you just get heavy juiciness. Then as the juiciness fades you get whacked with the bitterness. After drinking it for a bit your teeth feel like you have been chewing pine tar. Very well brewed beer. Keep 'em coming!"
"Pours a hazy light orange color with a thick white head that dissipates. Smell is strong with Nelson hops, mango, tropical. Flavors reflect the same with some sweet/bitter white wine taste. Feel is extremely smooth. Delicious"
"From bottle. Pours a beautiful peachy gold. Head retention is only knock. Grapefruit forward nose. Misc. citrus backs up. Great juicy hops. Sweet citrus and a hint of what reminds me of carrot juice. Super smooth, solid carb, and a bit of resiny stick."
"This beer is excellent. The idea behind it is great and the execution is even better. Juicy and fruity with the nice dry finish. Not a fan of the bubbles at the bottom, but once you taste it... you get it. If you love IPAs and appreciate a good Sauvignon Blanc, you will certainly enjoy this. Well done Trillium."
"This beer is preposterous. Hazy Trillium turbidity. Light head. Aroma is so cool. Nelson hops are my favorite. They are in full display here. Earthy, grapey, mossy, tropical, kiwi. The Sauv Blanc grape juice is very prominent. Crazy Trillium hops combined with wine juice. Almost has a light gasoline aroma. Wow. The flavor is equally as shocking. A fruit puree with Sauvignon Blanc wine poured into it. All of the tropical fruits are there. The Nelson Sauvin is dominant. The Sauv Blanc is dominant, too. This is easily one of their coolest beers. Big flavor and a bit of alcoholic heat with medium bitterness. Nailed it. Nailed it. Nailed it."
Bomber poured into snifter
750 poured into a tulip. 3/18/16
Thanks to my buddy Nate for snagging this during his recent trip to the Boston area! Nice unexpected DIPA twist! Juicy DIPA up front and dry finish due to the Sauvignon Blanc grapes!! Great stuff!!
Was nervous about the sauvignon blanc but it works. Really easy drinking. Kind of miss the normal bitterness that comes with a Trillium IPA/DIPA but still awesome.
A: I don't think I've ever seen anything more cloudy in my life. It's like quick sand. You can see suspended particulate in here; guessing it's grape. Could be yeast. 
The smells will throw u off! Maybe the Nelson I dunno! But first sip will blow your mind. Outstanding !
"L - Murky, hazy yellow. Less than a finger of white head."
"This DIPA was outstanding. Poured in the proper glassware, thin head that dissipates quickly. A white wine and tropical and citrus fruit aroma. The taste was of dry white wine and citrus fruit. the finish was dry and quick very pleasant. I think it is a must try for the Nelson lovers, the addition of Galaxy was a very nice touch."
"Might be a little *too* milkshake-y for me for color. I like hazy IPAs, this looks like a grapefruit juice mimosa."
"Poured from a 750 bottled less than a week ago (I believe 3/18/16). Lightly carbonated, this pours a glowing hazy orange/yellow with a thin amount of wispy head which all but disappears. "
"From a 16oz can, dated 11/01/18. Served in a tulip."
"Pours a murky orange with a finger of white foam. Head retention is pretty good, with a pillowy appearance. Aroma is pineapple, guava, papaya, tangerine, and orange with hints of toasty, earthy malts. Malts absolutely buried by hops. Flavor profile is pineapple, papaya, tangerine, guava, and orange. Malts are whispers, and hit notes of toasty, biscuity. Hops absolutely run the show here with a heavy tropical fruit presence that is just tweaked slightly from the standard tropical fruits. It's good, just a blast of flavor. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a fuzzy, graininess that borders on 'chalky'. Overall, big flavor matches the 10% ABV. Very good for those seeking a shotgun blast of flavor, but very little nuance or refinement here."
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Red Session. Aroma is sweet and fruity with dank hop notes. Taste is sweetish, citrusy and a bit astringent with a light bitterness on the finish. Really well balanced for a triple IPA."
"Hazy orange pour, nice foamy head but not much residual lace"
"Canned 12/27/17, it pours cloudy gold yellow color with a 2+ finger white foamy head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating very, very slowly and leaving incredible thick foamy lacing coating the sides, leaving rings as it went down. Looks like a glass of pineapple juice with a world class beer head. It's not just textbook NE-style IPA looks, this could be the dictionary picture for the style."
Let's face it - Other Half puts out some stupidly good stuff.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy burnt orange color with a modest head that leaves a few strands 
"Brewed with lactose and oats; featuring Wai-iti, Kohatu, Ekuanot, and Citra hops; triple dry hopped with Galaxy and Citra lupulin powder... another stupid good beer from Other Half... 10% abv... Creamy, smooth, lots of tropical fruit impressions and - unsurprisingly - an oatmeal-like element... Opaque, dark fruit-juice-looking beer - let's call it dark gold... Mildly sweet, mildly bitter... Softly carbonated and lush... C'mon - you'd be a fool to pass it up..."
"Had last night. Pours insanely hazy tan color with a small tight head. Smell is pretty inviting, it's big and hoppy but I swear you can really smell creamer here. Very fresh and citrusy. Flavor is a bit all over the place. There's tons of resinous and juicy hops upfront, big malt presence with sweetness from the lactose and oats. Fusel alcohol burn in the back. Very thick beer, smooth, huge body. A cool beer to try but I wouldn't get it again."
"L - super appetizing name I tell you hwhat. OH does a great job with that. Pours a shockingly dark murky brown. It wants to be orange, but hot damn the swamp cannot be resisted. Fluffy head that appears a darker shade or burnt orange what with all the darkness starting to peek through. "
"Pours a hazy orange with a quarter inch white head that was well retained but left minimal lacing. Smells of citrus fruits with some tropical notes in the background. Tastes of sweet pink grapefruit juice, pineapple, peaches and grapefruit rind. Medium bodied, ABV hidden very well, medium carbonation, plush mouth feel, medium bitterness."
"dark and hazy in color..like grapefruit juice..smell is grapefruit & pineapple, taste is all citrus yet bitter and sweet..ABV is well hidden as this drinks like a 7 or 8% DIPA..carbination is light and the mouthfeel is full, like most Other Half juice bombs..this is in the upper echelon of beers I've had from them, and its the first triple dry hopped beer I've had..if they can all be this good, it won't be the last"
10-26-18
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip. Pours a golden orange hazy body with a big frothy white head that reduces to leave spotty lacing and a layer of retention. 
"16 oz can poured into a tulip. Pours a darker golden color. Not very bright in appearance. White head that dissipates and leaves sticky lacing to the glass. Aroma is insane. Citra all up in my face....citrus, mango, grapefruit....smells amazing. Taste follows the nose. Tons of citrus....mango and subtle grapefruit notes. The citra in this beer really pops. Feel is medium bodied and sticky/resinous. Really coating and leaves behind wonderful flavors of orange and grapefruit. Overall, this is a tremendous beer. Really love the showcase of Citra here. Noble did a great job with this one."
Via trade
Poured from 16oz into Snifter. Canned on June 13th 2017. 
Citra Hopped Double IPA 8.8% ABV | 77 IBU
"Copper to brown in color with a half inch of dense off white. The aroma is of citrus hops, light malt, and floral hops. Amazing nose. I'm tasting citrus to mandarin orange hop flavor along with some light malt. The mouth is lightly resinous and chewy."
Poured on tap at Noble Ale Works.
"22oz bottle dated 1/31/17 poured into a Trillium snifter. Crystal clear apple juice body with two fingers of tightly packed white head that left moderate lacing as it slowly receded to a thin layer on top of the beer that was continuously replenished by several lazy bubble streams. Aroma is sweet Citra hops heaven; stone fruit, citrus, and slight alcohol. Taste is a stone fruit citrus bomb with a alcohol notes. A perfect example of what Citra hops can do. Mouthfeel is my only complaint about this beer. It's juicy and sugary up front, but the finish is incredibly dry. While I had zero difficulty finishing the bottle, I was definitely thirsty afterwards because of the drying effect of the alcohol. I would absolutely buy this again."
"Beautiful clarity, two inch white foam head on a clear amber pour"
"Pours a clear and beautiful bright golden orange color with a thick and foamy white head that persists and laces well. Insane amount of bright citrus aroma. Hops, hops, and more hops! Appropriately named ""showers."" Flavor follows in all its citric glory, with just enough sweetness from the seemingly simple malt bill. Feel is crisp, dry, bitter... what more could you want from a Citra DIPA? Overall this is an outstanding DIPA with exceptional use of Citra hops. Cheers!"
Nose has a decent amount of malt and honey like sweetness and then dank hops. After a swirl it smells like you lit your nose up to a bucket full of fresh hops. Nice creamy mouth feel and low bitterness on the finish. This one is right at about a month old so it's fresh but the malt backbone is a little over done on this for me.
p- dark orange
"Noble Ale Works makes a lot of great beers, my favorite is still naught sauce but this IPA from them is great. The hops are great. Nice west coast style IPA."
"Lots of Citra in the aroma but overall the beer was a little bitter and not as good as other DIPA's on the market. Not a bad beer by any means, but I have had much better"
9/29/2016 bottle drank in a chalice on 10/11/2016
Clear golden color. White head. On tap. Side by side with juice box and this is crap compared to it.
One of the best Citra IPAs I've had. Was able to get a bottle within a week or two of bottling and the Citra aromas exploded from the glass. The aromas we're backed up perfectly on the tongue as well. Wish this was around more often
"Poured a beautiful golden orange with an off white head hat left tons of lacing in the glass. Aromas and flavors were dominated by the majesty of citra: grapefruit, piney resin, some orange marmalade, and it's all balanced by a nice sweet and bready malt backbone. Sticky mouthfeel with medium carbonation that gives way to a nice wave of bitterness for the finish. It's hard to imagine this beer displeasing (m)any DIPA fans, but it seems to me to lack that final special quality that would put it in the range of the all-time greats."
L: Slightly hazy golden hues with an ample foamy white head
Picked this up from WFDTLA.
"Aroma is sweet pine sap with orange, pineapple, and mango. Tastes like orange candy. Plenty of sweet malt and dank, earthy hops. Great depth of flavor. Mouth feel is amazing. Its creamy and resinous with just the right amount of carbonation. It sticks to your palate long after you swallow."
Pours an orange yellowish hue with medium head. Smells of grapefruit and nice bitter smell. Has a nice balance between the malt and the citra hops in the taste. Overall a really well done beer.
"Awesome extra received in a trade from ph1ogic, wasn't even on my radar. This beer smells absolutely amazing, which really isn't surprising for a citra beer, but it even stood out from a crowded field of citra IPAs. The flavor was outstanding too, with a light malt bill and not too much bitterness. It was all juicy citra hops. Definitely one of the better bottled DIPAs out there, up there with the likes of Trillium's best stuff."
"Poured a two-week old 22oz. Aclear golden with very little head with aggressive pour. No lacing, head subsides quickly"
Orange with a retaining white head.
Received this as an extra. As a Tree House regular this Citra inspired brew caught me off guard in a good way. The aromas on this one are elite...extremely dank! Flavors of mango and other citrus take the spotlight. Wish I had more regular access to this.
"This is a great beer. Loads of Citra hop without too much malt. the ""Showers"" Series never disappoints. Great mouth feel, loads of Citra taste. Only critique would be slightly underwhelming aroma. But a fantastic Beer."
"Appearance: beautiful tangerine / orange bright vibrant color. Medium sized head, not too big and not completely white. Decent amount of bubbles darting towards the surface. There are golden outlines to this beer."
Arguably the best IPA in the West
Easily one of the most drinkable DIPA's I have ever had. The flavor was so well balanced that it hid the higher ABV very well. Citra hops give this beer tons of character and an increible nose.
Huge thanks to PG2G for this as an extra.
Fresh 22oz. (drink before 9/30/15 on bottle)
This beer...
Look: Good size bubbles and amber. 
This is one outstanding brew! It's so full of juicy Citra hops. Super smooth finish with no aftertaste. As soon as I popped the top I could smell the Citra. Very easy drinking for a double. Halfway through it I was wishing I had another one. I highly recommend this awesome beer!
Got a fresh 22 ounce bomber of this via trade and was excited to try it as I have tried many other showers versions...this was by far the best version of the showers series I have had… Tons of Citra hops on the nose and the finish
"Pours honey yellow with fizzy white head with good distribution and retention. Beautiful aromas of papaya (the most vibrant and clear papaya scent I've ever gotten from a beer) cantaloupe and a bit of candied orange, but mostly papaya. Very catty up front with flavors of candied orange peel and grapefruit along with bits of rosemary. Very bitter finish that lingers. Medium bodied and slightly syrupy. Great IPA, the flavors opens up a bit as it warms but the nose reigns supreme on this one."
"Drank from a 1 pint 6 fl.oz bottle purchased at Whole Foods Market, Venice, CA"
From 22 oz bomber to Mikasa pint glass
We have a winner here!
"Purchased from Holiday Wine Cellar. Has a small amount of that calms down to a minimal amount of lacing. Nose is citra hops all over the place. Dank, citrusy. Fantastic. The flavor is amazing. Citrusy, dank, sharp hops abound. This is a fantastic beer that is very refreshing."
"Had this when it was almost 3 months old but it was incredible! Cloudy, fruity, citrusy, juicy, great mouthfeel. This is definitely a 5/5 if it were fresh, but you could hardly tell that it had any age on it at nearly 3 months."
"I have had some of the best IPA out there and this definatly ranks up with the top dogs! Heady,Pliny, SOS.... ,Citra showers is right up there!"
"What a beautiful beer! Golden, sunburst orange, gigantic frothy cream-colored head. So bright, so fresh. A subtle grain base features layer upon layer of slightly sweet, floral, fruity hops. I spent a good several minutes inhaling deeply."
Serving type: 22oz bomber poured into a spiegelau glass - drink before 9/30/2015
"Absolutely delicious beer. Starts off with one of the most amazing aromas ever emanated from a beer glass. Super fruity, floral smell. The taste is one of the juiciest, hoptastic beers I've ever tasted. Just the right amount of bitter. This thing drinks so smoothly and don't detect any alcohol at all. Tried a previous batch months ago. Bought 3 bottles upon this new release and drank them within the week. Had to go back to the store to buy three more. Consume fresh!"
"Very strong, citrusy smell. Has a taste that hits as powerfully as it smells. Absolutely delicious, has notes of grapefruit, orange, apricot. Awesome, awesome stuff."
22oz bottle served in a tulip. Pours an orange golden color with little head or lacing. There was a burst of floral notes that I picked up when the bottle was opened. Nose is floral and citrus. Taste follows with more citrus peel and some bitterness on the finish. An excellent drinking beer.
Look is typical gold/orange transparent IPA with very little head despite a slightly aggressive pour. 
"Heard good things. ""Best by 9/30/15"" Printed on the bottom right of the label. "
Great single hop beer. I love the shower series and this is one of my favorites. Great Citra smell and flavor they last throughout this beer. I will have it again for sure
Pours a golden hue with a white head. 
"Excellent , really enjoyed this beer! Nowadays it's hard to tell when your drinking an IPa or a double . Highly recommend it !"
"A great single hop showcase, although I personally like Citra better when it's balanced by other hops like Mosaic (Fresh Squeezed) or Motueka (Modern Times' Booming Rollers). On its own, as another reviewer has mentioned, it's just a bit 'hollow.'"
"One of the best double IPA on the planet. Great citrus flavor, perfect balance. Simple but done perfectly."
"One of the best CA DIPAs I've come across in quite a while. Dull gold hazy unfiltered liquid topped by a small head of white foam. Rich nose with moderate dank orange and floral notes and a sweet maltiness. This tastes addictively good: orange zest with sweet malt, cucumber, and a dose of honey sweetness. Just a touch of bitterness adds some balance. The mouthfeel is creamy and the brew coats the tongue with a delicious hoppy nectar that is slightly tongue numbing. Emphasizing dank hops, but presenting on the sweeter side of the IPA spectrum."
"OMG!!!completely Ridiculously good! As good as ""Sip Of Sunshine"" from"
wow. i even had an older bottle and it was amazing.. so fruity..
Name says it all. Lighter than most DIPAs. Alcohol well hidden. Very enjoyable.
"I don't know, I just don't get the hype. Really crackery malt base, which combines with the Citra hops to give this one a bit of a hollow feel that I just don't find endearing. Sure, the Citra hops smell nice-ish, but I'm gonna need more than that to consider something upper echelon, which this just frankly isn't."
Beer is not what it once was. Could be my pallet changing more then the beer. Originally had in a bottle in 2015. Pretty clean refreshing beer bought not that juicy. Disappointing mouthfeel.
22 oz bottle poured into a Jow's Arcade tulip glass
"The beer comes in a hazy, very opaque, dark orange."
"Cm thick head. Smells fruity and very juicy. Initial taste is bitter but very citrusy. Great taste but the only problem is that the alcohol is very noticeable. Wolf among weeds hides the alcohol better. All in all, I absolutely love the smell but meh on the taste. Sort of tastes like alpine Nelson but more alcoholic"
A: golden orange. Medium story. Loose opaque bubbles. Head dissipates quick 
Perfection for a DIPA. Tied for the best hoppy beer of all time in my opinion.
"Loads of citrus hop flavors and aroma with intense clarity and an extremely crisp, refreshing finish. A pristine example of a citra-centric double IPA."
"Pours a hazy light golden with a nice finger tall white head that leaves lacing all over. Smell is sweet mango, tangerine, grapefruit, and a little pine. Taste follows for the most part. This thing is just loaded with hops, much like the other Showers beers. Pretty low bitterness which allows you to really enjoy Citra to its fullest. Mouthfeel is damn good for 8.8%, also like the other Showers beers. I can't think of a better Citra IPA/DIPA. This is simply incredible; in my top 10. Better than KR Citra. If I were to rank the Showers I've had it would go something like this:"

One of my all time favorite dipa's
A. M. A. Z. I. N. G.
Had in a growler sent across the country and gave it a 3.5. Had it on draft at Noble Ale Works and thought it was head and shoulders better.
"Pours a cloudy gold color with a small white head. Aroma of citrus and tropical fruits, florals, a bit of dank piss, and some sweet malts. The flavor hits the same notes, but is more intensely bitter and showcases more of a floral, citrus peel character. Light-medium bodied, with a bitter, juicy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Good citra DIPA, maybe not as tropical-leaning as others I’ve had."
Appearance: Pours a hazy honey color with a reasonably impressive head that leaves some dots and dashes of lace behind
"Poured from a bomber into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Hadn't even attempted to smell the beer and already picked up the strangely dank and disgusting yet somehow delicious aroma of cat piss. Accompanied by piss is are crisp refreshing citrus notes, grapefruit, flowers, and malt. Very very clean and crisp smelling. Taste is citrus, grapefruit and floral hops leading to sweet malts. I'm finding a great balance in this beer and it's drinking very easy. Finishes with a grainy grassy yet bitter taste. Mouth feel is a notch above medium and right one par with what I expected from an 8.8% abv DIPA. Not much that I don't like about this beer."
Bottle opened on 1.9.14
A: deep hazy gold body; head as big-as-ya-want-it of ivory foam; ample lacing down the glass
22 oz bottle with a drink by date of 2/23/14 courtesy of Vince. Thank you kindly for the opportunity!
"Pours golden with an hazy into the glass, forms a nice finger high white head with terrific retention and steady rings of lacing."
Was lucky enough to pick up a bottle of this from Hollingshead's Delicatessen yesterday. #1 on my want list while in socal on vacation. Into the Bruery tulip she goes!
"Simply put, this is one of the finest Citra-based beers I have had. In my opinion, it is better than Pipeworks Citra Ninja, and slightly inferior to Hill Farmstead's Double Citra (which rarely is brewed). Noble would be wise to make this an annual beer, as the hop character is simply outstanding."
"I feel like Mr. Arkadin in Orson Wells' masterpiece. I am lost, I am unaware, I am... Citra Showers took me on a tropical journey to far off places, to beautiful places. The beer glows a gorgeous golden hue like a newborn Twinkie, while the taste...the taste! Wow! Luscious Citra perfection. The hot dog thang has a delicate crispness at the end that makes you think that you are taking off Adriana Lima's bra."
"Lots of people talking about this beer right now, and it was drop-dead gorgeous tonight. Popped the beer and my kitchen was flooded with peach, mango, lychee, pine, and onion. What sets this a part from so many other DIPAs is its power and elegance. Many powerful DIPAs come across too sweet, boozy, etc, but this was all about freshness, balance and finesse. This QUICKLY ascended my favorites list. Double Sunshine may be the only better DIPA I've had. Impressive."
Heard about this beer two days ago. Went out looking for it today just as a new shipment dropped. Schwing!
"22oz bomber, drink by 2/23/2014, poured into a stemless wine glass today, 1/7/2014. Picked this one up at the beginning of my Los Angeles visit- looking to see what the local hype is behind this one."
Thanks to wethorseblanket for sharing this one at jmgrub's tasting.
"This is phenomenal, reminds you why hop heavy beers made an impact in the beer world two years ago."
"Pours a standard straw ipa-color. One inch head that maintains well with decent retention. The nose on this beer is over the top. So dank, so juicy....tropical fruits of guava, pineapple, fresh cut grass and mildly piney with a little bit of orange and tangerine thrown in. The smell is worth it alone on the pi. The taste is bitter and clean and quick. It is much less sweet on the taste but still dank and grapefruit shows up in the taste here. Mouthfeel is average but very suitable for this style. Noble has cooked up two gems in a row with tongue tickles and Citra Showers, I hope these will be readily available. This beer is a 9.5/10 from a true hop head. Would love to try side-by-side with Kern's Citra. Outstanding offer from Noble Ale Works."
Drink before 2/23/14
L - deep shade of solid orange red. Mango juice. Fluffy head with loads of lacing. Slick and shiny. 
Can from Kevin
"this is an absolutely delicious ipa, and i owe a huge thanks to my brother for sending this one out from new york for me to enjoy! its fully on trend, but so much better than just about everything else out there in this style. its cloudy orange tinted when i pour it, and it holds several inches of thick white head like beaten eggs, stuff and peaky and lasting. no visible sediment but the cloudiness makes it appear quite thick and substantial. the aroma is killer, to me fresh tangerine, orange tic tacs, and even orange soda, canned mandarin oranges too, it would make sense if someone told me they added fruit to this, but i dont think thats the case. its all hops, i just have absolutely no idea which ones could have produced this striking aroma. its even more pronounced in the flavor, which might be the most impressive part of this beer overall. so often with the heavy dry hopped brews they are so aromatic but fade in the flavor, thats not the case at all here and in fact quite the opposite is true. its even more pungent in the taste, orange tic tacs and soda too, sweet for a minute, oily and rich, grounded only by the starchiness of the grain base, and barely at that. this thing is so unique, i cant even guess which hops might be responsible for such a distinctive and interesting flavor, but its awesome. seems like wheat or oats in the malt, maybe both, this is frothy and almost creamy feeling, which is great with all the orange character in this. dry and well carbonated, but i burp these one of a kind hops for awhile after the beer is gone. this was enormously impressive, my first beer from the acclaimed equilibrium. stoked to have gotten to try this one, its really special beer!"
"On tap. Quite different hop profile on the nose with some oniony notes, vegetal, dank, fruity but with some unique notes. Taste follows with fruity notes like melon but also chives and dill. Medium body and carbonation. Tasty and quite unique."
Look: Hazy murky yellow with small white head. Has low carbonation.
"Can to chalice. Huge thick head, hazy orange color. Big fruit aroma, tropical fruit taste with mango, orange, melon. Incredibly smooth. Amazing juice bomb. Scary drinkable - can't tell at all this is 8%+. One of the best beers I've tasted in recent years."
"Latest batch, worth mentioning as there have been tweaks and adjustments to this beer along the way, as the wizards of EQ get this beer perfect. "
"Pours a cloudy deep yellow color with a thin foamy head. Head retention is decent. Lacing is very good. Having a hard time with the aroma. Not very strong. More of a tropical fruit aroma. Guava, maybe pineapple predominate with some mild piney resin. Nice juicy taste. I get some guava, maybe melon and mild pineapple. Some good bitterness on then end; maybe even a little peppery. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation."
"Treehouse is my house brew...so I knows what I speaks of...This is tasty--- Ive liked other EQs like MC2, but havent been wowed before Fluctuation.... All the usual flavors for a NE IPA are there, and then there's a melon, guavaish note that I personally really enjoy---reminds me of an early Curiosity, 11 or 12 I think....."
Hazy orange right out of the can..looks like the sludge at the bottom of a bottle of OJ
Tall can w/o canning date info
These guys are going neck and neck with the NE haze tycoons.
"Cold pint can poured into room temperature pint glass. Single digit head that slowly fades into a gentle lacing cradles the glass to the bitter sweet end. Light notes of layered fruitiness fill your nose with each creamy sip. Citrus Crush of Mango infused with layers tangerines, apricots and peaches slowly crawl across your palate flowing into a slight bitter hoppiness. This beer is a Master Piece."
"Moderate pour yields a one inch white head over a hazy golden body with sticky lacing. Nose of tropical fruit and citrus. Flavors mirror aromas with a nice, mellow bitterness. Good feel and overall, a nice job from Middletown, NY. Cheers! That lacing though, wow!"
"Let me put it to you this way. No longer will Treehouse and Trillium be used in one breath for me, it will now be Treehouse, Trillium and Equilibrium, all in one breath."
"I had this on draught at the brewery. 12 oz. pour in a goblet. It pours a pretty, opaque yellow-orange color with a foamy, milk-white head and amazing lacing that coated the glass and retained its integrity through the pour. This is as pretty a pour as any NE IPA. The nose features lemon, grapefruit, ripe melon, and floral hops. The taste is luscious: lemon, grapefruit, sweet tropical fruit, and a touch of vanilla. It finishes with a slight bitterness. There is no strong hop taste. The flavors are fresh and they blend wonderfully. I love the mouth feel: it is creamy, almost viscous, with pleasant carbonation. It's simply a pleasure to drink. Overall, this is one of the best DIPA's I've had in a long time. It's delicious and has the perfect feel. There aren't a lot of reviews yet but I think the BA Score on this one is way too low. This is a World Class DIPA. I wish they had more cans left!"
"A: Poured from the can - no freshness date thereon, but I believe this was picked up at the brewery itself this past weekend. It's now Monday evening, so I'm pretty sure this is pretty darned fresh. Looks like pulpy pineapple juice: milkshake-like tangerine-orange body with a half-finger of foamy white head on top. Some lacing left behind. "

"Definitely one of the prettier big deal IPAs I've seen in a bit: golden with a slight chill haze, white head with decent retention for the ABV, nice lace."
Another big thank you out to Craig for this.
Can from the brewery for around $5. A well executed west coast tasting triple IPA
"Growler fill on 2/25/17. Smooth, syrupy honey pine with looong citrus melon finish. One of my absolute favorite double IPA's. So glad Ocelot is near me."
Bottle from 2/1/17. Poured into Belgian ale glass.
On tap at brewery:
This year's batch (2017). Bottled 1/31
A: This poured a cloudy gold with a bit of white head.
"A buddy picked up a growler fill for me at a Saturday release. He said the keg kicked 20 minutes later. I drank it the following Tuesday. It tasted flat and lacked carbonation. I don't know if it was a bad fill, it wasn't securely capped, no CO2, bottom of the keg or I waited too long to drink it, but this just did not live up to the hype. Clear look, not a juice bomb. Darker wheat than most ipas i see. Nose was a wallop of grapefruit and mango. The hops fell flat in the taste. I got lots of malts and honey. It reminded me of a Hopslam, but not quite as good. "
"Hazy straw color; medium head. Nose a bit subdued considering the big taste that follows -- still some tropical fruits, citrus and pine. Flavor similar to nose, grapefruit, tangerine and pine with some light tropical fruit hints on the side of the tongue. Serious hop punch at end (it is a Triple after all), but doesn't interfere with initial fruit flavor -- really exceptional taste - also benefits from being very fresh. Mouth feel is good with the hoppy bitterness that sticks around long after. Overall -- this was my first Ocelot offering and really excited to find a beer of this caliber locally. I will certainly be returning and look forward to future batches of this gem."
"Medium head and nice color for an unfiltered beer. Wonderfully fruity nose, with hints of candy. Mouth filling and flavorful with a tangy fruit finish before the hops arrive. Nice bitterness but not overwhelming."
"Poured from growler into tulip. Aroma is magnificent and jumps out of the glass with tropical fruits. The taste is resiny with pine and tropical fruits. Feel is a slight lingering bitterness but well covered with just the right amount of malt and syrupy mouthfeel... certainly a bit of heat but not offensive. Reminds me of, and might be better than, Sixpoint Hi-Res which is one of my favorite TIPAs."
"Having just drank Ephraim, I can say I like this better. It's a really great fruity triple IPA that disguises its booziness quite well. This is going neck-in-neck with Wings for the best IPA the DC area has produced. Really nice."
Growler fill – 64 oz of deliciousness.
Revisited 2/1/18
On tap at Ocelot.
"This is possibly Ocelot's best IPA to date, and they make fantastic IPAs. They may never have a beer that climbs the Beer Advocate rankings because their brews are usually one time only."
"Pours hazy and tick but not syrupy like many TIPAs and not as hazy as many Tree House IPAs. The nose if light with relatively mild hops for the style. My fiancee said it smelled like Juniper berries. That taste is complex - hops roll over the tongue and linger, even dance, much like a Tree House IPA. This beer is not syrupy or overly sweet like many TIPAs. This beer is amazing - quite mild for a 10% beer. Would drink many more times."
"Goblet pour and subsequent 64oz growler fill. Dark golden with a very small head. Strong citrus and tropical fruits on the nose from Mosaic and Citra. Taste follows along with a trailing bitterness, assuming from the CTZ. Finish is clean with no cloying sweetness that you can sometimes see with this big of an IPA. Alcohol was well hidden but effective. Fantastic brew!"
Everything about this beer was spot on. at 10.8% the alcohol was well masked. You could smell the hops as they were pouring the beer into the growler. A nice straw color thanks to no caramel malts. This is the best local beer I've had and it's not too close. Well done.
The beer pours a very nice and white head that dissipates very quickly. The beer itself is a lightly cloudy medium gold color that looks very nice. The look has a very nice golden appearance with a very attractive orange hue to it. This is definitely a really good looking beer.
"From a growler filled from a fresh keg, before I am even finish pouring I'm hit with fragrant oranges and grapefruit. Beer is a beautiful orange with a half-finger head and spotty, webby lacing. Getting my nose down in there reveals more oranges and grapefruit, plus layers of peach, pineapple, ripe cantaloupe, pine, savory herbs and dank. Taste is in a word delicious, with all that fruit and hoppy spice going on. A tasty bitterness pounds any residual sweetness into submission. "
"Nice dark golden color, slight haze, thin white lacy head. Not a huge aroma, but nice aroma of berries, pine, and citrus. Nice well-balanced mouthfeel with juicy up front and dry bitter finish. Another great beer from Ocelot!"
"Full disclosure: This was a collaboration between Ocelot and three of the restaurants I work for. Given that I said ""let's make a Triple IPA"" and they 100% wrote the recipe, I feel marginally okay doing so. I did toss some hops from a bucket into the kettle."
"A fantastic ""triple IPA"". This has tons of citrus flavor and smell. I thought the flavor was even better than the smell- citrus and some pine near the end. Dangerously drinkable given the ABV. I am a huge Ocelot fan and I think this is their best one yet."
"This beer does not drink like a 10.8% triple IPA, it drinks like a double the the color is that of just a single IPA. Well done by the boys at Ocelot, they keep putting out great beer. Such a treat to have this gem in N VA."
"I'm not normally a triple IPA guy—they're usually too sweet and boozy, more like an overhopped barleywine than an IPA. But this ain't that kinda beer. Massive hop aromas leap out of the glass, lots of citrus and tropical fruit. It tastes the same, with hints of pine around the edges of the palate. No hint of booziness. The mouthfeel is perfect, not too thick, not too thin. They need to brew this again."
Had on tap at TH. 
A-Pours a hazy yellowish color with a generous head and lacing
Bottom of can reads:
Canned on 9/26/18; consumed on 9/27/18. Another super-fresh one from Tree House tonight.
Best of the BBBrrright variations.
Light Creamy Haze (think Green) Pungent tropical nose
"Looks nothing like any Bright I’ve ever had. Poured as hazy as Juice Machine, with a thick bright-white head. Not a ton on the nose for smell actually. I think I noticed the same with the reg galaxy version. Taste is all Galaxy. That signature clean, crisp Bright hop finish is there, but the tropical fruit is obviously dialed up. Feel is thinner than some other IPAs, but more on the Bright side. Overall, until I had this, the reg version was the best Bright. Now the hopped up version takes that place. This actually is a top 10 IPA from TH for me. Really not much else to say except let’s see this one again soon."
"Great beer, aroma of fresh hop, pineapple and mango."
"Picked-up four cans at the Tree House Brewery for four dollars and eighty cents last Wednesday. Huge flavor on this guy, a bit too dank for me, but a solid brew. Side note: climbing the Tree tonight - have had: Trail Magic; Alter Ego; Sap; Bbbrighttt w Citra; Bbbrighttt w Galaxy. To do: Doppelgänger; Very Green; Juice Machine. Wish me luck!"
Not going to knock the pour. Not going to knock the smell. Not going to knock the taste. Not going to knock the feel. This is the best of the Bright family and one of the best I’ve ever had!
"From a 16oz can, date stamp illegible - but it was sometime this past week. Served in a stubby little IPA glass."
"L - whoa now, double whammy with the Citra. What luck! Pours a thick shade of solid glowing haze. Seriously, I might need to grab my Geiger counter..."
Picked up at the brewery and shared with JLindros.
"Canned 6/13/18, thanks to rudzud for sharing"
Poured from a 16 oz can into a teku glass.
"Thanks to Bpfahl for this 16 oz. can, with art that’s an unsubtle head-butt to one of the great teen movies of all time. A fine-looking extra. "
"Pours a light/medium gold coloration with a medium, foamy head. Smell is very bright, hoppy and tropical, with notes of pineapple, passion fruit and guava, with a hint of booze. Taste follows the nose, being quite hoppy and tropical, with light citrus notes. Some light biscuity malt coming through as well. Strong notes of sweet, juicy pineapple and guava, with lighter notes of passion fruit and zesty grapefruit. There's a light dankness and just a hint of pine in the background as well. Finishes with a very light bitterness and very mild hop burn, with just a hint of booze coming through in the aftertaste. Soft mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation. While there is a very mild booziness to this, it's still quite impressive how mellow and juicy this is at 10.5% ABV. I still don't really see the point of TIPAs, but have to say that this is exceptionally well-crafted. It also doesn't have these overripe, slightly artificial tasting fruit notes or bubblegum character that you get with many high-ABV IPAs."
Hazy golden orange. Frothy white head. Sticky lace.
"Pours a hazy bright straw yellow. Nose is of pungent citrus peal, ripe tropical fruit and sweet doughy malt. Taste very malt forward especially considering a triple IPA. Bready malt forward with citrus pith, pinnaple juice, mangos and slight sticky pine sap. Full creamy body with a hoppy bitter finish. It's good but the forward maltyness seems out of place. Could be toned down a bit."
Best TIPA I've ever had. I feel like the drinkability is so smooth is feels like a DIPA. great hoppy aroma and nice floral notes. Cant believe this beer is 10.5 percent
"No date on the can. Pours like murky OJ with an inch white head leaving spotted lacing behind when consumed. Smell is lots tropical and citrus fruits very slight sweet malts. The taste is incredible for a 10.5% TIPA. Like a fruit smoothie!! No sign of malt or alcohol, but it will get you if you pound it! The feel is kinda light actually, soft and smooth as well! Overall i will definitely trafe for this when it comes out again!"
Looks hazy and bright.
"This one pours a fairly hazy dark-ish orange, with a small head, and a good amount of lacing."
1 PINT can
"Another fun heavy-hitter from HH. Smells very floral, fruity. Alcohol bite noticeable, takes the the rating down a bit, but not bad for a triple by any means. Love the hazy color/consistency."
"Can from the most recent release 5/21/17. Consumed on 6/3/17. Get a lot of kumquat, mango juice type flavors. Reminds me of ""I'll have what she's having"". Alcohol is less notable than dragonsaddle."
"Pale golden, small head and spotty light lacing. Aromas of pure grapefruit juice. Notes of grapefruit pulp, citrus juice, orange rinds and fruit salad. No hint of abv, drinkability through the roof, medium body and dry. Amazing triple IPA, probably my favorite."
Hazy pale gold with a large foamy white head that settles to a persistent white blanket.
"Hazy white grapefruit juice looking body, sticky bone-white head. Aroma is big on tropical fruits, big hints of pineapple. Flavor is still big and juicy even for the abv, tropical fruit notes, slightest hint of alcohol on the back end. Smooth and drinkable for 10.5%. One of the better TIPAs I have had, drinks like a smoother DIPA."
Poured from can into Hoppin Frog snifter
Looks like atypical IPA. Heavy fruit nose! Tasted like a NE IPA but not over the top juicy. Great hop balance. For being 10.5% it is increadibly drinkable! This is a delicious IPA that could get you in some serious trouble with how smooth it is!
"Getting a ton of pineapples on the taste and aroma probably from the Mosaic. Tropical fruits, papaya and guava. Very impressive!"
"One of the best triple ipa's I have ever had. Big melon, passion fruit, guava, and pineapple on the nose. Looks like canned pineapple juice.....hazy, yellow, and thick. Taste is outstanding.....abv is well hidden, huge citrus notes, and crushable for a triple. Feel is full bodied with moderately low carbonation."
"Honestly don't get the hype with this one. Tasted very artificial, like tootie fruity candy. ABV was very well hidden, however, there's a lot of lower abv options that have more flavor that I'd take over this any day. Worth a tick I suppose."
Smell: big melon orange guava passion fruit peach mango pineapple banana candied fruit bready malt sweetness herbaceous but mostly smells like a tropical paradise.
"Pours a light yellow to orange with a soft white head. The nose is straight citrus and tropical fruit - oranges, mango and a touch of pineapple. The first sip yields a nicely balanced palate, with hints of grapefruit coming through, followed by the sweet tropical fruits and cantaloupe in the finish. The feel is smooth and it's ridiculously drinkable for the ABV. It's another great beer from Hoof, and quite honestly one of the better they've put out recently."
This is the best Hoof Hearted I have had. Stuff is an explosion of citrus on the nose. Loads of orange and pineapple. First thing I thought of after my first drink was a creamsicle. Damn good. I will not trade any of this away. All mine. Cheers to whoever was lucky enough to get a few of these.
"Wow. Absolutely outstanding. The first NE style IPA I've tried in OH. Doesn't quite match the ones from the East Coast (it's not Tree House, but is pretty close to Tired Hands), but is heading in a great direction. Pours thick (like pineapple juice). An absolutely brilliant nose. Palate is predominantly pineapple, with a great citrus hop background. Mouthfeel is thick for an IPA - excellent. The best OH IPA I've had by a wide margin."
"From can into teku. Bright yellow-orange opaque appearance with good bit of foam head upon aggressive pour. Wonderful tropical aromaticity with ripe fruits: mango, peach. Juicy. Really nicely done with a medium, soft and creamy mouthfeel. Monkish makes exceptional NE style IPAs."
Very nice citrus aroma. Aroma almost makes it seem like it is going to have a sharp “bite” on the pallet. Taste is also citrusy and dank. Very clean. The “bite” isn’t there. Pillowy mouthfeel. Monkish is the real deal.
"Typical hazy oj pour, really nice deep orange, some lace... creamy head"
So dank with juice all around the edges.
L - Hazy orange with murky body and a finger of white head
"Enjoyed on draft at the brewery, and this really lived up to all the hype. Unbelievably smooth with tons of hoppy tropical goodness throughout. No presence of alcohol or off tastes. Get this one while it lasts."
"L - deep, dark, brooding orange. Looks like dangerously overripe mango juice. Crackling head that leaves behind desperately clinging lacing. "
"Great dipa. Canned 5/25, pours deep orange into the glass with fairly quickly dissipating head. Smell a lot of orange and tangerine zest. Full bodied, soft mouthfeel on the tongue, tasting lots of melon and mango. Overall great addition to the Curiosity series."
"No canned on date (which is odd), but released on 05/24/18."
"Good God. Tropical hops for days - mango, citrus, passion fruit, with perfect mouthfeel and bright, glowing appearance. High ABV but perfectly balanced in the aroma and flavor. Very soft on the palate with slight alcohol warmth in the midpalate. Just very well done."
16 oz. can dated 08/01/17
650ml bomber purchased in Decorah for 10 bucks.
"650ml bottle, undated but purchased fresh, poured into a 2017 Toppling Goliath Assassin Teku glass. Enjoyed on 04.15.18, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
Bottle poured into a Russian River Brewing Co pub glass
"Incredible DIPA from TG. Just has everything you want in the body and taste. Rich hops swirl around the palate with ascending flavors of pine, tropical fruit, citrus fruit, especially orange, and a honey like malt backing to it all. Has bite, sweetness, spiciness, and savory flavors. The smell is also quite enjoyable, with orange hops leading the way."
"650 mL bottle. Hazy orange. Smells of sweet orange and pale malt. A hint of garlic. Tastes exactly as you'd expect. Orange hops, tropical fruit, sweet pale malt, and a nice garlicky bite. It's big and a touch sweet, but not enough for me to mind. Medium heavy. Outstanding, as always."
22oz bottle undated purchased at Moonshine in Harwich. Hazy gold/orange color and citrus nose. Citrus flavors such as orange rind and pineapple come through with a malt background. Another enjoyable beer from TG.
L - Hazy orange with a frothy white head.
"Tangerine, grass, melon, grapefruit zest and orange. Fairly dank. Building zesty, resinous bitterness balanced out by the cracker malt. Not too sweet. Clean. Medium to light bodied. Dry finish. Delicious."
Orange and grapefruit
"Toppling Goliath, I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship..."
Bottled ~6 weeks ago. 
A great hoppy and bitter beer without being too dry. Super refreshing while still having bite and flavor
"Quick: Pours a slightly hazy orange gold with a about a thumb of head, retention is okay and there is some decent lacing. Smell is dank and piney with some elements of citrus coming through as well. Taste brings those hops forward all the way, piney, dank, bursts of citrus and then a nice malt teaser. Feel is medium full with good carbonation, finish is dryish. A good beer, solid and easy to enjoy."
"Beautiful in the glass from a 2.5 week old bomber from bottle date. Head dissipates back into a golden and murky body. I get spring onions and grass on the nose - rather sharp and interesting. Not a lot of malt sweetness on this guys. Rind, resin, and hints of garlic lay on the taste with an old school heavy ibu finish. Great beer for a classic double if you enjoy heavy doses of these hops - they aren’t for everyone."
"Slightly hazy dark golden color with a dense head. One of the dankest smelling beers I have experienced. Hints of weed, garlic, and citrus. The flavor lacks depth and certainly subtlety. Admittedly I am not Citra's biggest fan, and it certainly did not put on a good showing here. And then the masters of Mosaic seemed to let their game lapse with this offering. The beer tastes good, but I expected to be blown away by TG with this type of beer."
"Drank from a 22 fl oz (1 pint 6 fl oz) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA"
"Bottle. Expensive but this brewery has earned it. Recently distributed in MA. I picked up some Pseudo Sue cans recently and they tasted legit. I haven't had this one but their hoppy beers are world class in my mind. Pours rather opaque but not turbid or muddy. Nice cap of foam. I don't think the aroma jumps out of the glass like I wanted it to but it is still quite nice. Tangy citrus, some green onion, melon, etc. Flavor is bright and vibrant. Haven't had a DIPA with some IBUs behind it in a while. Bursting with citrus soaked melons and some grassy undertones. Alcohol peeps up in the finish but I don't mind it. Overall, I don't like this one as much as some of their others but I also think I may not enjoy some of the others as much nowadays anyway. Yummy but the price point hurt in the end."
"Fantastic beer, had a pint at Mead Hall in Kendall Square, Definitely worth seeking out at your first opportunity!"
Bottled 3/27/18; drank 4/8/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"Slightly hazy, tannish-orange. Tastes like drinking a Mosaic Hop. Fantastic!"
"Tasted in a a Rastal Teku from a 22 fl oz bottle on April 5, 2018. This double IPA is a hazy triumph made possible by the combination of mosaic and citra hops giving it pineapple and orange flavors that will give into your taste buds."
"A very good beer. And if this is in fact King Sue dry hopped with Mosiac, the additional hop does a nice job adding to the beer. Based on review though I was expecting something a little more juicy and flavorful. TG beers are great but more and more having to decide if the $10 a bomber is really worth it when I can get other similar beers for $15-$16 a four pack."
This is such an amazingly tasty Imperial IPA. Lots of tropical and fruity notes but also dank notes. Very chewable and with just about the right amount of bitterness.
Purchased from Tavour.
Appearance: Pours out very cloudy and honey colored with a little bubble show to boot; nice stickage and copious lacing
"A - Super hazy orange body, moderate white head, lots of stringy white lacing."
A - Nice hazy golden amber with a white head that sticks and leaves a great lacing
Had this on draft at MD 2016. Liked it better than King Sue.
Bright golden orange hues with a big white head that leaves a ton of lacing on the glass.
"One of the more nose bracingly powerful beers I've had in a while. Even having been decanted at a temperature normally too chilly to produce much aroma, this one has a ton of earthy, vegetal, wild onion smells wafting about. Taste has the same markers in it's blitzkrieg, but add in a hint of pine and orange peel to that earthy, veggie soup. A particularly mealy finish serves as proof of a malt bill that is minimally, struggling for attention, but in reality it is giving way a nice walkway for a spicy, slightly hot finish. After taste tries to lay a foundation of sweetness, but falls short as the earthy bitterness really takes root. This hazy beer is not for the unitiated, as it takes a real fan of today's IPAs to really appreciate every characteristic of this beer that has elements of earthy funk, citrus and onion."
Pours like orange juice. Has a thick white head to it. Strong tropical fruit smells with hop herb in the background. Thick mouth feel with very strong flavors. Bitter finish while cold and sweetens as it warms. Great beer
"TG with yet another citra/mosiac bullseye. Pours a hazy orange color. Aromas of citrus, pineapple, with a little pine. The mosaic and citra work well together making this a real juicy hop bomb. Excellent DIPA."
Bottle shared by Khalil. Thanks man.
"Very expensive bombers are available by the case at the Clinton, Iowa Hy-Vee. "
"Pours a hazy tangerine color......smell is full of citrus, mango, pineapple, with a little pine in the background. Smells like a juicy citra bomb. The mosaic and citra play well together in the taste.....this is one juicy beer with moderately low bitterness. Super drinkable for a double. Really liked this beer.....still not quite as good as the king or citra sue."
"Exquisite. Hazy orange. Sticky head. Smells like oranges, grapefruit, pine and sticky, dank hops. Lightly sweet with an awesome bitterness. Lots of orange and grapefruit with a pithy and pine finish. This is s really great beer."
"Pours a hazy yellow/orange color with a thing soapy white head on top. The lacing is good. The smell of beer is pretty damn nice. Loaded with dank citrus. The taste is great too the flavors of citrus and pungent resin. The feel is medium bodied, creamy and smooth. Overall it's outstanding."
Aromas of citrus fruits along with temperate fruits such as a wide variety if melons and peaches. The use of Mosaic and Citra Hops in this are independent and meld well together.
"Pours a hazy murky orange to deep copper with a creamy off white head. Nose is of bright citrus and pungent citrus peel as well as fresh cut grass. Taste is amazingly smooth. Creamy orange julius like with lemon zest, tame grapefruit peel and very light sweet pinnaple. A bit of malt base to it along with a light floral character. Rich creamy body that finishes dry but maintains it smoothness throughout. This is a hop bomb with out that pungent kick you sometimes get with a hoppy beer. Said before and I'll say it again! Incredibly smooooth!! A real treat."
"Mildly citrus aroma. Murky, hazy orange color with a 1/2 inch white bubbly creamy head, dropping quickly to a thick cap with a little lacing. The flavor is citrus, but is dominated by a piney flavor. Not bitter, but a pine flavor. Thick, smooth, creamy, soft mouth feel. Hops flavor of citrus, grapefruit, and pine dominates, but it is well balanced with a malty body and very subtle bittering. Very tasty and enjoyable. At 8%, it is not a super strong DIPA, but the alcohol is well hidden and the taste is easy-drinking, so it will hit you quickly if you're not careful and don't pace your way through the bomber."
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a chalice.
"Pours hazy light orange. Thick, off Whitehead the last awhile with good lacing."
Pours a very hazy golden orange color with over a finger of slightly off-white head.
"Pours a pale hazy straw, similar to pineapple juice. Smells tropical fruity sweet. Taste is heavy on the tropical hops. mouthfeel is a little thinner than I want out of such a big beer. Overall I get what the hype is all about, this is a great IPA."
Like most other beer from TG I enjoyed it thoroughly. Went down very easily and could have used some more. Thinking that King Sue has a cleaner finish.
JUICE!!!
Another great addition to the TG lineup. Orange and weed are omnipresent as the other reviewers have noted.
"Poured from 22-ounce ""bomber"" into a TeKu. This is beautiful in appearance, if you like a hazy, juicy-looking, light orange-yellow body underneath a thick, brilliant white, long-lasting head that leaves lots of spotty lacing as it settles. Malt forward at fridge temperature, but becomes nicely balanced as it warms. Lots of citrus as expected, with notes of orange, grapefruit, and orange zest. The nice resiny bitterness begins to come through at close to cellar temperature. Medium mouthfeel, with a crisp, bitter finish. Another one out of the park for TG. Kanpai!"
Bomber bottle poured into snifter.
"Murky deep gold pour with eggshells white foam; long lasting cap; heavy lacing to bottom of the glass. Dank grapefruit nose; Dank weed taste; lemon rind bitterness; grapefruit and fresh hops;some tropical fruit/no onion, but mostly dank, bitter juice. Medium lite, crisp, with moderate carbonation. Overall a pretty beer that delivers on the hop bang; bitter citrus and dank earth linger; like King Sue on the pipe; a great tasting, easy drinking DIPA."
"Poured quite hazy and opaque - Would appear to be dry hopped. Nice head with good retention and lacing. Smell was a pungent aroma of orange and peach, grapefruit and mango - very fruity and aromatic. The hops just pop. Taste followed the nose with a nice array of orange, grapefruit, mango and peach flavors coming together with a hoppy bitterness that comes from dry hopping. Not overly bitter, but certainly some nice bitterness on the back end cutting any sweetness. Feel was a bit fizzy, light and dangerously drinkable. Overall this is NOT a NE style IPA as some other reviewers have noted - but then again, it isn't marketed, labelled, or intended as such. Its a dry hopped DIPA and as that - its fantastic."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow gold with a large head. The aroma is bursting with notes of grapefruit flesh and peel, overripe pineapple and mango, kiwi, orange flesh, papaya, pear, peach, and apricot. The flavor features strong tangerine, mango, papaya, pineapple, and pink grapefruit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly soft. Overall this is a very tasty beer, though maybe lacking in a touch of vibrancy."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color. Smell is citrus with grapefruit,tangerine and oranges. Taste follows nose very citrus forward with a little rind bitterness in finish not much thou. Softer mouth feel with some bitterness in finish, ABV well hidden. A great 2IPA for those that like more citrus than tropical notes."
"This is not a great IPA. It is very solid, I'll give it that. However it is a failed attempt at a NE IPA. Body is too thin, not enough citrus and, not that it matters, isn't very hazy either. Don't get me wrong, it is good, just nothing near a 4.5+ IPA."
"Pours a yellow/orange hazy color. Big hop forward nose as soon as you open the bottle. Juicy as can be, and loaded with bright tropic fruit flavor. Mango and orange stand out. A slight bitter finish. Every bit as good as the other big TG IPA's."
"Hitting on all cylinders and hitting the palate hard with a Toppling Goliath brewing mindset, an imperial IPA that employs copious amounts of the most coveted hops on the planet for a succulent, tantalizing and full flavored hop bomb that simply explodes on the tastebuds."
"From bottle. Deep cloudy orange-yellow appearance with good bit of foam head upon pour. Bursting juicy and tropical aroma with a good bit of those aromas following in the taste. Mildly bitter finish. Dry feel. Excellent offering, which to me is every bit as good as King Sue or Sosus DIPAs."
Bottle. White head with lace. Hazy sunset gold.
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass.
"Opaque yellow-orange with a thick, large white dense and creamy foam leaving a permanent and solid wall of lace on the glass."
"On tap at Blue Moon. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a cloudy, hazy golden-copper body, one finger white head, good retention, some lacing. Smell is juicy citrus and grapefruit, a bit of resin and pine, light caramel. As usual the hops are out of proportion to the malt. A bit of seediness also. Flavour is huge citrus and tropical fruit, with that sweet pineapple character of mosaic playing a big role, with citra in the background. Mild caramel malt sweetness, good showcase of hop aromatics here for sure. Drinking this one next to King Sue, I felt like this was a bit more interesting. Not sure if this was because it's different, but I found this one to be a bit more interesting. That being said, body is medium, slightly astringent bitterness on the finish."
Juice like pour. Turbid bright straw yellow with a thick fluffy white head on medium pour. Nose is mellow and subdued. Tropical fruit notes with a touch of floral and earthy malt. Minimal on the latter tho. Taste of mangos and melon. Slight citrus and grass. A bit abrasive on the finish but I dig it. Smooth creamy body with a full thick mouthfeel. It’s good.
"Like Raul's prom night, this beer exceeds expectations! Super fruit tropical bomb, hazy like Trump’s brainwaves, and super lush like an LSD dream. Like Mount Pompeii erupting in hops, this one is beautiful."
"Exceptional beer offering by them. Hazy, someone muted smell/flavor, but extremely smooth and tasty. It's not the overwhelmingly dry/bitter/dank IPA you're used to on the West Coast, it's somewhere in the middle between east and west, but reminds you it's an east coast IPA. Great work."
"Poured from a growler filled a week ago, 03/17/18."
"16 oz. can. Hazy orange. Smells very tropical, tangerine, kinda sweet, and a bit of alcohol. Tastes of orange, mango, sweet malts, very low bitterness. Medium heavy. Good DIPA. I was pretty impressed at first, but it ended up being a little too sweet for me."
Canned 4/5/17; drank 4/18/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"Really hazy yellow color with off-white head. Aroma is really herbal and grassy with an intense green hop note. Taste starts sweet and juicy, really fruity and tropical. Light bitterness on the finish. Medium to full bodied, quite crisp carbonation. Overall it's a great example of a NE IPA, really hoppy and juicy."
Canned 11/18/16. Consumed 12/29/16.
Hazy golden rose with two fingers of white ten minute head. Swirls of lace.
"A helpful bartender said ""I got just the beer for you."" When the glass arrived at the table its aroma caused my friend to ask what on earth I was drinking!"
"On tap at Blackback Pub in Waterbury, VT after a bruising 9-hour drive from southern PA. (I just offer that for context: sometimes things taste better after a long day; also, provenance [Waterbury, IMHO, being being the galactic epicenter of craft brewing] might make a difference). A nice clear amber with a fine-bubbled persistent off-white head. Initial impression was OMG: smooth, creamy fruitiness, with lots amd lots of citrus, a healthy dose of pine, some earthiness to keep it real, and a dose of caramel and biscuit malts to balance everything out. Mouthfeel is fluffy and smoooooth; carbonation is perfect. Finish is dry and a little bitter, but sweet too."
"Growler fill from Last Drop. Served in my LHBCo tulip. Coppery in color, and translucent, without much head formation. Really nice tropical fruit aroma: pineapple, guava. Flavor has an initial bite, but is very flavorful still. Delicious simcoe dominates. I get sweet orange peel complemented by a biscuity malt presence which provides more balance than I expected from a proud, aggressively named, PNW IPA. My second ale from Boneyard does not disappoint, though living up to Armored Fist is hard to imagine."
32oz Crowler
Not a fan of West coast ipas I think. Kind of malty.
Surprised this took me so long to get around to reviewing. Growler from MoC.
On-draught @ Freshcraft in Denver.
This pours a slightly caramel amber color. Big and malty bitterness with a slightly sweet finish. Some heat. Lots of candied citrus notes. This was a good one.
"Here's the west coast IPA I've been looking for. Resinous and piney bitterness, but with some honey sweetness rounding out a smooth finish. Drinks very easy for 9%."
"Big body, but surprisingly smooth. Expected bitterness but it's totally subdued. "
"12oz snifter consumed at Manito Tap House in Spokane, WA, for $5.50. "
DANK-LICIOUS
"Luckily stumbled upon this ""want"" in Burlington, VT. This is a beastly beer. Really pronounced hoppiness, especially on the tongue. West Coast hop concussion followed by an odd-yet-pleasant berry flavor. Enjoyed it a bunch."
"Like RPM, this is top notch, with both some paradigmatic west-coast features and some dimensions that make it distinctive and unique. And it is just delicious. Anyway...from a growler into a shaker. Pours a hazy slightly dirty golden-amber. Off-white head with spotty retention and lacing. Nose is of orange rind, fleshy grapefruit, earthy piney resin, and some caramel and bready maltiness. And something else that's kind of sweet and kind of earthy (kind of like tobacco but different) and makes venom the perfect adjective. Taste follows...this is really quality. Like RPM, it isn't overly bitter...but it is really flavorful and hoppy, and there's a substantial malt presence too."
Crowler Date: 3/8/17
"nice looking brew. golden orange with a white head, nice lacing. on nose and palate are notes of sweet malt, intensely malty. some citrus and dankness coming through as well as piney and floral and some spice. overall a bit too malt forward for me but I can understand the appeal - its definitely well done!"
"This felt very much like an old school IPA. It's very far from where IPAs are currently trending, with all the juice and the haze etc. But it was still delicious, and I could appreciate that, like DFH 90 min, it was probably much higher rated back in the day."
"On tap at Mikkeller & Friends in Copenhagen. This was on my list of DIPAs to try for a while and was not expecting to see it on tap in Copenhagen. This isn't really my style for a DIPA - it is malty, but not very bitter; still, it is a very well made beer."
"Crowler from share on 11/12. Pours out a nice, rich golden color, with small, soft, fluffy head. Hops dominate the aroma, some nice citrus, fruity sweetness. Taste continues with more of the hop forward flavors, some juicy tropical fruits. Lingering bitter bite."
Probably the best IIPA I have had. Just need to get them to distribute 60 miles east of Oregon now.
smooth; no alcohol bite or burn. Had it on tap in riedel ipa glass. nice white head; good nose; ample body and not over the top on hops. very well balanced and some tropical notes with not the piney hoppy usual dipa. very good for its class
"Drank on tap at Toronado, Seattle, WA"
"Poured from a growler into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a half finger white head the good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus, piney hops with some good dankness, tropical fruit and orange citrus, nice. Flavor follows with light caramel malt, dank, piney and lightly citrus hops, orange family citrus, light guava and papaya. Finishes with resinous, herbal piney and dank hops with pleasant hops and mild caramel lingering. Medium bodied with light creaminess and good mouth feel. A classic West Coast style IPA with great fresh tasting hops that would not be out of place in a fresh hopped ale. The aroma has distinct caramel, but the in the taste the malt seems quite neutral, allowing the hops to take the whole stage, although a light toffee flavor shows up in the finish. A very well made imperial IPA with a great hop bill. Deserves its reputation."
"now i know why everyone freaks out about this one, its a beautiful northwest style double ipa, and its really super well done. i think its not all that interesting in its hop profile, its not trying to do too much, which is its most appealing quality in a world of experimental hop this, and numbered varietal that. its a classic, no matter how long it has been around, it has a permanent sort of flavor to it, like the gold standard of the style in some ways, but its also more of a ""wow"" for me in terms of overall quality than in terms of the flavor itself in that its not all that different than what a lot of others try to be, its just a lot better. i love the juicy and piney nature of the hops, and all the oil swirling around in here, this seems like fresh picked, incredibly rich in some ways, but not sweet in the end. not an irrelevant grain thing either, its both flavorful and flush in body, and its just enough to support the hops without getting in the way. surprised to see this served in a pint glass at choice city in fort collins, they must sell their kegs at a reasonable price. never seen this on tap here before, so maybe they have decided to launch in colorado? in any event, this beer is a treat, and if you never had it you will see what i mean when i say its often copied but almost never equaled. the alcohol is so well hidden, you could easily get into some trouble with this one!!!"
L: Clear copper gold color with a creamy white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Bands of lacing all around the glass 
"32oz crowler from the bruery, poured into a tulip glass"
"On tap at CBC 2016. Citrus and tropical fruit hops, on top of a nice malty body. Soft and refreshing."
"Aroma came bursting out of the crowler before it was all the way opened. It pours a dark amber with nice fluffy white head. Strong aroma of caramel malt, grapefruit, orange, pine, cinnamon, and clove. It has some very interesting flavors on the taste. I get burnt brown sugar, caramel, resinous pine sap, and more cinnamon and clove. It also has an earthy taste which adds complexity and balances the malt sweetness. Despite the inviting flavor profile, this one falls off badly on the finish. It's flat and almost watery. The flavors never come together and don't deliver the punch you would expect from a top west coast IPA. Was it the long ride on the Fedex truck from Seattle to Orlando? Possibly, but I have to grade what's in front of me and this one did not live up to the hype."
The hop venom is great. I love boneyard rpm and notorious. 
"Tasted in a pint glass from a growler on March 30, 2016. Not as good as the Bend bozos would have you believe."
I had this on draft.
"Had on-tap at the Toronado in Seattle. Dank, grassy, potpourri, resinous. Boneyard IPAs have always struck me as fervently-hopped, yet clean and bright, with every aspect of hop flavor and aroma perfectly preserved."
Nectar of the Gods!
Definitely Top 3 DIPA.
"Not overly impressed. Good for sure but doesn't hold a candle to most IIPAs with similar ratings. Wanted to love this but after drinking similar brews from Surly, TG, Trillium, Lawsons, Melvin, etc this doesn't really hold up"
"Finally, Boneyard makes it way north to the Richland Growler Guys. It definitely lives up to the hype. Everything you could want in a double IPA...big,in your face, juicy hops both in smell and taste, nice abv that is hidden. My wife even enjoyed it and she doesn't usually like ipas. Crossing my fingers that my local GG continues to get Boneyard shipments."

Served On-Tap
Boneyard and their usual orange and yellow hybrid of a beer. Looks nice. Aroma crushes it with pine. Lesser tropical hop aromas.
"Fantastic DIPA, and dangerously crushable despite the higher ABV. Lots of nice hops on the nose and very balanced flavor profile. It pours a nice clean amber with a big white head with slight lacing."
Golden orange. White head.
"After having RPM a couple years ago, I've been craving more Boneyard beers. Growler picked up from the Beer Junction in West Seattle yesterday. Tasted 23 May 2015."
"32 oz Crowler can flown in from Bend, Oregon!"
"The nose is present with citrus. Quick dissipating head, yet lingers. Body is delicious with citrus and finish with a slight spike of hops. HOP VENOM!"
"Tasted on tap at the Bistro dipa fest. Mix of orange and yellow colored beer, lots of pine in the aroma jumbled up with tropical fruit. Good stuff."
keg tapped recently for 32oz fill @ valley growler
On tap at Toronado Seattle. Served in an odd 10-12 ounce sort of shaker glass.
"32 oz Crowler. Pours clear golden amber, thin white head. Sweet smell of bread and fruit. Taste is sweet and fruity up front which turns to citrus hoppiness and a biscuity dry finish. Balance is great. Mouthfeel is slippery. This is a top notch IPA."
"I once had this beer on tap at the Latona Pub in Seattle, and the pint I consumed was so utterly amazing--richly flavorful and perfectly balanced--that for a moment, at least, it stood in a class all by itself in my personal DIPA experience. Others have joined it since, but I still remember that one glorious time."
Great easy dream bling strong beer
"A highly hopped beer with great nose (smell) and taste too! Nothing negative but the price at $29 a growler fill at Porky's in Longview, WA."
"Tried on tap at Special Brews Lynnwood, WA."
On tap at Hops and Pie. Was it hoppy? Yes but it wasn't anything special to me and had a weird malt flavor. Just strange. I know I am in the minority here and that is ok.
"On tap at Apex in Portland, Oregon. "
Surprisingly smooth for a double IPA. Hoppy but not dank or overpowering
"There are several great 2xIPAs out there, but this one in contention for the best. Might not have the hype or marketing of Pliny, but it's world class. Boneyard is only available on tap... so try to track this gem down at a good beer bar."
"Double IPA paradise. On tap at CC pdx. Incredible hop presence on smell and taste. Doesn't leave you reading for water, but for another one. Yet another Bend benchmark brew."
"This is a much sought after IPA and I finally got to try it here at Apex in PDX. Looks pretty good sting lacing classic copper gold color with a frothy white head, but the smell is not terribly amazing very citrus heavy with some heavy musty smells as well, but the flavor is really quite citrusy with some grape and pine undertones. brood ultra dry body that compliments the style. Overall, it was a great IIPA with tons of citrus and a very smooth body for the near 9% ABV."
Great ipa so hoppy and mad smooth for real!
This is an amazing beer! I'll remember the first time I had it as it opened my eyes to how smooth a double IPA could be.
This is a great iipa! I feel it's up there with Pliny the Younger... and a whole lot easier to get!
"Light, clean amber color with a thick creamy head. Aroma is heavy on grapefruit with modest floral notes around the edges. Taste is sour grapefruit, a little bit peppery, a touch floral, with a subtle honey background in the malt. Juicy at first then a dry biscuit finish. Surprisingly smooth both in taste and feel - fortunately lacking the harsh astringency of many strong IPAs - while yet possessing a nice, bright crispness too. Don't let the name scare you, this one doesn't sting a bit. Overall a very pleasurable IPA to spend time with."
Served in a pint glass at Clyde Commons. 
"A very solid beer, a great introduction to Boneyard. Taste and smell are beautiful and make this beer, back end is very full (although a little bitter), but heart warming and enjoyable."
"Really Fantastic DIPA. Not too bitter, with a slightly sweet finish. I would put this up against PtE anyday."
"Pretty straightforward here. Mostly getting grapefruit and pine. Hints of some tropical fruits on the aroma, but the flavor is certainly dominated by grapefruit flesh/rind."
"Had at boneyard tasting room in a tasting glass. Fantastic and balanced, delicious malts backup the intensely floral hop aroma and perfect hop bitter. Growlers only!"
Very pleasant and drinkable at first but the sweetness builds as you drink it.
Best in style. No flaws that I can detect. Consistent batch to batch. My top DIPA for past 3 years.
"Geez, this is a great beer. Awesome look. Sticky white head. Rich, amber body. Juicy, rich, piney, hoppy aroma. The feel is venomous. Something gives this a small bite. Amongst DIPAs, this is the best I have had this year. The best balanced DIPA I have had. Definitely World Class stuff."
"One of the best DIPAs I've ever had, drank 3 days old. Thanks mom!"
"Wonderful array of hops, with just enough malt to support it. Hops are mostly piney in character, some citrus too. Feels very solid on the palette, not too thick though. Well carbonated, with a bit of kick in the finish."
A maltier DIPA that drinks towards On the Wings. Big pine character along with grapefruit.
Thanks to DCLAguy11 for sharing this one at Wowcoolman's tasting.
"Poured into a teku, a clear amber color with a fluffy white head. Was not expecting the color. Smell is phenomenal. Lots of tropical fruits, Papaya, mango, pineapple and a touch of pine. Taste similar to the smell. Flavor just coats your mouth. This is a very balanced double. The malt lingers in the background and supports the hops without getting in the way. Very Solid. Would compare this to DRIPA and Bodhi."
"So to start with the nose on this is grapefruit and marijuana (or Cascade hops). If you can imagine how good that combination would smell, that's it. Btw Appearance was light copper with a strangely thin, weak, head. Moderate lacing. Carbonation is low, but seemingly perfect for the beer. Taste starts with a big green hoppy kick up front that lingers and takes the reigns of a well developed malt profile. It's nearly perfect. Slight warmth going down. "
A-medium amber color with a nice white head and good lacing
Maybe the most well balanced IIPAs I've had.
"On tap at the Pine Box in Seattle, served in a pint glass."
On Tap from Baileys Taproom
Served out of a 64 oz growler into a glass. 
Received a 32 oz growler from @kurmaraja straight from the source. This is my first growler trade as well so it's adding to my excitement of this great beer.
Served on tap into a shaker glass.
"Scored a growler of this through the Home Brew Talk Make A Wish. One of my top wants for quite some time, so I couldn't be happier to be the recipient of this one! Poured into a snifter. "
This is as close to perfect as you can get. Incredible hop flavor aroma and bitterness and masterfully balanced. 
Solid double IPA. Boneyard is blowing up and this beer just adds to an already stellar lineup for being a fairly new brewery.
"Overall, a very tasty and extremely balanced beer. Very similar to Pliny the elder, if you were to make a comparison, but I may like this one a little more. Perhaps it is because I can't get it regularly, but either way, it's still great. "
"From 02/11/14 notes. Big thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing a growler of this; thanks Ross, big Want of mine. Poured into my Bell's tulip."
Fresh Growler poured into a Mason Jar.
"I can't tell you all the fancy terms, i guess im not that smart. But if you have any intelligence, do yourself a favor drink this beer!! To me this is right up there with any IPA i have had, Pliny, Heady, Sculpin, ETC... this is just as good if not better. Yum (please forgive me for punctuation or spelling i have been drinking)"
1771st Review on BA
Finally reviewing this beer after it being a favorite of mine for the past couple years...
I'm getting a growler of this once a month at our local homebrew store. I've had this side by side with a fresh bottle of pliny the elder and it simply beats it for smell and taste. I've had guests that don't like IPAs - or any kind of bitter beer - taste this and the hop flavor and smell is so nice and strong and complex that they loved it. You can at times forget it is actually beer and not just pure hop juice goodness. I'm a big fan.
"16oz, capped growler"
"Big thanks to flexabull for sending this growler my way; my first taste of Hop Venom seemed off, so here's hoping for a truer reading. 64 oz. of liquid gold consumed during a Friday night poker game. I ended up $2.05, so I probably didn't drink enough. "
i tried this on tap at the Three Floyds brewpub a few weeks ago. This is from notes.
"Thanks for the growler, Jeff! Poured into Duvel tulip. "
A:golden honey
64oz growler poured into a Throwback snifter.
"On tap once again at one of the Bistro fests, my review #2400. As usual, Boneyard offers up a very light, yellow and orange colored ipa. Aroma is a blast of pine. Pine venom. Mixed in with that is a decent amount of tropical fruit as well. Very nice. "
"Draft at Taphouse in Seattle. Copper pour with little head in a pint glass. Big floral aroma with definite light sweet citrus. The hops really shine through here and I get no booze on the aroma despite the relatively high ABV. Flavor follows aroma exactly, with beautiful dry hops along with juicy citrus and a slight malt backbone. Slick but pretty easy drinking with medium carbonation. Solid brew! As with RPM, I want more of this. Boneyard is doing some great stuff."
"Nice surprise on tap at Three Floyds. Pours a burnt orange, almost amber, color with a finger and a half length off white head. Smells of resinous grapefruit and pine, as well as sweet carmel malt, some tangerine notes, maybe some tropical fruit notes. Taste starts with resinous hop characteristics. Get grapefruit rind, some orange peel, classic west coast pine, as well as some grassy and floral notes. The middle brings even more resinous qualities, but also starts to introduce the sweet carmel and bready notes to balance it. The finish is quite nice. The hop qualities are still there, but not as bitter, just resinous (if that makes sense). Just get great hoppy fruit flavors with a sweet carmel backbone. Grapefruit, mango, pine, tangerines, sweet bubblegum. Pretty full body with a creamy and oily mouthfeel. No alcohol to speak of. Definitely bitter like a west coast ipa should be, yet never gets abrasive and out of control like a lot of them do. Very hoppy, yet extremely balanced. Really, really good."
"Served on tap at Three Floyds in Munster, a surprise to see, but a welcome one. "
"Pours a murky dark golden orange color and a one finger frothy beige head that slowly settles into a thick lasting ring. Streaks and chunks of soapy lacing coat the glass throughout. Floral, earthy hop aroma with lots of resinous, grassy pine. Really dank smells but there’s also a lot of tropical and citrus fruit sweetness. Hints of mango, grapefruit, pineapple and orange peel followed by some pale malt and sweet booze. Chewy full body with a blast of dank resinous hops that provide a lingering dry bitterness that lasts throughout. Extremely fresh and crazy hoppy but there is some sweetness mid-palate and toward the finish that balances things out. Hints of orange peel, curaçao, tangerine, grapefruit and mango. Sweet booze but abv is relatively well masked. Easy to drink considering how extreme it is. Subtle pale malts toward the finish as well but this beer is all about the dominating dank hops. Really wish 10 Barrel and Boneyard would ship their beers to me…"
"Have had this several times on trips to Oregon, most recently on tap at Apex, but also have had as taster at brewery, and in growlers."
Growler shared by Todd. Served in a DryHop taster glass.
"Mid to high hoppy sweet aroma, low carbonation, sweet more than bitter, yum, sweet linger. "
"I finally got the chance to try this after hearing many good reviews from friends. It didn't disappoint! I got a growler filled at Growl Movement in Keizer, Oregon."
"A - cloudy golden, served in a tulip glass, strong head off the pour, quickly dissipating."

Aromatic floral West Coast big but not overpowering hop front. Surprisingly mellow medium textured balanced mild sweet light caramel herbal body. Balanced hop spice tasty clean bitter hint satisfying rich IPA end. Very smooth and mellow for it's 10% ABV and 80 Ibu's. Big and Tasty! (4.25 / 5.0)"

A - This beer produces a small white head with nice lacing and decent retention. The beer is clear and copper in color.
"February 16, 2012 @ Park Way Tavern"
32oz growlette poured into Dogfish Head tulip pint
"On tap @ Parkway 16Feb, then @ Red Hot 19Feb. A bit thinner, crisper the second time around. Boneyard seems to create multiple awesome IPA's - RPM, SkunkApe, and now that I've have the pleasure - Hop Venom. This one really stood up to a night's competition of Pliny the Elder, Younger, Avery Maharaja, and Dogfish Head 120 Minute. Wonderful stuff."
"Poured a luminescent orange-gold with a trace of off-white head. Absolutely huge aroma of grapefruit, pine, honey, and caramel."
"On tap at The Bistro's DIPA fest. Was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. Hard to believe it's 10%, as it comes across as rather light-bodied, dry and balanced. It has a pale amber body, a few shades lighter than most PNW IPAs. Nice citrus nose with grapefruit leading the way, though it isn't as aromatic as several other beers I sampled that day. The palate is excellent, however, with big grapefruit and orange hop flavors balanced by an oily and biting but restrained bitterness, very Pliny the Elder-esque in that sense. Malt lends some body and slight sweetness, but it remains a lighter-bodied, hop-forward beer. Pretty impressive stuff, one of the best DIPAs I've had from Oregon."
"Growler provided by my younger brother, thanks Bro!"
A: Poured a nice glowing but deep orange with a nice white cap
On tap at the green dragon today. Only available in 10 ounce glasses (but my bartender/waitress gave me a BIG 10 ounce glass).
"From a growlette (32 oz. sold apparently only by Boneyard). Tasted at the brewery with Tony, the owner, who sold it to go because they just opened and it wasn't busy."
On tap 6/6 at Cellarmaker. Belgian tulip
"Excellent hazy ipa. name says it all. Super tropical, fruity hop notes. low bitterness but full of flavor. Cellar maker keeps killing it. Best of the series for sure."
"Had this at one of those Bistro double ipa festivals in recent times. I'm sure I could look it up, but suffice to say it was in the last 1-2 years. Cloudy yellow pour on this one. Small thin white head that eviscerates from its smallish 1/6"" head to zilch in the quickness. Huge blast of pineapple like hops. I think its all Citra but damn also smacks of Galaxy. "
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, red session. Aroma is really dank with citrus fruits, mostly tangerine. Taste is juicy, really fruity and citrusy. Some grapefruit bitterness on the finish."
"650ml bottle, from the January, 2017 release, poured into a Cellarmaker imperial pint glass. Enjoyed on 1.18.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
Good stuff!
This pours a tan gold with slight haze. I am blown away by the aroma. Pow! Wow! Big citrusy juicy aroma. The flavor just pops with citrus goodness. Fan freakin' tastic. One of the best beers I've had this past year.
Tasting notes from 01/25/17
"Piney slight fresh pinapple ..flavors sweetened over some time. First were lemon curd and key lime tones but after carbonation settled...pineapple, guava, mango, and melon. Medium to full body. Good hoppy notes on the finish and linger a bit. "
The beer comes in a clear pale to medium amber color.
A good friend brought me a bottle back from Cellarmaker SF.

A- Like orange juice
"Looks and smells like straight orange juice in the glass. Incredible. As it warms, piney fresh hop aroma starts to pop out of the glass. "
"What a great beer!! Love the cloudy look, love the fruity smell and love the taste!!"
A: gorgeous opaque hazy yellow. Matte mustard. Orange juice. Thin large pearl white bubbles. 
"Monk's Kettle - San Francisco, CA - draft"
"Fresh growler into a teku. Very hazy orange amber. The citrus hits you between the eyes as soon as the growler is opened. Taste is a little pine and lots of citrus, I love Citra hops and this a top notch."
"On tap at brewery, this is one of my all-time favorite beers. Pours opaque, orangeish but its a color that's not in crayola's 128 pack. They pour it very cold, this is an important factor as it evolves a ton in aroma and flavor as it warms. Cold it has big orange, grapefruit, pineapple nose. When it warms you get some fruit, but big dank aroma. Signature CellarMaker stuff. Taste is divine, its fruity but the malt balance is very nice biscuity. When warms you get a totally different experience then cold, and its just as enjoyable. Incredible DIPA, unique, Citra to your dome, this recent vintage is more like april than august and its the best they've done."
"On tap at CM. this DIPA was unlike any I've tried. Orange-yellow haze in color. Smells like floral hops and sweet malt. Taste: silky-smooth and delicious hops, bready malts. Feel: medium-bodied and refreshing. Overall: great beer. Wanted to have a growler but this one was apparently getting low. Next time!"
"If you are Citra fan, you will love this beer. Otherwise, it's a solid beer which I would drink again, but doesn't rank with the better DIPAs. Pour a solid orange with little to no head. Not bitter, with a hop forward taste that is surprisingly smooth."
Pour from growler filled two days ago. 
On tap at cellar maker poured into a taster glass on premises. Definite nose of citra hops. Big bold taste and a nice combination of bitter and sweetness. A really good beer
Straight up grapefruit in a glass ... so damn good. So happy Cellarmaker is in San Francisco so I can get this stuff without any hassle.
"Looks like freshly grapefruit/OJ in the glass, not sure if its minimally filtered."
Poured on tap into a taster glass at Cellarmaker Brewery.
Yea I'm giving big points on the hazy cloudy look of this unfiltered dipa. Aroma of candied citra. Slightly sweet up front with big bitterness cutting through it. Orange and grapefruit through and through.
"This beer is a can share from RemingtonSteele1987, co-worker. The pour is a hazy, golden orange with a nice, off-white head with some spotty lacing retention. The smell is big pineapple with a pine dankness and some subtle tropical fruit. The taste is impressive. Big and bold pineapple flavor with a hint of citrus fruits, such as grapefruit, melon, tangerine and mango with just a hint of pine hoppiness."
"This is an incredible NEDIPA with the signature three hops that got the style on the map. Soft, juicy, with a nice dry bitter finish. Execution on point!"
"Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is orange, tangerine, and grapefruit rind. Medium bodied, slightly bitter, and low carbonation. Excellent juice bomb that is different from other NEIPAs. Awesome. Glad I got a four pack."
Light orange hazy pour. Nice lacing
"Pours a very cloudy pineapple color. Nose hits of strong and pleasant citrus and hops. Nice full bodied mouthfeel you’d expect from a double IPA. Compared to NG ( my fav) and Swish, IMHO I put this in between the two. Pleasantly surprised. Better than expected. And glad I bought it."
"Poured into a tulip. Super hazy golden yellow. Looks like a hop milkshake. Looks thick and creamy. Aroma is straight pineapple with subtle tropical notes as well. Taste is amazing...pineapple juice flavor is dominant but subtle tropical fruit layers with minimal bitterness. Wow! Feel is as expected with the beer being creamy and full bodied. Overall, this is my new favorite beer from Bissell. Outstanding."
"Dank, grassy, white grapefruit, earthy yet bright, pithy and pine. A wisp of a malt bill. Cracker dryness. Medium bodied. Raw citrus rind and pine resin bitterness. Pleasant amount of sweetness. Really good."
"pours out this ridiculously murky pale yellow color with a dense and fluffy bright white head, excellent lacing. on nose and palate is a ridiculous bouquet of ripe fruits - big mango, creamy peaches, tangerine, pithy grapefruit, melon, herbaceous green character and a hint of pine. sweet bready malts throughout and overall very creamy texture and profile."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with 1/2 finger width foamy head. Retention is mild. Lacing is decent. Big time pineapple aroma with mild piney resin. Big, big pineapple taste. Very fresh. Good amount of piney bitterness at the end. Medium bodied with low carbonation."
"This one pours a fairly hazy yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
This is one tasty beverage. Juicy with a nice bite. Lights that candle and scratches that itch all at one time. Do not pass GO. Grab it if you can.
"Draught @ Brewery: This one pours a milky golden color. It has a small white head and some lacing. Good nose! Pineapple, some lemon and orange. The taste is very good. Low bitterness. Lots of juicy, fruity hops. Pineapple, orange and lemon. Nice!"
Had on tap at bar.
"Pours a hazy pineapple juice color, aroma hits you in the face when u crack the can, pineapple, mango, blueberry's, awesome."

"For me, this beer varies quite a bit batch to batch. It can be one of Tree House's best or kind of average. If you hit them on a good day, buy the limit. Buy the limit anyway since you don't know and the ""bad"" days are worth the risk."
"Hazy light golden color with white head. Aroma has ripe citrus fruits, mango and hop resin on a clean malt background. Taste starts bittersweet and hoppy with citrus rind and resiny hop flavors. Aftertaste lingers with a good amount of bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. A more west coast approach of the style but it's well made and tasty."
a: muted orange color with some amber & dark yellow notes. slightly hazy. 2 finger frothy white head
"From Zombier. In Teku glass. Playing Avernum 5. Plenty of nice orangey notes in a good, smooth body. Didnt have a strong citra profile, but is really nice and original with its orangyness"
"Wow, another Treehouse beer that's almost exactly like the rest."
Somehow locked this one down in Chico from a local who gets beer mail. He left it on my porch at 5am on his way to the airport early today and it was still frosty from the morning chill when I got to it. Cracked it same day after discgolfin and a hot shower and holy HOONTAH is this delish. A crisp hit of bitterness turns into the exact feeling of drinking an orange julius. First Treehouse offering i've tried. If I ever conjure enough $ to go on an east coast beercation I will be definitely stopping in Mass. to try other offerings from the source! Short story long: DIDNT DISAPPOINT!!
Pour is orange gold. Definite taste of Orange and citrus. Very drinkable and in my opinion one of the best treehouse offerings. Solid easy coast IPA.
I am not the biggest fan of Citra as I get a bit of the dreaded cat piss. I much prefer the galaxy version. That being said the Citra here is very well presented.
"16oz can: This one pours a murky golden color with a hint of orange. Good head and lacing. Good nose. Citrus and tropical aromas are predominate. Orange and tangerine stand out. The taste is good. A fair amount of bitterness. Orange, other citrus and tropical hop flavors. Nice!"
A very good IPA but no were near as good as some of the others from TH. I found the feel lacking as well.
Tree House Bright w/Citra 7/1/18
16oz can dated 6/27/18.
"Tasted from can. Color is a hazy orange with thick white head. Looks like orange juice. Nice citrus aroma with lots of orange, tangerine and a little grapefruit. Incredibly balanced with very little bitter bite. Flavor is huge orange and tangerine, slight grapefruit, melon and some biscuity sweetness. Excellent imperial IPA."
"Canned 4/10. Vibrant yellow, a good inch worth of head that faded slowly leaving thick lacing and ring of foam around the glass. Smell is tropical and citrus. Tastes like ripe papaya a hint of bitterness like orange rind and a pleasant, subtle sweetness. Very smooth for a double IPA at 7.8%, perfectly carbonated with a very soft finish. The Bright variants have really impressed me!"
"Pours a slightly clouded amber- yellow color, with a froth, huge head."
"Probably my favorite of the Bright series. Drinking this with about 2 weeks of fridge ""age"" on it. Comes out very... bright. Hazy hay color, nice head. Flavor is brimming with lemon and tangerine, some herbal notes linger, bitterness is definitely there. Would be higher rated but it's a bit one-sided. Too easy to drink and this was perfect for a lazy afternoon on the porch."
Canned a week ago.
"Very citruisy, great hot weather beer!"
"This one pours a moderately hazy (much less hazy than most TH IPAs) yellow-ish/orange color, with a small head and lots of lacing."
Very strong citra taste. Good just not my cup of brew
"The beer pours a some what hazy yellow with big fluffy white head that sticks for a while. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells citrus, lemon, grapefruit, and pine. It tastes of citrus, lemon, grapefruit, and pine. The mouthfeel is medium. This is a good bright variant from Tree House."
First things first...Citra hops..for sure
Untappd
"A good example of a TH DIPA, but I prefer the original with Mosaic."
Beautiful citrus colored beer. Like tangerine or orange juice with a half finger worth of off white head. 
This is really tasty. I’ve had regular Bright and was less then impressed. This one hits on every level and holds up to treehouse standards. Big fan.
"I've had the tremendous privilege of drinking Bright, Bright with Citra, and several other Treehouse beers in the last day. Being able to compare them in such a short amount of time - pretty fantastic."
"Very pleasantly surprised. Did not expect this to quite measure up to Julius, Doppelganger or Haze, and was blown away to find that it equals or surpasses all of them. Perfect malt/hops balance; typical Tree House cloudy pour with moderate head; rich, fruity hop aroma. It simply does not get much better than this."
"Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew, again."
"16 oz can. Scored after a 45 min wait in line on 12/13. Not bad, except it was about 5 degree's!! Lol. Worth it!! The selection was very good. Green, Haze and this. Bottom of can : ""Smile like you've got nothing to prove"" 12/7/17 poured into a TreeHouse signature glass."
Bought at the brewery yesterday and enjoyed at home. Outstanding double IPA
"Canned on 10/5/17, consumed on 12/2/17 - so not super-fresh, but still . . . glad to have a can of this."
"Appearance - Pours a hazy pale orange. A week and a half in the fridge and I noticed some separation of the sediment that didn't happen with my other tree house offerings, but a quick swirl in the can brings it right back up. It looks like a blend of tropical citrus juice. About two fingers of fluffy eggshell light head, leaving a thick ring of lacing that doesn't want to dissipate."
Look- Slight haze with a light golden orange. Minor translucency. 
"Can poured into snifter. Yellow straw, hazy, bright white pillowy head leaves lacing on the glass."
"Pours hazy, light yellow in color with 3/4 inch head. Taste is pineapple, tangerine, and sweet orange juice. Medium bodied and carbonation, slightly sweet, and juicy. This is sooooooooooo much better than regular Bright. Not really a fan of the regular version. This one still maintains the taste of the base beer but has a twinge of pineapple that makes it go down way easy. Glad I was able to get several cans of this. Still prefer their core four, but this is well worth a try."
"Pours a bright golden hazy. It's opaque but not milky looking. It's a collection of tropical fruit but pineapple and unripe mango are probably the most accurate with a hint of passionfruit and papaya. Those tropical flavors carry through up front but there is a nice kiss of grapefruit on the finish. It's not my favorite Citra focused beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it's good."
"Medium-pale gold body with that New England haze... Bright (lol) white head left lotsa lace down the glass... Unsurprisingly presents a bouquet of citrus fruits and their flowers on the nose, followed by a crisp, sharp, and tangy citrus splash across the tongue... Juicy and zesty, the fleshy sugars hit up front, in moderation, and subside to allow the pithiness to dry out the initial waves of juice... Medium-light weight and amply carbonated, smooth but tingly... Fresh as fuck with a 10/18/17 canning date..."
"From a day-old can, pours a glowing, hazy yellow-orange. Two fingers of dense foam leaves thick lacing. Smell is fresh citrus, tropical fruits and green herbaceous matter. Taste follows. Feel is soft and slightly rich. Really nice."
16oz can dated 9/5 poured into a becher
"Bought cans at the brewery, kept in fridge. Every day i drank one. The hazy declined exponentially with days. After 3 days, this is a very nice West coast IPA. Initially its awesome, but it fades in minutes. Not a classic treehouse beer by any stretch. Though overall, nice"
"Looks like a hazy yellow beer with a foamy white head on top. The smell is a little on the funky side, not really all that hoppy. The taste is really nice, quite juicy and not overly bitter at all. The feel is very smooth. Overall it's a very nice brew."
"from a can, pours a hazy, pale golden color, thick white head, aroma of tropical fruits, mango, papaya, starfruit, hoppy, citrus, grapefruit, orange, floral, light pine, bread, honey; flavor is hoppy, medium bitterness, citrus, tropical fruit, light honeyish profile, crisp, medium body, slick texture, finish is fruity, bitter, and refreshing, very nice"
"The beer pours so well. Although the body looks like dirty dish water the head is deep and long lasting. The aroma is excellent, the flavor is outstanding from start to finish. This instantly grabbed my attention and became one of my new favorites. Bright with Citra is the real deal. It's no Heady Topper but it's in the neighborhood."
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. Canned a few days ago and purchased at brewery. 
Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into a snifter. The beer pours a hazy orange color with frothy bleached white head of 3 cm foaming up even with a fairly gentle pour. The aroma is very fruity and has mango and some peach hits. I also get a bit of biscuity yeast but this is fruity hop dominant. 
Had this as a pour at the brewery. Absolutely delicious!
Had this not too long ago...
"Look: extremely hazy, can barely see shadow of fingers through glass. Yellow with a bit of orange."
"pours golden orange, not quite as cloudy as others, almost can see thru it, but not really. Great mouth feel with a slight (tiny) bitterness at the end (tiny), certainly not like any WCoast DIPA. So easy to drink, doesn't come across as 7.8%, just an easy drinkin, full mouth feelin DIPA from TH, great stuff but what else would you expect?"
"16oz can, purchased at Tree House on 6.14.17, poured into a Tree House snifter glass. Enjoyed on 6.24.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"A very nice head retention on this brew, thick and creamy foam that lingers. Nice Hazy IPA color that is well blended. I smell more citrus than anything, but the sweaty dank scent comes through in the secondary. Taste is a heavy malt punch that is attacked by the hops as your palate adjusts. Opens nicely to a sweet lemon tart with a hop crumble atop. I feel a bit of the alcohol bite, but not overpowering, can definitely taste the 7.8%. A very enjoyable brew, nice change of pace for Tree House, and very complex smells."
L - Hazy light orange with two fingers of white head
"Pours a chalky orange with a three finger head. Smells of peppery hops, pineapple and earthiness, slightly dank. Taste is bitter up front, hoppy, peppery - matching the nose, with tropical citrusiness on the back end. This beer is more hop forward than most other Tree House offerings, and it leaves the tropicalness that usually comes with on the back burner. Not a bad thing per se, and should really impress lovers of traditional ""West Coast"" IPA's. As always with Tree House, this beer is good and certainly worth a try."
I have had this beer several times and each batch is slightly different. Always a very good classic west coast style IPA. Overall a really nice beer but in no way is this one of the best beers in the world.
Enjoyed this one recently from one of my TH sources. In my opinion this is the BEST version of Bright that TH puts out! Tons of Citra hops here and a lot easier to get ahold of then some of their others!
16 oz. can dated 07/25/17
must preface this review by saying that if id ran into this beer at a gas station or on tap i would have thought it was okay-
"My first draft beer at the brewery! Head billowing out of the plastic cup. Hoppy and juicy, soft and creamy. Filling. Not as hazy as others."
"P- Poured from a 16 oz can,into a large Tree House snifter.REACH OUT IF YOUR CUP BE EMPTY 07/25/17."
"Can dated 7.25.17 (yesterday) with the phrase, "" reach out if your cup be empty' to paraphrase the Greatful Dead's Ripple...."
Truly exceptional - one of my top 2 of all time.
"Bright is an underrated beer from Tree House. In this Citra instance, it comes out completely tropical but something is lacking. There are better variations of Bright."
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (2 weeks old). Appearance is light orange brown in color and fairly transparent until the bottom of e can is poured in, two finger thick head with decent retention. Smell is bright floral hops with tons of citrus. There are notes of orange juice, tangerine, resin, honeysuckle and crackers."
A: soft white 2 finger cloud I see with most th beers and the color a hazy yellow 
"Hazy orange pour, large puffy white head, good lacing. Tropical fruit aroma, dank citra, grass. Grassy up front, citrus, light herbs, dank, weed. Medium to slightly lighter body, incredible drinkability."
"Nice orange hue, plenty of light scattering. Excellent head on pour with retention thereafter."
holy crap this stuff is good!!!! so easy to drink... so yummy and delicious!!
"The smell when I crack the can was overpowering ripe tropical fruit. The body is great, full and creamy with a zing in the finish. If anything maybe I am growing bored with an all Citra beer."
"Definitely my favorite of the Bright series! Nothing wrong with Mosaic hops, but Citra makes this beer simply amazing!"
"Pours a clear orange that turns murky and opaque when the last ounce or two is poured out. Two fingers of white, foamy head form up top. Head retention is fair, with good lacing left behind. Aroma is heavy orange, citrus, and papaya. Flavor profile is orange, mango, and melon. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a little graininess. Overall, flavorful, with good citrus and melon notes. Not a tastebud killer either. "
Thanks to whomever traded this my way in the line the other day...very much appreciate the tick. classic looks but the addition of Citra really makes a somewhat meh beer from tree house into a really nice tasting beer. definitely an improvement on the original. bursting w Citra.
"Top Bright variant to date. Typical hazy tree house style, but the nose on this one explodes with grapefruit, orange, and tropical sweetness, complimented by a smooth oily mouth feel. Must try!"
"Big thanks to rudzud for picking this up, canned 1/10/17, so a bit of age unfortunately, so I'll take it with a grain of salt."
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Monson, MA"
"The body on this is a shimmering, mostly clear burnt gold with a large foamy off-white head leaving fuzzy garter lace. The second half of the can brings the haze, and tons of it, almost becoming fully opaque--this is not my experience with other Bright versions."
Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 3/21/17.
"One of my favorite Tree House beers. Pours hazy gold; strong fruit aroma (orange/mango). Very clean refreshing with citrus taste that is similar to aroma. Very smooth, lightly carbonated. Great taste overall. Would be a great beer to drink everyday. I prefer Bright w/Citra to the other versions."
Imorovement over the regular bright. My fav variant is simcoe/Amarillo but this is very solid. If u enjoy the citra hop u will really enjoy this beer
"Pours a semi hazy straw yellow with a thick, soft head."
"First had poured from pint can, (apparently) stamped on bottom, ""KEEP COLD, 02/16/17, DRINK BRIGHT,"" acquired at Tree House on visit on 02/17/2017. This is an amazingly drinkable beer, and perhaps the path forward for the American DIPA, as the big citrus is grounded by herbal dankness."
"Already was a big Bright fan and the Bright with Citra is amazing – a lucky surprise after standing in line. As I'm pouring the aroma explode out of the can and glass, even as it's two feet away. Hazy orange-bronze in the glass. Flavor is powerfully floral citrus hop with pleasant carbonation. Flavor remains pleasant as it lingers and smooths out nicely. Compared to regular Bright, this is more citrusy and feels a bit fuller-bodied. A truly amazing brew."
"16 oz. can. Hazy bright orange. Smells of citrus, mango, sweet doughy malts. Tastes of orange, tangerine, mango, and some pithy grapefruit. Has just a bit of garlic to it. Moderate sweet pale malt. Not that bitter, but enough to surprise me. Medium body. For something that's supposed to showcase citra, it's pretty dynamic. I expected something just juicy and sweet."
"Bright golden orange hued, big white head, and fantastic lacing. Harsh citrus aroma. Notes of orange, tangerine, grapefruit and fresh citrus zest. Medium body, soft, crushable and lightly dry. Huge citrus flavors, maybe a touch one dimensional but exceptional!"
"It pours with the typical haze, but this is a lighter yellow shade, nice 2 finger head, great retention and lacing all the way down the glass. The smell is just straight up tangerines, orange and maybe a hint of mango. A soft aroma, not as pungent as a lot of other DIPAS, very nice. Taste follows the nose, beautiful, bright, soft tangerine, orange, a slight grapefruit and mango lingering in the back, the flavor is unreal. Very soft bitterness, just enough to remind you this is beer. It has a very soft, pillowy mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Overall I believe this to be one of Treehouse's very best IPAs/DIPAs...I love how the Bright series just uses one hop, to highlight the very best qualities of the hop thats used. Just simple, clean, EXTREMELY well executed beers. A+++++"
Poured a very fresh (1 day) can into a std pint glass. Hazy (opaque) light yellow gold color with 1 finger head. The head dissipated fairly quickly and left mild lacing all the way down. The aroma was a bit more dank for me than some other tasters have reported. Citrus rind and perhaps a little barnyardy. The flavor follows the nose with a nice balanced bitterness offsetting the light biscuit of the malt. Finishes nicely but without the usual TH fluffy mouthfeel. Honestly a bit disappointed with this one. Very good beer but just under TH usual standards. I will give the other cans a week or so and try again and revise rating as warranted.
Poured from a 16 oz can into a teku glass.
Very drinkable and light.
"Pours an opaque hazy gold with a two finger head that lasts most of the beer, ample lacing."
Big big fan of this one. No surprise.
This edition of bright pours a hazy gold but lacks the opaque cloudiness of most TH IPAs. The foamy white head leaves rings of thick lacing. 
Poured into new Tree house glass picked up yesterday from 2/17 Bright w Citra growler
"Light orange hazy color (perfectly matches the color of the can). Nose not as explosive as some of the main line TH brews, but still pleasant hints of citrus (big surprise), orange, orange soda, and a bit of grass. Taste is mostly orange that finishes with a slight bitter orange rind pith bitterness that is there and gone quickly. Crisp and clean mouth feel, although not as soft and velvety as some of TH's other offerings. Super drinkable - tastes closer to 5.5 than 7.8."
idk...the nelson variant was the one that did it for me. good non the less. nothing to go crazy over imo.
Picked up some of this at the brewery on release. Poured into my Duvel tulip.
Love this beer. All brights are my favorite!!!
"Another tasty brew from Treehouse. Not on par with Haze or Doppelganger IMO but still a solid beer. Of the Bright series I enjoyed this one, original Bright and Nelson the best. Very tasty brew, smooth and full of flavor. Its def a NE style though not a huge Juice bomb. Very subtle and drinkable. Well done"
"L: More translucent than the typical Tree House IPA, but moderately hazy with a thick and lush white head"
I really think that the Brights are the most underrated of all the Treehouse beers. Bright with Citra hops certainly lives up to the reputation. Very drinkable and wish I had more!
Bright just isn't my type of beer.
The beer pours beautifully with a thick white head that has good retention and lacing. The body of the beer is an opaque yellow but not hazy such that there is a lot of proteins or polyphenols.
First beer I've had from Tree House but the hype is real! The line stretched around the block at 12pm on a Wednesday. Incredible!
"This wasn't on the menu tonight, but in my drunken stupor I managed to drop it on the floor, close the kitchen door, pushing it outside where it rolled across the deck through a gap roughly the size of a rolling can, and down a flight of stairs to the laundry room where it settled in a dark corner."
"Pours a deep straw/ light orange color, very hazy, minimal head. Huge hoppy aroma, very dank, big tropical fruits: pineapple, mango, loads of citrus. Very hoppy and sweet! Loads of tropical fruit: pineapple, mango, some guava, orange, lemon. Very juicy, makes my mouth water. Carbonation is appropriate. Overall this is a fantastic beer, I want more!!!"
L: Burnt orange golden hues with a foamy white head and ample lacing
CAN
"On tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY."
8/7/18 - On tap at the Haymaker in Manhattan. Served in a 12 oz. stemmed glass. Hazy orange copper color with white head. Great fruit aroma with a spicy fruit bomb flavor. Too many flavors to keep track of. Tasty.
Poured into a pint glass via grolwer purchased at OH on 7/26/2018
Decanted for a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned on 07/19/2018 and purchased at the brewery today.
"I had this at a bottle share. I didn't see a date on the can but based upon the release date it was canned 5 weeks earlier. It pours a turbid orange-brown color with a large, fluffy, milk-white head and extensive lacing. It's a beautiful pour. The nose features ripe cantaloupe melon, lemon, grapefruit, and floral mosaic hops. The taste positively bursts with fruit, both sweet ripe melon and slightly tart citrus, with oats, lactose, and flavorful Mosaic hops with very little bitterness. The blend of flavors is amazing! This ale is super viscous and creamy - one of the thickest IPAs I've ever had - with moderate carbonation. The 10.5% ABV is potent; if you prefer session ales, then I suggest you pass on this one. I'm glad I didn't, though because Mosaic Daydream is magnificent! The tastes are beautifully balanced, and so is the balance between a plush, pillowy mouth feel and a high ABV. Simply outstanding!"
Can shared by Dave. Thanks man.
L - 1-finger offwhite head atop a murky yellow body.
Draft pour from the source.
Dangerously drinkable for a 10.5%. Everything I love about Mosaic-forward Other Half beers only...more. Outstanding
"Not going to break it down in all categories. Just an overall. Very smooth DIPA. Love Malden, Everett and Charlton beers. Never thought the towns I grew up in would one day create beers that are literally art work."
Review from notes dated 4/9/18 and from currently drinking on 4/20/18
"Poured out as a hazy yellow color with a great looking white head on top. The smell has a very nice hop aroma coming off of it. The taste of the beer is very well balanced with a nice malt profile and hop bitterness. The feel is nice and smooth, very drinkable. Overall it's a very nice beer!"
"Wow, it's been about 9 months since I first had this beer's little brother, Four Seam... seems like yesterday that IH's first NEIPA graced my palate. Honestly, Four Seam is an awesome little beer, but Six Seam is in another league (baseball jokes notwithstanding!)... read on to find out how much this beer has impressed me!"
Just perfect
"Drank on tap at Idle Hands Craft Ales, Malden, MA"
"This is on the same level as many of the heavy hitters from Tree House, Trillium, Alchemist and Maine Beer Co. Great balance and just really enjoyable. It’s nice to drive 5 minutes and not wait in line to get a beer this good. Well done."
"From a 16oz can, dated 01/10/18. Served in an imperial pint pub glass."
L - Hazy orange with a finger of white head
Averaged out my experiences between the November 2017 batch and the January 2018 batch. Nov batch had more aroma and flavor pop. Jan batch came in a little hotter. Got Mosaic and then Galaxy character as it warmed. Both batches had ultrasmooth carb.
"Edit: think I was a little overzealous rating this, still stunning but dropped it slightly. "
16 oz. can dated 10/25/2017
Look: pours a very hazy yellow. Looks like if you mixed pineapple juice with a bit of orange juice 
Pours apple juice.
"OJ, deep orange, slightly milky color. Medium lace, creamy head."
Murky yellow with white foam.
"16 oz can. Light cloudy golden pour. Aroma pops of pineapple, wow! Tropical flavors, on the sweet side, almost too sweet. Nice dry citrus peel finish. Really solid brew by Monkish, as expected."
"Smell: Straight pineapple candy, pineapple juice. Mango, papaya, orange juice. straight Tropical fruit juice. No malt presence at all."
Can Date: 10/19/17
Canned 12/27/16. Consumed 1/12/17.
DDH Citra + Galaxy - Other Half
L - you know how I know there's Galaxy hops in here? This shit pours a milky banana yellow. It doesn't even look like beer! Looks like frozen pineapple juice. 
"Pours cloudy gold color that looks like pineapple juice with the typical 1-2 finger foamy off white head that leaves good spotty lacing. Smells and tastes like pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, lime, tangerine and orange peel, followed by floral notes, coriander, peppery spices and piney notes. The malt backbone is sturdy with graham cracker, toasted grains, biscuit and light caramel. Another really tasty OH beer which doesn't seem dry hopped since it was very juicy and flavorful."
Outstanding indeed.
"Picked this up when it was released at the brewery, as the date on the bottom of the can was 10/18 with ""TIME TO FIST BUMP"" under it. I enjoyed the regular version of this but of course, this double dry-hopped take was smoother, juicier, and just that much more enjoyable! I'm not sure if these are the two best hops out there, but it's easy to see why they're so easy to quaff after forcing myself to take my time savoring this!"
Typical OH tall can...10-18-17....a month in the can
"Super juicy after 2 weeks in the can. Tons of aroma, this one is actually turning out to be the best one of the release. My only qualms are that it is under-carbonated and thus needs an aggressive pour to yield a one finger sized head. Other than that this is a superb beer. Lot of stone fruit and a big punch of peach all over the flavor, very light and quaffable, though a bit stale from the aforementioned lack of carbonation."
"Massive thank you to my man Robbie for tossing me the goandpickitupformebro can to tick. Pours total murky juice. Yep, nose is citra and galaxy, side by side leaning towards galaxy. Thick and lush. Taste is full bodied and represents both hops really well with a lab to galaxy. Solid brew."
"Medium-gold, juicy-looking beer under a fat head of foam... Plenty of citrus on the nose - primarily orange and grapefruit, which is pretty common... Followed up with a body of similar citrusy notes, smooth and soft, medium-weight... Carbonation is ample, bitterness mild, sweetness the same... a nice vehicle for two favorite hops, New England-style... 10/18/17 canning..."
"L - light yellow, opaque, white two finger head fades only slowly"
"Another wonderful hazy dipa from Toppling Goliath. The pour is beautiful with white foam crowning a yellow hazy concoction. The smell is full of hops, with typical hazy fruit filtering up, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, melon, along with hay and wild flowers. The taste has some added honey, earthy tones, and some banana. The feel is light and fluffy. Enjoyed quite a bit, but like other ipas from TG more"
"Cloudy golden straw pour . Smell is tropical fruit, orange, and pineapple. Taste follows the nose and stays sweet with hints of tropical papaya fruit . Creamy medium body. Bitter aftertaste with sine warming."
"Juicy, earthy, and bitter."
2018-07-04
I don’t love this beer as much as everyone else. 
"22oz bottle, shared with my friend, Ken. Opaque pineapple juice colored ale with a creamy off-white head. Zesty aroma of citrus and passion fruit. Flavors are passion fruit galore, lemon-lime, grapefruit zest, and guava. Medium body, zesty and tart, moderately bitter finish. Very good NE style DIPA."
Look--- beautiful golden hazy 
"i get it that these guys were one of the original makes of this sort of thing, not a trend follower, and that they have some of the most notable hazy ipa types out there. i also get that its exciting to drink beer from them, but this one really isnt that different or that great, and as much as i think its tasty, its probably better on its own than it is in the context of the rest of their hoppy portfolio. the aroma is fresh citrus, but so are a million other dry hopped beers like this. its juicy and its fresh, but that does not make it unique or special anymore. what bothers me here is the hop burn, its like so dry hopped that there is a distinct vegetal harshness about it, like it was hopped beyond its carrying capacity. sure those hops are delicious, they smell and taste incredible here, but the textural sacrifice is a lot to give up, and while this has plenty of grainy body, it also is a little hot and overly hoppy going down. subtle melon and pineapple here with the citrus, a nice mix of hop varietals and a fine technique, but these guys have clearly found a formula and a sticking to it, not unlike the early beatles songs, but just like 4/4 time and verse chorus verse song structure, this is becoming a little redundant and as much as i like it, i want a new experience every time i have a toppling goliath beer, or anything this hyped for that matter, and thats not what i got with this one..."
"220z bottle undated purchased at Moonshine. Hazy orange color and citrusy nose. Citrus flavors such as orange, pineapple and mango are present along with possibly melon and definitely grapefruit that continues in pith form on a very long-lasting finish. Great creamy mouthfeel. Another enjoyable beer from TG."
Bottled ~6 weeks ago.
Bomber poured into a teku glass
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 22 fl oz bottle on May 11, 2018. Brewed each spring to celebrate our brewery’s annual day off to go morel mushroom hunting, this excitingly hazy double IPA is a tribute to our love of great hops and morels. Created with a combination of Pacific Northwest and Southern Hemisphere hops, Scorpius Morchella is meant to be shared with friends on a warm spring afternoon."
"A: Cloudy, lingering white head, light peach juice"
"Cloudy, amber color. Small, tight bubbled head produces thick streaks on the glass. "
Beautiful cloudy golden look. Smell is candied tropical fruit (orange/pineapple). Taste follows nose and stays sweet tropical fruit throughout. Creamy medium mouth feel. This is a great NE style DIPA. Can't wait until next year to get it again.
Look - very hazy
Opaque tan-yellow with a moderate white froth that settles in lumps.
"Scorpius Morchella pours a very hazy, lighter copper color, with a long lasting and lacing head. Aroma is bold, with a creamy backbone, citrus, and hops. Flavor is pretty balanced, bold flavors, big citrus hop flavors. Good body and feel. Overall a very tropical and bold IPA."
"Drank from a 22 fl oz (1 pint 6 fl oz) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA"
"Pours cloudy yellow orange in color. Smell is fruity with a little dankiness. Taste very fruity and sweet but a good ipa feel. Good ipa. 13 Oz draft $9 @ The Fix in Worcester, MA."
Pours a bright almost neon yellow. Completely opaque. Two finger frothy white head dissipates but not completely. A rolling series of hills of white foam is left on top of the beer. 
Pours a very hazy light orange/yellow with a thick white head that lasts. Leaves decent lacing. The aroma is light tropical fruit with some pine. Flavor follows the nose. The feel is smooth and thick. Overall an okay beer but nothing to justify the cost. Disappointed.
"A let down for me. If I had this blind, I would think it was a nicely down IPA but nothing special. But considering TG's standard and how hyped this beer was, I was disappointed. It just lacked the big flavor punch that I was hoping for."
"650ml bottle. Served in a Toppling Goliath chalice. Pours a medium pulpy orange body, one and half finger white head, plenty of wispy lacing. Smell is grapefruit, spices, caramel a bit of pulpy orange, some zest. Flavour is orange zest, a bit of caramel, grapefruit, and a bit of spice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, soft without much bitterness. An overall tasty brew with a good bit of orange zest to it."
"22 oz. bomber that’s been in my possession for about four hours. Split with my wife. Oh, & I love mushroom hunting. Fresh beer & fresh mushrooms are a killer combination. Literally, if you’re not sure what you’re picking…"
"On tap at Ansari’s, into a snifter. Pours a swampy dense peach with a little foamy head that leaves some lacing. Wow is this fruity (pulpy mango, passion fruit, fleshy guava) and a little pine (but no resin). Lots of hops but they’re gentle. Just a delicious nose and taste that follows. Bright flavor notes, not overly sweet, a little lively on the finish, fairly wet but not too heavy."
Bottled on 4/26/18
Wow! I’m so happy TG brought this to Chicagoland. Taste reminds me of King Sue a bit and I bet I could have named this a Toppling beer in a blind taste. Great looking beer with a head that stays and nice haze. Pillowy soft mouthfeel like the best IPAs. I’m glad I bought two and will continue to buy it!
"Poured from 22-ounce bomber into a Riedel champagne flute. Fantastic burst of hoppy aroma upon opening the bottle. Opaque yellow in color, with a soapy long-lasting white head that left lots of spotty lacing. Dank, juicy, and citrusy, with a touch of pine resin and a solid malt backbone that provides balance and structure. Orange juicy on the palate, with some citrusy sweetness and a dry finish. The hoppy and juicy character obtains from beginning to end. Overall, yet another world-class hoppy offering from TG. As expected."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color. Smell had a garden herb and onion nose. Taste was better very herbal and tropical a bit of pine and citrus, with grassy notes had sweet malts in the finish. Sweet mouth feel with dank hops a dry finish. Liked this but at $11 one will be all i would ever buy."
Bottled 4/27/18; drank 5/4/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"On tap at the brewery. Hazy orange. Smells of citrus and garlic. Huge hop aroma. Tastes less intense. Sweet pale malt. Sweet orange citrus. Garlic bite. Light bitterness, but enough to cut the sweetness. Medium heavy. Very good. Seldom do I really enjoy an 8%+ DIPA, but this is excellent."
"Unbelievable brew from TG! Not too hazy, not too juice, perfect everything. Reflects characteristics that make Hillfarm, tree House, dinner, and the rest great. Tropical, balanced, quenching, and some Hop. Speechless!"
"Wow, just wow, top 3 IPA all time for me, the hops and flavor in this beer are too die for, citra hops are amazing, juicy with a mix of orange and pineapple. Great job TG!"
fresh growler drank on 5/19/2017
"This is the best beer I've had in 2016. It smells and tastes like a can of just-opened pineapple but in a very good way. The finish is mineral loaded and clean. It is yellow-orange, cloudy and retains a great lace as poured from a growler.It is jammy yet clean-hopped. Please bottle this and it will be a staple in my fridge. Amazing brew."
Poured from a growler - thanks Datdubj1988 for the opportunity
Growler poured into a snifter.
May '16 on draft at the TG Tap Room
10 oz pour from a growler to a snifter
This was a fantastic brew. Mike showcased his liquid art form yet again. 
Great cloudy pale orange color with white head. Great smell of hopps. Has a bitter bite and even a spicy sweet finish. Thick mouth feel and good carbonation. Great job TG brewers!!
Growler fill. Hazy sunset gold. White head with lace.
"Definitely the best beer I tried at Heist, It poured hazy like most of their IPA's with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer had a very nice hop aroma coming off of it. The taste has a solid bitterness coming off of it which was nice, The sweetness of the malt is still there but the hops kind of punch right through it. The feel is smooth. Overall This is the one to try if you're at Heist, they're all solid but this one is the one I feel hits the hardest."
On tap at heist brewery
I got this beer as an extra from a friend in NC. To say that I was surprised is an understatement. This beer is great. Looks like a beer from Veil or Trillium pouring a hazy orange/yellow color. Big tropical nose with a lot of grapefruit scent. The taste is phenomenal. Basically a juice bomb with slight bitterness on the finish that makes you want another sip immediately. The mouthfeel is a lot lighter than what you would expect for 8.4% ABV. I would have never known about this beer if it weren't thrown in as an extra and i am glad that it was.
"Imperial version of Blurred Is the Word. What a fantastic beer. Like many of their hazy offerings, it's a straight juice bomb. Totally worth seeking out if you're a hop head."
"L - hazy shades of papaya and pineapple juice. Has that thick, solid, meaty gradient that light struggles to penetrate. Decently sticky lacing. "
"Appearance: Pours with a New England look, a bubble show producing two fingers of foam on top of the cloudy amber liquid; nice stickage leaves a web of lace"
"Super murky orange in color. I’m not much on imperials but this one is about as fruity and orange flavored as it gets. Soft mouthfeel and taste is superb, I’m a huge fan of citraquenchl so this one was a winner for me. Heist killing it as always"
"32oz crowler sent to me by Dragginballs76 as part of a dastardly sneak attack on my porch. According to the writing on the side of the crowler, it was canned on May 10 (presumably of this year!) and is 8.1% alcohol."
Pours a hazy dark orange apricot color with two fingers of dense white head.
A: Pours a super murky pale bright golden yellow in color (think beeswax) with moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising quickly along the edges of the glass and faint lemon yellow colored highlights. The beer has a three finger tall dense sudsy foamy bright white head that slowly reduces to a couple of small patches of thin film surrounded by a large patch of very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.
"Pours hazy orange. Foamy, medium white head that fades slowly with lacing."
"Pours a murky orange with a finger of white head out of a 5 day out crowler can. Head retention is good with good lacing left behind. Aroma is plush with orange, clementine, mango, and papaya. It smells sweet and welcoming. Flavor profile is mango, orange, papaya, and melon, again with a sweet, sugary flavor profile. It's smooth and well anchored. Mouth feel is a touch fizzy, but is otherwise velvety with a touch of effervescent. Overall, a great IPA. Aroma and flavor profile are both spot on with NE IPAs. Lovely and splendid smoothness."
L - pours a delightfully hazy peach juice. Thick orange with a pinkish hue. Looks like somebody poured milk in my beer. Almost zero head save for a tiny ring of bone white lacing. 
"Opaque dark orange. Again, no head."
Awesome beer! Shared from a growler can from a trade. Looks like orange juice. Smells great lots of citrus. Taste is citrus juice with hop oils. Reminds me of trillium. Wish I lived nearby.
"L: Cloudy and hazy pumpkin, apricot and orange yellow hues with an ample white head"
"Another winner from Heist. Kicked up version of Citraquench'l, and it shows. Not quite as juicy as Citraquench'l, but still an amazing beer in its own right. Definitely will be picking this up again and worth trading for if your into the NE style imperial IPAs."
"Pours a hazy golden color. Has an excellent tropical aroma. Taste just like it smells with a great juicy burst. Good feel for the beer. Overall a great beer, would buy again without hesitation. I still prefer Citraquench'l a little bit more."
Appearance: Arrives with the familiar cloudy beeswax color familiar to this brewery; the head packs to an inch and leaves some webs of lace
Well done. World class Hazy IPA
I Never Sleep looks like melted butter. The completely opaque yellowish liquid is capped by a relatively thin and unstable foamy off white head that retreats to leave just a ring around the edge of the glass.
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Yellow Session. Taste is mostly hoppy but not as intense as other Monkish IPAs. Taste follows hoppy, bitter, herbal on the finish."
"Canned on 04/25/18, ‘DEADHEAD’."
Appearance: Arrives cloudy and honey colored with a pillowy white head; a few strands of lacing lacing around the glass.
"Poured from a tallboy into a snifter, the beer is a cloudy, opaque, orange-peach coloring, looking like a glass of juice, with a halo of clingy white head. Aromas of orange juice, peach puree, spicy pine needles, dried grass, and some earthy highlights. Flavors are very juicy forward, heavy on orange and grapefruit, but with some solid peach and pineapple notes in there, too. Pepper spiced and herbal hops characteristics level it out, with dried grass and pine needle notes, too. Very dynamic and very well balanced on a mid-body with a solid dry, acidic edge. The aftertaste is all juice, sweet and acidic, lingering on past the slick, juicy, and somehow slightly dry finish. Really tasty, juicy beer."
"Canned 7/2/16 (I think?). Consumed 7/20/16 in Brooklyn (notably, after the can made the 2500-mile journey in 90+ degree heat)."
"Look: pours a hazy golden yellow, more yellow and less hazy for the style, close to a hefeweizen. "
"This beer pours a super cloudy yellow orange color reminiscent of OJ. The head is small, loose and bright white. Retention is very good especially considering how small the head is to begin with and there are hanging rings of lacing everywhere. Smell is bright and tropical. Pineapple, mango and passionfruit dominate with a hint of dank green pine in the background. Taste is similar, but the pine is much stronger and there is a good amount of bitterness. Feel is light side of medium, soft and prickly from the bitterness. Overall a fantastic beer. The pine characteristic in the taste kind of masks the fruit flavors that were so prevalent in the smell. Truly a west coast take on an East Coast IPA. Also love the nod to Nas with the name."
How the hell am I the second review? Everyones probably busy chugging this or trading it other NE juice bombs from back East.
Dank hop bomb. Strong smell of citrus and tropical fruit. Look is very hazy and murky. Very easy to drink for a DIPA.
"It smells like passion fruit, tastes like passion fruit, the hops are dialed back a tad, but this tastes like spiked tropical juice. A really good balance of flavors."
What to say...other than WOW!! Thanks Singlecut for getting me all hopped up and have me to adjust my monthly beer budget. Hahahaha
"Simply, the best IPA I ever had. But, be prepared for an incredible hoppy beer."
"Shared a pint can, stamped 09/06/18 on the handsome label, with an IPA snob buddy. Poured gently into Spiegelau IPA glasses. Excellent head with superior retention and lacing. Color SRM 9, fairly turbid but not opaque. Smells just shy of perfect: gloriously hopped. Taste a fine hop bomb cloaking the 8.6% ABV magically. Such a tasty brew, I feel almost sacrilegious trying to analyze it. My beer snob buddy agrees Singlecut beersmiths know what to do with IPA. Magic spells indeed!"
"Turbid, slushy orange, little head. Aroma is a little whispy - a little vague citra / tropical note, slight earthiness but nothing really asserts itself. Taste is in the same vein - melon rind, soft pine bitterness, but none of the flavors really coalesce. Washed-out. Singlecut makes some great beers and this one has a great rep but I was left a little unthrilled"
"16oz can. Hazy, orange in color, very much a juice-like appearance. There's a lot going on aroma-wise. Melon notes hit the nose first. Some grass and pine are mixed in. Undercurrents of some of the more exotic tropical fruits: passion fruit, papaya. A very effusive and pleasant aroma overall."
16oz can dated 7/16/18 poured into a tulip
Canned (16Oz) 8/3. 
"Tried this at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Pours a cloudy yellow color. Not much of a head and it doesn't last. Not much lacing left. Smells very floral with grapefruit up front. Taste is very citrus forward with orange peel and grapefruit up front. Mostly clean mouthfeel slightly oily. Overall nice DIPA."
Opaque dark orange with an airy off-white blanket that settles to a thin pearl ring leaving spongy lace all around the rim.
Pours a very hazy orange color with a 1 finger dense foamy biscuit head. The aroma is strong with citrus and guava notes. I'm not a fan of that guava side of it but that's a minor knock.
My first beer after taking a 9 month lay off from the beer scene. Palate is reset to say the least.
Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip
"A: The beer is very hazy orange yellow in color—too hazy to see if there is any visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high off white head that died down, leaving a lacy patch of bubbles that covered most of the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass."
Pours with a great 1 inch head. Smell is very citrusy but flowery at the same time. Could smell it from 6 feet away. Taste is a hop bomb. Feel is very light for a 8+ ABV. You’d think it was a session!
A - Pours a hazy orange with a one finger fizzy white head. The head recedes quickly leaving some nice soapy lacing.
I liked the DDH version better.
"This brewer is new to me and came highly recommended by the person selling it to me (no wonder). Nice one, though."
Can from Kevin
A very satisfying IPA.
Look: hazy one finger head.
"Has a hazy, peach juice looking color with a small head. I can smell the thing from far away. Strong hops with piney, fruity aroma. It comes across strong, hoppy and fruity, but kind of fades quickly on the tongue but the hops stay on the back end. It's a easy drinking IPA and the 8.6 % ABV is hardly noticeable but its incredibly smooth at 131 IBU. Overall it's more exciting than I give it credit for. ""CHANGE THE RECORD"" 2/20/18. Special THANKS to PatrickCT and tasterschoice62"
"Apricot body, brilliant, pastel and cloudy. Two finger white head that leaves lots of sticky lace."
"I just wrote a lengthy review and hit ""rate it"" instead of submit and it was deleted. This might be the best IPA I have had. World class."
"Begrudgingly rating this so high because I've been turned off by the brewery's sky high pricing and a handful of inconsistent cans. But, this beer (on draught) was just amazing, an explosively aromatic hop bomb that follows through on flavor and doesn't leaving you hanging in a cloud of ephemera and unfulfillment. A perfect harmony of pineapple and chive; fruits and danker notes, and a moderately crisp and drinkable body that has you going back for me. Not a smoothie style NEIPA but hits a great spot between the best of west coast ipas and the low bitterness juicy takes of the moment. Looks nice too, with a pale gold body and wispy white lacing. I'll be back for more of this one for sure."
Canned 8 days ago. 
2018 SSMS canned 2/20/2018 Edition and from the keg:
Looks like orange juice big white fluffy head. Smell is peach and citrus. Starts with a tropical sweetness and with a Piney bitterness and prickly carbonation. Lacks complexity.
L - Hazy golden/orange with small bubbly white head that disipated quickly. Thin lacing.
"Pours cloudy light orange into a flight glass, leaving a fair amount of lacing as I drink. A rim of foam lingers."
"Aromatic of fruit, smooth for the octane, and a pleasant finish. Definitely a solid drinkable double that’s pretty juicy. I like it"
"Incredible NEIPA, deservedly near the top rated of Singlecut's offerings."
Had on tap in Manhattan. Probably needed to be a slightly different temperature.
Served at depot street tavern in Milford MA into a pint glass.
solid DIPA. has a unique sweetness on the finish. very drinkable for a 8+ ABV brew.
"Pours an opaque deep amber with minimal lacing, minuscule trails of bubbles can be seen through the murky liquid"
I've heard singlecut is supposed to be gud. Been let down time after time but this one beer is elite af they outdid themselves lmao
"Bottle dated ""5 17"" This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a soft burnt hazy brisk orange color with a fairly quick dissipating finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipated at an even pace. There wasn’t any lacing. The smell started off with some agressive sweet danky onion, sly sweet grass and a soft malt to blend nicely. The taste was mainly the same with an equaling bitterness from the hops. Aftertaste and finish seem to be the same sort of sweet to bitter hoppiness. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionable to dry sipping sort of feel on my tongue. Carbonation seems to be a tad higher than expected, not bad, not overbearing, but noticeable enough. Overall, aroma and flavor is key in this one, for the most part, that’s what taking this beer to the extreme. I’d definitely have again!"
"Poured from 16oz can into tulip. Pours a dark orange color, fairly opaque. Little to no head to speak of, and leaves a few bubbles in terms of lacing. I keep trying to pick up distinct notes on the nose, but it's fairly difficult. I'm getting a bit of overripe fruit, followed by a heavy malt smell. The taste is a little more bright; I'm getting fairly juicy hops up front, malty middle, then a bitter finish. Pretty standard IIPA in my mind. I wouldn't get again, especially with SingleCut's price points."
"Very hazy and the smell of citrus fruits smack you in the face as you pour the beer. The flavor is big with fruit, the slightest amount of bitterness, and no hint of alcohol in this 8.6% juice bomb. I've enjoyed almost every beer I've had from Singlecut."
"Tropical, fruit-forward, soft body. How this beer remains both drinkable and soft on the palate despite its 8.6% ABV is magic in and of itself. Opaque, golden-orange pour with a puffy one-notch head. Huge aroma of citrus, pith and pakalolo bursts out of a bottle. Not much pine on the nose or taste - this is all tropical fruit and leafy hops. Guava, papaya, pineapple and tangerine with an earthiness on the back end. Smooth and slightly warm from the alcohol but it comes together as a pillow-soft sip every time."
"From 16.9oz bottled April 5, 2017 into tulip. Picked this bad boy up at my local coop, and was drawn in by the professional labelling. "
Juicy cloudy and full.
"Single cut is rapidly becoming one of my favorite breweries and this is an excellent entry by them. If you can find any of their beer, get it, not matter what it is."
Not sure what the hype is about. I like Singlecut (especially wierd andgilly and the stack series)but this might literally be my least favorite beer from them. The taste is highly vegatable and i can't get past that.
Poured from a growler into a tulip glass
10 day old bottle poured vigorously into a Duvel tulip
"1pt 9oz bottle, 10 days old. poured into snifter. "
"Not exactly a huge head on this murky orange beer, but that allows the fragrance to jump right in. Very vibrant grapefruit with hints of wild onion and grass. Taste is even more massive, as it goes from slightly salty grapefruit to orange in short order, while leaving a little heat behind in the mouth. Upon further sips, I'm also getting a slightly earthy twist. The finish on this solidly medium bodied beer is dry, bitter and still has some heat. Very nice beer!"
Damn! On tap at Armsby Abbey. Had while waiting for Chris Truskey who was late due to recent parole violations. This beer is stellar. Fruity and hoppy...typical Singlecut- love this Brewery .
"2 weeks old. Some of the most peach, tangerine, & piney hop flavors I've had in a canned IPA that wasn't actually made with those fruit. Only downside is a hint of dank, oniony flavor, like what sometimes slips into Stone's IPAs, but it's so mild, it's easy to overlook. Man, hops today..."
"Had on tap. Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is earthy, barky hops, peach, lemon grass, and grain...Really unique taste. Bitter, with medium body and carbonation. Really good and unique and stands out amongst the wide variety of great IPAs I have had lately. Enjoyable like most of Single Cut's beers..One I will get again."
"In celebration of all things good and hoppy, only a group of brewers who call themselves beersmiths can craft something so aggressive and yet so refined to make their embibers say, ""that's too much... may I have another"". And that's exactly what Singlecut Beersmiths have done."
Can poured into a pilsener glass
"Crowler from Beer World, Kingston, NY. "
Served in a snifter glass straight from the bottle. 
Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. It's my Birthday! Jan 13th 2017.
"Home, home again. I like to be here when I can. Put away your ""Possible Past"", invite ""Vera"" and ""Run Like Hell"", because after your first sip you realize that the ""Show Must Go On"". ""Point Me at The Sky"" as this is one of the few IIPA's that can ""Shine on Like Crazy Diamonds"" as you taste a beer that makes you ask, ""Is Anybody Out There, just nod if you can hear me"", because no one should be alone in experiencing ""The Great Big Gig in the Sky"". Like 'Candy and a Currant Bun"", I'm just ""Biding my Time"" with a taste of ""Apples and Oranges"" while dreaming of ""Any Color You Want"", like hazy orange while you drink with ""High Hopes"". I'm a bit ""Lost for Words"" while ""I'm on the Run"" and I ""Remember a Day"" trying to figure out the magic of a ""Saucerful of Secrets"". Even when you finish this perfect moment you might ""Stop"" or ""Stay"", but you will ""Scream Your Last Scream"", saying the ""Show Must Go On"" while ""Time"" is slipping away like an ""Unknown Song"". It's ""Us and Them"" ""When Your In"" and if you not, we ""Wish You Were Here"". Drink this amazing moment and realize your ""Possible Past"" would be less without ""Softly Spoken Magic Spells""."
Slight hazy orange pour with a fluffy head
"L: Hazy orange with a thin white head. Retention is short, but spotty lacing is left behind."
Poured from 16.9 oz bottle into tulip glass.
"Loved it, a bunch of tropical fruits here. It's supposed to be supper bitter based on that IBU but I couldn't tell by the taste of it. Could drink a bunch of 'em despite the 8.6"
"Poured on draft in a Belgian Tulip at the Mint Gastropub in Bethlehem, PA."
"Dark orange - almost rust colored, unfiltered, has a ""thick"" look to it. Nose - I am getting a heavy dose of overripe apricot and honey, maybe a little melon. Unusual scent - not super alluring, but certainly not unpleasant. Makes you need to find out what taste is driving that unusual smell. Taste has some apricot, a bit of cantaloupe, citrus with a nice malty balance (think Alpha King). Strong, pleasant hop bitter bite at the end. "
"First had 7/31/16 at Sunset Beach condos in OCMD. Brought this bad boy along to the beach, and I'm glad I did. Melon, citrus, juiciness, with a nice bitter finish. Notes of bread round out an overall great beer."
"Bttld 5-17-16. Drank 5-31-16. Pineapple, citrus, tropical delicious. Fantastic beer."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a small white head. Smells of juicy citrus fruits such as orange peel, tangerine, apricot, with some grapefruit and definitely some bitter hops. Taste follows the smell being very juicy and not as hoppy as expected. Taste more juicy than hoppy but, you can still taste the bitterness on the finish. Goes down very easy and smooth. Delicious beer and I would definitely buy again!"
Bottle shared by jc1762. Thanks man.
"On-tap 12/31/2016 at Natty Greene’s Tavern in North Attleboro, MA, served in a tulip glass."
"Was lucky to have the opportunity to partake in two fresh bottles of this (bottled 12/13, consumed 12/22 and 12/27). Pours a hazy burnt orange with slightly off white head. Aroma is full of citrus with notes of orange and grapefruit, and a resinous piney note (though not dank). Taste follows the nose with bright citrus and resinous pine intermingling nicely. This is certainly a showcase of PNW hops. Wonderfully balanced and supported by a sturdy malt backbone, though the malt accentuates the hops rather than interfere. On the first tasting this came off a bit fruitier or juicier, however it was during a tasting of Fieldwork IPAs. On the second bottle on a fresher palate I got a lot more balance and it tasted remarkably close to Pliny. Either way a delicious world class IPA."
"Pours a super hazy pale orange in color with a finger of white head that quickly dissipates leaving behind almost no lacing. Aroma is super dank with some oniony notes. Taste starts super dank as well then adds some tropical notes, finish is balanced. Good mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation. Overall a good beer but the dank oniony notes just aren't my thing."
"Just awesome....I put this up there with heady, sip, after image, etc...."
"Exceptional smell to this beer. Pineapple and some citrus notes dominate. I'm really excited for this beer given to me by my brother in law Todd ! Really nice flavor on this beer. Scent translates to the tongue. Pineapple and sweet citrus fights with malt, alcohol and hop bitterness for dominance then finishes slightly bitter. Quite complex. Sticky resinous mouthfeel. Good dare I say great beer."
Hazy dark orange with a faint white head that fades quickly and doesn't leave much lacing. Smell is sweet and tropical. Taste is tons of overly ripe pineapple and a little bit of a biscuit finish.
Shared with a good friend in a stemmed teku.
This is another winner from Single Cut. Maybe my favorite of all their beers. Great tropical fruit notes with a nice dry finish.
"I don't think this is a Heady killer (it is actually a very different beer), but it is pretty darn good. Super juicy and drinkable despite the ABV. I'm not sure about the claim of 130 IBUs - this is not a bitter beer."
Simply Delicious. Great nose and hop flavor
"Pint can shared with Lisa. I'm not sure what others see in this one. I get a lot of old school caramel malt, though without any bitterness. Nose is floral and caramel. Taste is more of the same with intense perfume (yuk) and light citrus. Not recommended."
Straight 4.5 shows that the craftsmanship of this beer is solid. This is the purest answer NY has had for its neighbor state's Heady Topper. Cliche worthy of the straight juice moniker.
"Golden orange in color with murky, unfiltered appearance. Poured with a thick, frothy, bright white foam with excellent retention. Medium high sharp, slightly dank, citrus hop aromas. Fresh, bright aromas of ripe pineapple, fresh peeled orange rind, and papaya. Medium malt aroma beneath. Medium bodies with medium light carbonation and a fabulous creamy smooth feel. Pleasant warmth grows through the middle and provides a boozy bite near the finish. Intense hop flavors from start to finish. Dank hop flavors up front that slowly transition to bursting, juicy, fresh citrus hop flavors: ripe pineapple, tangerine, melon, and papaya. Medium hop bitterness through the middle followed by spicy hoppiness and malt flavors to the end. Finished dryly with citrus melon flavors, a touch of boozy heat and a lingering hop bitterness. An incredible array of complex flavors, aromas and feel. A pleasure to drink."
"Poured bottle into tulip. Has a light haze orange color with a one finger white head and leaves some lacing. Insane tropical aromas and some citrus. Taste is even better but has some soft dank and citrus rind. Creamy mouthfeel but leaves some stickiness. A world class IIPA, a must try!"
"Wow, this might be the best IIPA that's ever hit the shelves of Washington, DC. Incredible citrusy aroma with a unique flavor profile that perfectly blends tropical fruit and bitterness with a little bit of spice. A unique, complex beer, and the best thing I've had from Singlecut to-date."
A - Very cloudy and hazy with a moderately thick layer of sticky creamy white foam.
Regrettably brief impressions:
"Been a Singlecut devotee for a long time, but this one is absolutely where they harnessed all their powers into an absolute NE IIPA killer."
16.9 oz bottle dated 11/17. Less than a week old.
"What an outstanding DIPA, heavy on the PNW hop dankness and a mellow doughy, biscuits malt background that helps fill out 130 ibus. If you have a chance, drink or buy many of these."
Poured from chilled bottle 4 days from bottling date. 
"Purchased at Healthy Living - price unknown, but it doesn't matter because this beer is SO good! Poured into a shaker glass, comes out a fairly hazy, dirty-orange color, with about a finger of off-white head that leaves some lace. The smell is awesome...I'm guessing Citra in there - tropical fruit and just a touch of pine. Very aromatic. The taste is also tropical with a hint of pine, and just a slight, soft bitterness on the finish. Produces some crazy hoppy burps. Mouth feel is great. Overall, super surprised by this beer. I'll be looking for more ASAP."
Looks is very hazy orange
Golden orange color. White head.
Undrinkable if its not fresh...
"16.9oz Bottle from Brooklyn Harvest in Brooklyn, NY. Bottled on 9/28/2016, drank in early October. "
Updates:
A: Poured from the half-growler into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is hazy golden-orange with only the smallest of a white head on top.
"Bottle dated 9/28/2016. Poured into IPA glass. It pours a murky honey color with orange hues, and two fingers of foamy, egg-white head and lacing with great retention. It's a lovely pour. It has a rich aroma of lemon, grapefruit, sweet tropical fruit, onion, grass, and floral hops. It's dank and has a great balance of citrus, onion, and hops. It also has a significant malt presence and you can taste the sweet tropical fruit at the finish. Everything blends and balances extremely well. This ale is medium-bodied and moderately carbonated, with a fairly creamy mouth feel that is pleasing. The 8.6% ABV is just right for a DIPA and gives it substance without being overwhelming. Overall, this is a terrific DIPA that deserves its ""World Class"" rating."
Poured from growler into RR chalice
Excellent IIPA from Singlecut. Looks like your typical NE IPA with a hazy golden orange color. Smells very pungeant grapefruit from the loads of hops. Really liking the strong aroma. Taste is tropical with a nice malt presence to take the sting away from the 130 IBUs. Excellent hop bitterness that lingers a little bit with the sweetness of the malt. Very well done!. Mouthfeel is smooth and very easy drinking for 8.6% abv DIPA. I'm very impressed. Definitely the best beer I've ever had from Singlecut.
"Exceptionally beautiful beer, had on draft at the Reservoir in Waterbury, VT. Poured into a 12oz small tulip glass with an amazing orange haze coloring and slight head."
16.9 oz bottle poured into a stemmed tulip.
"From the 650 ml. bottle that appears to be dated 9/28/2016. I see a 9/28 on the label. Sampled on October 8, 2016."
"If you look up ""juice bomb"" in the dictionary, there's a picture of this beer (Singlecut Softly Spoken Magic Spells). The pour reveals an orange-hued, murky beauty of a beer, propping up a finger of light tan head. As you pour this, a full frontal assault of citrus aromas attack your olfactory senses: oranges, HUUUUUUUGE grapefruit, some prickly passion fruit, maybe some pineapple."
Half a 500 ml bottle served into a pint glass. Thanks to Dan for the share.
"My first trip to Singlecut Brewery! I had it on tap. Pours an amber orange color with a foam head that retains. In both the aroma and taste, it is filled with citrusy and tropical fruit goodness. The hops pack a serious punch; moderate bitterness and sharp pine. Medium bodied and dangerously drinkable."
"Pours a deep rusty apricot color with a small white head and the lacing is spotty without much stick. Candied grapefruit resin hop bombs in the aroma. Notes of dank, grapefruit peel, grapefruit flesh, candied grapefruit piths, dinner roll, and light pine needle. Medium body, nice bite of carbonation smooths by the end, finish leaves a clean linger with no hint of alcohol. Simply a stunning and juicy DIPA. If you love grapefruit this is for you."
"Hazy orange color with off-white head. Aroma is really dank with chives, onions, dill and other vegetal notes. Taste starts juicy with melon, passionfruit and a bit of mango. Finishes with the same dank/vegetal notes from the aroma and medium bitterness. Medium to full bodied with medium to low carbonation. Quite interesting hop profile but not as good as expected."
"375 ml bottle. Pours hazy to lightly clouded orange, thin white head fades leaving little lacing. Sweet pale malt aroma with citrusy fruity notes. Taste starts out with lots of light malt sweetness and tropical fruit, met by dank earthy herbal piney hops that take over through a bone dry finish. Great lasting bitterness at just the right amount. Medium soft feel. Excellent DIPA that I'll seek out again."
"Amazingly dank, fully competes with heady"
"Had last night with no opportunity to take notes, but this one was memorable enough to be worth rating, despite that. Pours dark orange, with fairly small head. Smell and taste are citrus, pine, and tropical fruit. For me, the latter predominated, especially in the taste. The juiciness is fantastic. Interesting malt notes, too, and the high alcohol barely reveals its presence. Medium feel, nothing special. But the beer as a whole is special--now one of my favorite DIPAs."
"Bought a bottle at the Beer Shop in East Longmeadow. This beer poured with a very murky dark orange appearance with a thin ring around the glass and some lacing on the sides. Aromas pack an incredible punch with sharply strong hops and grassy citrus. Taste follows that nose with a strong, dry, earthy pine hop flavor with some great fruit combinations like mango, orange, grapefruit flavors. Mouthfeel is great and compliments the flavoring well by making a dry, good carbonated beer with some light creamy textures. Overall, this is a fantastic beer all around."
"Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a can glass, date of 8/21:"

Pours a hazy light copper with a half finger of head.
"another gem from these guys, courtesy of ""my guy"" back east. what a treat this one is, a little darker than some of their other ipas, but still real cloudy and heady, pretty in the glass, lacy, sexy, sturdy. it smells unique too, still all the juicy tropical hops, fresh mango and pine together, but there is something more interesting in the grain bill than normal too, hard to place though. it sort of smells a little like smoked malt, but it isnt that i dont think, then i wonder about an interesting malt, perhaps a red wheat or something, which could be, but is also has that richness you sometimes get in like an esb, english, but only for a second, really tough to figure, and generally i do not prefer much grain interference in my ipa, especially the bigger ones, but here it seems to be the perfect platform for the hops, bready with the fruit, very nice. hops are all tropical, but still some bitter too, orange and pineapple, mango again, even something strange like melon or kiwi fruit, id love to know which varietals get the play here. lots of body, likely wheat for sure, and some soft doughy yeast thats not all the way cleaned out of here. enormous flavor complex to this, lots of alcohol, particularly as it gets warmer, and overall just a real delight. they have a few others i like just as much, but this is really sensational, and one of their more original big india pales. it wont be long before these guys are in crazy demand. the world needs more beer this good. love the name too. keep em coming singlecut!"
"Pours a solid orange with a one finger head. Lots of sediment in the glass. Aroma is wonderful. Tropical, citrus, mango, orange and some earthy hops. Flavor is filled with citrus and biting hops. This is a big beer... juicy, bitter and crisp. The high ABV is disguised pretty neatly, but there's still a light burn in the mouthfeel from the booze. There certainly isn't anything 'light' about this one. ""Tropical hop bomb"""
"Look around and see a reddish golden hue. When you breathe, breathe in the beer, there's tropical fruit. Lots of papaya in the nose, some faint pine and onion to cut it. This beer is very boozy. When I come home cold and tired, this is a good beer to warm my bones beside the fire. There's nothing soft about softly spoken magic spells."
Poured from bomber to a tulip glass. Freshly cut grass kissed with dew droos on a spring day. Extremely balanced taste that grows in depth as it warms in the glass and after the 4th sip. The ABV is deceptive
Poured into a Duvel tulip. Label says 0713.
22oz bottle poured into a medium sized tasting glass. Cloudy golden color with a fair amount of yeast sediment. Wonderful orange juice and grapefruit flavors in the scent. Orange juice and some light piney hops in the taste following a nice light malty flavors on the tongue. Smooth flavor with a light amount of bitterness in the aftertaste. Very drinkable with the 8%abv well hidden. Would drink again.
7/13 bottling date
Awesome Pink Floyd reference. Bottled 7/13
Despite being on the top 250 I think this one gets overlooked. It’s a wonderfully aromatic DIPA that drinks super easy and has an appearance that borders on Tree House/Trillium levels. Great stuff - I hope to be able to try more from SingleCut in the future!
Smell: lots of grapefruit zest grapefruit peel earthy dankness. Peach orange tangerine peel.
"A: Hazy, dark orange/apricot in color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates. The beer looks like juice. Wonderful!"
pours nice hazy orange with thin head that dissipates quickly. nose is strong boquet of tropical fruits and orange peel. up front palate bitterness and orange rhind start this puppy out followed by bitter grapefruit and little pine withmalty sweetness floating around to balance it out a little. finish is dry and bitter. nice feel overall and complimentary of the style. overall very nice beer that seems to get much more pronounced flavors as it warms with an even stickier mouthfeel. I feel like tnt and billy full stack both were more enjoyable for me but that's not a knock on this beer. very good and well done with tons of flavor.
500ml capped bottle into a Surly teku. Shared by schen9303. 
Bottled on 7/13/2016: Pours completely hazy orange color with a lot of bubbles that cling to the sides of the glass which leads up to a 1 finger beige colored foamy head that faded on the average side and left minimal spotty lacing.
Not really understanding the hype on this one..... Initial sharp hop bitterness with more of a malt base over citrus. Kind of has that onion flavor going as well. Really fairly similar to the Enjoy By series which is nothing to scoff at. Solid DIPA but fails to meet such high ratings in my opinion. To each his own.
Had this one a few weeks back. Probably the best singlecut I've had. All their IPA's hit my pallet very well. This had some fruity notes to it. Delicious taste and smell.
"Poured into a Snifter from a Bomber with a bottled on date of 7-13 (5 days old). Produced a hazy orange/mango brew that is blanketed by an eggshell white, 1 inch, dense, creamy head. Nose is filled with Pineapple, Mango, and Peach, and is backed by a slight grassy bitterness. Taste follows the nose and it's absolutely delicious! Finishes dry, leaving such an awesome taste of citrusy goodness to linger. Super drinkable, I mean seriously, I could crush a few of these in a sitting with no problem. The 8.6% is hidden superbly. This is my new favorite from Singlecut, and one of the better DIPA'S I have had in quite a while. Cheers!!"
bottled 7.13 - thats two days ago!! appearance is hazy golden orange. 
Appearance - hazy golden/orange color with slight white head
"L: Hazy straw, foam disappears quickly"
O. M. G. That is all I can say about this brew right now. Other than that it is (string of expletives as adverbs) amazing
"Pours a dark straw color with thin white head that doesn't linger, hop aroma is hint of grapefruit and candied sugar. Taste is overly malty with very very little hop flavor coming through mostly sweet caramel backbone and some hop bitterness, alcohol was apparent as well which I consider a flaw. Needs bottle dating. Overall, not that impressed."
The hop flavor is somewhat muted on this one. It was overly sweet on the malt front. I was expecting a bit more out of this one given the high ratings.
"The best brew to date from Singlecut. Excellent example of a east coast style DIPA. Super drinkable, very smooth and fruity. These guys make some great brews and this is the best. Love it"
"The appearance is the weakest part of this beer. It starts with a large-bubbled, quickly descending head. It settles to nearly no bubbles at all....certainly no lace. The liquid is cloudy with a dark gold color."
"Bottle. This brewery has been fairly hit or miss with me. Often I find their beers far too sugary sweet. Sometimes, I enjoy them, though. This one is orange and cloudy. I was expecting it to be paler but I don't care either. The nose is more interesting than most of their beers. I get the standard candied hop syrup aroma that I equate to Singlecut. Yet, there is also an interesting earthy hoppiness as well. The flavor is like hop flavored marzipan. Sugary, hop-fruity, piney, mildly eathy, and very bitter. Simply too sweet. This is very highly regarded but I don't think their IPAs suit me."
These guys make amazing IPAs and this one takes the crown from in my opinion their Bon Bon. Poured into a tulip glass this dark Amber hazy brew reeks of tropical sweetness... Pineapple and candied green apple hit the noseZ. Palate feel is soft and creamy taste is pineapple holiness with a slight crisp bitterness at the finish. A damn near Perfect beer I will look to hoard and stock up on
"Wow. What a surprise. I live an hour and a half from Treehouse and with two kids, I can't often justify the trip. This was the first beer that I've had that I liked as much as the typical Tree House brews. I've been following Single Cut for 7 months now. I was unhappy with their Bon Bon (although plenty seem to love it), so-so on their Does Anybody Remember Laughter, better with their Half/Full Stacks. And I did rather like their Mo Shuggie. And then this. Finally, something in stores that nails the New England hazy juice-bomb style. If you like TH Julius, Haze, AlterEgo etc. then you will like this too. It's got all of that dank juicy goodness but is more polished and refined than something like a Pioneer Trailblazer - another attempted TH copy, in my opinion. Sadly, everyone else seems to agree and now I can't find it anywhere. But for a few sweet short days I had my hands on 4 of these. My only regret is that I drank two of them while fixing the power steering pump on my car, when I should have been lying in my hammock on my deck."
"Pours a cloudy dark orange color, thin vanilla head that dissipated quickly, not much lacing in the glass. Lots of tropical aroma. Taste is very hop forward yet well balanced. Has a prominent fruitiness, apricot and mango perhaps. Feels syrupy on the tongue. Finishes with a unique orange zest bitterness. In the current craft market jammed with IPAs this is one of the best. Love this one, would definitely recommend it to any of my IPA aficionado buddies (they can buy their own)."
"West Coast flavors in East Coast water. I've enjoyed this one from the get-go. Lucked out to find this on tap at Mikro, later sought out a bottle at La Bella Vita (New Haven, CT). "
"This is definitely a very different beer than I was expecting. Upon pouring into my Bormioli IPA glass, I was thinking NE IPA, but this is definitely not like any I've had. The head disappeared quickly and what carbonation there was seemed to leave with it. While the nose is dank and fruity,the to me is onion and garlic potato chips. Needless to say,this isn't really for me though it is kind of novel."
I thought this beer smelled amazing. It was orange/amber with moderate haze. A white foamy head persisted and set clingy lacing onto the glass.
"500mL bottle. Pours a murky burnt orange color with virtually no head. No lacing. The aroma is fantastic. Tons of tropical fruits. Grapefruit, mango, papaya, guava, tangerine, lime and pineapple. The taste is ripe, fleshy tropical fruits. Guava, mango, papaya, and tangerine. Herbal, dank finish. Very fruit juicy. Light mouthfeel with virtually no carbonation. Mild alcohol presence. Tastes almost like an Imperialized Jai Alai. My only gripe is the lack of carbonation and mouthfeel, but it's still an outstanding beer worth seeking out."
Pour was a bit unimpressive - nice frothy white head forms but recedes quickly. No lacing. Hazy light orange in color.
"Mid sized bottle, bottled 5-17"
2016 release
On tap at As Is in NYC.
Appearance- hazy dark orange with minimal head on edge of glass
Just watch out for bottle variation here. Rated based on the good one.
"A: Clouded, hazy NE style fireweed orange. Definitely unfiltered by looks of it with some specks in stasis. Minimal head spizzes out quick. Gorgeous color, but little else. "
Poured from a bottle into my favorite willi-belcher glass. 
Poured from a Singlecut bottle into a speiglau IPA glass. 
A very very delicious DIPA. Reminds me of hops and honey. Combine that with the nice malt backbone and it is like drinking a hoppy honey butter biscuit. Glad I got to try this! I would love to try some more of Singlecut's beers!
Poured from 500 ml bottle dated 5/17/16 into snifter. 
This is a phenom. Pungent aroma. Soft mouthfeel. Great drinkability. Citrusy and dank at the same time. Might be best.
"On tap at Mule Bar in Winooski, VT"
Huge aromatic DIPA the second you pop the cap! Big time Juicy Dank tastiness!!
"L - copper, cloudy but not milky, small head fades fast"
"Hazy, medium gold color; New England-style goodness, plush with fruits, tropical, citric, and pale; soft and fuzzy feelings compliment the fruits and haziness."
Bottle poured into snifter. 
"Cloudy orange, very cloudy, with a bright white head on tap that quickly dissipates. Lots of juicy aromas - nectarine, peach, slight pear, orange, tangerine, the absolute works. Very nice bitterness on first taste, quick resin, then lots of fruit. Juicy really the best way to sum this up, strong in the NE IPA tradition."
thanks to my brother for the share! enjoyed in a glass from the bomber chilled.
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass bottled on 5/17/16, 2 weeks old. Pours a cloudy orange with a 2 finger sticky white head, that leaves loads of lace behind."
Tons of bitter grapefruit pith and zest. Resinous and piney. Super dry. Decent level of sweetness but this is a big bold bitter bomb. Another delicious dipa from SingleCut.
"Had on Saturday into a Tree House tumbler, SSMS pours out a nice golden color with some dark orange hues due to the extreme haziness. Some floaties swirl in the beer. A decent head pops up but doesn't leave too much lacing."
"fitting into the stereo-typical new england ""hazy"" style iipa and absolutely NAILS IT! a beer worth comparing others to for quality of the style. as a friend pointed out to me before hand this beer oxidizes quick. not a fan of that at first but the tropical fruit flavor opened up tremendously as a result of. worthwhile find. a must have!"
By far the best Singlecut I've ever had! Wish I could buy more.
"This one poured out as a murky looking golden color with very little head on top. The smell has a good amount of hops on the nose. The taste is killer, loads of hoppy bitterness and some sweetness in there too. The feel is smooth. Overall it's a damn find beer."
"have been hearing good things about this one so snagged the first bottle I saw locally...opened a few hrs later. very nice iipa, definitely on the chewy side. my wife dug this.more than the freshie can of captains daughter we had right before. another winner from the locals. heavy handed pepper and bitter finish."
"Bottle dated 5-17. Hazy pour, almost non-existent head. Aroma is stromg and yummy; juicy fruits and a touch of the dank. Flavor follows the nose; fruity, dank and pleasantly bitter. Super juicy. Mouthfeel is decent, and it finishes sweetly bitter."
L - Murky orange body with a light fluffy head. The head becomes soapy as it dissipates and leaves good legs on the sides of the glass.
pours a hazy unfiltered orange with small half finger head that quickly dissipates. the flavor is a litter bitter at first with a citrusy and sweet finish. the smell is of citrus fruit and pine. finishes clean and lingers shortly after each swig. overall another excellent offering from SingleCut.
"This one is somewhat of a miss for me to be honest. The body is a hazy copper. You get a bubbly off-white head that vanishes quickly to a glass-like surface. Smell is a tropical fruit explosion with a lot of mango and papaya. There are hints of white pepper and pine resin. Here's the rub, while the aroma is complex and varied, it's also way too saccharin and, unfortunately, the same is true with the taste. I find it to be very sweet up front. The good news is the mouth is good, despite the sweetness, thanks to a great finish that is surprisingly dry and sticky. Overall this is an interesting beer, but it's not one of my favorites from Singlecut."
From bottle. Hazy orange. Zero head. No lacing. Fantastic smell. Reminds me of the orange slices (candy). Backed by a dank hop. Some assertive bitter. Very fresh pine with a kiss of citrus. Feel is nice. Leaves a bit of resin just not that next level rich.
"Bottle is stamped with 5.17, which presumably means it was bottled 5/17/16. This beauty was an unfriendly price of $9 for a 16.9 oz bottle."
"Cloudy, murky orange-brown color, like a mix of fresh-squeezed fruit juice and cider, with a finger of white head that's quick to dissipate. Strong grapefruit and apricot aroma. Watery mouthfeel up front with a strong prickliness to it mid-palate into the aftertaste. There's moderately strong bitterness and nice malty sweetness, almost like a nectarine, but relatively little of the strong fruit impressions in both the appearance and aroma carry over to the flavor. There's a tinge of alcohol on the backend. This is good, but I like other Singlecut offerings better."
UPDATED review of third batch.
"Drank from a 1 pt . 9 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Pemberton Farms, Cambridge, MA"
"Bottle dated 5/17, vey aromatic when poured, smelled of citrus and pine. Cloudy golden yellow appearance, really smooth and balanced taste, almost creamy with a hint of bite at the finish. I had trouble drinking it slow because it was really good and very drinkable. Easily the best beer I've had in a while, I'd almost swear it can from Vermont. I bought it on a suggestion from Craft Beer Cellars in Framingham, I bought 2 and gave one away. I will be heading back for a lot more."
"This beer is awesomely good. So creamy and delicious. The flavor profile is bold, hoppy, citrusy and piney. The mouth feel is really impressive. The only knock I have to this beer is the look- could have used a bigger, longer lasting head and lacing. Otherwise really really impressed."
16.9 oz. bottled on 5/17
"One of the best IIPA's in a New York area that is blowing up in the craft beer scene. Very hazy deep orange color with a thin white head that dissipates really quick. dry-hopped aroma is really prominent, with a rich toasted malt character. Something incredibly grainy that melds with the grapefruit and orange. I can't describe what about this beer makes me go crazy, but it has that crack quality that just makes you want more. It could be the mouthfeel which is very rich for the style and incredibly smooth."
Poured from a bottle dated 5/17
L: Darker orange and golden hues with an ample white fluffy head
Bottled 5/17/16 poured into a 20 oz. stemmed tulip - F.R.E.S.H. I have sought out SSMS's since I saw it on the Beersmith's website earlier this spring. I love what Singlecut has been up to and am very happy to be able to regularly snag their best bottles and draft. Lets get into this one specifically though-
"Hazy; unfiltered; juicy; smooth. Aromas of citrus, tangerine, peach. Taste follows and no sharp bitter taste. This is a Grimm-killer for anyone who misses out on that brand's ephemeral and unpredictable releases. Drank it fresh the day Premier Gourmet in Buffalo got it in; went in the back cooler area and took a couple off the pallet. As fresh a taste as could be had. And the kicker - better than 2x Bon Bon TNT."
"This beer was phenomenal. On tap at one mile in NYC, poured a deep hazy orange peach color. Smelled of big citrus notes and the pallet followed. Full thick body and a killer beer overall"
"Pours an orangish opaque color. Nice pine and grapefruit smell. Tastes like it smells with a wonderful balance between the malt and the hops. Nice, smooth mouthfeel."
"Bought this on the night it was released - ten bottles it it from the Brewery because I love SingleCut so much! In addition, I was hoping that this would be on the level of the Bon Bon that got me hooked on these guys and for the most part, this fit that bill. The flavor was just a bit hair one-dimensional but given how tasty and smooth this was, that wasn't much of a deterrent here and this went down quite smooth for the amount of alcohol that was present. "
"Crowler filled at brewery May 13th, opened May 15th."
This was a lot better than I expected. Person I got it from said it tasted like TH Green and I agree. Lots of pine and grapefruit with a smooth finish. Not very bitter. Dangerously drinkable.
"Had on tap into a snifter. It's like Bon Bon and Moshuggie had a kid. Really tasty, got that Jenkem look I'm looking for in a IPA. So good I had to convince the bar to sell me a growler at cost."
"This beer pours a cloudy bright golden orange with a 2 finger fluffy off white head. After a few minutes it fades to a sliver of a ring around the edge with a microfilm layer across the top. Very little spotted lacing. Smell is magnificent. Mango up the wazoo with tangerine and slight grapefruit. Taste is the same with a little bitterness on the back end. Feel is light side of medium, soft and juicy. Overall this beer is absolutely fantastic. Just outstanding."
"Served on draft, into a 16 ounce teku at 39F."
The beer comes in a hazy deep gold to pale amber.
"32oz growler fill from Noble Grains, NYC"
"found at a liquor store right over the CT line, on tap, 32oz growler filled. singlecut killed it, absolutely killed it. pours that beautiful murky gold that everyone strives for. smell is huge tropics: big mango, big guava, some peach, citrus, almost no malt. taste is all of that, HUGE mango and tropical fruit, so juicy like trillium and tree house. Everything the nose suggests, plus a nice piney and grassy bite on the end. Feel is spot on, it finishes so clean, something that some of these hazy IPAs struggle with, but singlecut achieved with such elegance. phenomenal beer, sad I only have half a growler of it left."
"Super hazy light orange color, small white head that quickly dissipates."
Digging the Pink Floyd reference!
"L - Turbid light orange, thick white head"
"Outstanding IIPA. This was very reminiscent of Tree House IPA'S. Very creamy with a cloudy orange pour. You can not see through the pour in your glass which tells me this is a hop bomb. Papaya, grapefruit juicey front with a little hint of wheat on the back. This is New England/ Northeast style at its best."
On tap at Birch Hill Tavern

Poured into a tulip glass via can
Poured on tap at the brewery.
"Maybe it's just the good vibes from a very pleasant Easter Sunday but I'd go as far to say that this is Singlecuts best IIPA. Incredibly complex and intense nose of mango, sweet tangerine and some dankness. Taste was identical with a touch of spicy hops and incredibly smooth with as good a softness as you'd find anywhere in VT. No way you'd have any idea this was 8.6%. Finished very clean and went down so easily I polished off the growler in record time. Magic for sure!"
"Wow, this is an awesome beer. Has that New England stye look, looks like juice. This beer has a great smell, it surrounds the nose, one of the best smelling beers I have had. Low carbonation, but good mouth feel. It also has an awesome taste, so tangy. This may be the best beer that Singlecut has produced to date. So good."
Thank you JBowenGeorgia for this
"L - massive, fluffy, bright white head atop a near-transparent yellow body."
"Very tasty Double!!! Enjoyed at brewery on tap. Wanted to bring some home, but apparently sell out in 2 days when canned:"
"On tap, pours a mostly hazy yellow-gold. Smell has tons of tangerine, stone fruit, tropical fruit and some pine. Taste follows, very come and delicious. Feel is a little light for a double IPA, making it very drinkable. Top-notch beer."
Thanks to JBowenGeorgia for the chance to try this one.
"This is one mighty fine DIPA, restrained heat, lush fruit. Superb body with fine lacing. Moderate body and quick clear, allowing for easy drinking. Superb."
Had from can 1/3/18
"Pale, lemon yellow brew. Fluffy snow white head; good production, fair retention. Brew is hazily translucent."
From a 16oz can stamped 9/6/17
One of my favorite IPA's hands down (out of what I have had). Delicious hop forward brew with solid depth and balance all around. Crushable 8% juicer here A+
"pours a murky gold with a medium head that hangs around for a bit. lots of sediment. nose; grapefruit zest, tangerine, cantaloupe/honeydew, & citrus hops. taste; white toast malt, grapefruit, mango, orange, citrus pith, light pine, light seed bitters, very slight onion (mosaic hops) & citrus hops (citra/simcoe). medium carbonation & mouthfeel, slightly oily. absolutely nails the citrus fruit bouquet & hop balance. this has got to be an alternate recipe to their other double ipa, cosmik debris; both are fantastic! quintessential ""fruity"" ipa. pours a murky gold with a medium head that hangs around for a bit. lots of sediment. nose; grapefruit zest, tangerine, cantaloupe/honeydew, & citrus hops. taste; white toast malt, grapefruit, mango, orange, citrus pith, light pine, light seed bitters, very slight onion (mosaic hops) & citrus hops (citra/simcoe). medium carbonation & mouthfeel, slightly oily. absolutely nails the citrus fruit bouquet & hop balance. this has got to be an alternate recipe to their other double ipa, cosmik debris; both are fantastic! quintessential ""fruity"" ipa."
"Big dank overripe citrus/Kern’s apricot nectar nose. Hop-forward, hop showcase finds a perfect balance of citrus (orange, tangerine, ripe grapefruit) and tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, papaya). Exceptional hop expression from the trio of hops! Svelte malt backbone. Just a hint of booze as it starts to warm, not necessarily a bad thing and is really just the last couple sips."
A Northeast IPA fruit bomb.
"Draft poured at brewery. Hazy Amber color with nice head. Grapefruit and hops are apparent to nose and the taste does not disappoint! Medium body, well balanced. This is easy drinking for a DIPA."
"Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass (batch #2, 3 days old). I rated batch #1 a 4.6 but had to up the rating after trying the newest release. The mango and orange juice flavors as well as the mouthfeel are almost perfect. Overall balance is noticeably better than the first batch, which was still excellent. There is a little more bitterness on the finish that balances out the juiciness. This is the best IPA that Creature makes and one of the best from any brewery that I have tasted."
"This is party of flavors well balanced throughout. From pineapple to orange juice to an overall citrus bomb. This beer looks, smells and tastes amazing."
"Best hoppy beer I think from Creature in 2017. It was hazy, bursting with aroma, soft, great juicy mouthfeel, and the flavirs were just amazing. Tons if peach and tropical fruits."
Poured into a Wicked Weed snifter. No freshness date.
A - Pours an opaque light orange color with 1 inch of white head that settles to a ring quickly.
L - Golden haze bomb. 
"Out to man like Dustin on the plug. Half finger head, spotty but pretty lacing, hazy mango juice appearance. Nose is subdued, might be my airways being stuffed up but nothing mindblowing. The Citra/Mosaic/Simcoe combo rarely fails and here we have another winner. Very soft, bright carb, all sorts of tropical fruit and hop oils clinging to the palate. Great offering from the Southeast."
"Wow! May be my favorite CC beer to date. I hope they do this one again, I was fortunate enough to get a sixer from the brewery. The appearance was just lovely, very hazy, opaque, yellow orange, looked like pineapple orange juice. The smell was piney citrus hops. The taste was very similar. Overall a very well rounded beer!"
"im not sure if all mylar daydream and ddh mylar daydream are the same thing, i assume so, and thus this is the one that was on tap at trve this weekend, so cool of them to do a little showcase out here, all we ever get to do is read about how great other half is, so it was really fun to get to drink through a number of these! this one is oat based and a little sweet, maybe some lactose in the mix, its heavy but truly creamy feeling, and hopped to oblivion, as is trendy right now. the thing is with this one, and frankly a lot of these from other half, is that they are just objectively better than what it seems like everyone else is doing. a soft haze to this, not as heavy as a lot of them look, and with an almost nitro looking head on it from the tap. a familiar hop profile in terms of the varietals used and what they contribute, both in aroma and flavor, but it just seems more up front, bolder, fresher, starting sooner and staying later than so many others. i like how well the alcohol is hidden in this one, its more drinkable than the all green everything by a mile, but still has a lot of structure and body from the oats, its slick and rich feeling but isnt overly sweet, the hops just burst and pop in here, citra and galaxy and mosaic heavy for me, a great combination and well timed and dosed. it gets a little burny when it warms up, but i cant complain, this is next level stuff, one of the better examples of this sort of thing i have had. thankful for trve bringing them out to colorado!"

"Canned 9.6.18, opened 9.16.18"
poured into a pint glass via growler (4 days old)
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Red Session. Really hazy pale yellow color. Aroma has sweet and juicy tropical melon notes. Taste is well balanced and really hoppy with milky yeast notes and light bitterness."
"Cloudy light orange with two fingers of somewhat airy, yellow-tinted head. Spotty, soapy lacing."
Thank you CanConPhilly for this 
"Pours an opaque medium yellow with a one inch white head that left spotty lacing. Smells of tropical fruits with a hint of citrus. Tastes of ripe pineapple, orange, orange rind and an earthy presence. Medium to heavy bodied, moderate carbonation, thick and juicy mouthfeel, mild bitterness."
"More ridulous fun from Other Half... This is an imperial oat cream IPA featuring Amarillo, Citra, Galaxy, and Mosaic; double dry hopped with Citra, Galaxy, and Mosaic... You just can't go wrong with these Other Half NEIIPAs... Typical orange-pineapple juice opacity with a finger or two of white head... Tastes somewhat like a creamsicle - like orange sherbet with a vanilla cream center... Soft and smooth with some tang and zest... Additional fruit impressions of pineapple and peach round out this moderately sweet and only very mildly bitter beer... A real treat - as usual... 4/4/18 canning..."
"Hazy golden yellow pour , foam white head"
"The pour yields a turbid golden straw- colored beer with a pillowy off-white head. This sits between the hazy look of Heady/Focal and the milkshake look seen in many of this style. I prefer this to the milkshake look, but YMMV."
"Missed the first release of this back in November but got this right after New Year's at the brewery. Given how popular any of Other Half's beers with ""Mylar"" or ""Daydream"" in the name were, this was set up to be a winner and sure enough, that was the case. Dank, slick, sweet, and solid, this was nearly everything that one could ask for in a beer without any aspect overpowering the others or feeling contrived at the same time..."
Poured from a growler into a teku glass.
"Pours cloudy yellow with a one finger white head. Aroma of grapefruit, lemon peel,pineapple,orange juice and light pine. Taste follows the nose. Another solid one from OH."
"On tap at Haymaker, it pours like all OH beers, cloudy yellow gold color with a foamy 1 finger off white head that faded slowly and left good spotty lacing. Typical good looks."
Many thanks to jrnyc for yet another OH sample. 
"I tip my cap to my man rowmark...thank you my beer brotha for tossing me this tick. There's been a big backlash against all the cream IPAs from the pureists, but I for one...LOVE the new craze (so long as the tried and true juice bombs continue to appear alongside these dessert IPAs. So naturally as a fan of the style and a fan of mylar...and a fan of all things double dry hopped, I dig this. I don't know if I could drink more than one in a drinking sesh...but I am enjoying this can."
"Tried this at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Had this in a tulip glass with a quarter inch of head. Nice line of lacing. Not much aroma. Very fruity flavor - maybe plum. A little pine at the end, but not much. Overall great tasting beer."
"This beer is another triumph by NEBCO. Just picked up a few fresh four-packs from the brewery. Rich golden-orange color with a thick, durable head. Aromas of orange zest, keffir lime leaf, fresh melon, and resinous pine. Dry yet generous and extremely long on the palate (honestly, count in seconds how long the finish goes). Similar to G-Bot in that they are both basically perfect DIPAs, but with noticeably different flavor profiles due to the different hop bills. I am officially a NEBCO fanboy."
"Poured from a can, fresh from the brewery dated 2/2/18."
Many thanks to Knapp85 for this can. Canned on 9/25/17.
Finally. 
"Good, not great. Filtered, copper colored DIPA. Super drinkable but overall, didn't wow me. Glad I got to try it though. On tap at Mohegan in Comix club."
Big grape nose. White grape is the star. Some pine. Fairly boozy. Balanced bitterness. Body is quite thin for a double. Hop notes trend toward grassy.
"A richer, more robust Fuzzy Baby Ducks."
"I don't get this beer, a malt driven IPA that tasted old and stale (drank from can 1.5 weeks after canning). The hops were not well executed. I will not be trying this one again."
12oz can into an Alchemist stemless teku. 
"New England Brewing just keeps bringing the goods. Had this from a can poured into snifter, from the most recent canning release in March. Look is spot on for the style..golden/amber with some very nice lacing. Smell is spot on for a heavily hopped Nelson double IPA. Tastes very smooth and similar to a top tier Vermont double IPA. Hops dont come out and bite, it's surprisingly very easy to drink for a double. This is probably my 3rd favorite double IPA from New England. That's saying something. Cheers!"
"Medium orange hue, big frothy big bubbled head with great lacing. Aroma is super melon, cantaloupe and orange citrus forward. Those Nelson hops really shine through, yes plenty wine grapes and tropical fruit. No detection of maltiness, and subtle hop bittneress. For a DIPA, super session like. Impressive."
Poured from can dated 3/10/2017 (yesterday! That's fresh!) into a rt tulip glass. It's hazy Orange with nice foamy head. I pick up some light citrus & melon in aroma but something else is there...the aroma of a hot wine grapes from the Nelson Sauvin. 
"I have had this beer a number of times. The most recent was out of a can and after sipping it, and getting that huge smell of Citrus I said this could be the best beer NEBCO makes. Does not drink like a dipa to me. Almost a perfect beer. Well worth it anytime you can get your hands on it."
12 Oz can.
12 oz can...I can find no canning/dating info
poured from a 12 oz can into a Veil Teku. No canning date or BB date that I can find. Got it in a trade on 1/6/17. 
Acquired from marino13412 so a big “Thank You” goes out to him. Poured from a 12oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.
Drank 11-28-16. Full Nelson!
"Taste test Christmas Day with Sip of Sunshine(2nd),GreenTH (3rd)Swish Bissell Bros.(4th). Guess who was No. 1? Coriolis! Great beer all the things you want in this style without any of the back end bite. Incredibly smooth and flavorful. A Winner!"
"Some people think NEBco is CT's Best brewery. I differ in that opinion. However, If all their beers were as good as Coriolis, it would be a different story. This is an DIPA that's bursting with flavor. Its fruity, creamy, slightly bitter at certain points, fresh tasting, refreshing, slightly straw-y. It has a bunch of flavors I can't name, but its a remarkably good beer. I think Its better than Julius and Green from Treehouse. Its a very unique tasting brew. I could have more of these. Gawd damn!"
Had this beer a while back and wasn't very impressed. Didn't write a review. A buddy of mine insisted that I need to have it fresh so we drove to the brewery and picked some up. Drank it the day I brought it home out of a TEKU.
Beautiful lacing and head. Golden yellow with ample haze.
"Clear, dark orange color with white head. Nose is sweet orange, apple, grape, herb, grass, resin, and sap. Taste is sweet fruit - grape, tangerine, apple, pear, orange pith, white wine, herbal notes with a bite, malt sweetness, floral notes. Getting some vanilla cream notes from the nose as it warms. Mouth feel is world class, so creamy with perfect, prickly carbonation. Pour at cellar temp for the best mouth. This is a great IPA."
Sampling a cellar temp can poured into a chalice. The beer pours a slightly hazy golden hue with a creamy bleached white had of 1 cm that fades to a sturdy surface layer some densely packed lattice clings to the glass during each sip. A few lazy streams of carbonation rise to the surface. The aroma has a bit of sweet caramel and then goes to a bunch of citrus and pine with orange dominant but also a bit of peach. No booze notes on the nose.
"an absolute stunner, famous for a reason, and a reaffirmation of my love for the nelson sauvin hop, which is apparently the only one used in this honey thick milky yellow colored heady east coast ipa that comes with a whole heap of hype. aroma of white wine, lime, melon, more piquant citrus, sweet pine and birch, and some fresh cereal malt that likely include wheat and pils, but possibly also some oats and another pale barley, not overly complex on the malt, just enough to support all the hops. appreciably dry in the flavor, no grain interference, just some nice body. hops are all nelson all the way, and if you know that hop at all, its amazing. none of the cat pee warm or stale thing here that lesser beers with this hop sometimes have, instead its a bright tropical fruit complexion with pineapple and melon and again the lime coming to mind for me. bitterness has been tamed here, it doesnt linger at all on the palate after the swallow. juicy and hazy, mostly dry hopped, but its somehow different, more refined, better than the other huge milky india pale ales coming from the east. less turbid and nasty, more attention to detail, and of course, more nelson! carbonation is fine, body is bigger, creamy almost, and the booze is hidden well. great ipa, one of my favorites in awhile! worthy of its high praise over the years. so stoked to finally have had one!"
Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a hint of something towards the red spectrum. Half inch head that lingers for a while after the pour. The smell is non specific citrus that leans more towards orange with a slight piney resiny finish; good but not spectacular. I actually enjoy the taste more than the smell as you still get the citrus character of the beer but you also get a nice grassy note on the front end like a really good pilsner. A very dry beer that does not finish overly bitter; extremely pleasant overall. The citrus character kind of lingers in a pleasant after taste. The feel is medium with a light finish. Overall a really good beer but there is nothing that really stands out about it.
"First NEBCO beer, and it delivered. One of my favorites from the IPA night at Backcountry Pizza in Boulder the week following GABF. Very lucky to get this on tap in Colorado, and so grateful to get to experience it. Crisp, low malt, tons of pungent Nelson hops in aroma and flavor. In summary, drink this beer if you can!!"
"Poured 12oz can into snifter. Big thanks to Jhavs for shipping a can to WI. A gold orange color and nice 2 finger white head with webbed lacing on my glass. Dank, sweet, tropical aromas with a nice bitter blast. Flavor is very tropical, with some dank citrus and a finish of bitter pine. Feel is medium, great carb, juicy and slightly dry. Yeah, this one is a winner."
"I'm so happy they can this one now - and I love the can they put it in! It's a close call between this and Fuzzy Baby Ducks for my favorite NEBCO...but maybe give this a slight edge, if only because dinosaurs trump ducks."
From can into a 12oz glass.
"I have a new favorite, this is one tasty beverage."
The Nelson Sauvin hops just erupt from this brew. Both on the nose and on the palate they impress in every way. Great pale color and smooth mouth feel as well.
"This beer pours a hazy, vibrant golden orange color with a creamy, one finger off white head. Retention is minimal and there hanging, webbed sheets of lacing all over the glass."
"12 oz can. Pours deep hazy gold, two finger white head just sits there forever, coating lace. Dank herbal piney aroma. Taste of this one is weedy with a touch of ripe fruit, piney earthy notes, citrus peel. Full soft mouthfeel. This is a top notch IPA."
"Poured from a can into a snifter, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, straw-gold coloring with a low profile, clingy, foamy, white head. Aromas of evergreen, lemon zest, subtle caramel, pepper spice, guava, and subtle grapefruit. Flavors are bitter and roasted forward, with an immediate follow of the dank and aromatic evergreen notes, pepper spice, and grassy highlights. All of this hop forward blend before getting into the juicy, sweet blend of lemon, grapefruit, guava, and melon. Very balanced, on a slick, oily, mid-body. The aftertaste is more of the juicy and fruity blend forward, but that evergreen character is still holding strong. The finish is slick, dry, and with a solid linger of dank hops and tropical fruit. Really good, balanced DIPA!"
Have waited for this one to hit growlers forever and instead they did one better and put it in cans! Super nice and juice DIPA by NEBCO! Loved this one!!
fresh batch out of a can drank in a teku on 7/28/2016
"12 oz. can. Orange body. Smells of strong Nelson hops. Tropical with the nelson bite. A little bit of toasty malt. Tastes of all nelson ups with some sweet pale malt. Again, it has just a bit of toastiness and a light bitterness. Medium body. Smells and tastes like a big IPA, but it kinda isn't. I appreciate that it isn't a sugar bomb."
"Recently released in 12 oz cans by NEBCO. I waited in line for the first release. I'm glad I did. Previously, I've had this only in growlers and on tap. The pleasure of being able to pop open a 12 oz double IPA like this in a can is wonderful. If they ever make enough of this to distribute it, it will be a game changer. "
"Coriolis in a can is absolutely the best Connecticut beer that you can get as a regular offering in a can. I try to get it every time NEBCO releases, wish they did it more!"
"maybe I just got an off batch, but I don't get the hype on this one"
Nice clear tangerine-amber with minimal head.
64 oz growler from NEBCO. Pours a hazy orange with a nice tropical smell. Taste is classic nelson...hops and fruit with a dry white wine-esq finish. Other than OG Alpine Nelson this is best nelson IPA I have had.....
Growler from the new facility poured into snifter. Fresh.
"have had this one a bunch of times, but finally decided to give a review instead of just a rating. pours an extremely hazy dark golden orange, foamy head that dissipates into a thin one, pretty good lacing. smell is grassy, weedy (the stinky kind), piney, citrusy, and juicy all at the same time. taste follows it exactly, grassy, skunky, citrusy, with a big juice finish over the top of everything else. extremely hop forward, very little malt apparent. mouth feel is exactly NEBCO: lots of carbonation with a slight slick feel, perfect for a DIPA. awesome beer, could crush these (but get in a lot of trouble)."
"Waited in line for several hours at NEBCO's reopening...walked away with a 64 oz. growler of this, Fuzzy Baby Ducks, and another 32 oz. of FBD which I managed to flip for a growler of Tree House Good Morning. Walked away feeling like a champion just one day before my birthday."
"Hazy, ugly appearance as appreciated from most NE breweries. A lot of Nelson on the nose, as expected. Taste is slightly bitter and unbalanced but still solid. Finish is bitter but quick. Solid beer overall."
"Delicious double. Ranks just below a Heady or Sip of Sunshine overall. Awesome hints of grapefruit and citrus. If you see it, stop what you are doing and drink some!"
"Thanks to my buddy Todd for picking this one up at the brewery and sharing some with me. Pours with pineapple smoothie consistency, bright gold and cloudy. Decent head from an aggressive pour leaves lacing. "
Picked up 2 growlers from the brewery. Better than bot and a close second to fuzzy baby ducks in the nebco pecking order.
Rare very hard to find offering from NEBCO.
Nice hoppy IPA. Reminds me of Stone IPA.
Very herbal aroma and taste. Crisp bitterness
A: slight haze; deep gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a thin collar; very nice lacing;
L: Hazy orange body with a generous white foamy head. Beautiful lacing when poured well.
"Effervescent liquid grapefruit. That is the three word review of this beer. Absolutely recommended if you get a chance to score this on tap at your local watering hole. Hopped exclusively with Nelson Sauvin from New Zealand, which is supposed to express a grape-like aroma in the sauvignon blanc wheelhouse, but to me this beer is all about grapefruit. Crisp mouthfeel, pleasing bitterness and astringency after swallowing. I wish New England would can this beer for resale."
This was disappointing. Didn't stand up to any of the other IPAs in the share. Surprised by the reviews.
Love most of NEBCO's IPAs but this one just underwhelmed. Wasn't memorable.
Fruity. Nice pine too. Good summer cut the lawn beer.
Hard to believe this a single hop Nelson. I love Nelson but this is an onion bomb.
"appearance- Gold amber color, cloudy, and pours a dense foamy 3 inch head."
"From a growler from nebco. In sort perfection. When it is young it has a dry astringency that is reminiscent of a fine white wine. As it ages in it gets juicier with all the flavors you would expect from good hops with a subtle grape note. Aged this is my favorite beer out of Locus Reign, Gandhi Bot, and Coriolis. Fresh from tap I think the Gandhi is more drinkable. Age and enjoy!"
"Orange-yellow cloudy beauty, nice finger of frothy head, excellent lacing in the tulip."
From 09/08/14 notes. Big thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing this one; thanks Ross! 32 oz. screw top growler that is a few days old poured into a tulip.
This beer is just absolutely fucking killer. Poured from a 4 day old growler into a tulip. 
"Drank on tap at Woodbridge Social, Woodbridge, CT"
"I'm going back and reviewing some of my favorite beers I've had since my previous ratings now mean nothing. Coriolis is one of my top 3 favorite NEBCo beers. The other two being Locust Reign and Fat Ten Er #2. I wish that one day I could compare all 3 side by side, but unfortunately, that tasting has only occurred in my dreams."
"L - always love how these guys package their beers. The lid of the can is practically bursting off and the moment the top is popped, beer comes rushing out, prompting a quick pour. Certainly won't feel gypped with anything NEBCO cans! Color is a lazy hazy peach. Not too hazy, but more opaque than their usual fare. Huge billowing head blows up from the bottom of the glass leaving sticky lacing all around the glass. "
"Orange, pineapple, pine, grapefruit zest and pith. Nice amount it sweetness but still finishes with citrus bitterness. Somewhat clean. Medium bodied. Really solid."
A: golden unfiltered mouth watering at the sight
"A great DIPA, very unique and a great display of the Nelson Sauvin hop!"
Had this bitch on tap at the brewery about 4 months ago for the first time and was blown away...had it again at the brewery and it was even better this time. Pours a white fluffy head with beautiful sticky lacing. Smells like peaches grapefruit coriander with beautiful piney backbone. This has an almost exact nose as gandhi bot but not as floral. Mouthfeel is incredible and leaves a lingering sweet and tangy film and keeps me coming back for more! As it warms up the peach and grapefruit notes come more into play. Hands down the perfect double ipa. Just wish they sold this shit in stores!!!
"The beer offers wonderful Nelson Sauvin notes, but I almost confused it with Galaxy. "
A: Pours a hazy golden orange with two fingers of white head. Hazy and cloudy. 
"Growler fill at Oliver's in Albany, NY."
Purchased/filled a week ago at the brewery. Nice new facility btw.
"Growler filled a few days ago. Pours cloudy golden with creamy white head. Beautiful smell of citrus, pine,grass. Taste spot on with the nose - heavy citrus and grass. Great complexity and depth. Feel creamy and smooth. Overall amazing offering from nebco with amazing taste and feel"
This beer is literally the shit!!!!
Wow... Saw a tweet on this NEBCO DIPA and I knew I had to track this down fast. This brewery continues to impress me... Very much welcomed in Syracuse
"Served on-tap in a stemmed-tulip glass at J. Timothy's in Plainville, Conn."
1 liter growler into Duvel tulip. Big thanks to BA mob2332 for picking this up for me! (2012 version)
"For some reason the first sip or two of this beer were a little bit funky. Could be that I was not used to the Nelson Sauvin hops. After the first two sips this became an immensely flavorful beer that I could not put down. Much different than any DIPA that I have tasted, in a really good way!"
"A stunningly delicious single hop Nelson beer. Huge nose of tropical fruit, grapefruit, and pineapple blended with a slightly piney aroma. The taste mirrors the aroma well. Again, another amazing single hop beer from NEBCO"
"A special thank you to my wife for stopping at the brewery and getting me a 32 oz fill just prior to vacation to Portland, OR."
My first review so bear with me. Picked this up in a 64oz growler from the brewery. Tasted it 4 hours later.
"Had 4 of these babies last night on cask, double dry hopped. Thank you prime16 and nebco."
This is my favorite offering from nebco - maybe my favorite DIPA ever.
"On tap at New York Pizza. Pours a hazy dark orange with a half inch of head. Nice lacing. Big whiff of citrus hops, apricots, dank hops and an overall sweetness. Almost like candy. Taste is a big hoppy citrus bitterness upfront with some sweet bready flavor. Bitter tangerine at the end with floral notes. Grapefruit as well as some more dank hops. Medium carbonated with somewhat of a heavy mouthfeel. Extremely dry. Insanely drinkable. I wasn't sure that I'd get a chance to try this one but boy am I glad I did. Overall, outstanding Imperial IPA that can hold its own against the Bot."
On-tap at the brewery just a couple days after conditioning. Served in a 668 tulip.
"A very cloudy straw yellow color with a decent white cover and solid, scattered lacing. The aroma brings lemon oil cat-piss and grassy-pine biscuit. Very nice hop heaven. The flavor gives me a thick headful of lemon grass grainy hop. Grapefruit hints, bready honey, herbal grass. Lots of bitter flavors with some tropical fruit nuances.This is a medium-plus bodied brew with a somewhat sticky feel that manages to gain some lighter, brighter ideas in the finish with fine but effective carbonation. A hop lovers delight. Bitterness and bright grains in another excellent DIPA from NEB!"
"Had from growler on 9/7/12, had this beer multiple times and is an outstanding IPA. "
Massive thanks to Pete for bringing this 375mL swing top my way. Very much appreciated! Enjoyed from a captain Lawrence tulip.
"Don't do a lot of reviews, but wanted to get this one on record. Lovely beer overall, excellent use of the Nelson sauvin hops. I am a big fan of the single hopped DIPA. "
Got this in a growler from New England Brewing Company. 
"64 oz. screw top growler, filled 6 days ago."
Pour from a 64 oz growler into their new 668 tulip glass. Purchased on 8/28/2012.
"Eagerly anticipating this for the last few weeks. Poured into a 668 tulip glass. Nice head that quickly dissipates. The taste has a lot of range I get apricot, pineapple, peach and a bit of spicieness. The alcohol is very well hidden."
A-Pours like pineapple juice or orange juice. Completely opaque. Like a melted creamsicle. Head is light bubble-clusters that do leave some consistent lacing tattoos on the glass. This just looks absolutely awesome and unfiltered. Just how I like it. Beautiful.
"A 12 fl. oz. can, canned on 2nd October 2018, and with a drink by date of 13th November 2018. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass."
Have had the rest of the six-pack and cannot be happier with the quality of the Hill beers in cans.
"Pours a murky bright orange color. Awesome nose, tons of citrus and tropical fruits, taste is a little bit bitter. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation."
12 oz can poured into pint glass canned on 10/2.
"Tastes of Oats. American imperial IPA with honey as well and multiple hop strains including Simcoe, galaxy, and Nelson Sauvin. Solid, but not my favorite."
12 oz. can dated 7/23/18 and purchased at brewery 7/28/18. Poured into Belgian ale glass.
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery.
"Had on tap at the Whetstone Station, Brattleboro"
Picked up a growler of this about one week ago at HF. 
"This one pours a bright and fairly hazy orange, with a solid fluffy head, and a lot of lacing."
Poured from a fresh growler into the test glass.
Huge thanks to jhavs for this
"On draft, 10 oz pour at AA&A, served in tulip. Copper yellow color, hazy with one finger alabaster head. Minimal retention and lacing. Nose is papaya and mango skin. Flavor is resins and dank, some subtle vegetal notes. Very dry, little to no sweetness. Clean medium mouthfeel, touch of creamy texture on the finish that compliments the dryness. A bold and mature example of the style by a favorite. 93/100, cheers!"
750ml growler filled at the brewery. Served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass.
"L: turbid orange body with very thin head that leave a faint, speckled lacing."
750ml growler poured into a Other Half pint glass.
"Hill Farmstead are masters of pungent but delicately balanced and clean IPAs. their society and solitude series is always top notch, so after seeing a newly available batch the hype was very real! "
Opaque yellow.
Nearly perfect. What's not to like?
"West coast IPA. Simcoe, Citra and Mosaic hops ore Elan’s in this beer. Juicy taste, nice color. A solid offering and one of the best IPA amongst the society and solitude series."
On tap at Armsby Abbey poured into a chalice 
12 oz can a few days old.
"7/9/18 canning, features Simcoe, Citra, and Mosaic hops..."
750 ml growler.
"Six pack of cans picked up from the brewery retail sales room. Poured into a snifter. Canned on 1/8/18, drink by 2/19/18 per the bottom of the can. "
"Excited... haven't had a new Hill beer in ages, big thanks to rudzud. Canned 1/8/18"
"Opaque light yellow-tan with a large white foam settling as a central, popover shaped lump leaving an even layer of droopy lace."
Can received in trade with Jacob
Picked this up at the brewery last week.
"This one pours a fairly hazy sharp orange, with a small foamy head, and lots of lacing."
"From a 2L growler, filled at the brewery four days ago. Served in a 16oz tulip."
Look: Yellow hazy with medium sized white head. Has medium low carbonation.
Pretty limited in smell and taste. This is a very overrated beer. If this beer was in a blind taste test no way it would score the ratings that it gets.
"Just shared a growler I picked up yesterday with a friend. Amazingly nice beer. I will not try to put this into the five categories and just say drink it if you get a chance and make up your own mind. I, personally, would be very happy if this was the last beer I ever drank"
"Light golden orange in color. Hazy in appearance. Tons of ripe white Grapefruit juice, orange zest, tangerine, melon and citrus pith. Medium bodied. Not too sweet. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish. Tongue tingling. Dry. Real good."
On tap at Coals pizza in Portchester on Feb 25th.
"Pours a hazy golden color with a one inch, well retained white head that left lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of citrus, pine and a mild sweetness. Tastes of grapefruit, orange, lemon, pine, slightly sweet caramel and mango. Mild bitterness, lightly carbonated, smooth mouth feel."
"Had on tap out of a tulip. Beer comes in light gold/yellow with a fuuuullll haze and bright white head. Aroma explodes with pineapple and passion fruit. A good amount of oniony dankness as well. Taste follows the nose with a light citrus bitterness and a medium to medium minus mouthfeel. Overall, this is a really complete beer that meets most of my flavor and aroma expectations. The only thing holding it back is the mouthfeel. 97 points!"
"On tap at Haymaker, NYC, it pours cloudy orange gold color with a small white head that faded slowly and left very good rings of lace coating the sides. "
L - hazy and opaque. OJ and pineapple juice. 
"750ml fliptop growler. Served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Pours a medium straw yellow body, hazy in colour with a slight orange hue, one finger thick white head, great retention, bits of lacing. Smell is citrus, orange, grapefruit, resin and a touch of pine, light caramel sweetness on the nose. As always, not particularly bitter or resinous. Flavour is a nice combination of grapefruit, light resin and orange, a bit juicy. Not particularly sweet, fair bit of mineral in the background, but there is a slight booziness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, soft, creamy with a nice carbonation and feel on the backend, vintage Hill water. Overall, a tasty blend of hop aromas and creamy mouthfeel; a bit lacking in depth compared to some of the other hoppy beers that come out of that farm."
"750ml growler, freshly filled, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 12.21.2016, reviewed from Tasting Journal. "
In a tulip the beer was a hazy gold color with a moderate off-white head. There was a good deal of lace.
Poured from the growler into HF stemware one day after filling.
"The color is amber, orangey, and hazy."
"Pours a dull, hazy orange with a loose, frothy head. Nose expresses citrus and pith. Taste follows nose with the addition of an earthy/pithy finish. Citrus suggested by the nose is more subdued in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild, even carbonation and a semi-dry, slightly crisp finish. Overall, solid and quite drinkable."
"On tap at The Well Brooklyn. Poured a completely cloudy orange color with a good amount of frothy head. The nose was wonderful, a mixture of citrus with grapefruit playing a key role before you get some mild floral piney notes. The flavor is an amazing balance of bitterness to citrus, tropical fruit sweetness. You get pine and flowers mixed with grapefruit and mango. The feel is thick and smooth just as the appearance would suggest. This is my first Hill Farmstead and I'm completely blown away!"
"waited excessively long to get a growler fill of this at the brewery. really great looking beer, as you come to expect from these guys. very hazy but not in that dull murky sludge way - color is brilliantly opaque golden orange, thick lace left behind and retention is great. "
On-draught at a Zwanze day event.
Growler shared by jc1762. Thanks Jon!
"Got a 750ml swing top bottle from HF on a Wednesday and drank at my house 5 days later on a Monday. OJ appearance in a glass with frothy head. Great lacing. Bright orange, murky and oh so nice to look at. Smell is once again perfection. Fruit explosion with a little earthiness in there as well. Taste again is near perfection in what I would look for in an IPA. Sweet and fruity with hop bite in the finish and just a touch mild bitterness that is my only ding. Mouthfeel is so rich and creamy which is where I'm guessing the oats and wheat really round this beer out to make it full bodied and rich. Overall, I really don't know what else to say except every beer nerd needs to visit Hill Farmstead once in their lifetime to enjoy the best the beer world has to offer."
"Disclaimer: It's hard not to wax poetic about these beers when you're drinking them staring at the green mountains in fall, so apologies ahead of time. "
Add on 10/26/2016:
"had on tap at Gold Star Beer Counter in Brooklyn, NY"
"Pale orange hazy body with a very frothy bone-white head. Aroma showcases simcoe with a catty nose along with some citrus and a dash of tree fruit. Flavor is a nice blend of citrus, some peach, hints apricot and some grassy notes. Feel is very creamy, smooth, medium carbonation, very nice. Really awesome beer all-around, well done."
"750 mL growler. Very hazy orange body. Smells of tropical fruits and some citrus. I can smell oats, but not wheat. Tastes very creamy with an orange hop flavor. Sweet pale malt. Light hop bite and a lingering oat flavor. Medium heavy. Big IPA. The oats are strong. Makes for a distinct profile."
750ml growler poured into a snifter.
"Bright golden yellow with a rustic sticky foamy head and thick lacing. Dominant Tropical citrus nose and taste, and moderate mouth feel and carbonation. Great new addition to the S&S series!"
"Growler from Brewery: This one pours a hazy orangish-straw yellow color. There was a small white head that didn’t linger long. The aroma is great. Tropical fruit hops, lemon and wheat. This beer is smooth. Just a bit bitter. Malts, wheat, tropical fruits and some lemon. Very nice!"
"Picked up a two liter growler from the brewery, drank the same day. This beer is incredible. The pour is a bright yellow hazy cup of wonderfulness. The aroma and taste are both heavy on tropical fruit including pineapple and mango. A pillowy mouthfeel makes for one of the best IIPAs I've ever had."
"L: Warm butterscotch, honeycomb, amber, and golden hues with a fluffy white head and elegant lacing"
"Pretty much the best dbl IPA I've had....love the light orange hazy appearance w/ a monstrous 2-3 finger white foam head. redonk lacing up and down my glass, scent is straight up a bowl of tropical juice (mango, pineapple...all that crap), taste is a tropical hop delight that is significantly better than that other grass clipping flavor i get w/ the juice from the other massachusetts big boy(s). i don't get much of alcohol but i get a sweet, flavorful resin that stays w/ you for a while. drank this stuff too quick..needless to say the 8% is all there. "
"Pours a hazy, bright golden orange color with a 1-finger white head. The head settles nicely into a ring around the glass, and leaves some splotchy lacing as it dissipates. "
First beer from Sand City!
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a one inch head that left spotty lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of tropical and citrus fruits, pine and a hint of sweet malt. Tastes of mango, pineapple, grapefruit, pine and a subtle malt presence. Minimal bitterness on the finish. Light to medium bodied, well carbonated, smooth and incredibly easy to drink. Another winner from Sand City."
"Double dry-hopped with Citra, Simcoe, Chinook, and Mosaic... No canning date... Medium gold body, hazy, white head a couple of fingers high on a moderate pour into a pint; left some lace lines down the glass... Aromas of citrus and tropical fruits muddled with mild earthy dank tones... Muted citrus of grapefruit and mildly sweet fruit melded with herbal pine and a little muskiness... Bitterness is subtle, with just a faint sweetness alongside, soft and airy-feeling, medium-light weight... Super smooth drinking... Batch released 3/10/17..."
wow! great nose on this brew with a seriously complex flavor from the multiple hops in the dry hopping. very impressed with this Imperial IPA as quickly becoming a fan of sand city
"L: Apricot, honey, and caramel hues with a thin white foamy head and tons of lacing"
"An amazing NE style IPA. Smell lots of hops but not with much of the bitterness at all. A very drinkable beer with grapefruit, citrus and some subtitle pine in there. A great job with the mosaic hops. This brewery is as good as any. And I'm not some long islander trying to hype the beer. I'm from the city and this beer and brewery is fantastic"
"Wow lots of people here are drinking the kool-aid, or should I say the sand-aid. My guess is lots of Long Islanders who are thirsty for having something to drink other than Blue Point are hyping this up as some world-class DIPA when frankly it's perfectly mediocre. This beer is a mess. Poured from a can that I got in trade. Thin, forgettable aroma after pouring in to a snifter. The thinness continues as you take your first sip. Completely overpowered by an astringent smell I can't quite place...reminiscent of mop water. Not a complete drain pour but pretty close. "
Another great one by Sand City. I think this is their best beer. Has the classic pungent qualities of Mosiac hops. Sand City sure knows how to make beer with Mosaic.
"Obtained can in a trade. I hadn't heard of Sand City before but, after consuming this can, I'll be looking for any other products from this brewery that I can locate. Not much I can add to what previous raters have expressed. Second Wave rates as an outstanding Imperial IPA - always a great pleasure when an unknown product (to me) turns out to be outstanding. Wish it were distributed in my home area."
"Can from an in person trade at Bissell Brothers in Portland, Maine. "
"Crack...glug, glug, glug: welcome to the big leagues and canned beer Sand City."
"Pours with a nice head. Light suds hang on the sides of the snifter and stay to the last sip. Aroma of citra , mango and hops. Taste citra , mango,light pineapple,very light malt light hops at the finish. Great dipa. As with all sand city beers it's excellent. Love That they are now canning. Look forward to more from them."
"the second of the pair of cans released today, second wave is definitely bigger and richer and decidedly a IIPA. still fairly light and easy drinking an all out assault of tropical fruitiness from the hop. really love the wide range of great ipas coming from these guys. another winner."
"From a growler. Orange pour, thin white head. Aroma is big tropical citrus. Taste follows the nose; this is a tropical bomb, no alcohol presence whatsoever. Great thick mouthfeel and the finish is long and sweet. My new favorite SC beer."
Sand city can do no wrong. 
Phenomenal DIPA. Smell and taste is a juice bomb. Competes with HF and Trillium as one of the best IPA's I've had. Was a great find and an underrated brewery that deserves more hype.
"Sand City's best beer to date, and one that elevates them to the next level. Beautiful bright orange opaque color with lasting creamy white head that hangs around. Blasting Citra in the nose with huge peach and pineapple, pithy grapefruit, orange peel, some earthy grassy mosaic notes. Taste follows with mostly Citra, juicy peach/pineapple, citrus peel, slightly unripened mangos, light crackery malt, finishing with a soft but clinging dry grassy bitterness. This brew is tremendous."
On tap at the brewery. 
"Though this is the double version of the CPA, I found that beer to be more expressive and flavorful with all the various citrus interplay; that said, this is still a great beer - lots of pineapple, grapefruit, etc. Balanced, soft bitterness at the end"
One of my favorites from BG!
750ML swingtop growler poured into a Brew Gentlemen tulip glass:
"750 ml growler. Pours super cloudy light orange with thin white head, rings of lace left behind. Juicy pineapple and mango aroma. Great tasting, balanced IPA, juicy citrus, mango sweetness, with a bunch of dank weedy hops. Nice back end bitterness lasts just right. Medium to full creamy soft feel. My first brew from these guys, impressive."
L: Soft and hazy yam and apricot hues with an ample white fluffy head and impressive retention
"Orange hazy small white head leaves lots of lacing behind. Tons of tropical fruit on the nose. Tastes like a juice bomb, but high alcohol and bittering hops help balance the taste making it quite pleasing to sip. Very smooth."
L - 1.5 finger sparse white head atop a milky yellow body.
Canned 9/4/18. 
"Excellent DDH IPA. Cloudy in glass, great light tropical citrus, crisp, very dry. Too bad it’s hard to find!"
Top five Bearded Iris Brew for sure.
On tap at Tørst. Poured a very hazy orange juice color with a slight amount of white head. The smell has tons of citrus notes with a good grassy finish. The flavor is juicy as you’d expect with citra hops but gives a slight bitterness and the tiniest spice finish. Feel is smooth and finishes dry. Outstanding for the style. Always love citra hops. Used very well in this beer.
Appearance - The beer was super cloudy in appearance. This nails the style. 
Thanks goes out to Buck89 for this brew.
"Is there any hop any sexier than Citra? And is there a more alluring beer style then the imperial IPA? So, naturally these two flavors marry up for a taste that kicks the Bearded Iris hoppy regimen straight through the uprights. "
Crowler dated 8.26 poured into a pilsener glass
Notes to nose will remind you of Trillium's DIPAs. Very nice! Shelton Brothers 8/18/17
"Bearded Iris has my full attention!!!! Great hop nose and flavor that carries throughout the tasting. Smooth for s high a high Abv, not complaining at all!"
Hazy look of pineapple juice. Smell of pineapple and oranges. Taste... right off the bat you can taste orange and pineapples and fades to a spicy end. Just enough hop flavor at the very end but not much at all. Mouth feel was exactly as the can described. Pillowy! SUPER Smooth and enjoyable. I will be making a trip back up to TN for more.
Juice like appearance. Hazy pale gold with a 1 finger eggshell head.
"Smell: Grassy, juicy a hint of dankness. Big juicy fruit orange, tangerine, mango, pineapple. Creamy yogurt. It smells wonderful!"
"With the flood of local DIPAs over the last few months, this one is easily my favorite and might be my favorite local brew in all."
This beer is so juicy and amazing! 
"This is an exceptional beer. Easily my favorite in Nashville and possibly one of my favorites overall. I would put it up there with Heady Topper and Pliny, and yes I have had both. "
"Without question my favorite beer in Nashville. Bearded Iris masterfully crafts the juiciest of IPAs, but this Double tastes like you should be drinking it out of a Capri-Sun straw. First batch on draft blew my mind. Same batch in cans continued to deliver for months. The newest batch (2nd) lives up to my own beer soaked expectations. Least boozy DIPA I've ever had the pleasure to imbibe. #DankNation"
East Coast Juice Bomb! 
"I only do a full review of beers that have caught my attention and this is one of them! Can dated 1/24/17. The look through me off because it's more on the hazy orange side than the hazy yellow side (which I expected to be on the maltier side) but it has a nice fluffy white head. Smell right away when pouring was mango, pineapple, peach, candied fruit! Taste is just like the smell with a tiny touch of Carmel in it to let you know it's not pure juice but an actual beer. The Feel is super smooth and somewhat velvety with zero aggressive bitterness. Overall I dig it a lot and I am going to trade for more of these guys since I live many hours from Nashville."
"Very nice Dipa. Pours a golden/copper color with very minimal white head that fades quickly, some lacing.."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Moderately hazy but not turbid. A golden-orange color with a one-finger foamy white head that left nice lacing in the glass. Very tropical aromas: tangerine, pineapple, and mango. There was a tiny hint of malt. The taste was more complex, with big fruity flavors but also a dank, herbal presence. Well-balanced with a dry, bready malt. As billed, this has a very soft and yes, ""pillowy"" feel. The bitterness is there but also ""soft."" This is a great IPA."
Canned 1/24/17. Poured into a Bearded Iris tulip. Served at 40-42 degrees.
"Bearded Iris keeps canning new offerings, and I keep trying (and really liking) them. Not a bad one in the bunch. Attention Please is their biggest to date in terms of ABV (8%+), but I'm amazed at how quaffable it is."
"Damn if that isn’t one of the freshest IPAs I’ve had in a long time. I thought the “enjoy by” thing on the front of the can might have been a gimmick, and surely this beer couldn’t be as good as the reviews say? But it was everything I could have hoped for, and more. Nice bright light copper-amber color with some foamy head and just a trace of spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, nice big bold citrus zest aromas with a little pine in the background. Tastes amazing. Loads of fresh citrus fruit - passionfruit, orange, tangerine, mango, grapefruit, lemon - as well as piney hops, floral hops, vanilla, bread and a great well-balanced malt backbone. So smooth, easy to drink and great mild mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation. It’s additionally an imperial IPA but you’d never guess it since the higher ABV is well-hidden and the bitterness is just right, not too bracing, not too subtle. An outstanding beer and I will venture back to a local pub to sample this one on tap."
"Not a NE style (thank God!). Just a beautiful Westcoaster bought at Sam’s in Durham, NC in a canned sixer for a fair price. Should have bought more because I only get there a couple times a year. Clear (no gassy yeast!), hoppy, a tad of sweet malt; this is one of their best. Don’t be scared of the monster on the can, just trust the masters at Stone and your Holloween will be perfect!"
Enjoy by 10.31.18 - 
10.31.18 was a very good offering.
"I really enjoyed ""Enjoy by 10.31.18"" from Stone, ABV 9.40%, IBU 90. I liked it better than the unfiltered Enjoy By, which had a garlic undertone (this one doesn't)."
The 10.31.2018 is awesome
"This beer's color absolutely radiates gold with a big foamy head, an absolutely gorgeous pour. Aroma is upbeat and citrusy, but nothing truly of note. Taste is smooth, dank but sweet with the expected hops bite. The big ABV and malt keep it mostly sweet at the back end of a swallow. Mouthfeel, again, is incredibly smooth. Delicious, but maybe a little too rich for more than one or two a sitting."
"This is one of the top IPAs I've had (and I'm not an IPA guy). Really had solid hops and offered great color and mouthfeel. Super value compared to Treehouse, Heady Topper and other rarities."
"I've drunk a lot of IPAs, Double IPAs, Imperial IPAs, and Triple IPAs--This is the tastiest brew I've ever had in my life! It approaches perfection like no other. A friend gave me two four packs of cans for my March 30th 70th birthday, which we drank on the use by date with other appropriate consumables--we were flying! I drank another can last night, more than three months past the use by date, and it was still absolutely superlative. Other than Dogfish 90, I prefer my strong IPAs lighter in color and this one is literally the light gold standard. Though it says its danky, I find its hop taste far from the dankiest. Rather its hoppy clear and true. I have one more can. I wish I had a case. It just doesn't get any better."
Solid readily available IPA.
"Drinking the Enjoy by 07/04/2018 that was filtered at the brewery. Very enjoyable but I like Hopslam a bit more. This doesn't come close to M-43, Crusher or Sip in my opinion. If I see it in Total Wine in Orlando this weekend I'll get another 6-pak. Would like to find it on draft."
The bar for fresh Double IPA's! 'Nuff said.

Poured from can (4/20/18) into a Dogfishhead pint glass
"Had Enjoy by 4.20.18 and 12.25.17. Good beers. A little late on both reviews, of course..."
"Enjoy by 4-20-18 , Citrus, hoppy, yeah."
"Enjoy by 4.20.18 from 12 oz can. Beautiful pour - brilliant clear copper with great head and steady bubbling. Smell from my tulip glass is ripe fruit, dank grass, the waft of alcohol and a touch of citrus. Taste is an intense depth of balanced malt, hop bitterness, carbonation and hop flavor. Finishes slightly sweet on the back end. They have done a nice job taking what could have been an overly intense beer and making it very drinkable. This is a great beer."
Enjoy by 4.20.18!
"Enjoy By 04.20.18. I love the concept, perfect for a double. Happy to see it in 12 oz cans."
A: Wonderfully clear and golden. Excellent lacing.
Enjoy by 4/20/18. Canned on 3/14/18.

For Enjoy by 04.20.18
Canned march 14th 2018
"Nice golden colored hue. Creamy white puffy head which remains. Smells like grapefruit, pine,orange marmalade, fresh dough cooking.Tastes like a super hoppy,fresh,tangy,not too astringent. Feels amazingly smooth ,crisp,well balanced .Overall this is a kick ass IPA !! I would guess it at a 7% A.B.V. it is actually 9.4. Really good stuff."
4-20-18 batch. Poured into snifter. Orange gold a little bit of haze. Strong citrus grapefruit aroma. Flavor follows the aroma with a very smooth follow through with an excellent hoppy finish. An absolutely fantastic beer.
"Canned 3/14/18, consumed 3/25/18"
"Pours a foggy copper, nice off white head. Aroma is mostly hops. Stone does IPA's well, this one is no exception."
"A solid IPA. As to be expected from Stone. Nice cloudy pour. Strong hoppy aroma. Its missing something. Im not sure what. Good hop taste. Not overpowering, but is it possible for a beer to be too hoppy? Not in my experience. I opened it past the enjoy by date. What can I say, I like to drink dangerously."
Any bottle of this IPA is enjoyable as some things are just not worth changing -- this is one of those things!
This is a darn good beer. My brother in law got a six pack of Enjoy by 10/31/17 in late December for $1. It still tasted great.
I had the enjoy by 12/25/17.
"Pretty darn good, but a bit overrated given the stellar reviews I see here. Not very special to look at, great nose and very good to taste. Not throwing cold water here folks, I was just a bit surprised by the over the top reviews I saw on the site. This ABV is very well disguised and it's a thumbs up, just not ""world class."""
"12/25 edition,"
"I frequently say that I'm not a fan of hop bombs, yet very time I have one like this I have to reconsider that position. Excellent smooth hippy deliciousness."
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.
"Devastatingly DANK! The marketing on the can embraces the date! This was ""Enjoy By 4.20.2018"". It was canned on 3-14-2018, and meets the 'fresh' standards when enjoyed. :-)"
Stone is without a doubt one of the best breweries in the world. Their IPA is delicious and this variety is very close to Arrogant Bastard and is extremely enjoyable.
"Stone Enjoy By is an extremely fresh double IPA with an especially big, citrusy, floral front end. Love how Stone sends a clear message that this beer needs to be consumed ASAP with the clear label."
12 oz bottle that was bottled on 9/24/17 and opened on 11/2/17 poured into a Duvel chalice.
"12oz draft pour into a snifterloudy boasts a clear, mirror bright, orange-gold body and floats a persistent 1/4in cap of tightly bubbled head. Constant rising bubbles and a spotted lacing."
This maybe an inaccurate rating because it was a few months past date.
10/31/17 version
Solid west coast IPA as always.
Enjoy by 10-31-17
Nice golden amber color with a thick white head on top. Has an overpowering hop smell with citrus accompanying it. Taste has citrusy hops with a malty finish.
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass. Poured clear dark honey blonde with some orange. Nice cream colored head. Citrus aromas on the nose. Hoppy on the front end with a smooth finish. Fresh tasting, citrusy flavor. I would highly recommend. Was skeptical of the 'drink by' that the beer vendor was trying to sell me on but it does taste very fresh and the 10 different hops I found interesting."
"Wow! I’m a huge fan of Stone/Arrogant Bastard brewing. I’ve been drinking Ruination 2.0 since day one. It has always been my favorite IPA until now. Enjoy By has set a new standard in hops overload and freshness. I sweet, bitter tastes from beginning to end. Simply a refreshing beer that is amazing. If you like hops and quality beer, then look no further. This is the beer to get."
"12oz bottled 9/24/17 poured into a teku glass at fridge temp 9.4% ABV. The beer pours bright light honey in color with a hint of orange. The head is off white, sticky and persistent. Lacing is prevalent. The aroma is pine, citrus and light honey. The taste is semisweet caramel, pine and citrus in classic west coast style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and bitter & dry in the finish. Overall, still outstanding. This EB 10/31/17 is the first I've tried in years. The last few times I had it (2015), I was overwhelmed with onion aroma that I could not get over. This is back on point."
"This beer is just a great clean and balanced double IPA. Its just the right level of bitter and sweet. The taste is clean and refreshing, with hints of citrusy mango, pineappley tasting goodness. After taking part in the NEIPA craze lately, I always forgot how great the classic tastes are."
This maybe the best all around beer that is pretty easy to seasonally acquire.
"4 oz pour, small tulip, Best By 10/31/17. "
22 ounce bottle from Costco	
First impression: Wow! Tasted from bottle. Pours a clear gold with white head. Huge aroma of citrus floral and pine. Excellent nose. Taste is similar to the nose with robust citrus and floral bitterness mixed with a mild caramel sweetness. It's all about the bitterness here though. Medium bodied with some nice stickiness to the palate. One of the best IPAs I've had. Well done guys!
Nice head with constant bubbles rising. The smell is citrusy with definite pine and noticeable alcohol...but the overall impression is freshness. The taste is more grapefruit than the nose and the bitter hoppines just screams fresh. Feel is lighter than expected considering all the aromas and taste. Another winner from Stone.
"L: Cloudy, orangish, frothy white head, much carbonation"
"Would rate thus a 4.69, because this beer is nearly perfect but has some very slight shortcomings"
"This actually isn't a single beer, but it would be quite the chore to put all the actual beers on here, and people have already been reviewing more than one on this page so why bother? I'm going to review multiple versions of this beer and just use the rating of the one I like best. So far, that is the first one."
"Look, Bomb!"
"Reviewed from notes. The appearance had a clear golden amber colored body with a one finger white foamy head that disappears at a moderate pace, speckled lacing clings a bit. The smell had a sweet yet bitter through pine, floral, hoppy, grapefruit tones. The taste had a bittersweet through previously mentioned flavors, grapefruit aftertaste, dry finish. On the palate, it sat at about a light to medium, semi-sessionable as the ABV seems to be well hidden, carbonated spot on. Overall, very nicely done IPA in a series that is always easy to come back to."
"We all know his beer.. dank, resin, pine etc... got it at Bevmo San Jose a week before holiday.. $18.99 6 pack cans.. variation between cans. Half were cloudy, others relatively clear..but all good."
"I saw this on a menu yesterday in Birmingham while at work and immediately stopped by to try it for the first time on my way home. Served in a sniffer. Look is pale amber in color with about 3/4"" of head. Pungent odor of hops and hops and hops with slight citrus quaffed around the hops. The imagery of hops soaked in a pool of zesty seltzer water came to mind. Taste seems to be a never ending profile of hops that flows in waves throughout. Complex indeed but so incredibly smooth and refreshing. Truthfully with the ABV and varieties used I anticipated it to be overbearing but in typical stone fashion, it was not. Incredibly smooth and balanced throughout and had a wonderful mouth feel that coated so well. I am extremely impressed by this IPA and encourage anyone to get one while its good."
Bright golden with large billowy head. No lacing. 
"Pours a golden-orange color, but I was surprised to see it this clear despite being labeled “unfiltered.” Lot of rising bubbles. Thin white head that lingers. Floral and tropical fruit aromas. Taste mirrors this, moderate amount of hops for the style, there are certainly more aggressively hopped IPAs. A delayed malt character presents itself to balance out the finish. Thick, lacy mouthfeel, can feel and taste this beer for about 20 minutes after finishing it."
One of my favorite Enjoy Bys. Diverse hop profiles.
12oz canned on 5/29/17-- Enjoy by 7/4/17.
"This good beer, and it will give a great buzz, but it tastes like onions. Reminds me of Voodoo Ranger, but smoother. Drink it with a juicy burger."
Enjoy By 5/29/17
"On tap into a pint glass. Pours clear golden color with a two finger head that sticks around and leaves lacing 1/3 way down the glass. Strong but balanced nose of peppery, dank, and citrus hops. Taste is complex but redeeming with pale malt, citrus, pine, and dank hops with clean finish. Medium body and medium high carbonation with a perfectly subtle bitterness."
"Taste: complex flowery hops, dank and dry finish. Same with the nose. Amber color, slight haze, with a refined soft foam head and defined ringed lattice. Medium/full body. This was the ""Enjoy By 4/20/17"" version"
"Bottled 3/14/17, enjoy by date 4/21/17, actually enjoyed on 4/25/17. Poured into an oversize wine glass."
Appearance is a hazy gold. Light head and lacing.
"12oz bottle into a pint glass. best by 4/20/17, so right on the nose here. "
"It is just after Midnight on 04.20.17 & I just happen to have a bottle to be Enjoy[ed] By today! I am a little surprised that I have never reviewed this beer before now, but no time like the present, Happy 4-20 Day!"
"Pours a dark golden color. More bubbles than head. Has an earthy pine smell. Taste is lemon in the beginning, with an earthy pine finish. Mouthfeel is a little heavier than most IPAs. Overall a beer that lives up to the hype."
"Poured from 22oz bottle into Bell's Hopslam Tulip, this is the Enjoy By 4-20-17 bottled on March 14th 2017. "
Bottled on 3/17/17.

Poured into a tulip
"P- Poured from a 12 oz bottle,into a large Funky Buddha snifter.Enjoy By 04.20.17."
"Big, juicy, & citrusy hop bomb with a malt center and a piney finish. Very dank flavors that attack your tongue. The taste perfectly mimics the nose. Lots of fruit, but perfect proportion to the hop presence."
4/20/2017 version on tap at the Winking Lizard in Columbus Ohio. Served in a tulip glass. Brilliant Amber color and wonderful smell. Taste is like a strong IPA that just keeps going. It is strong fruity and hoppy and the after taste is the same. Strong and smooth. Beautiful. A must for IPA lovers.
A: [4.25] The bottle lists the ABV (9.4%) and there is a best by date 4/20 - duh. The beer is a cloudy amber color with 1 finger of white head.
One of the best beers I have had. Tastes better than all other IPAs.
"Pours a pellucid, reddish orange with an off-white froth. Wait, you mean it's not hazy!"
"After having this beer on tap (today!), I believe this is easily the best IPA I've had so far."
"Clear amber with head that dies down. YUUUUGE aroma. Pine, grapefruit, sweet mango and peach in the aroma. I don't know what dank is in a beer, but the taste has powerful resiny spiciness, booze on the finish, assertive bitterness, and subdued bready malts. Incredibly intense and unique taste. A great DIPA. Heads and shoulders above Enjoy by Unfiltered."
Not sure why this particular date gets its own entry. I wonder why that is... 
"Look- 4.5-Gold color, slight haze, white head that lasts a little while, lots of lacing."
"Possibly the best beer I've ever had. I don't write reviews much, but this one blew me away so much I had to say something. Has the most complex, intense IPA flavor. The usual grapefruit, pine flavor but just more...interesting."
Copper color with white head / thin lacing.
enjoy by 4-20-17
Usually a 4 to 4.25 depending on the batch. Best i had was 12/25/16 which was at least a 4.5.
"L: This beer looks like what a double IPA should look like. Great carbonation, Half a finger of fluffy head that leaves perfect lacing as you drink it down. "
Re review: 10.31.17
"Look: Copper, clear, and well carbonated with a healthy head that sticks around."
"Pours a clear, orange color with a little over a finger of white head. The smell is fantastically strong from the moment the bottle is opened. Strong smells of tropical fruits, especially citrus like tangerines and oranges, some smell of peaches. Dank. Smells delicious. Taste is solid, hoppy bitterness from the start, not overpowering but it's there. Sweet and citrus, some pine notes, alternates a lot with the malts. Nice, medium body beer. Has a lingering bitterness to it. Overall its solid and nice, glad I grabbed a six pack, might get another one."
Enjoy by 04.20.17 This is one great DIPA.
Top 5 IPA of all time. Perfectly brewed. Reminds me of the Northeast IPA's that get all the accolades even though most of the country can't taste them.
"A clear amber orange with loads of carb rising, and a finger of white foamy head that sticks. In the aroma, I get lots of citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemon), a decent amount of the dank, but, not quite oniony vibe, and a nice touch of caramel malt. In the flavor, nice waves of hops and malts that alternate back and forth from sweet to bitter, ending with a pleasant bitter note. Dank is mostly what I'm picking up in the flavor, which is great, but, I think the nose gives off a little more in the way of the citrus. Still, a very tasty brew. The feel is, above average carbonation, full feel, a little oily up front, and, quite dry on the finish. I can see why it's in demand. Nice stuff."
"Enjoyed the 4.20.17 release of this. Lots of tangerine, clementine, and other lower-citrus citrus. Smooth, juicy, almost sweet mouthfeel with little lingering aftertaste or bitterness. Remarkably light feeling for over 9% ABV. Absolutely the best offering I've had from Stone."
"L: hazy golden orange with lots of hoppy carbonated bubbles, misty white lacing that stains glass, looks delicious."
4-20-17 ventage. Pale gold appearance with minimal white head. Strong very clean citrus fruit aroma with hops. Taste is strong citrus fruit and hops but very smooth and without any hint of alcohol.
"Probably my favorite non vintage stone beer along with Xocoveza. An accessible cream of the crop west coast double IPA. I didn't try the chocolate version, but I know others who have. I'm glad it's back to it's base beer roots - for now. Enjoy by 4-20-2017"
Poured into a Berliner glass..04-20-17... 2 finger mini bubble head ..great carbonation...your typical IPA taste ..yet..very refreshing and a bit more malty..(which I like).good mouth feel and mellow after taste..no alcohol burn (9.4%)..light lacing throughout ..***
"Pours hazy, golden amber. Medium, white head that lasts a while."
"Big time fan of the Enjoy by series and this latest batch didn't let me down. Nice and Dank and just as good as previous editions. This one is full of bodied, floral and nice and smooth. Had that creamy feel to it that I've come to expect. "
Great IPA always fresh but never the same twice which is why it can be amazing or not really your style. Over all the good ones overtake the bad and for this I give it a 4.25 overall rating. Also trust the bottle and enjoy by the date on the front of the bottle. Not much later than that date can alter the overall feel and integrity of the beer.
"By far my favorite beer I have ever had. I mean...come on people. It's amazing. Takes a lot to get 5 star ration across the board. Look is a fantastic light golden haze with bubbles and awesomeness. Smell is like I'm peeling a grapefruit or maybe an orange or maybe a star fruit/grapefruit/orange/tangerine/mango-hybrid. Just incredible. Taste is basically the same as the smell. Just outstanding. Seriously world class stuff here. As far as west coast American IPA's are concerned this is the cream of the crop. Mouthfeel is just outrageous. Crisp, clean, smooth, thick enough to really set the flavors into your tastebuds, light enough to wash away after a moment or two after swallowing. Overall this is probably my favorite beer of all time, and each iteration is just a new and exciting version to sample, every time a new enjoy by comes out it's a nice diversion to a different aspect of the original profile without changing so much as to be unrecognizable as an enjoy by. I look forward to each one, especially the unfiltered editions. Thank you stone!!"
"One of the best beers I have ever had. It is rare that I give a beer at 5 star rating, but I simply cannot find anything wrong with it whenever they make a new batch."
"Enjoyed 44 days after brewing, so this isn’t quite as fresh as Stone had intended."
"I've had many iterations of this long running IPA series. Six in total, ranging from 10.31.14 to 10.31.16. My favorite was 04.20.15 which was had the best overall aroma and flavor. My rating of 4 is the combined score from all six I logged on untappd. In my opinion, this serious has run over due. It was a great idea, and they've proved their point. Its time to move on to bigger and better things."
"Enjoy by July 25. Wonderful Double IPA. enjoyed on the porch in July on a beautiful summer day, certainly that helps. Great color and aroma from the pint glass we drank from. Nice citrusy taste and great mouth feel. Was unable to get the 12/25/16 version though tried. Keep 'em coming."

Enjoy by 12.25.16 Unfiltered IPA. Virginia Brewery Prototype. 
The stone enjoy by's are always a bit different but I love them. For one that is easy to find this one should stand the test of time. The hops are great and probably one of my favorite west coast IPA's very nice and very smooth.
very good IPA nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to ipas of higher calibers such as focal Banger and heady topper than I'm used to. Tastes good smells good. nothing to write home about very well brewed beer and very fresh
Solid but doesn't hold up to the top East Coast IPAs.....at all
Look - Drank a 10/31 the other night and haven't put together my little notes for this until now.
Had the 7/4/16 version near the end of June. 
This series is extremely variable**
"For freshness sakes, not much out there on the shelves will be as fresh as this exquisite citrus and floral double IPA. Defying the laws of retail beer distribution, the Stone Brewing Company delivers this release with a label displaying an enjoy by date not far from when some lowly clerkboy stocked the beer. Now, I'm not sure why anyone would buy a case of 4 6-packs and not be able to drink all of it in one night but for such plebians it is probably recommended you stick to more layperson varieties such as Coronas which, from personal experience, can be drunk a good five years from purchase date (a single bottle half-drunk was found behind my fridge after cleaning out my condo and still tasted fine). However, if you're into a fresh boozy beer with a flavor of manufacturing plant still in the bottle you have the King right here."
"Definitely nice fresh hop character. Unfortunately bit of a sweet booze note to it as well but that is little tough to avoid in a beer this big. Definitely dank and resinous as advertised. Not a favorite but for a beer that is as available as this series, pretty damn good."
"On tap at Verona Inn. A truly remarkable IPA. This one stands out. Bursting with flavor and freshness, the taste really hits home and is evident on this one. Strong dank, resinous hop presence throughout. Unique in my opinion. Recommended."
javascript:void(0);
Had a few of these in the past couple weeks. I'm used to drinking a Treehouse or Trillium so my expectations were low for this but it was tasty and very drinkable!
"Had the 07/04/16 release. Golden beer with foamy white head. Sporadic lacing. The aroma is pine, grapefruit, mild tropical fruit and malt. Big hops flavor, citrus and pine, earthy and spice notes. Resinous mouthfeel and slight alcohol burn. Excellent beer overall."
"Picked up the 07.04.16 version and just a day late in my enjoyment: Poured into small chalice, color is straw gold, clear, nice bright white head with mainly fine bubbles, light flecky spots on the glass sides."
Pours a opaque orange color with a large fluffy white head. Excellent retention and moderate lacing.
"Had the Enjoy by 7/4/16 at the Poynt restaurant in Newburyport. The beer had a bright, murky orange appearance with some lacing and a thin ring around the glass. Excellent aromas of pine and citrus that really linger in the nose. Taste follows the nose with a bittersweet, citrus beer with plenty of hop flavors. Medium body overall and well carbonated. Overall, really nice beer, especially with its aromas and taste."
"7/4/16. Fantastic juicy, fruity, bready, well rounded IPA. The enjoy by series is truly a gem to find in my area. I would buy this again and again if I could."
Im going to keep my rating as is because that is for previous times....
Enjoying the Enjoy By 07/04/2016! Actually...enjoy sounds like an understatement. This IPA is fabulous!!
Rating 7/4/16
"Pours a very lightly hazy pale copper in color with a finger of white head. Very hoppy, pine, some citrus, and a bit of tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose and is hugely hoppy, the flavors are somewhat less distinct than the aromas but tropical fruits are more pronounced here but pine and citrus are still present. I get a bit of booze here as well but it's not unexpected given the 9.4% ABV. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied and moderate carbonation. Overall a very good beer but I will say that I found it far more enjoyable straight from the bottle as opposed to from a glass."
07.04.16
"Over 3 days, I've had 3 of these already. I think that says a lot. Looks damn near perfect for a DIPA: bright, golden amber body, mostly transparent, with a foamy 2 finger head. Head dissipates down to a thin layer of foam and a little swirl of the glass stirs up a surprisingly thick layer of foam. Even the last couple ounces still produce more head than some beers I've tried when first poured! Smells of strong, bitter citrus fruits and a hint of pine. Taste is predominantly grapefruit, tangerine, orange, and lemon. I'm getting both the juices and the rind of each fruit flavor. There's some strong pine bitterness buried beneath all the citrus fruit, and a little bit of candy like sweetness way in the background. This is a great marriage of sweet and bitter, really embraces the west coast style of strong bitterness and is much more balanced than some of the east coast DIPAs I've had. Feel has a really nice drying effect from the hop oils, and feels full bodied and with medium carbonation. The one downside of this beer is it gets the tiniest bit harsh as it warms. I drank one relatively quick and the next day let it sit a little longer, and the last few swallows of the one left to sit out had a much more noticeable alcohol presence. Otherwise, this is an awesome DIPA and I'll be on the lookout for the next batch."
"Look: Golden, with a large head that slowly dissipates. Good lacing as well."
"Extremely drinkable, light IPA that is perfect for summer time! Delicious!"
"Reviewing the Fourth of July 2016. On tap: pours a clear, honey-golden body with a bright white head with good retention. Aromas are lively and potent: huge hops are predominantly citrusy with a healthy dose of pine, and tropical fruit notes like pineapple and papaya feature strongly as well. On the palate initially sugary and pineapple juicy before an electric jolt of hippiness rattles the mid-palate. Finishes with a nice fruit-salad like quality, with some hop oil lingering to remind you of the beat down delivered by the bitterness. A fantastic beer."
A fucking tasty fresh brew.
"Smooth, full-bodied, with fresh intense hops leaning toward the citrus end. Fresh, well-balanced, and full of flavor."
"Not a big fan. It was good, but not great. Put this in line with so many other double ipas. Big hop presence with bitterness. The High abv is not present."
Enjoy By 7.4.16
"I have never been one for following suggestion. @stonebrewingco said I should enjoy this by 7.4.16. I said no. I will enjoy this right now. And just that I did. Forget all the stuff I could go into. The appearance? Beer. After that, everything else is just hops, on hops, on glorious and magnificent hops! The nose hits you in the face like there is a little mysterious being inside this beverage showering you with a firehose of lupulins. It completely covers your palate in delicious hop flavors like glitter off a strippers tits. At that point you're done. You know how it finishes? Hops. It's fresh. It's smooth. It's all things Stone. I suggest they change the name to ""Enjoy by tomorrow"" because that's about how long this should last in your fridge. #reviewsofbrews #stone #stonebrewery #stonebrewing #stonebrewingco #stonebrewingcompany #beer #hops #humuluslupulus #ipa #stoneenjoyby #stoneenjoybyipa #stone20"
"Stone is back in WI and I get to have my first ever Enjoy By! 7.4.16 bottled about a week ago. Poured 12oz bottle into snifter. A clear dark gold with streams of bubbles ascending to the 3 finger white pillowy head. Retention is amazing and leaves a cap with very thick lacing on my glass. Aroma is very fruity with some nice citrus and dank hops. Sweet tropical notes. Flavor is more tropical and juicy with faint notes of bubblegum and a bitter finish. Feel is medium with an oily feel, but slightly dry on the finish. I had no idea this was close to 10% ABV! What a treat, glad to finally try one."
Great beer but the price is a little out of order. Picked up a sixer of Luponic distortion at the dame time for about half the $. Stone has some great beers and many just good beers. If you can find it and justify the price check it out.
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle dated as bottled 5/28/16.
This beer does not disappoint! Make sure you get this beer!
Enjoy by 4/20/16 Bomber drank on 4/20/16. A great Enjoy by when wonderful tastes through out the whole experience. This has a dank piney citrus taste that is enjoyed in so many ways. It's a superb IPA and I'm glad Stone does this by keeping those fresh IPA's on the shelves.
Well I finally tried a Stone that I really liked. I think it helped that it was on tap and really fresh. Nice balance with citrus flavors but not much bitterness. I can't remember if it was tangerine but it was excellent nonetheless. The fact that this is a iipa really surprised me because it was extremely easy drinking. I tried it on tap in Champaign IL with my graduate so it was even that much better!
"Poured into a wide tulip glass. Big lacy white head, very much like a Belgian blonde. Big nose of grassy, earthy, and floral hops. The taste has much of the fruit and straight bitterness of their mix of hops. There is a slight green taste in the glass. Certainly a slick feel and syrupy amount of malt. The body is a little on the thinner side and carbonation medium at best. Neither detract anything from the beer; they allow the hops and all of their glory show through. This was the latest incarnation, 4-20-16. Each release seems to be close to the same recipe, IMO."
"4-20 IPA. Draught. I found this boring, flavor profile was typical west coast IPA, just stronger."

"4/20/16 version. Pours a golden color with an orange hue, clear with a half inch white head that leaves nice lacing. Smell is floral, pine and citrus. Taste is dominated by grapefruit, a slight sweetness, balanced by a hint of pepper, and then a bitter pine finish. Very dry mouthfeel, well carbonated. A very good beer."
05.04.16
Bottle. Byrne Dairy. 4:20 date
"Enjoy by 420. Poured a golden straw yellow with a hint of orange. Smells of floral and pine. Taste of grassy, floral and pine resin. A bit of citrus but it is really a afterthought in this one. Very earthy IPA. Very enjoyable. Excellent mouthfeel and finishes smooth and dry."
Pours a solid amber in color with a milky white head that lingers through the session. Heavy amounts of lacing present. 
"Have enjoyed by since 2012 atleast,always has a verh great consistency"
"Enjoy By 4.20.16, bottled 3.4.16, poured 4.9.16"
"The beer poured a lovely shade of golden, with one a crystal clear body. The head was a little small, barely measuring at one finger thick. The aroma was very dank, smelling of grapefruit and pine resin. The taste was superlative. I was blown away by the assault of the dank piney and citric hops strong enough to strip teeth enamel. The hops were backed by simple pale malts that provided just a touch of sweetness. This was a sticky hop bomb, and coated my tongue, and throat going down, providing a long lingering hop aftertaste. The alcohol was well hidden, making this very drinkable despite the near double digit ABV. This is an essential beer if you are a hophead. I thought I had already reviewed it before now, but I was wrong about that. You can bet this is going to be a go to purchase for me from now on."
"Up there with the best, one of the most wine-like beers I have ever tasted. "
Enjoy by 04.20.17
This is great smooth and hoppy I love ipa's and this is close to the top of my list.
4.20.16 version.
Enjoy By 04-20-16
"4.20.16 edition, enjoyed on 4.06.16"
bottled 3/15/2016
"This had a surprisingly light body, which is really not what I wanted or expected from this. This was the first enjoy by that I have ever had, and maybe it's due to high expectations, but this beer fell short for me. Honestly I had this with another beer because I was like ""Really? This is it?"" and wanted to compare to something I've had multiple times before. After thinking about it though, I realized I just didn't like this much. It looks great, and smells even better, but the taste and mouthfeel were really lacking for me. I ended up pouring out probably 4-6 ounces of it."
Enjoy by 4.20.16. Poured on-tap at the Escondido brewery into tulip.
Enjoy by 04.20.16
"Golden pour with excellent clarity. A white viscous foam that leaves great lacing. The aroma is big. Dank, resinous, tropical fruit, pine, citrus. The taste follows exactly, with the tropical fruits really coming to the fore. The body is full with a moderate-high carbonation. A dry, boozy, bitter finish. Really fantastic."
"Smooth, like peanut butter mixed with velvet."
Never had this series until now. 4/20/2016 IPA series. 
"The 4-20-2016 is delicious....beautiful clear IPA hue, aroma and taste."
12oz. 04.20.16 bottled on 03/15/16
Wonderful beer
"A fantastic IPA from Stone, with a wonderful hops profile. I'm guessing the West Coast-style cascade strain is in here. Good citrus that don't overdo it on grapefruit flavors like some others."
"Two week old Enjoy By 4.20.16 poured from bottle into snifter. Pours a gorgeous, clear gold with a thin white head that becomes a collar rather quickly. The lacing is spotty and webbed. Aroma is one area where Enjoy Bys typically shine and this is no exception. A lively bouquet of grapefruit, honey, malt, and citrus. The flavor is hop forward but does so mildly, with a round finish consisting of more grapefruit, melon, earth, and rich malt. The finish is wet and clean with a long bitter touch. The hops are not overdone and mix well with the rest of the palate. A great IPA."
"Poured from a bottle not even 2 weeks old all the way over here in Beaumont, TX. 4/20/16 version woo hoo! Pours a slightly hazy medium gold ale color with the tiniest bit of carbonation. Smell is piney resin drops of dank if that makes any sense, and the taste follows suit with a bold refreshing flavor that quickly opens up your pallet but hides the 9+% deviously well. For some reason it wasn't kept refrigerated by HEB. Great job Stone, concept is a very welcome one in this craft beer market where many a retailer overstocks, ruining beers in the process."
I have had this man times before...but revisiting on Easter Sunday. Damn. This is really good. I can't think of a better DIPA regularly distributed in a bomber. Even better that it has come down in price in NorCal...bombers are now $5.99. Can't beat the QPR. Tasty for days!
"4.20.16 good date choice guys. its a little sweeter, not quite as dank or funky this time, but really nice. did the abv go up a hair maybe? either way this is always excellent and deserves all the praise it gets. big ups to stone's marketing team or whoever came up with the title and concept. what a good idea."
4.20.16
"Pours a golden yellow, which is quite lovely. Head is foamy and white and retains well. Lacing is tight and everywhere. Tangerine, citrus, and dank hops form a juicy, hoppy aroma. Nice juicy dank and piney hop flavors with a bit of citrus and tangerine to back it up. Good balance, which leans on the bitter hoppy side. Mouth feel is a bit harsh on the carbonation side, but otherwise manageable. Not as full as other IPAs either. Overall, a good solid IPA. Didn't deliver as well as I thought it would (my first Enjoy By), but it's still quality. "
Enjoy By 04.20.16 bottled 03.15.16
Poured a nice golden color into my snifter glass. The nose is perhaps a little muted but there is some soft citrus aromas coming through. The taste is better than the nose showed with strong citrus and tropical flavors going on here. The mouthfeel is smooth but there is a little bit of alcohol burn in the back of this. And since this was really fresh it is a better than average beer.
"4.20 Honestly when I cracked it I hated it. Syrupy sweet finish. It killed it for me. Fortunately as this warmed up it came around in a big way.The warm citrus hops came through beautifully. Big IPA and delicious, among the best."
"4.20.16, opened the first bottle a couple weeks ago, this is holding up fine with a couple weeks before the EB date."
"4-20-16. As I've come to expect from this series..., a great looking, smelling and tasting IPA from Stone. Crystal clear, an inch of head, wonderful lacing. Tropical and citrus hops, a sturdy enough malt backbone and just enough bitterness in the finish. Love it."
"Crystal clear gold pour with a white head that leaves a moderate amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is grapefruit, pine and malt sweetness. The taste is grapefruit, peppery mango and massive piney hops. There is a nice sweetness and this lingers with the finishing bitterness. This is a quite tasty beer."
"Pours a clear gold straw color with thick white head and bubbly residual lacing. Nose is mostly hoppy.Taste follows with some bitterness and some alcohol creep. Goes down smooth with moderate carbonation. A beautifully unbalanced, high octane IPA -undeniably Stone."
12/25/15
Really good DIPA from stone and commend the effort to get it as fresh as they can across the whole distro areas. solid tropical and tangerine nose and flavors.
pours light orange with one finger head. nose is nice orange and tangerine. medium carbonation. I get some orange rind mid to late pallate with nice bitter finish. juicy at the end of the sip making my cheeks pucker. nice beer with nothing overpowering. better than some but I wouldn't place it in the top tier of iipas.
"Enjoy by 02.14.16. Poured into a tulip glass. Hazy golden yellow. Copious white head and extensive lacing. Strong citrus notes. I smell grapefruit. Smooth taste. Hops are there but not bitter. This is the definition of ""juicy"" in an IPA. Amazing!"
"Nice, golden hue with a good head; I can see floating sediment and evidence of the lack of filter. I love the sweet smell with a hint of orange. It has a full-bodied, yet light flavor. Can't taste the alcohol at all, but I can definitely feel it. Nice, hoppy taste. Will definitely enjoy again."
"A unique DIPA. No cloying maltiness fighting with forward hops, just a clean malt presence undergirding a terrific hop bite. This is a goto DIPA, and one for the ages."
"Enjoy by 4/20/16, bottled 3/16/16. Enjoyed 3/21/16."
Enjoy by 2/14/16 - poured from a bomber bottled 1/9/16 into a tulip on 1/24/16
"Very smooth. It delivers the alcohol in the taste, but still very good. Fantastic aftertaste. I would drink again, but in a limited fashion as it delivers a punch."
Great beer! I was looking forward to this for a while I have the Black IPA as well I will review soon. This beer has all of the citrus taste and smell with a tad bit of caramel and a big grapefruit note. I don't believe anyone will be disappointed. Thumbs up to Stone I don't care if they are getting on the unfiltered bandwagon this beer is good! Look for my black IPA review soon.
Still drinking the 12/25/15 batch... part of the reason is that it isn't for me.... more bitter than I like a golden color to it and more of a dank smell that I really enjoy.
World class for a reason. No doubt the freshest beer I've had (except at the local brewerys). I could pick this one out of a crowd of IPAs any day.
"I am really not that big on IPA's anymore but this is an awesome beer. The ABV is a plus, very smooth, and great hoppy flavor."
"Friend gave me several bottles because, you know, they were outdated. This was still a first class imperial IPA. The hop character was unique, exceptionally dank, and outstanding. No complaints at all. So if you are well past the date.... don't throw it out. Give it to me."
"For such a readily-available beer, this one is never a letdown. A classic within the style from a brewery that is known for producing many, high-quality IPAs, Enjoy By is based on the premise of drinking hop-forward beers as soon as possible. When consumed before the enjoy by date, this beer is juicy, full of tropical aromas and flavors."
Fantastic beer
"9/13/13, 2/14/15, 4/20/15, 7/5/15, 4/20/16"
"Pours clear golden with a thin off-white top that clings a bit. Aroma is really nice, even though I'm 6 days late! Lots of tropical fruit mixes with a caramel malt. Similar in flavor, a nice malt backbone smooth a never-overwhelming blast of fruity and citrus hop flavors. Finishes slightly dry and slightly bitter."

Great ipa very crisp and bright with a hint of bitterness followed by a nice piny biscuit undertone and finished with a fresh citrus....excellent beer
"Perfectly hopped IPA, dark golden with small creamy head. Piney hops with a hint of citrus, smooth malt backbone and slick mouthfeel. Mild dry bitterness lasts on the tongue. Excellent! Rated: 2-4-14, 12-26-14, 4-20-15, 7-4-15, 10-31-15, 12-25-15"

"Enjoy by 12/25/15, opened on 12/19/15. Good carbonation. Crystal clear, straw color. The aroma is good, but not as strong as it should be for this kind of beer. Tons of hop flavor as well as bitterness, but balanced very well. The balance extends to the after taste as well. ABV is well hidden. "

"For an Imperial IPA, you can really taste the Hops. This beer is awesome!"
12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. 
"One of my favorite IPA's. I get this every time it comes around. Excellent balance, very fresh (as expected). A great concept by Stone, and it seems to work every time."
"Substantial clarity, looks professional as can be. Even manages almost a full inch of head on it, something amazing given the massive amount of hops/hop oil here."

"Bomber bottle labeled 10-31-15, so I tasted it approximately one month past its ""best""."
"Golden and clear. Eggshell head. Piney dank aroma grapefruit, some caramel. Taste is so dank piney and citrusy. Then caramel sweetness and a hint of alcohol followed by a lasting bitterness. Medium body and medium carb. Still my favorite west coast iipa."
"12-25-15 Interesting beer to say the least! The 1st glass was fresh & crisp with no noticeable ABV and it almost resembled a ""session"" beer because of it's drinkability. SCARY because it is actually 9.4%! 2nd glass was with spicy food and it held up to it fantastically. This beer shines tremendously with the addition of food. The hops are clean and cut through perfectly with out being overbearing. This is a beer that seems OK until you get further into it then it shines. Excellent and a perfect spicy food paring!"
"Enjoy by 10.25.15 is another exceptional beer from Stone! Stone continues to consistently put out great beers and I am looking forward to their opening their new brewery in Richmond, VA."

"A clear golden color, with a small head. Clusters of small rapidly rising bubbles makes it all come alive. "
"drinking 12.25.15, pours a clear orange color, good foamy head that lasts a decent amount of time. smell is pine and resin through and through, nothing tropical here. smell follows the taste exactly: resin and pine, pine and resin, resiny pine, and piney resin, with a dry malt backbone. definition of a great bitter hop bomb ""west coast"" IPA. mouth feel is great, but I wouldnt expect any less from Stone. great beer when it's around, was my favorite Stone brew until I tried Thunderstruck."
Superb IPA!
Pours sap with a ring.
Stone is quickly becoming a great go to fall back beer when I cant get trillium or tree house. Love how available it is and how solid it is. This was enjoyable.
Great IPA very smooth and hoppy love the finish
"Stone always has solid brews. There regular IPA used to be my go to, but with so many brews out there it's difficult to stick with just one."
Clear rich gold with two fingers of ten minute white head. Lacing is plentiful.
Pour: On draft at Smoke and Barrel in D.C. Poured into a tulip glass. Appearance: Deep amber. Clear. Good looking white head with lacing present. Aroma: Slight hop and juicy citrus...very subtle. Taste: Pepper up front. Anise-like licorice. Juicy hop and citrus on the back. Warming alcohol. Aftertaste: Huge anise kick lingers then recedes into a warming and juicy AIIPA. Overall: Very good - 4 out of 5.
Enjoy By 10-31-15
"Super clean. I think it is a smart move by Stone brewing to impose a rule that this beer be enjoyed as fresh as possible to taste what the brewmasters intended: a bright, explosive ipa that leaves you waiting for the next release."
Pours a translucent yellow/orange with one finger head. Aroma of sweet grapefruit and papaya with pine and bready malts. The taste follows the nose. Mouth feel is light to medium and super clean with not trace of the 9.5%. an excellent double IPA
Enjoy by 10.31.15
"Very pale in appearance. Not much head. Sweet hoppy aroma. The taste is bitter up front but mellows into a sweetish lime aftertaste. Not my favorite Stone offering, but certainly an enjoyable beer. I'd order it again."
"Enjoy by 10.31.15. Pours the typical, crystal clear west coast style. A light golden honey color with an off-white, eggshell color. The smell is super fruity and tropical, guava, peach, pineapple, onion and garlic sweetness, mango, marijuana dankness, pine, grapefruit rind, honey malts. Nice balance and a great aftertaste, not too bitter. Its like drinking the leftover juices from the fruit salad deluxe from a company christmas party. Lots of tropical fruit, pineapple, mango, passionfruit, guava, citrus, dank resinous qualities, bubblegum, candied orange, clean malt sweetness. Haven't had this beer for a while but it was a great reunion. Only picked up a single 12 oz. bottle but its enough to hold me over until the next batch comes around."
"L-Pours a gorgeous golden-orange color with a two finger, bone white head with great retention and copious, sticky lacing. Beautiful appearance. Nearly perfect."
"A great tasting IPA. A fresh citrusy taste with some piney notes. Clean, fresh feel and taste, very enjoyable with my pizza! It pours a nice clear deep yellow. Tastes great as I watch Dancing with the Stars with my wife."
"I had this on tap at mellow mushroom. The look wasnt my favorite, translucent golden collor, just a bit light. Flavor and aroma were strong on the hops as you might expect, lots of pine flavor, pretty good. Mouthfeel was full but not too harsh, pretty good considering the strength of the beer actually. Good, but maybe a bit overrated here."
L - Very light Amber not much head
"Draft pour at the Bulldog in Baton Rouge. Typical West Coast appearance with nice not great grapefruit, maybe orange pith aroma. Extremely well balanced hop followed by sweet flavor. Suprised that it wasn't more of a hop bomb. Really enjoyed the beer but was expecting to be blown away I guess. Edges out Ruination 2.0 as my new fave Stone offering"
"I've had this beer before, about 2 years ago and really loved it. This review is enjoy by date of 10-31-15. Pours with a small white head and golden color. Nose is hoppy, fruity, some tartness, pine. Lovely. Taste is tangerine, hops, resin, grapefruit and orange pith, and tropical fruits. Very little alcohol detected. Finish is rather dry and begs for another sip. Hard to believe this beer is 9.4%. Wonderful balance between the hops and malts. Usually, with high abv DIPA's, I always seem to notice some green onion and garlic. Not here. Very impressed and this might possibly be the tastiest Stone offering I've had."
"Picked up a six pack while in New York State. Enjoy by 10.31.15. The reputation of this series precedes itself, so I had to buy while I saw it. Served at cellar temperature into a pint glass. Bottled September 24, 2015 and Enjoyed October 20, 2015."
"Sampled on 10/20/15, bottle date 9/24/15. Poured from bomber into Spiegelau IPA glass. Beautiful in appearance, a translucent dark orange with a voluminous snow-white head despite a somewhat tentative pour. The aroma from the bottle was piney, but once into the glass the hop presence was muted. On the palate, some sweetness up front followed by a bitter, resinous finish. There seemed to be a lot of hop oiliness and bitterness without much of the actual hop flavor. Too close to the enjoy-by date? I don't know. Not the hop bomb I was expecting, but a pleasant enough offering and very (too?) drinkable for the high ABV."
"10-31-15 edition, 12 oz. bottle"
22 oz bomber poured into a lagunitas glass.Smell is a citrus smell with oranges and grapefruit coming across.The taste is very Hoppy with a lot of Bitterness.I thought it was alright but nothing special.I didn`t find anything great about it but i`m glad I tried it.I`ve had 3 different Enjoy beers now and to me they seem to be all over the map.Give it a try and see what you think.It does have a nice ABV of 9.4 which will get the job done.
I had the 10-31-15 edition. 
"Wow the reviews are low on this. Near perfection in my book. Nose is tropical fruit, pineapple smoothie, and the taste is a glossy hop coating of citrus bitterness with a slight frankness on the finish. No onion and really not much noticeable alcohol."
"Poured into IPA glass. The color is a pretty golden yellow with a thick, white head and lacing. The smell is a very nice - floral, hoppy, pine, with abundant grapefruit and sweeter fruits. The taste really follows the nose. Dry, bitter, biting, with both grapefruit and sweeter fruit. This is a classic West Coast IPA: big, bold, bitter, hoppy, and delicious! It is pleasantly carbonated and easy to drink. This is a great IPA!"
07.04.16
"Delicious, smooth flow. Very silky."
"Looks exactly how you want an IPA to look. Copper color, big white head, excellent lacing. Nose is big, fresh, piney hops. Flavor is similar; big, fresh, piney hops. Not surprisingly, the malt is almost nonexistent. Not a balanced beer, but a delicious hop bomb, as I'd expect from Stone. Maybe not the most complex IPA I've tasted, but a tasty one. Really a delicious, fresh, brew. Would have again."
"Yes! Was only able to obtain 2 bottles, so I shared one with my drinking buddy. Wowzer!"
"Bomber. 10-31-15 batch. Pours clear bright copper orange, thick white head, great retention and gobs of lace. Great looking brew. A lot going on in the aroma, floral and fruity, pine notes, touch of alcohol. Very clean taste of toasted malt, resiny pine and flowers. Balanced well but leaning on the sweet side, a little different than I recall the earlier batches which I believe we're more dank and hop forward. But could just be my palate after so many great DIPAs. Mouthfeel is thin to medium but slippery. Semi dry finish, bitterness lingers just right amount, tad of alcohol comes out. This is a very good DIPA that's readily available when it hits, always have to try it."
"One of the best releases of Enjoy By in a long time! Delightfully aromatic, very smooth and coats your tongue like Mad Hatter IPA. Nice hoppy finish, not overpowering in any way"
"Overrated. Similar to all their other hoppy offerings, but always fresh."
Poured cool from a 12 oz bottle into a dogfish head goblet glass. 
"February 5th, 2015 - This is a question I keep asking myself and never look up: do the Stone Enjoy By recipes change for each date? At this point I like living in ignorance. It's a test to see if I can detect differences between the iterated brews. As for the 2.14.15 version, it begins with a fresh and lightly dank aroma, laced with pineapple and gratuitous amounts of grapefruit. In other words, the hops aroma is strong and insistent, and coupled with a lovely and gentler taste. Both sweet and hoppy, the aroma's pineapple dimension makes a grand return, fruity and sweet, and decorated with an orange slice. In many ways it reminds me of a tiki drink disguised as a beer, which covers several of my favorite dimensions in the drinking world."
The 10/31 enjoy by does not stack up to previous releases. Won't waste my money on this again.
The beer comes in a deep gold to pale amber.
I don't know what everyone else is drinking but this beer is delicious. I don't usually give into the hype but this beer delivers.
This is quite a beer. The smell is fresh dank piney grapefruit hops. Some noticable onion smell. The taste is a bit sweet wih some bitter citrus. Very flavorful and the alcohol is well hidden. nb
Enjoy By 10.31.15
"Nice strong beer, lots of flavor and alc but it's kind of expensive. It's about $3 for a 12oz bottle which would make you think i'ts up there with the big dogs well it might be for lots of people but not for me maybe it's because I haven't much high alc tolerance but it just seems like the overall it's something that doesn't fit my agenda. I like by beer a little easier to drink since I live where the climate is hot most of the time so I appreciate something that is not as strong so it goes down easy and I can cool off. It's good to have at least once though to get a feel for robust beer which in my opinion this is."
"Look: Perfectly clear golden-colored beer with a perfect white head that dissipates into a thin film. Not much lacing, but a solid appearance nonetheless."
Lovely beer. Nice taste. Enjoyed it a lot. I now know why hella people love this beer!
Phenomenal fresh balanced IPA
Excellent finish. 7/4/15 was slightly better in my opinion
"Pours a clear golden color with a thick white fluffy head that lingers with excellent lacing. Just about the perfect look for a dipa. Smell is very aromatic with the obvious hoppy floral you would expect with hints of spice and onion like notes. The taste hits right away with hops and bitterness. Some maltiness as it warms, but not quite as much as you might expect. The feel is spot on with a creamy initial feel and slight carbonation. Overall this is a stone beer with plenty of hops but it drips right off into the bitterness and I would hope for a bit more complexity. Not dissapointing but not the best I've had."
10-31-15 E.B
Very good and grapefruity (but I don't know which one this was)
"I had the 07.04.15 edition of the IPA. Not my favorite IPA, but a great go-to drinkable beer. Very clear golden color and good balance of hops. Curious to see if there is much variation from date to date."
22oz bomber poured into pint glass bottle date 9.25.15
"Pours a honey / light Amber color. Has aroma of citrus peel & resin. Flavor is citrusy and piny. Good balance with a nice aftertaste of hops. Overall pretty good IPA, I enjoyed it"
Semi hazy light orange. White head
First time reviewer here...
"Went to the store looking to get a 4 pack of Double Jack and came out with a six pack of Stone Enjoy by 10.31.15 instead - cost a little over $18 after taxes. I will start off by saying Enjoy By has always been hit or miss for me. Anyway, onto the categories"
Poured into pint glass
Enjoy By 10/31/15
"10.31.15 edition. The beer comes in an orange color. The aroma is mostly malt. The taste is sweet malt, ripe cantaloupe, and honeydew. The best batch I've had so far and my favorite beer from Stone."
10/31/15
10.31.15 batch.
"I have had an opportunity to try a few versions of this beer. Coloring is a light gold and pretty much see-through as the beer is well filtered. The hop aroma is very strong from the start (when opening the bottle). There is a decent amount of citrus with added spices (maybe cracked pepper-basil combo?). There is some malty sweetness but it is not overpowering at all. Overall this is a great offering from Stone; fresh, hoppy beer!"
Enjoy By 10.31.15 bottled on 9.26.15 and consumed on 10.01.15
L: Golden orange
LOOK: Bright golden hue beautiful color
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a crystal clear tangerine hue, with a thick, two finger white head rapidly rising, and receding leaving moderate lacing. The nose of this beer is truly singular. Dank, aromatic hops, with citrus undertones - tangerine most prominently. The palate of this beer follows the nose, with a thick, dryly hopped forepalate being mellow by a sweetly piny orange-fruit finish. Palate is middle of the road and complements the beer tremendously. An exceptional IPA. Balanced, even in its extremity. A world-class representation of the style."
"Whatever you think of this beer--and I think, like many others, it is a consistently outstanding West Coast IIPA--you must give it credit for advancing the (national) conversation on freshness in the style. It'd be an all-time classic for that reason alone, but it also happens to be a great beer. Stone has done real public service with this offering, in more ways than one."
7/4/2015
Dank. As. Fuuck.
"Writing my first ""Add Beer"" here on my Birthday for this beer, well, Enjoyed By 09.02.15! While there is another category for the larger ""Enjoy By"" series, it is my belief that each one is different, so that is why I am reviewing this particular one. That, plus it's my birthday!"
"Pours a clear golden-orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, tropical fruit, earth, and slight herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet citrus juice, citrus zest, tropical fruit, berry, and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with fantastic fruit forward hop characteristics that make this one a treat to drink. Great job, Stone!"
"Really enjoyable fresh beer that sings of hop aroma, citrusy and floral. Berry notes on taste (slight) and orange as well. Sessionable and tasty."
Pours amber with a nice looking frothy two finger head that leaves a good amount of lacing. 
"L: brilliant amber, 1” head dissipates to film S: big grassy nose T: Starts rich and creamy with some malt and then an overwhelming hop presence rises up, very well developed. Some malt sweetness in the background, A little pepper, very grassy palate, the hops are intense but not harsh, very mellow F: Creamy, medium to medium full body, medium carbonation. O: The hops flavors are a treat. The combination of intensely grassy hops over sweet malts is marvelous."
"I had the "" By 09/02/15 batch. Fantastic! Wish I could get the recipe and try brewing this myself. Awesome as e freshness just jumps out!"
"I was expecting quite a bit from this one going in - considering it was a pain to find in my area at the time - and I think it delivered. Loved the malty profile and the sweet, almost tropical notes to it, great hoppy finish. Medium body, soft carbonation. Surprisingly well balanced. I wish I'd picked up more of it!"
"Stone doesn't make my favorite style of IPA, but they do make a damn good one, and the Enjoy By series is one of their rare moves that goes beyond gimmick (unlike the Enjoy Afters) and guarantees a fresh IPA. So yeah, not much here that you can't get from their regular IPA or even the Arrogant Bastard which are both easy enough to find, and popular enough that, due to high turnover at most beer shops, you shouldn't have trouble finding a fresh one. But it does have nice holiday coincide-ance so you can say, ""Hey look I'm drinking the 7/4 bottle on Independence Day!,"" but at that point we're going back to gimmick-mode, which Stone does quite a lot of."
"Listen to the label. Outstanding fresh, not so much after the date."
This beer is everything and more ! The best word I could use to describe this beer is Dank ! It has a earthy hemp like smell and a hoppy taste that complements that wonderful aroma.
"650ml bottle from BottleDog, London (£15):"
"Enjoyed two weeks AFTER the said date (7-4-15) but was still good. Tons of danky grapefruityness, orange, earthy/herbalness. Typical Stone bitterness. Can't wait to try next time around when it is fresh!"
At long last this bad boy is finally in my hands..
"For this particular tasting, I am sampling the 07.04.15 batch. After breaking the seal on the 22 oz. bomber, a smell that is uniquely Stone engulfs the room: a former roommate of mine would probably call it “dank” and I wouldn’t necessarily disagree (keep in mind that he also used this word to refer to girls, burritos, parties, and – as expected – weed). Citrus fruit and pine resin quickly follow the initial fragrance of fresh-cut grass. At first sip, hops and booze smack your palate (in the playful bad-girl way that a Las Vegas stripper smacks a bachelor). Fortunately, the 9.2% ABV brew is balanced by its earthy character and fruit-forward nature, so the bitterness does not overwhelm. So Crisp. So Delicious. So Fresh. So Clean. ♫ –♫ — ♫. Time to listen to some Outkast and relish in the genius behind this beer."
So.. i have had many stone enjoy by... and the 12/25/15 is my favorite so far.. more tropical than the previous which i thought were more piney but still awesome... i like them all.. great job Stone!
"From a nice cold 07/04 15. What can i say but fabulous. The nose was Pine and citrus all the way,a wonderful thin white creamy head."
A very fun beer! It changes so from opening til the last sip. I had trouble identifying the hop content. I will buy again!
"7.4.15 Poured in a Spiegelau glass. Clean, hoppy, balanced, citrusy, prolly one of the best IPA's around. Can't go wrong with Enjoy by and this one is the best yet! Better and better!"
Bomber of 7-4-15 opened a few moments before the 5th! Almost spoiled..phew.
"7/4/16 variety. Look is golden With slight orange tint. Taste is malty, fruity with a bitter finish. Solid IPA just not one of my favorites. Happy 4th"
"7.4.15 -- An incredible beer. Thank you, Stone."
"This is one of my favorites, ever since I have had it. A great DIPA/IIPA. Something about the first sip always turns me off a little bit, maybe that is done on purpose. After that it is nothing but sweet and blissfully harmony. When I see these at the store (and the date occurs in the future) I generally buy all the bottles I can."
"This is the benchmark for all IPAs in my opinion. It has everything going for it: dank hops, sweet malt, great mouth feel, and 9.4% ABV. What more could you possibly want from an IPA?"
stone enjoy by from a 12 oz bottle
A wonderful hop/resin taste. The taste is a piney malty taste; when really it is a heavy IPA. Well done.
"Great hop flavors of citrus, pine and a touch of resin. Just a hint of sweetness but not enough to interfere with the hops. A touch of stone fruit. Lingering bitterness, appropriate for the style."
"Seriously good.. Sweet, piney, fresh. Alcohol is so well hidden. It's a damn good IPA. Great work Stone!"
Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. 
"Enjoy By 7.4.15 - This poured a slightly translucent copper colour with a finger thick white head that dissipated into small islands fairly quickly. The nose obviously screams hops with a earthy pine taking the lead, followed by floral and citrus notes. There is some caramel malt around the edges trying to fight it's way though with minimal success. Now on the taste those malts do come forward but are still surrounded by pine resin and citrus fruits and finished with a even bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice and makes the beer quite refreshing. Looking forward to having this again."
Bomber of 7/4/15
Enjoy by 7/14/15. Amazing IPA with citrus and floral hops.
The enjoy by by Stone is solid. However.... my biggest complaint with this highly- distributed beer is that it taste totally different on tap than in a bomber. When the experience is that different between a bottle and bar... I'll take my $$$ somewhere else. If you see it on tap... go for it...! On the shelf... knock it off the list... but I could put that $8-$10 to so much better use...!
"Enjoy By 07/04/15. This is a complex IPA. Large gulps taste of caramel and oranges with a floral hint. Smaller, contemplative, sips reveal a resinous bitterness."
Solid IPA .Would buy again .
To be clear this is for 7.04.15.
"At downtown World of Beer 6.24.15, on tap. This beer has more than three weeks of life left on it!!"
Tasted similar to 90min but not quite as good
Yes..yess..yesss..yesss..yessss
"Enjoy by 7.4.15. Great floral nose and a little sap in mine. Color a nice light copper. Taste, delicious. A little sweet as it warms but Has a nice long lasting after taste of citrus, mouthfeel very light. 9.4abv non detectable. Really glad I got to try it as its my first stone enjoy by. Cheers!"
"APPEARANCE - 2FH that dissipates, foamy, lacing, amber, hazy."
Citrusy and floral hops. Sweet beer and surprisingly light for a 9.4% beer. This can be enjoyed all year. Dear God this beer is so damn good. Wish I could get a case of it.
Enjoy it now. Amazing clearly one of the best
Best IPA I have ever had and I don't like IPA.
Enjoy by 07/04/15
"A: Clear burnt orange, pretty. Still- no carbonation. White head, moderate lacing."
"Hopefully I just got a bad batch, but this is the worst thing I have ever tasted. On tap at Point Blank Brewery."
Enjoy by 07.04.15. Delicious IPA. Glad I got one to try!
"Gorgeous, crystal clear, Amber body with a soapy white head. Sticky, clingly lace."
Amazing!! Bar none the best DIPA I've tasted!
By far one of the best beers I've ever had. Amazing.
Enjoy by 07.04.15 
"22oz bomber, Enjoy By 7/04/15, brewed 5/28/15 and consumed on 6/13/2015. Straw colored and the off white head lasts the entire time leaving behind layers of lacing. Aroma smells of light citrus, pine, and grass. Taste follows the nose with the pine and grass more noticeable. Smooth, almost a fluff feel, on the palate and quite drinkable for 9.4%. First time trying one of these enjoy by offerings and it was quite delightful."
"Awesome,rich, easy to drink need to get more"
"These ""Enjoy By"" offerings can be hit or miss. This one is a Grandmaster death blow. It is easily one of the best double IPA's that has ever passed my lips. The price is fair given the product. I'd suggest you seek this one out immediately because I doubt you'll see it available 10 days from now."
"Not my favorite beer, enjoy more hop aroma and flavor."
Best stone I have ever had! well worth the extra money!! 
"Exceptional. One of my favorite DIPA's. Better than a much harder to find beer here in NorCal, you know which one ;). Just my opinion. This beer is perfect to me. Will buy every release."
07.04.15 version - typical average tasting Stone DIPA
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, the ""enjoy by"" date is 7-4-15."
"I remember the days when enjoy by was exactly or very similar to what is described in it's description. This 7/4/15 batch is good, but not danky or very citrusy to say the least. Last batches ive had have been more malty and sweet than a bitter juice bomb like I would prefer. Still crisp and good, but does not live up to it's own description."
Enjoy By 7/4/15
Enjoy by 7/4/15
07.04.15 12oz bottle into a solo cup. 3rd Enjoy By release to pass my lips.
"Enjoy By 07.04.15, had one of these previously at the end of 2014. Says it is bottled on 5/28/15, so pretty dang fresh."
"On tap at Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock, VT in their snifter. Enjoy by 7/4/2015"
One of the most flavorful balanced beers from stone. Hop forward yet smooth. A true treat for any hop head. Buy as manyas you can afford
great taste. heavy on the front
"Deliciously dank, deliciously fresh, just plain delicious."
My top 5 beer choice. The gods have graced us with this beer pick.
Enjoy by 4-20-2017.Obviously these Enjoy By ratings need to be broken up by date. 
Tastes like hop syrup. And I like hop syrup.
West Coast is alive and well
"First sip wow what an amazing combination of flavors. I really liked the whole experience and worth the extra cost. Dank, citrusy and fruity with a finish with balance and no aftertaste negatives."
Far too hoppy for my palate.
Enjoy By 07.04.15. 
Very good brew hoppy fresh deliciousness
"If you like hops, you'll love any version of this... When i opened it i smelled it for about 2 minutes before even tasting it... the aroma alone will have you wanting more... Nice and Piney......"
Great beer very good citrus flavors a little grassy but I like it it's everything I look for in an ipa
"Citrus bomb! Mango, mango, mango.....crisp, hoppy, piney finish...this is a classic! This was the Enjoy By 3-14-15. So far every Enjoy By has a nice citrus base with a crisp, hoppy mouthfeel. I've also had the Enjoy by 7-4-15 which wasn't as juicy."
I had some Enjoy by 4/20/15 earlier this year in early April. Was able to pick up a bomber from the local Meijers. I am not a fan of this beer. It really did nothing for me. Aroma was blah. Taste was blah too. I tasted watered down.
Enjoy by 4-20 from the tap on 4-12 was my first experience. Did not disappoint one bit. Only offerings in my area were draft and bombers and by the time I had it all the bombers were gone. Don't let it pass you by.
This is an awesome beer!
"Seems right the dankest IPA they have made so far is set for 4:20, it also happens to be my birthday and there have been two before, each having a significant date for myself as the enjoy by - this is the third I've had and I'll be damned if it doesn't follow the third time charm (not to say the first two weren't awesome)."
Had the first release in 12oz. bottles 4/20-really enjoyed. Tried it in the 22 oz. and was a little disappointed(compared to the 12 oz.) Ive always enjoyed this beer but the 12oz. seemed to really capture the hop aroma and flavor. We won't talk about the price though-ridiculous
"Dank, but not over the top like some reviewers mention. Actually wanted MORE dank!"
One of my favorites. Simple clean smooth beer with tons of flavor.
Really enjoy this beer.
Enjoy by 4-20-15 on tap at the Charlotte Flying Saucer on 4-15-15. 
"Had this on 4/27, so as would be expected, the hop flavor was starting to head for the background. This brought forward a sweetness that was indeed ""devastatingly dank"". I'm not sure if it was the fact that I enjoyed ""after"" or just the beer itself, but this was a more than commendable addition to the Enjoy By series."
Fresh floral and citrus notes. Crisp bitter finish
"I can respect this beer AND see why folks like it, but I consider it average."
Great beer and love the other brews Stone has.
"4-20-15-- drank twice in two weeks, just before ""Enjoy By"" Date. Also had this on draft (different date) some time ago. One of the best IPAs I've ever had."
"Very good, smooth hoppy finish but not overpowering...full disclosure: drank 4/20 on 4/22"
4/20 enjoy by drank in a tulip
I got the 4.20.15 batch for review.
A- very clear golden color with a nice white head on top. 
Exceptional IPA. Great aroma. Full of flavor from start to finish. Highly recommended. Great beer from stone. 
Can't beat stone when it comes to solid IPAs
One of Stone Brewing best. Very good beer.
Falls off fast - was fantastic when it first got here but the one I had this week (still before 4/20) was not good but I look forward to the next round.
"04-20-15, most definitely dank"
refers to Enjoy By 4-20-15
"Tried ""Enjoy by 4/20/15"" and ""7/04/15"" versions. Most excellent across the board. Of all the standout characteristics the pungent, dank and floral aroma is at the top. Juicy, almost chewy IPAs that leave a long lasting resin and bitter feel in your mouth like a patented finishing move."
"Good but not great. Had the enjoy by 420 and it a typical west coast ipa, if that's your style. Seems to be a step behind pliny but overall a decent brew!!"
One of my all-time favorites.
"Enjoy By Pi (3.14.15), sadly sampled a little late, but still terrific. Nose could be more pungent, but excellent dry, pale-malt grainy notes mingle with floral sugariness and hints on limey pine. The color and flavor match the dexterity of the aroma, but with greater and more assured—though still ultimately mild and measured—intensity: pale, round golden-brown chromatics meet rich, grassy sugars and juicy, soft-touch hops, featuring notes of papaya, nasturtium, and hints of lemon-zest. "
Enjoy by 4.20.15. One of the best beers I have ever had.
"I've had many variants of this, this particular review is based on Enjoy By 4.20.15."
22oz. bottle split into two snifters.
"04.20.15 consumed on 04.11.15 so I get the freshness angle, but refrigeration is not to be overlooked when preserving IPA's. Nice lacing and good balance between the citrus and bitterness although sort of a sweet fruit forward in the front end. Taste of orange juice stands out in front and not as much ""devastatingly dank"" as advertised on the label. ABV seems well hidden. I'm not sure if î is really hidden or is it the Lupulin River I had a half hour before. Still a good but not great IPA."
It's alright. Not blown away by the 4-20
4.20.15 - my favorite enjoy by so far!
Bottle of 4-20-15 consumed on late night 4-11-15. That is five words!
"Room Service - San Francisco, CA - Bottle, ""Drink by 4/20/15"""
Enjoy by 4.20.15 
I had 4.20.15 for this one
had the Pie 3/14/15 and 4/20/15. both excellent beers. very fresh
It's a beautiful tasty beverage! Get it while you can!
"Pours amber, smells boozy with notes of grapefruit, citrus, sweet malts and hops. Tastes of dank bitter hops, and an aftertaste that hints back at the sweet citrus and bread. The hops are the defining characteristic. This is a bold IPA to be sure. Really an awesome imperial that lives up to the hype. I'll be looking for another sixer of this at the next release."
"L (4.25) - Lovely orange color and light fluffy head. Not crystal clear, but about right for a IIPA."
Poured 12oz bottle into snifter glass. 9.4% abv. 4/20/15 Version
Enjoy by 10.31.15
Absolutely amazing. Hop forward is an understatement. Amazing mouthfeel. Like a little citrus fairy couple dancing on my tongue!
Drinkable double
"2x IPA lover here -- this beer OVERRATED. After just having enjoyed a KBS and the pure enjoyment and understanding of such a finely crafted brew, I don't have any idea why folks are doing backflips over Enjoy By. Average all the way around... where's the taste distinction, brewmaster character, special note/feel/taste?!"
"Look – Thin, white head. Bright, golden translucent body. "
"Lots of hype and expensive, so you would expect the very best. Well its not the very best but its darn good. Enjoyable would be an understatement. This is a very fresh beer and I like it!"
Enjoyed 4.20 on 3.05.
Enjoy By 4-20-15
"In my opinion, this is about as good as an IPA can be (among the very best I've had to date). If you don't love strong and fresh hoppiness, don't get this. It is perfectly balanced hoppy deliciousness! I recently acquired a case of the 4-20-15 and I can't wipe the smile off my face. This beer is a grand slam!"
Enjoy by 4/20
Good beer makes me happy
"Potent aroma of citric, floral and grassy hops. Taste is so fresh like the hops are still floating in the beer. Bitter but not lingering bitterness on the tongue. This beer is smooth as it it but especially for a beer over 9%abv. Loved it and so did the people who shared it with me!"
Enjoy by 04.20.15
4.20.15 version. One of the best double IPAs out there.
This is the 4/20/15 enjoy by!
Enjoy By 4.20.15 expensive but very good.
4/20 this one is so good
Lately I have been getting a little obsessive about my beer being fresh. So when I heard about a beer that was made for very limited window like this one I knew I had to try it... 22oz bought from total wine on 4-2-15
"Love the flavor, aroma and feel. Outstanding!"
About 2 weeks after bottling and it's amazing. Smell is fantastic - floral and citrusy. Very smooth and clean. Surprised it's such a high alcohol content. Best DIPA I've had so far.
"It's a pretty good West Coast IPA, very Danky and has a nice clear look with a good head of foam. The citrus flavor is really there. Bottled 3-15-15 about 2 weeks out from today."
"This has to be my favorite IPA!!!!! Tried 2.14.15 for the first time when my friend shipped it to me from San Diego to Chicago (we like to trade beers). Picked up 4.20.15, and this IPA didn't let me down at all. After pouring into my glass, I noticed many good floral notes right away. Had a really nice, thick head on the beer, with a really nice amber color. The taste was really great as well. Pick up a really nice hoppy taste, as well as a nice citus grapefruit taste. Wasn't very bitter at all. With it being 9.4% alcohol, was very surprised at how smooth this beer is. Myself and my friends are now huge fans of this beer!!!!!"
Ratings for multiple versions 
Amazing! This review is for Enjoy By 4-20-15
"Amazingly beautiful gold color with a solid grapefruit nose. Obviously dry hopped with motueka, one of my favorite hops. It was more resinous out of a bottle but on tap it was silky. You don't get the bitter until 3 seconds after your sip. What a solid beer. Wish this was on tap all the time."
"I love this beer! So tasty! This is ""Enjoy by 4/30/15"". I know they vary a little but this particular one was NICE!"
"I am not enjoying this beer, but I don't know why"
"Delicious but has a strong alcohol taste. Probably the best smelling beer I've ever had. Thick, highly carbonated mouth feel."
"This beer was very smooth for an IPA... Can really taste the hops but definitely isn't over powering and taste fresh as all of Stone ""Enjoy By"" beers."
"Had the enjoy by 4.20.15 at Salty Pig. Love this concept. Beer is a typical big California IPA, but it is the freshness that stands out. Such a great beer. However if I had this on April 21st, I would never drink beer again, and curse Stone"
"On tap, at The Blue Monkey"
"I had the Enjoy By 4.20.15 about 2 weeks after it was bottled - WOW...what an amazing beer. Amazing west coast IPA smell: danky, piney and fruity. A very pungent aroma that leaps out of the glass. The taste lives up to the smell- a perfect balance of dank, tropical fruit and pine needles. There is a gumminess on the aftertaste that, along with the grapefruit, pushes the bitterness away. The only knock I had was that it's just a little boozy on the back end. I can't wait to try the next Enjoy By."
Great IPA for an IPA hater.
Wow.. Just pored a stone enjoy by 4.20.15. and it was world class. Nice color and lace and small head.. But enjoyed it throughly.. Gona get me some more!!!
Reviewing the Enjoy By 4/20/2015
Honey colored with light head. Truly dank hoppiness with a little sweetness at the end of the nose. Well balanced and easy drinking for a DIPA . Didn't punch me in the palate like I had expected
"4.20.15. Very good. Right on point with its price equivalents/ peers, sculpin and 90 min. I enjoyed it from a 6 and looking forward to the rest by 4/20."
4.20.15 great hop aroma with very smooth finish
4.20.15
4.20.15
"I admit that I have a hard time with big DIPAs like these, as the malt and booze just tend to dominate for me. So it is with Enjoy By, which still smells the part, and is by no means unappetizing, but can't reach the heights attained by more restrained brews. Huge Stone IPA lover, but this one is just too much (though I imagine they're absolutely fine with that)."
3-14-15 bomber poured into Rastal Harmony glass
"Seriously bitter hop head delight. Great floral aroma. West coast, hop centric piney flavor with no sweetness to get in the way of the hops. Lingering citrus-rind bitterness."
Enjoy By 4.20.15 - This thing smells as close to perfection as I'm allowed to believe is possible.
4-20-15
"This beer pours a nice translucent Orange with a Medium white head. The retention on this one is great, especially for a 9.4% brew. When it starts to dissipate, it leaves rings around the glass as you drink down. On the nose, wow, you can really tell there’s a lot of hops in this one. Mango, Pineapple, Orange and Tropical Fruits hit first, with a touch of Pine and Sweetness from the Malt on the finish. Whilst drinking this beer, the first thing you’ll notice is the bitterness from the word go. On the Palate lots of Pine, Citrus Peel and Tropical Fruit. This is definitely an IPA for warm weather, although it could also work in the colder months as that Alcohol is detectable but not overwhelming. On the finish there’s a few Grapefruit notes and a touch of sweetness from the Malt. The beer is surprisingly smooth, and although starts bitter and dry, finishes sweet with good carbonation."
4.20.15
4:20:15 bomber into pint glass.
"4.125/5. Really torn between the obvious dankness and the obvious skunkiness of 4-20. There is just enough ""Heineken green bottle"" going on to keep this out of the upper echelon. Great gobs of bitter and onion on nose but some sulfuric fartage on the end, which IMHO they did on purpose...but I digress..."
"4:20 version. I can tolerate the dank, onion, garlic, sweaty feet aroma. I just felt it was overly bitter and the hop profile was unable to effectively balance this monster imho."
Not worth all the hype
"This is an exceptional beer. When it comes to Stone's best, this is on par with Ruination, perhaps better. Without going too in-depth, I love the mix of tropical fruits and oniony, peppery, spicy characteristics. It did wonders to the palate, and it had me hoping for a limited edition bottle that includes a tongue scraper. Dank, delectable, and overall delicious. Like Daniel LaRusso and Ally with an ""I"", Stone and hops are a winning combination. Enjoy."
Enjoy by 4.20.15 in 12oz. bottles. Delicious!
bought a six pack of the enjoy by 4.20.15
Stone Enjoy By IPA: 04.20.2015. & 07.04.2015
"4/20 edition...Man, so good. They've all been good...to me, they take a couple weeks to hit peak flavor, but this one is great out of the gate. 6 packs?!?! One happy dude."
"Aroma is amazing. Very Hoppy, fresh, and straight up dank. Mouth follows with even fresher tasting hops and crisp delicious bomb. One of my favorite beers ever."
I have had too many bad ones of the enjoy by's to give them any better of a rating.
First sip 2/13/15 at home with John. Purchased at Whole Foods February 2015. Enjoy by 2/14/15.
"Great looking beer and the smell is like a bunch of IPA's rolled into one. I'm getting tropical fruits, berries, flowery a bit of that onion and grassy smell. NIce bite up front evolving into a slightly boozy, big hop bomb. Every smell is in the flavor leaving that tongue scrubbing bitterness and some warmth from the 9.4. I love how Stone has no reservations and just serves up a huge double IPA with a take no prisoners attitude. Not for a person that just wants to have session beers. This ones huge!"
3.14.15 very hoppy yet well rounded and refreshing even
"Hop heads delight, as it says on the bottle it is devistingly dank. Almost a palette wrecker"
"12 oz bottle, 420 enjoy by. Not as good as previous enjoy by's. Lacking a little in taste and a bit boozier than I remember. Still, a very good beer."
Enjoy by 4.20.2015. I have had several different enjoy by IPAs and this is by far my least favorite. Paid $7.99 at California Fresh Market.
"I really enjoyed this IPA, it has a real smooth taste even though it has a 9.4% alc/vol it is the 4/20 version. Will definitely have this again."
Great fresh ipa! Stone is the bomb!
This was a really nice IPA. It was very well balanced with a nice floral nose and good bitterness on the backend.
I will definitely try the next one a little sooner. Drinking the Enjoy By 3/14/15 on 3/12... Still a great beer but could be better. bit of an aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on. great feel and aroma.
"This one was an Enjoy by Pi Day. It i s an brilliantly clear golden color with a tremendous, towering white head. Aroma is of fresh hops. Flowers...pine, citrus peel. Wet earth and woods. The taste is intense. Alcohol warmth...sweet malt, and lots...lots... of hop flavor and bitterness. Spicy, peppery, resiny, citric, piney hops. Full in body. Intense and in your face. Excellent."
"can not believe this has such high ratings! This was GROSS! I would have to be wasted to drink any more! Bitter strong, horrible after taste. Not smooth!!"
Outstanding. One of my favorite IPA's. Usually get when available
"Well balanced throughout, not bitter, nice floral notes."
Bottle Enjoy By Date: 3.14.15
Love!!!! This beer is delicious.
A: crystal clear; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a thin collar; very nice lacing;
"Beautiful clear golden with a frothy white head. Aromas of onion, orange, pine and resin. I get a lot of oniony dankness on the palate, followed with some citrus and pine. Nice clean bitter finish."
I had the 3-14-2015 Enjoy By IPA
"Awesome idea, fresh delicious ipa with plenty of fruits and pine."
The 4 .20.15 is better than the 3.14.15 smell citrus light floral taste like citrus but not over powerful this batch is great F yeah 4th is best yet love it bomber poured in a sniffer great smell and taste
"22oz bottle, Enjoy by date 3.14.15, pour golden amber with 2in head. Nice lacing while drinking. Smell of citrusy, grapefruit, pineapple and slight banana. Taste was grassy, citrus, slight banana some sweetness very quickly then long hop bitter finish. Medium body. Overall very easy and smooth, covers alcohol well for 9.4%."
Had the 3-14-15 version and very much enjoyed it
"Had to revise from a previous enjoy by date. I feel that every batch of this is different. This batch ""pi"" was terrific. Well balanced. Juicy, little resin, grapefruit taste. I really enjoyed this batch."
Can't wait for the 4/20/15 version!
Not my favorite of the series
Had the 3.14.15 batch after searching for it for months (happened to be right under my nose). Excellent brew.
"Enjoy By 3.14.15. Hops done right. I almost never go out of my way for any variant of an IPA, but the Enjoy By Series has become something of an exception. It's not the ultra-bitter kind of (D)IPA that you get elsewhere. Excellent citrus/floral notes come through the whole way and keeps you coming back for another one."
"While it varies a little from batch to batch, I always try to grab a bottle if it's on the shelf! MMM"
"I had this beer around 1/26. Very interesting and very enjoyable! Although, the aroma and finish have a grassy, almost bandaid-like undertone. It smells like Mosaic or Azzaca hops which have a hint of that aroma profile."
Pours a light golden color - slightly pale - with a white head that leaves a trail of lace. 
"Enjoy by valentines. Had it on 2/21, so not exactly following the rules."
"Stone enjoy by 3/14/15. Haven't had an enjoy by yet, but have had other stone beers. As usual, an excellent brew from them!"
"This is a world class beer, nectar from the gods. Very smooth down the hatch with a very nice citrus after taste. I will buy as many as possible untill 3.14.15"
Great overall IPA. Good every time I have it.
3.14.15 is not very memorable. The 2.14.15 was better. Mediocrity at its best.
3.14.15 - Enjoy By Pi
"A+ liked this beer, smooth"
Had this beer on 2/15/15. One day overdue and it showed. Great but not spectacular. I'll try again next year
"I've had a few of the new Pi Enjoy Bys over the past several days. The interesting thing about this series is that it's actually pretty different every time. This time it's super heavy on the garlic/onion hops, which honestly I don't prefer. It's still a great beer though regardless of where they take it each iteration."
"Pours amber, large head."
Picked up the enjoy by 2/14/15 on the 12th while up in mass....great tasting beer...hopefully I can get my hands on pi
"So I'm having this a day late (2/15, not 2/15). The day doesn't seem to have ruined it. It pours a slightly cloudy orangey gold with a nice white head that leaves some small sticky lacing. It has lovely rich tropical fruit, citrus and floral hops aroma. The taste is restrained for a Stone IPA, but it is still a delicious and well-made beer. The hops flavors are not overwhelming, but blend together well and are supported by a sturdy and subtle malt backbone. Not too heavy on the palate and with just a little bitter bite on the finish."
"This is the 02.14.15. Clear with a nice layer of head. Smell of juicy citrus with a taste to match. Unlike other citrusy/juicy ipas, this has a nice bite of hops towards the end. Great beer all around...always excited to try the enjoy by variety's."
A - 1-inch head. Color is a clear amber. The carbonation is super lively. 
I really enjoyed the Enjoy By 02.14.15 Double IPA by Stone Brewing Co. It has a great smell and taste. I hope to get my hands on the next Enjoy By IPA. 
This one kills it every time. And I ALWAYS make the deadline...If only I were so committed in my personal/academic/professional life.
"Very good, sttrong, pungent, sticky, floral, citra, roasted tobacco hidden alcohol brew."
Ratings for the 2/14/15 batch.
"This review is based on the 2/15/15 bottle. Poured a two finger off white head in a snifter. A clear amber color with decent lacing. The smell of citrus lasted from smell to taste. I throughly enjoyed this beer, up there with DF 90 minute. I could easily drink several, thankfully the 9.4% ABV will remind me how many I can drink. Truly a delight."
Best Evah best Evah best Evah! Period!
Pours crystal clear light yellow with white head that lingers and leaves lacing. Lighter than I expected. 
Finally got a hold of this...well worth the wait - Outstanding!!!
"Great beer. Always enjoy having an Enjoy By, no matter what the date. It's a consistent go to when you want to start an evening off right."
"If my wife ordered this as a perfume, I would bang her clothes 2/14/15 appropriate"
"Maybe it me, but all Stone beers have a similar ""tinge"" to them."
Best. My favorite. Amazing. Punch u in the face hops!
"Overall a nice double IPA, pineapple taste, dry finish, one of the best DIPA;s I have had."
"A wonderful IPA, pick a date!!!"
nice bitter up fron strong citrus finish
Just tried the 'by 2/14/15'. Excellent.
L - pretty much a perfect representation for an IPA. Light/Medium golden honey with great clarity and nice medium/thick white head that sticks around that leaves a good amount of lacing behind. 
Nice citrus smell. Bitter finish lingers
2-14-15- awesome! Loved it.
"Smell is pure pink grapefruit. Sweet, citrus, light, maybe a little saline. Taste is what I expect... Pink grapefruit. A touch of grain, and sugar. Sugar. Sugar. I taste pith, a bit of spice... Not as bitter as I expected or wanted... But that sweetness is wonderful."
Update with By Pi.
2.14.15
"Hard to review a brew who's shelf life is so short. This review is for the 2/14/15 enjoy by date. Light golden color which is unusual for a double IPA, smelled a little bitter and piney, taste was quite good, less hoppy and lighter feel than expected for a double. Didn't linger long on the tongue. Deceptively light for a double, easy to drink."
Enjoy By 02.14.15. It was excellent. I am not generally a fan of their IPA (or the Delicious IPA) but this was fantastic and would drink again and again.
"Not my style, too much bitterness"
Yum tasty delish awesome aromatic fresh nice fulfilling an absolute treat
This was pretty darn good and fresh tasting. If I'm being honest with myself I like the Ruination better as crazy as that sounds.
This review is for the 02-14-15 batch.
Was a bit past the date so got it cheaply. Solid anyway. I will be visiting this beer again.
"Another excellent batch by Stone, this one being the 2.14.15. I'd have to agree with another reviewer, the 12.26.14 and a couple others were better, the first one I tasted being so good I described it in terms that I wont repeat in public. This one looks great, clear gold, white head, beautiful herbal and citrus aroma, strong herbal taste with citrus undertones, and near palate wrecker carbonation and flavor."
"3.14.15 Pi edition. Excellent as always. This version seemed a bit more harsh, more piney than the last."
Draft of EB 2/14/15 @ The Office on 1/23/15. Pours straw yellow with 1 finger of white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is strongly citrus with subtle tropical fruits. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit sticky. Palate is robustly citrus and resinous hops balanced nicely against the malt backbone and alcohol. Nicely balanced DIPA. Probably the best Enjoy By since the 4/20/14.
Enjoy by 02/14/2015
02.14.15 version. Outstanding as always. I live in Pa so bought a case. This is the 4th bottle and by far the best.
Not the biggest fan of IPA's but hot DAAAMN this was solid. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.
I am a bit confused as to why I didn't like this one more.
this review is only for the 10.31.15 Enjoy By. i've had multiple others and LOVED them all but never officially wrote a review of them. so this review is this particular Enjoy By and the others.
not a big fan of giving out 5's but this beer is absolutely awesome
"As an IPA lover, this is always a great choice for me."
Great brew. Everything you would want from a double Ipa.
"Stone Enjoy By 02.14.15 IPA. My first time seeing Enjoy Boy in a bottle (22oz). Served cold in a curved ""porter/stout"" glass. Beer is crystal clear and medium pale amber in color. Surprisingly tropical aroma, and fresh, of course. Courtesy of Citra, perhaps? Flavor is moderately juicy, builds pine, resiny flavors on top of the tropical fruit/passion/mango notes promised in the nose. Surprisingly well balanced for a Stone double IPA, too. I would even say the finish is not totally dry. The headiness of this brew, along with the corresponding amount of residual sugar, are the only things holding back this otherwise supremely drinkable IPA."
Enjoy By 02.14.15 (consumed on 1/24/15)
"January 23, 2015"
"Enjoy by 2/15/15 release. Pours straw crystal clear yellow. Slight carbonation. Thick head with lots of foam. Excellent lacing retention. Aromas of pine trees and musk. Lemongrass. Good mouthfeel. Lots of citrus tastes. Nose is all pine and grapefruit. Astringent bitter notes. Mid-palate it breaks to lemons, grapefruit, and some coriander spice. Back palate is a slight cinnamon bread malt and some bitter lemon notes. Lots of grapefruit and a slight alcohol bite. Excellent. Crisp, clean aftertaste. Some more bitter grapefruit and lemongrass. A hint of pepper and spice. 4.5 out of 5. Excellent."
Enjoyed 12-26-14 immensely. It was odd to drink a hoppy IPA that smooth and without bite. 2-20-15 is also good but I unfortunately agree with the onion comments.
Enjoy by 2/14/15
I like what they did with this beer. The marketing on this beer is different but awesome! It really brings people to by this beer just because of just the label itself! Good buy.
Everytime one comes out I am Buying! Great stuff!
Amazing IPA. Pair with pungent foods
"Pours a beautifully, deep golden hue with extremely good clarity. White, fluffy head with excellent lacing. First thing you notice about this DIPA is it's wonderful fruity, floral aroma. Very interesting flavor that transitions from malt to hop bittering with the PERFECT balance leaving no unwanted aftertaste; it even provides a deep earthy note toward the end that is very nice. The carbonation is just so so to provide a great mouthfeel. Interest lay enough, it is 9.2 ABV without tasting boozy. Drinks like a session, so be careful. Nothing bad I can say, except with I would've bought more!"
has shifted the bar on how i rate Imperial IPA's!
"Insanely drinkable, with a very fresh taste and aroma. Wish I could hold onto some until summer, it would be a perfect afternoon porch sipper. Can't wait to sample future batches!"
Enjoy By 02.14.15 (11 days from bottling)
Would love this in a growler.
"The freshness certainly brings out the best qualities of the style but the flavor profile doesn't stand out from most IPAs, you get your normal grapefruit and pine and other hop-forward flavors but nothing special."
Enjoy by 2.14.15
Light amber color
"Enjoy by 2/14/15. Excellent. One of the best I've had in this series. Dank, a bit tropical, and oh-so-drinkable."
Had the 2/14/15 last night and it tasted great! it had been a year or more since I last had it and it was better than I remember!
"My favorite. Always clean, fresh, crisp and delicious. Well this or Hop Stoopid. Either will do. 2/14/15 batch. Excellent. $7.99 in Las Vegas."
"I love this beer but something is wrong with the 2/14/15 batch. Finish is like cat pee mixed with overly astringent booze finish. I never thought I would have to pour out the second half of an Enjoy By bomber, but that's what just happened. Currently drinking a dank imperial stout, but even that isn't killing the taste of this funk. Hopefully this is just a bad batch. I am going to have to return these other two bombers."
Great floral flavor! Almost a perfect double IPA.
"Finally score a bomber from Siciliano's in Grand Rapids. Being a discriminating hop head, I'm very excited to try this baby. Enjoy by Feb 14, 2014, sampled on Jan 17, 2014, aka extremely fresh."
Why the grapefruit? All I get is grapefruit. I've heard great things about enjoy by. But I hate grapefruit!!!!
Definitely a piney smell and tasting imperial IPA. 
"They used an onion hop, either CZT or Nelson, and I'm sorry but I don't want onions or garlic in my beer. Just my opinion, sorry IPA geeks."
I have tried several different dates and they are all top notch. One of my favorite IPAs out there. Nice floral scent with a smooth taste not as bitter as other Stone beers. I will buy this everytime I have the chance.
"The 04.20.14 iteration was better than the 12.26.14 in my opinion. I was lucky enough to have the 4/20 version on tap at the Escondido facility while traveling and again locally at the Engine Room in Mystic, CT. I again sampled the Christmas edition locally on tap and from two different bottles. Every release is a superior IPA."
"I've had the last several versions of these and I try to get them whenever I see them. They are some of the best beers I've ever had. The unfiltered was tremendous and should go on Stone's regular schedule as quickly as possible; to me, that was close to a perfect beer. I thought they were a bit pricey when I first saw them($17 a six), but not any more. A fantastic beer."
"A - Pours to the color of apple juice, forms a nice finger of white creamy head, leaves nice soapy lacing on the walls of my glass. "
"The 12.26.14 was an excellent release, after having (and not reviewing) the 4.20.14. Great beer."
"I love the enjoy by series, I make it a point to grab these as they get released."
Had on tap at the Shepherd and the Knucklehead.
Syrupy hoppiness over the top
"It poured relatively flat and had no real lacing. The beer had a nice citrus smell. It was well balanced for an ABV of 9.4 percent, as the taste of alcohol was not over whelming. Definitely warming after a few sips. It just was not one of my favorites."
"i enjoy a, lot of stone beer, however not this one, it is a GOOD beer but only good, i dont go out of way to look for it"
"The 12/26/14 was solid. Not sure why its rated this high, but still a great, session able IPA."
I love this beer as an everyday IPA.
Really smooth imperial ipa. The alcohol taste is not as overpowering as the ruinten ipa and there is a nice hoppy finish
Found this IPA to be a bit too onion-E
"had on tap, smell was good but taste was way too bitter, maybe this was a bad batch"
"My all time favorite IPA or DIPA (so far). Huge mouthwatering aroma of citrus and tropical fruits with some pine. The taste will blow you away. I got strong guava flavors which is unique along other tropical flavors like pineapple and mango with fantastic bitter grapefruit citrus flavors to compliment. Nicely balanced with the malt but definitely hop heavy (which is my preference) I just don't want to stop drinking this beer. Better than Pliney in my opinion in smell taste and mouthfeel. If you see this beer, get it, and drink it fresh!"
Enjoy by 12.26.14 poured from a bomber into a tulip glass
"Had this yesterday (12/27/14) at J. Ryans in Syracuse. Yes, a day beyond the enjoy by date, but don't fret, still awesome. Ripe, juicy and dank would be it. Nuff said."
Got as a gift. Very pleasantly surprised. Wonderful
Just a good DIPA that's good on or before the 26th. Very fresh tasting double IPA.
"Purchased June 3, 6 days after bottling. Purchased at Total Wine in VA. for $8.49. Color is an amazingly clear, gold color with about two fingers of creamy white to off-white head. Allowed to sit and breathe for a bout 10 minutes, head is now almost completely gone and left in it's place is an average amount of lacing, nothing to really talk about. Aroma is pineapple, fresh squeezed orange juice, creamsicle and a small background of hop pineyness. During the second whiff of this on the second pour, I get a ton of ONION, wow, not my favorite, This aroma changed very fast from juicy citrus to fresh cut SCALLIONS... This version is quite a bit different, IMO, from the others I have had. I get a lot of hop bitterness right up front and the citrus now takes a back seat. I still get some pineapple, but it is subdued by the piney hops and the bitterness. I definitely can feel the alcohol a lot more than in previous Enjoy Bys. it really bites and lingers on the palate. Finish is pretty short, but the bitterness and alcohol remain for quite awhile and so does the smell of onions, weird !!. Of the three different Enjoy Bys I have had, this one is my least favorite because of the cloying, persistant alcohol remnants that refuse to leave and the lack of that burst of fresh citrus that were in the others. Overall, nice but not spectacular. Slightly disappointed !"
"Enjoy by 12. 26.14. Been sought after for a few months now after trying most of stones regular releases and reading more and more about this one. Finally found one available in my home town (without an expired date! Chill bumps upon noticing in the cooler!) although if I find another tomorrow( as today on Christmas the store is closed) , I will buy another and drink right before i CANT enjoy by!! have very high hopes and I can say..... This beer is magnificent! Beer is an understatement. From the smell to the Taste this fills all the gaps that other iPas lack, and I didn't even know they were lacking until I endured this HOP /FLAVOR explosion.I wouldn't even say it is bitter like most iPas as the bitterness is full flavor until it completely fades from your taste buds. It has completely ruined my palate as I have read from others.. This beer sets the bar for all iPas for me at this point. And with an abv in the 9's I'm blown away more like 6's by taste. If u drink iPas regularly do not pass this up you will not regret it!! Can't wait to find another!! Cheers, Kevin."
Bottle poured into a Stone IPA glass
"The 12-26-14 seems more piney and less bready than the 4-20-14, which was the last Enjoy By I had. Was not crazy about the 4-20, but this one--the 12/26--is a flat-out solid DIPA."
"Golden color, looks mostly filtered. Head is a bit foamier than typical for an IPA, good persistence."
What a great beer by Stone.
One of the best IPA's I've had
"In my opinion, the 12/26 is the best double IPA out there"
It's fresh and smooth on the alcohol end but a bit sharp on the bouquet for me
Enjoy By 12-26-2014 
"Huge floral, citrus, and tropical fruit with just the right bitter finish."
"Dam before I even went to smell this beer the citrus popped me in the nose. Beer pours a lite copper in color the head quickly disappears and is off white in color. The beer smells delicious, one of the best smelling IPA's my nose has had the pleasure of meeting. IT reminds me of frolicking, through the citrus grooves of California. I have never done that but that's probably what frolicking is like. The flavor comes off as a caramel sweet orange with some tropical fruit flavors. The beer isn't a display of hoppy bitterness tearing at your enamel as much as it is a display of the softer more sensitive floral flavor and aroma of the hop."
Bottle: Poured a clear bright yellow color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and some good lacing. Aroma of green fresh hoppy notes with light sweet notes also noticeable. Taste is dominated by floral green hoppy notes with grassy notes and residual sugar notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Glad to finally try this and it is indeed very enjoyable.
"Outstanding IPA; hoppy, bright and complex"
"huge hop and citrus nose, taste that follows the nose. this is a big hop IPA that delivers. The appearance and feel were right there as well. One of my favorites from Stone. this was Enjoy By 12/26/14."
Had the Enjoy by 12/26/14. Very good.
"This is an impressive brew. Golden orange liquid topped by a clean white head that is large and slow to leave. When it does it leaves quite a bit of evidence of its presence. Nose has an abundance of tropical fruits and light sweet malty goodness. The two pair to create an olfactory delight . Taste builds from there. Hops hops everywhere and just enough malt to ride. While big and pervasive they are not a grapefruit bomb. Multilayered and multifaceted they display an attention to the smallest detail. The tropical side is dominant when colder with the lovely citrus showing its yellow skinned dry and puckering edge as it warms. In all cases the abv is a ""Say What?"". You can pound this brew and not know it until you wake up on the floor. Feel is medium heavy with a full creamy carbonation the enhances the overall quenching quality. It just drinks like a session ale. A superb beer in all aspects. I love the attention to the hop construct that drives a brewers vision to create something like this."
Poured from 22oz bomber into a tulip. This is the Enjoy By 12.26.14.
"Bomber bottle, drink by 12/26/14 bought at Brown Jug, Anchorage, AK on 12/17/14. "
An interesting IPA for the holidays
Slightly thick off white head. Light gold in color. Floral and citrus dominates the nose with great pine notes. Tastes just as good as it smells. Lots of fruity hops and pine. Definitely one of my favorite IPAs that I have tasted.
"One of, if not my favorite double IPA right now."
This 3/14/15 is as good as the 2/14/15 Enjoy By IPA. At 9.2% doesn't feel heavy and overly malty at all! The citrus is still well pronounced and balanced ! Love the Enjoy Bys :) freshness is the key with these IPAs and Stone does an incredible job keeping it fresh :) cheers
"Stone has its many lovers and many haters. The haters complain about Stone's hubristic promotional language, failing to realize that it is largely self-parody. The balance nazis also hate Stone's aggressively hoppy brews, even though IPAs are supposed to be hop forward by definition."
"Bomber poured into a tulip. Bottle best consumed before Boxing Day. No obstacles there. Dark yellow amber with a finger and a half of creamy, slightly frothy off-white head. On the light side visually speaking. Aroma dominated by tropical fruit (pineapple, guava, mango, passion fruit), tangerine, lemon, and peaches, with a subtle pine undercurrent. There is more pine on the palate (along with a decent blast of booze), with the nose skewing fruitier, although I am still getting copious quantities of tropical nectar and peach. Slight hint of onion. Very light malts, just a tinge of toffee. Comes off as well-attenuated, with little to conceal the generous hop bill. Somewhat woody and herbal on the back end but lacks the potent green notes one can get in less refined fresh hop ales. Less body than expected for such a ""big"" beer, dare I say on the light side, with just the right amount of mid-range fizz. I am temped to deem this Go To IPA's big brother, although that comparison does not quite capture the nuances. Suffice to say, this is a powerful brew yet somehow sophisticated in its lack of coarse bitter notes or green off-flavors. Nothing but tropical muskiness, citrus rind, and pleasant floral alcohols to nourish the beer geek soul."
"Rating is based on the 12-26-2014 edition, which as I understand it is surpassed by a handful of prior bottlings. That said, this is an extremely enjoyable double IPA which deserves to be consumed fresh. "
650ml bomber poured into tulip 16/12/14 still 10 days until its boxing day due date 
Muted hops in the nose and on the palate. Decent brew
A great fuckin brew. Top notch.
3/14/15 bottle. A sweet piney citrusy resinous hop bomb with a perfect bitter finish. This is my favorite enjoy by release I've had so far.
Enjoy by 12-26-14 edition… Enjoyed on 12/14/14
22 Bottle of 12/26/14 in a Spiegelau IPA Glass...
"Pours slightly hazy golden color with 2 finger width foamy head. Head retention is good. Lacing is quite good. Deep fresh, citrus aroma. Very appealing. Nice hop forward bitterness, piney, with a slight citrus maltiness and great fresh, bitter, resin aftertaste. Slightly soapy and astringent. Very good and fresh beer."
22oz Bottle of Enjoy By 12.26.14. Poured into a Spiegelau IPA Glass:
"Whole family swung up to Plymouth yesterday (13DEC14) to see daughter #1 and get a tree. After cutting a fresh Christmas tree for the first time, we stopped into Biedermans for lunch. I actually ordered a Stoneface IPA, but was served a Stone Enjoy By... This is the 12.26.14 version, and I believe I was (mis-) charged $4.00 for it."
Tried the Enjoy by 12.26.14 on Dec 13 - nothing spectacular here 3.25
"Stone enjoy by 12-26-2014 double ipa, growler purchased at CBX in Charleston. "
22oz bomber. Enjoy by 12/26/14 batch. Poured into a tulip glass.
"Hoppy at first, fruity at the end. Pretty good."
Really nice floral nose. Finishes with smooth cloves. Like this beer alot..Stone does nice on tap
"In my opinion, these never disappoint. Been drinking them regularly since 2013 and have enjoyed them each time."
"Enjoy By 12.26.14, Clear golden-amber pour with a foamy white two finger head with good retention and great lacing. Sticky, resiny hops dominate the nose along with hints of grapefruit, pine, tropical fruit, orange peel, and subtle green onion. The taste mirrors the nose with dank, resiny, earthy, fresh picked hops along with hints of pine, orange peel, grapefruit, tropical fruit, green onions, and just enough sweet caramel malt to keep it honest. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, subtly chewy, and extremely oily with a mouth-puckering crisp, dry, bitter finish. Overall, I've been trying to get my hands on this beer for quite a while, and it did not disappoint. Incredibly fresh and bold and every bit as good as Heady or Pliny! Highly recommended!"
Serving: 22 oz bottle poured into an IPA glass (12.26.14 release).
22oz poured into Nonic pint 12-26 iteration
Enjoy by 12-26-14
"Anytime I see an Enjoy By I grab one, amazing IPA all around, for a imperial IPA this one pours a perfect amber color amazing fresh hop bitterness that other doubles should strive for, If a pine and citrus blend of awesomeness is what your looking for pick this one up and drink it fast, If I had a choice between this beer and a Pliny the Elder its Enjoy By all the way!"
"Stone Enjoy By 12/26, picked up at Mt Airy Liquors on draft. "
Very impressive.
"I got a 32 ounce growler of this because I'm such a fan of Stone. I sampled it before I bought it and thought it tasted pretty good. I poured into a frozen pint glass. By the time I finished it had a hint of a unpleasant taste. By the time I finished the growler, it was downright gross. I won't be having anymore of that."
Appearance – Pours an orange golden color with a nice head that sticks around and very good lacing.
L-Golden colored...light lace....lightly carbonated look
"Love the ABV. High IBU as well, but the hops work against the overall taste"
"Wow. Not one to do reviews and also more of a stout fan but, WOW! What a refreshingly smooth tasting, hoppy beer. I had my enjoy by 12/26/14 on 12/5/14 and just bought another this evening. This one impresses me. Way to go Stone!"
"Enjoy by 12/26/14. Skunky, funky...which is not always bad, but in this case it was a bit much. Would not buy this date again but love the concept and Stone is solid, so will try future offerings."
Had the 12/26/14 was excellent but not as good as the last version I had
"Just had the 12/26 version of the series. This was one of the better offerings. Nice balance throughout this DIPA. Go, find, drink."
Beer number 501
"Enjoy by 12-25-15. This is my 5th enjoy by, each slightly different but overall all fantastic. This one, like all the others, poured a golden color that is very clear with a ton of foamy white head. The smell is floral and piney with a bit of citrus. There is a lot of hop flavor up front, very citrusy with a resin finish. This has a medium mouthfeel. I look for each iteration of this beer as it is always enjoyable."
"12.26.14 version. Quite a frothy, white head, with lots of lace. Very hoppy with citrus and floral notes, particularly grapefruit. Sweet with a bitter finish. Well-carbonated and refreshing, with a long finish. This is a solid IPA."
22 oz 12-26-14. Very nice IPA. Would drink again (glad I have another!)
Very good beer. Unique and quiet delicious. Pours light but drinks heavy as expected. Definitely not for the wee lads!
Refreshing and clean
Very solid DIPA. Poured golden with good head and heavy hop aromas.
"Stone ""Enjoy By 12.26.14 IPA"""
Enjoy by 12.26.14 bomber.
"A DIPA that absolutely gets it right. Too many just don't have strong enough hop flavors and the malt ends up taking over, making them more like a hoppy barleywine. Enjoy By brings the huge, dank hop smells and flavors that unmistakably put this in IPA territory. Also appreciate the novel way to focus unavoidably on freshness through the prominent date on the bottle."
Bottled on 11/13/14 Enjoy By 12/26/14 enjoyed on 12/2/04
Picked up a case of twelve bombers enjoy by 12-26-14. Bought it 11-26... Five days old! Super dank and juicy. Nice unfiltered hazy yellow. Has a unique creamy undertone that I only recall from fiddlehead mastermind. Super high end shit. A privilege!
"Had this one on thanksgiving. Awesome awesome beer. Can't wait to pop open my second one soon. For $7 a bomber, wish I had more."
"One of the best tasting beer that I've had. N: the kick of the citrus smell right away and hoppy. H: thick and frothy and leaves a lace. T: so delicious, that citrus note hits hard, with the hop kick in the end. This beer tastes fresh and I had it a week after the just by date. Overall such an awesome beer!"
"Jesus Christ in a motor boat, this is the nuclear hop BOMB of all nuclear hop bombs. If you like that sort of thing..."
Enjoy by 12/16/14; bottled on 11/13/14.
I really enjoyed the 10-31-14. I would give it 10-31-14 a 4.5. 
"Had a family member ship me a case of 8.16.14 from the east coast. Totally worth it. Wonderful IPA demonstrating notes of citrus, pine, sweet. Balanced with nice carbonation. Truly enjoyable."
So far the best beer I have ever had
Enjoy By 12-26-14
Enjoy BY 12-26-14
I got the enjoy by 10.31.14. It was a fabulous IPA.
This was the 12.09.14 batch..IMO all these beers start to taste the same and I cant tell anymore whats so special with the hype in this series.. Im prolly done with this series at this point.
"12.05.14 version. Pour from a 22. This one seems to have more tropicals than citrus profiles found in earlier versions. Not sure if they tweak the contents for different batches, or if I am under the influence of what I ate before drinking this. The hop profiles were, as expected and hoped for, the dominant flavors early and across the tongue. Finish had a little boozy element to it. Would rather that be less pronounced (beer was at good temp, not too cold). Looking forward to next batch."
"Golden orange in color. One and a half eggshell white head. The nose is not as present as i remember in the past. Orange juice, lemon, pine, pepper, there is a subtle earthiness and a small amount of malt sweetness. The taste is very thick and juicy. Earthy hops and sweet malt. Less citrusy than i remember. Great ipa."
I'm a fan of this every time it comes out. Always tastes slightly different.
2.14.14 was one of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had.
Poured into a snifter from a bomber. Review from 7/4/14. Enjoy by 7/4/14.
"12.26.14 WTF???????????????????? This version was awful. What did you guys do here? Grapefruit notes completely missing in the taste. No balance, just bitter. Totally off flavors. Would have gotten a zero if I had not liked the other versions. This current iteration was a miss."
Light amber color with a thick head with good retention.
10/31/2014 Bottle
Stone is really hit and miss with me but this is one solid brew! Another great California IPA. Way to go Stone.
4.20.14 has been by far my favorite from this series.
I doubt I've ever met someone who feels as strongly about freshness as Stone CEO Greg Koch. I made the mistake once of mentioning to him that there was a lot of stale-dated Stone bottles floating around the Western New York market and it costs someone their job. It's no surprise this be the brewery to pioneer the concept of putting the 'best before' right in the beer's name...
Enjoy by 10.31.14. (Halloween)
Stone enjoy by 7-4-14 A non beer geek friend had this and donated to my fridge. I'm not going to say no because of a giant drink by date on the front!!
10/31/14 and was good
This beer is outstanding.
Smoothest double IPA
Enjoy By 10.31.14 Poured into a cognac snifter. It pours a rich darker orange color that is fairly clear. There is very little head on an agressive pour and it dissipated by the time I got my computer booted.
Appearance: Clear yellow with a short white head that leaves some lacing on the way down.
Enjoyed this in a side by side taste test with a Pliny. First time I have had either of these beers.
This was fanfuckingtastic!
Wow. Good offering. Pours a clear mid amber with little head. Wonderful citrus aroma with pine undertones. Grapefruit is the prominent taste. Medium body that snacks the back of your tongue. One of the better IPA's I've had of last. Good job!
10.31.14
Danky hops. Awesome.
"First time trying an enjoy by. Poured into a pint glass. Very clear golden amber with about an inch of head. Smell is largley a strong pine with some subtle notes of citrus like grapefruit, lemon, and orange. The taste follows the nose very closely and has a more balanced taste between cirtusy and pine than the smell does. There is a pretty large malty backbone in it as well. Medium mouthfeel with a good hop smooth hop bite on the back end. This beer reminds me a lot of a more hoppy hopslam. Solid brew by stone once again, but a slightly above middle of the road IPA."
Enjoy by 10/31/14 poured from a bomber. Poured golden with little to no head. Smells piney with some citrus. Smells great. All the good taste of a double without the bitterness. Just enough bite to it. Great beer. Glad I got a hold of one.
"4.20.14, 7.4.14, 10.31.14"
Been wanting to try this brew for a long time. Just had a bottle of Hop Stoopid so I'll probably be comparing the two. Here goes:
"Surprisingly smooth for and IPA, very enjoyable."
P- Thanks to my buddy Matt for this one...however I am drinking a few days past the enjoy by date.
"Stone's Enjoy By IPA is like an experience one would have with a virgin and her first exploration into coitus. It is one to savor, and not too pound."
Enjoy by 9/13/13 (had on 9/5/13): 4
Delicious every time it comes out! Always have to pick up a bottle when I see it.
"Enjoyed multiple versions, and always buy any one that I can find. Enjoy By 4-20-2014 was the best batch."
"By 9/20/2014 - wonderful aroma, rich assortment of flavor, smooth and lingering goodness."
From notes on 4/12/14
Love all the Enjoy By IPAs Stone Releases! So crisp and fresh! These special releases are what got me hooked on Stone Brewing Co.
"Enjoy by 12-26-2014, poured from a bomber into a tulip"
Enjoy By 09.20.2014
"Poured from a 1PT 6FL OZ bottle into a pint glass. Enjoy By 09.20.14 IPA (bottled on: 08.16.14 per website - this is indeed ""devastatingly fresh"" at just over three weeks old!)"
"Poured from 22oz boomer into tulip glass. 1finger fluffy head dissipates quickly. Golden, almost cloudy color. Smell: not much cold. A little alcohol and grapefruit as it warms. Taste: apricot, peach, grapefruit at the end strong grapefruit finishing into bitter hops. Mouthfeel: smooth and fresh, not syrupy or sticky. Light crisp carbonation. Overall: terrific IPA, very we'll balanced and full of flavor. wish there was a bit more complexity, but very enjoyable!"
Everything has really fallen off since I started drinking this last year. Its still good just not the same as it has been in the past. Bring back 4/20/14 which blew my socks off.
"solid ipa, I overlook it bc its always available at my liquor stor (MAX BEV in weha) very bitter and delicious"
"The beer has a nice hazy orange appearance. The carbonation bubbles are effervescent. It has a modest, but solid head and leaves a spotty lacing. It has a very fresh aroma and nice earthy hop smell, with a sort of garlicky characteristic. The beer is interestingly complex with a ton of hop flavors: predominately resinous pine, grapefruit, and orange rind. There is also a slight malt sweetness. A terrific DIPA; one of the best examples out there."
"It is a predominantly clear, light gold with an off white cap. This beer is a lacing monster. My tulip looks like it is covered with spray foam insulation. "
Enjoy By 02-14-14
"Modestly superb. Mine was 'Enjoy By' 9/20/2014. Golden orange/amber and very aromatic. Nicely hoppy in the mouth, but not overly so. "
My favorite Stone beer. A great option for any hop-head.
"This is by far and away the best double IPA...or any IPA for that matter, I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. I won't go in to too much detail on this one because it was several weeks ago when I enjoyed this beer. Furthermore, how can one describe in words what they believe to be a perfect beer?"
I buy these every time they come out. They never disappoint and are always tasty. This is the best commercially available DIPA you can buy IMO. Smooth with a mildly bitter finish
22 ounce bottle -&gt; snifter
"I had a batch with the sell by date of 7/4/14, and consumed on June 22. Growler from keg at local beer-specific retailer. Good dense gold color, a little hazy, but normal for a DIPA. Good healthy one finger head which left slowly. Aroma is almost pure hops, with a backing of malty sweetness. A bit grassy in its hoppiness, along with pine, grapefruit, and tropical fruit. Taste is wonderful, full in your face hoppy bitter resinousness, backed by enough sweet malt to make it really drinkable. Again, a bit of green freshness in the hops, I'd compare it most to nopalitos or green agave, which accents the pine and grapefruit excellently. Finishes dry, hoppy, and leaving you wanting more. Great beer. My first in this series, but definitely not my last."
A- pours a clear light copper hue. Small foamy head. S- mainly citrus with alcohol detectable at the end. T- floral sweetness that hits side of the tongues and lingers a tang of grapefruit. Malt slightly present at finish but is over whelmed by those beautiful bitter hops whilst being layered with a resinous sweetness. M- bright with medium body. O- though alcohol is evident in the aroma it's presence is hidden by the glorious hops. Quite enjoyable considering the decent ABV. Paired perfectly well with a baked macaroni and cheese casserole.
Served in a 14oz glass at Heartbreakers in Chaska
"I had this beer, on tap at WOB, in June 2014. Visually light amber, slightly cloudy, one finger head. "
Enjoy By 07/4/14
"Had one 6 weeks ago and saved one for 07-04-14. Used a Troegs HopBack glass because I couldn't find my Sam Adams or Dogfish glasses. Best beer I have had in a long time. Amazing nose... hoppy, citrus, resinous, other stuff going on. Bursting with flavor from the first sip BUT not so hoppy that it isn't balanced and refreshing. Would not think it was 9.4% ABV if it didn't say so on the bottle. Wish I had bought more than 2 bottles...."
22 oz bottle was poured into a snifter. Best by 7/4/14.
"Note to Self #1: had at least one other - if not more - ""enjoy by...."" - the last being July 2014 and was probably ""enjoy by 07.04.14"""
Consistently among the best IPAs
Poured into glass from bottle! Excellent stuff!
Huge hype for this brew and I went to 4 different liquor stores looking for this coveted nectar. Awesome graphic on the bottle and the premise of a drink by date only 30 days from bottle seems extreme. I was a little hesitant about the drinking only 2 weeks from the brew date but I had to give it a shot.
I just want to say I have been waiting quite a while to try this mother of an IPA. I need to make clear how awesome it is. I'm trying it at the end of its freshness and its just so smooth and crisp. I love this up a and all it stands for. It is right up there with Stones Ruination IPA. They have not disappointed:)
A: Crystal clear orange with a medium super foamy head. Plenty of tiny bubbles.
From a bomber with 5 days to spare
Appearance:
"I am enjoying this deliciously fresh IPA and will definitely pursue the ""Enjoy By"" label in the future. "
22 oz bottle poured into a tumbler pint.
I am enjoying the Enjoy By 12-26-14 IPA from Stone. This is the third in the Enjoy By series I have tried and this one was awesome. The ABV is high (9.4%) but not overpowering. This IPA is super fresh and has outstanding hops and citrus/pine taste. Goes down smooth. Pick up a few 22oz bottles for the holidays!
"Just had the 12.31...off the chain fresh, delicious, and hop-tacular"
Pours a light golden brown with a 1.5 inch head. 
Served from: 22 oz bottle poured into a tumbler pint.
"On tap at Sonka's Irish Pub, Terre Haute, IN. Poured a wonderfully deep burnished gold with a bit of decent head and some nice lacing. Huge deep malt sweetness in the nose with a wonderfully piney-citrusness. Same with the flavor, a huge malt sweetness with great caramel tones and a nice citrus start and pine end to the hop flavors. A bit thick and rough, but not bad for a 9+% brew. Excellent stuff."
Enjoy By: 2-14-15 Enjoyed On: 1-14-15
7/04/14 version enjoyed about 4 weeks before said date...
Love the name Enjoy By 07.04.14 (can not get a better date then that)
"It's a monster! ""Hop-o-liciously fantabulous"" is what American hop-heads would call it. ""An over-hopped abomination"" is what a few European / British friends of mine might call it. I'm more in the former camp myself, as I find it hard for stone to do any wrong, regardless of how much hops they manage to fit into any given beer. But don't be fooled, this is a hoppy one! If you're one to think this week's English ESB is a bit over the top, this one's a bit out of this world. "
"I can't say anything negative about this beer, so I had to give it a perfect rating. It's clean and crisp on the nose and the palate. Perfect IPA taste and smell. A beautiful golden, slightly orange color to it. I poured it into an IPA glass very slowly so there wasn't much head but it bubbled around the edges nicely and stayed the whole time I drank it. For a 9.4%, there's no alcohol taste so it really creeps up on you. Fantastic beer. Hoping to get another pint before 7/14/14"
06/28/15 Enjoy by 11/15/15
"22 oz bottle, the Enjoy By 7.04.14 version"
"Enjoyed in a 20 oz Beer Club Member glass at Mellow Mushroom in Southlake, TX. Pours a cloudy amber color with two finger head that slowly dissipates and 20 minutes later remains to create lacing. Lots of floral notes in the nose. The taste is surprisingly balanced - I was expecting my taste buds to get knocked around by the hops, but they survived. The alcohol is well hidden so be careful!"
Well done Stone! Well done! Personally I have not been overly impressed by the 'Enjoy by' series since its inception. Coerced by 2 very reliable sources I went ahead and did enjoy this dbl ipa by 7.4.14. 
"enjoy by 7.4.14 650ml poured into snifter. enjoyed 6/17/14 so half way to ""expiry"" "
A- Golden yellow and crystal clear. White head that fades leaving some thin lacing.
"This is one of my favorite beers. I have had several iterations both in bottles and on tap. I don't notice a big difference between them, although some have said they thought the 4-20 was more dank. To that I would say: maybe. You would never know this is a 9.4% beer when drinking it, so be careful"
01/26/14 From bottle labeled 01/09/14. Can't get much fresher than that outside the brewpub. That being said I wasn't knocked out. 
Clear pale gold with a white head. 
Finally got to cross this one off my want list. Bought a bottle of 07-04-14 last week and popped it open for the USA Ghana World Cup game. Great/lucky win by the way.
"Opened the bottle served with some nice chicken in a red pepper jelly over vermicelli. The golden color looks great. The aroma as I poured was intensely crisp with an abundance of pine. Once I dug into dinner and swallowed this lightly crisp, but very complex IPA I was blown away. This beer was promised as a fresh, but date driven determinator and it more than delivered an enjoyable experience. It's complexity isn't like the usual offerings in the IPA category. It offers something refreshingly different and makes me want to go get some more before July 4th."
"appearance - large frothy head, beautiful yellow orange color and great lacing. what an IPA should look like."
Enjoy by 7-4-14 model
"Enjoy by 9/20/14 is ridiculously floral. Nose, taste, such a clean and delicious offering from Stone. Solid IPA. Even the wife thought it was really good, and she hates IPAs. Update: The 12/26/14 was just a delicious mango explosion. Update: 3/14/15 Pi was enjoyed with my pal Jens4212, I got the tulip. Beautiful golden amber pour with sticky-icky lacing. Hop explosion: orange, grapefruit, mango, bit of a savory/earthy hop. Not much alcohol noticeable in the mix of citrus, bitterness, and deliciousness. Clean finish. Enjoy by rocks. Update: 7/04/15 had huge pine/grapefruit juice and citrus peel, crisp and clean with a dry finish, just an absolute hop playground."
Bomber poured into chalice
A-Clear gold color with a large white head that fades slowly and leaves a lace
"Just cracked the 7/4/14. Poured a nice pale yellow with a fizzy head that left trails down the side of the glass. The smell was amazing with a lot of hop scents of pine and citrus. The taste was great, exploding with a lot of pine and grapefruit notes that mingled in the mouth and left a very crisp finish that was very refreshing. Loved it and would definitely recommend grabbing a bottle while there is still time."
A: Orange-yellow. White tall head when poured aggressively. 
7-4-14
How is this beer ranked BELOW their regular IPA? These rankings are insane. Anyone with a palate for good beer would agree that the Enjoy By totally blows away the regular Stone IPA.
22 oz bottle of Enjoy by 7/4/14
"On-tap, into growler, into snifter."
"A: Pours a beautiful clear gold, white head quickly dissipates."
7/4/14 bottle
"A - A golden, strawlike hazy pour with a nice cotton top. Sticks to the glass all the way down and creates some nice lacing. "
"A: Copper brown tone, clear filtered, a little large bubbled carbonation, a finger of creamy off white head that fades relatively fast."
"For my taste buds, this is a perfect DIPA and probably one of my favorites of all time. Super fresh and hoppy, very citrus forward, masks alcohol surprisingly (dangerously) well, very smooth. Importantly, no maltiness / sweetness which is sometimes a drawback of this style for my taste. If you're looking for a fresh, hoppy, big west coast IPA I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one."
I love Stones' 'Enjoy By' beers. I had one the other day and they are so fresh. I've had from the growler at the brewery and It was the FRESHEST IPA I've ever tasted. I live about 50 miles from the brewery so even the bottles are fresh beers. I highly recommend picking up any enjoy by IPA's that you see. 
Saw this at Costco thought I'd give it a try. Off the top of my head I don't think I have ever been disappointed by any of Stone's Brewing beers...
Never had enjoy by until today 07 04 14. Impressed with the complexity of this beer. Will definitely seek this out again. Haven't tried in a bomber yet but on tap its amazing. Thank you Stone for all that you do and please continue to do it. peace out homies
"One of my all time favorite Double IPAs! The first batch I bought was 04.20.14 and I absolutely loved it. Currently, I am drinking the 07.04.14 for this review. It pours wonderfully with a light bronze color and thick foamy head. My first inhale hit me with a dank citrus, pine scent with undertones of an earthy, fruity base. The beer itself is smooth and round with a crisp bite of citrus. Its fresh, bold and I love it!"
"What can I say, Enjoy by .... lives up to the hype/rating. "
"Another winner from Stone. I poured this one (22 oz bottle) into a wine glass and let it warm to bring out the flavors. While I enjoy other IIPAs a bit more (e.g., Hopslam and Hoptimum) you simply cannot go wrong with this one as this one is rock solid. I will certainly be picking up another one in the next couple of days."
"Living by one of Stone's tap houses makes for very fresh Stone. The pour was crystal clear with a nice 1 inch head. Lacing was awesome as it stuck to the beer glass all the way down. Has a distinct piney flavor and scent. Overall an excellent brew, I drink it every time it's available."
"How do you even rate this beer? It continuously changes, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse."

Bought a six pack of 5.16.14 Enjoy by IPA from a local Bevmo and made a beeline home to crack them open.
Enjoy by 02.14.14 by Stone
"This beer appears golden and cloudy. I can barely see my hand on the other side of the glass. The head is white and dissipates into a light ring around the edges as you consume the beer. Lacing is minimal. It has a strong smell of sweet tropical fruit. The smell supports the taste. Fruity, piney, hoppy, and sweetness all rolled into a complex, superior taste. The mouthfeel is also top of the line."
On tap.
"Absolutely delicious. I don't believe that an overall ""perfect"" beer exists. But this is pretty close. Holds up to the Pliny the Elder everyone is so high on. In my opinion I'd take Enjoy By over the Pliny any day. The fact that it's dated makes it easy to know you're getting a freshly made batch. If you haven't tried Enjoy By you're missing out."
"Enjoy By 05.16.14, thanks very much to Rohan for bringing back for me."
Enjoy by 4-20-14
Enjoy by 05.16.14: made it with 2 weeks or so to spare. 22oz bomber purchased from Ales Unlimited in San Francisco.
I have had two versions of Enjoy By this year and they seem better than year's past. I had to go back and up my rating this year. Bold Citrus and fresh taste and is at the top of my IPA list. Definitely think it is better in growler/tap form if you can find it. Seeing more bottle this year here so it seems easier to get than in the past. I try to get it a least a couple times a year.
"Damn near the perfect IPA. I love the hoppy, citrus notes in this beer. It has a nice piney start and grapefruit finish. It is really a role model for IPAs. I'm not enough of a beer ""connoisseur"" to come up with 250 characters, but I would imagine that most people who can write that much about a beer are more pretentious than I aspire to be."

poured from a 22 into a pint gass
Had the enjoy by 2.14.14. 
"Presentation: 22 oz. brown bottle with the 05/16/14 ""Enjoy By"" date right on the label. Served in a Sam Adams pint glass."
"An excellent and we'll balanced DIPA. A fresh and pleasant scent, hinting at fruit. It does not disappoint at first taste, exploding with heavy fruit, especially grapefruit, and plenty of upfront hops. A bit of maltiness helps balance the brew, and masks the alchohol. The perfect amount of bitterness on the finish. Very impressive, reminiscent of Bells HopSlam. My second bomber, and not my last."

"Great, strong IPA from start to finish....not everything is a perfect score, but this comes pretty darn close. Love the piney taste to this one. Lots left on the palate so i suggest drinking this one last or by itself. I had the 4.20.14 batch and I am reviewing based on that."

Enjoy By 4-20. 
"The Stone Enjoy by Series is, for me, becoming one of the best beer series ever. The most recent addition is the Enjoy by 4.20.14 and I think that it's the best one so far. It's very smooth and crisp IPA. I bought this for my Dad for his birthday in a growler and as soon as we were done 64oz he was asking me to go get him another one! My Dad is not a huge IPA guy so the fact that he liked this so much showed me how good this brew was/is, I was unable to operate a vehicle after a few of these due to the 9+ ABV. He said he'd try and go the next day."
4.20.14 bottled 3/13/14. Poured into a large snifter and enjoyed over an hour.
Pours bright crisp golden yellow. Inch or so of head. Light lacing and retention.
"Holy shitballs! Maybe I drank the Kool-aid on this one, I was hesitant of all the great reviews, but this beer is all that and more. I have become a fullblown hop addict I guess?"
"Wow, was really surprised by how good this beer is. Not a big fan of Stone but was really impressed by this IPA. Definitely on par with some other great IPAs like Pliny. Even more surprising is that this one was sold at Costco. Looking forward to more bottles next month."
Poured into a snifter. Enjoy by 4/20.

"Very impressive IPA, love the devastatingly dank 420 feel/taste of the whole beer. It's drinkability with a 9.4% abv is truly amazing. Recent drinker of stone living on the east coast but is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries, well done to everyone at Stone!"
"Enjoy by 4/20/14 poured into a tulip. Appears a beautiful hazy orange color, with a thick, fluffy, off-white head. The head has great staying power, and leaves beautiful lacing as it dissipates."

"Finally decided to review this beer after many many bottles and a few on-tap. This stuff is good, like REALLY good. I'm surprised it isn't rated higher than it is really. This is a serious Imperial IPA. It tastes like one, smells like one, etc. Its probably a little sweeter and malty'er than any other double I have had, and I personally attribute that to the freshness. This months bottle, 04-20-2014 is probably the best one I've had. I'm sure that's just a coincidence... If you have not tried this offering from Stone, try it out ASAP. You probably are not going to find anything better anytime soon. There are few others out there that compete, but are not nearly as READILY AVAILABLE as Stone Enjoy By. Tastes absolutely fantastic straight from a bottle, but if you must, pour it into a glass and do all that looking and sniffing, then gulp it down all the same. Enjoy!"
"I have now enjoyed both the 4/20 and the 2/14 versions of the ""Enjoy By"". I've like every Stone offering that I've tried, so I wasn't surprised to enjoy these. This is an imminently drinkable ale for this amount of alcohol. This had well rounded flavor and seemed to have less of the sweetness than the Lagunitas Undercover. (Which was also amazing) This featured a nice head, pleasant aroma, and smooth mouthfeel."

Enjoy By 4/20/14
Had from a 22oz bottle. Pours a nice copper color with a white head that lasts for quite some time. It has a great nose to it. Has a nice hop nose to it. It has a nice strong but smooth bitterness to it. I definitely enjoy this beer. Not my typical style I go for. But one I would recommend to anyone. Just wish there was more product available. It was the 04/20/2014
"Enjoy by 4/20/14. Clear light amber, golden, pour with a very nice head and long retention lacing. Nose of sweet citrus (mango, orange) over a light grapefruit and earthy dankness background. Light medium bodied with a slick texture. Normally carbonated with no effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is a blend of hop flavors over a slight biscuit sweetness with a low level of bitterness. It begins with the sweet citrus flavors which are soon overpowered by the dank earthy hop components. While complex, the flavor is heavily ""dankcentric"" - lol. On the smooth finish, you get a bit of biscuit sweetness flowing into the dankcentric vortex coupled with a nice residual alcohol tingle at the back of the throat. An exceptional beer that those which wonder what dank means should try."
a: Clear golden; served with a thick creamy head.
Enjoy By 4/20/14
Tried this in a tasting at the beer store. Fruity and hoppy to be sure. A bit over the top for my personal preferences. Enjoy By 08-02-13 batch tasted during mid-July 2013.

"The re-dankulous 4-20 batch. Pours a lovely, hazy golden orange. Smells fantastic: citrus rind, sweet tropical fruit, and heavy pine. Taste is so dank and bitter, you guys; hoppy with a light malty sweetness. Aftertaste is dry, crisp, and bitter. Chewy and smooth. Doesn't get much better than this."

I have had this previously. Written this full review based on 4-20-14 version. Note: Additions made based on 12-26-14 version.
Tasted On: 03-28-2014
Purchased at Total Wine for &lt;$9.00 USD for a 22oz bomber; unbelievable! Poured into a British-style imperial pint glass.
This years offerings so far have taken a serious nose dive! Had the release for Feb and now the March. Bittering is much milder and seems to be off balance now. Flavor is still solid but it is missing the 'grapey' (nelson sauvin?)finish I thought made this beer so unique. Dank hops are much more noticeable in this version. Not sure what has happened to the recipe or if hops used are no longer cost effective but it is not the awesome hop head offering it once was in 2013. Too bad this was definitely one of my favorite readily available IPA's in my area.
"Had this tonight on-tap side-by-side with lunch from Maine. The lunch was sooo much better that it may influence my relatively low rating. This beer had a somewhat soapy taste and while there was a lot of hop bitterness up front, there wasn't too much balance. Also the smell was pretty run of the mill with some mediocre pine and citrus but nothing that really stood out. Maybe Stone advertising the freshness has led to this one being though of more highly than it should otherwise be. I will revisit in bottle form though."
Enjoy By 04.20.14
"appearance; clear gold, decent amount of white head that clings the sides of the glass tightly all the way down."
"22oz bottle, thanks to the good doktorzee for schlepping this back from Vegas for me. Enjoy By 04.20.14 was enjoyed on 03.26.14 - that still gets me in four weeks or so under the gun (and it was bottled only 10 days ago)."

"Here's the quick and dirty. My bottle was dated ""Enjoy By 4-20-14""."
enjoy by 4-20-15- lot of tropical fruit aromas and great flavors.
"Enjoy by 4.20.14, poured from a 750. Pours a translucent light gold with one finger foam. Highly floral aroma with bites of grapefruit. Hop forward crispness with good balance and bitter hoppy finish finish, mild sweetness creates a hop/malt equilibrium. I will eagerly await the next enjoy bye.... Note that I think this 4.20 back surpassed the 2.14 batch."
"I've been slacking on the previous releases of Enjoy By, and haven't had a chance to Enjoy since October 2013. Just got a hold of (4) 4.20.2014 and damn was it good! More than I expected from the last time I had it. I'd say my pallet is more accustom to IPA's now and this is why I rate this beer so high."
Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a Deschutes Brewery snifter.
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of citrus hops, floral hops, sweet malt, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, hops oils, slight floral hops, slight sweet malt, slight alcohol, hint of earthy malt, and a hint of grass. Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, good body, and decent complexity."
Enjoy by 4-20-14 
"APPEARANCE: A fluffy, finger and a half head rests atop a light orange and transparent beer. A few lazy bubbles make their way to the surface as the head fades at a similarly slow pace. Good looking beer, but not a whole lot of lacing."

"Reviewing Enjoy By 4/20/14. Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Dark golden orange sun kissed copper, an even cloudiness keeps it from being completely transparent. As it warms, it clears. White head, fades fast, little to no lacing."
"Just grabbed today; bomber poured into tulip glass -- Have had many of the other Enjoy By releases, but reviewing 4.20.14."
A - Golden orange with really nice lacing. Almost seems to glow.
4/20/14 enjoy by date.
pint bottle 
This was an October release (can't remember exact date.) A bright golden color and strong pine hops made this beer an excellent IPA. The bitterness was not overwhelming.
Always a good dipa. I've had several in this series and all have been fantastic. Some are better than others . . . I think the 4/20/14 was my favorite so far. Looking forward to the 4/20/15. Fast forward . . . 7/4/15 is a solid dipa as well.
Look - orangish color with good head and great lacing
I've been purchasing these released bottles every so often. I've been impressed with the Enjoy By series for quite some time. 
"General: This was the 2/14/14 version of Enjoy By. It was from a bottle swap with a friend, enjoyed it out of a chalice style glass. "
I'm not going to bother with the details; I put this up against Pliny the Elder any day. I would love to do a blind taste test.
Enjoy By 2-14-14 poured into a Tree House Brewing tulip glass.
"Enjoy by 2/14/14. Honey yellow in color with the slightest haze. Started with a shirt white foam that left ladder of sticky lacings down the glass. Pungent, earthy, citrus hop aromas with a hint of malty sweetness beneath. Smooth, incredibly delicate feel with gentle, lazy carbonation and an oily feel toward the finish. Flavor was similar to aroma. Pungent citrus, pineapple, and rioe grapefruit flavors uo front with a tangy hop bite through the middle. Caramel malt flavors peek through toward the end. Very enjoyable."

Bottled 1/10/14. Poured 2/3/14. I believe I paid $6.99 for the bomber.
Poured from bomber into snifter glasses.
"Enjoy By 2.14.14 from Volante Farms (grabbed the last one!). Beautiful with a nice frothy head, golden. My favorite Stone IPA by far. Juicy grapefruit, little bit of spice and resin. A little creamy. Lingering bitterness tastes like orange and pomelo pith. Awesome."
"I love this beer, I had the 4.20 last year and was just blown away, what really grabs my attention is the after taste and the over all freshness behind this beer. This year's 2.14 is amazing too, not quite the 4.20 to me though, but that might just be my palette changing over a year. Stone brewery does it again."
Poured from a bomber into a snifter
Bomber bottled on 1/9/14 into a pint glass.
Bomber poured into tulip
"Enjoy By IPA 02.14.14, enjoyed on 01.31.14 in my DT tulip. Pours a translucent, golden-orange with a loose, quarter-inch, off-white cap that dissipates into a froth and then an oily slick that coalesces into a thin band around the shoulders. Some spots of lacing and a random swath present during the tasting. Great nose - tropical fruit, citrus rind, grapefruit, spiciness and an herbal/piney character. Taste is less fruity than suggested by the nose. Much more of a malty backbone as well as a spicy character and rind towards the finish. An oniony character is also revealed as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a bright, prickly carbonation and a light acidity that stimulates that tongue and salivary glands. Overall, quite interesting, but I have to say that I wish the flavor profile was a closer match for the nose - a bit too much malt and spice and not enough tropical fruit for my sensibilities."
Enjoy by 14-February-2014
Tasting conditions: 8oz glass from 22oz bottle. 50 degrees fahrenheit. 
"I found this beer by surprise at Joe's Inn in Richmond Virginia. I had been keeping an eye out for it for quite some time and it always eluded me, so this was quite a treat."
Vintage: 2014
"Twas a great night. Started with the Stone so from what I remember. Was exceptional. Had a fridge just stocked for a good night of decent beers. Between the Dogfish Head and the local IPA from shipyard (Black and Monkey Fist), This was a spectacular night of great beer. 02.14.14 from Stone was highlight and also the 2nd to last trip to local packy. She sent me for smokes one more time, damn. But came home with a nice lil 5 spot for the night. The Stone was the star but you cant beat 90 min. from Dogfish Head. It's epic and we all know it. The fact i had a Sixer of the the local Shipyard IPA was a bonus and that Black IPA is real damn good. Stone continues to deliver and to be fair I live out in nowhere ME so the fact I'm getting this beer is just plane awesome. Wow I got min of 84 to go and all I can think about is that damn meatloaf i just microwaved. I shall go now and chow. drink well my friends Ü"
I had the 2/14/14 version this past weekend at a great beer spot in DC. 
"This is my first experience with the Enjoy By series from Stone but if it is anything like the rest of their ipas, I'm sure I won't be disappointed. Lets get to it. This one pours a beautiful copper amber hue with a generous white head that gives way to a gentle and lasting Frothy film and decent lacing. The aroma of this is slightly disappointing. At first it seems perfect with a nice sweetness followed by a ton of citrus and floral hops. Alot of grapefruit and mangos, some pine and definitely some skunky grass aromas. As I smell deeper im finding notes of garlic and scallions. Not sure if it fits in this super fresh dipa profile. The flavor is delicious...at first. Super fresh and hoppy, bitter and sweet. Very balanced. A lot of citrus, pine, grass, and some nice malt and yeasty bread notes. But in the aftertaste is still those damn garlic and scallion notes. Its not bad by any means just seems to negatively affect the freshness that this ipa is known for. The body on this beer is wonderful. Medium and a little sticky. Coats the mouth with hoppy goodness for a long while. This is a great beer and I cant wait to try the next date in the series, however I do not believe it is anywhere near Stones finest offerings. But for an allocated beer how can one go wrong at just $7.99 a bomber."
"I had this on tap at Brewhouse grille in Camp Hill, thanks to tenderbranson69 for sharing the bomber with me. Enjoyed chilled from a tulip. "
"I picked up a bottle of Stone's Enjoy By IPA a couple days ago for $7.99 at The Lager Mill. I've never had any beers from the Enjoy By series and this is the first one that I've seen on the shelfs, so I thought I should give it a try, lets see how it goes. Best by 2/14/14. Poured from a brown 22oz bottle into a snifter."
"I had the 2.14 bottle and more recently on tap. From the tap this beer was great. Pour amber orange with white head. The smell was outstanding with a good balanced pine and orange, grapefruit. The taste on this pour was wonderful with hoppy citrus forward and the bitter back end but the malt shined through and finished with some orange. I will say the bottle I had was not even close to this on draft. It was much more bitter and the taste just not as good. On draft this was great overall."
"Enjoy By 2/14/14 - Burlington, VT (Ratings edited 7/15 after trying another (much better) batch)"
22 oz. bottle of 02.14.14
"Wow this is quite a beer. The nose is a wonderful bouquet of citrus fruits, mango, guava, and starfruit. All of the juiciest fruit seems to make an appearance but has none of the tarter and more noticeable citrus flavors are found here. The taste is much in the same vein as the nose but there is a very mild undercurrent of piney and resin flavors underneath. The mouthfeel is almost the best part of this beer. So smooth yet with just a touch of carbonation, on such a robust DIPA it really makes drinking easy and before you know it your bomber is gone!"
2/14/14 Iteration - Bottle poured into DFH IPA Glass
Splashed half in the glass and now just killing it from the bottle. A bit unconventional but why not if I only have a limited time to drink it.

"Got a growler at the Whole Foods in Addison, TX. Nice. "
Had this puppy on tap at bottle revolution in Raleigh NC. Was so much better than I remembered.
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle picked up at Sprouts in Poway CA. Apperance is light golden with a pretty thin head upon pouring. Smells really fruity and hoppy. Very sweet smelling beer along with citrus notes and pine. Mouthfeel is thin. Taste…wow. Much sweeter then I was expecting! Not really any malt balance on this brew, very hop forward, but what else what you expect from a Stone IPA? I've been drinking lots of brown ales and stouts lately and this was my first IPA back from my malty phase, I enjoyed this brew but its almost a little TOO sweet for me personally. Hop heads should love this one."
Glad to finally see this one make it to Central PA...
"Pours a two finger head into my DFH IPA glass. The head has a strong resemblance of clean sea foam, if there ever was such a thing. Pretty deep amber, almost glows."

Enjoy by 2.14.14 served in a Citizen Cider snifter.
"Having a 7/4/16 on the last day on 7/4/16 to review. Nice orange semi-cloudy color and 1 finger frothy head. Smell is nice citrus combined with some resiny Stone patented familiarity. A really nice hearty brew with solid amount of citrus and resin. Lots of warmth and bigness and chewiness to this beer, nothing watery going on. A full bodied DIPA if I've had one. A nice standard DIPA, but a tad pricy. Will still periodically buy as its always better than most other store options to bring home."
"First reviewed in January, 2014; revisited as available. This review is Enjoy By 04.20.15."
"Enjoy by 02.14.14 IPA is a prisitine clear orange liquid topped with foamy light brown head that leave behind a nice foaming coating on the glass. The excellent appearance gives way to a strong sweet apricot hoppy nose that is simply delicious. On the tongue is it presents a strong hoppy bite. Behind that lies a fruity citrus that gives way to a wonderfully balanced lingering hop. In the mouth this beer is smooth, refreshing, clean and crisp. Quite simply this is a fantastic IPA. Certainly worth a night for the IPA lover. I don't advise is for a new drinker or non IPA person."
Enjoy by 02/14/14
"I had the 12/2013 version. I've never really been blown away by a beer like this. Color and appearance was good (orange-gold), smell was nice (floral? it was a while ago)... but the flavor! The sheer ecstasy of this brew's first greeting to my taste buds seared itself into my mind and to this day has yet to let go. An incredibly balanced blend of citrus (orange, tangerine), warm bread, spices and hops... every flavor in perfect proportion, bold and up front and yet somehow sharing the stage equally with all the other elements going on - absolutely divine! If you ever see this, buy as much as you can and share it with good friends quickly."
2-14-14
"Wow, I was surprised by this ""Enjoy by 02/14/14 IPA"" the look was typical of an IPA, a solid golden yellow/brown color with a good head. The smell was amazing; it might be the best part of the beer, an insane combo of floraly hops with a soft piney caramel to it. The mouth feel, sort of gummy, chewy, beer with a smooth finish. These taste is the only part that levels off the beer. A very solid pine cone cinnamon flowery finish that is classical of a solid IPA. Overall a great IPA. I'd have another."
Bomber poured into a tulip
Poured into a dogfish head IPA glass. Bottled 1/9/14 (enjoy by 2/14/14 edition).
"Poured from a 22oz. bottled about 12 days ago. Smell is beautiful and everything I want in a double IPA. Pine, grass, citrus, lemon, very small hints of alcohol. Taste is similar to how it smells. Opens with the piney/grassy taste, citrus fruit hits and finishes with a slight pear flavor. Very minimal alcohol flavor here. Very well hidden. This is my favorite beer and is my #1 recommended. Find it. It's worth it"

"A: Pours a golden orange with an almost gray ring of head.\r\n\r\nS: Nose is utterly dominated by tangerine, fresh orange and other similar fruits, with just a touch of simcoey garlic.\r\n\r\nT: Fresh orange juice, citrus peel, onion, tangerine, tropical fruit, papaya. Delicious.\r\n\r\nM: Full bodied and smoother than your average IPA.\r\n\r\nO: By far my favorite beer from Stone. Uncharacteristic of them, hop-profile-wise, and that is a massive plus for me.\r\n\r\nNote: My version was best by 2.15.13, and I had it a couple days after this particular batch\'s release (It wasn\'t even on the shelf yet)."
"Enjoying a fresh 2.14.14. Glad to get this again in georgia. The last we got of this was 4.20 and i did not stock up enough. Once you crack this bottle you know you got something special. The aroma is funky is all the best ways. Great appearance and nice fluffy bit of head. Flavors are citrus, pine and ripe tropical fruit. Bitterness dominates the party in the best way. Mouth is just the slightest bit thin for a double ipa, but it wont detract from the overall experience. Alcohol is there for sure but not at all in the way. One of the best beers i have had since the last Enjoy By. Cant believe my local package store only got one case (!). Great representation of a west coast ipa and i will be buying each and every botle i see of this stuff."
"pours a crystal orange color nice head. Smells amazing hops citrus pine mmmm mmmm taste is of pine, orange, just enough bitterness on the tongue without killing the palate... abv is well hidden no booze no burn just a great balanced dipa... Will enjoy by any time I can get it..."
"A DIPA does not get much better than this. The top tier beers of the style come to mind when you taste and smell this beer. Citrus, pine, are all present in both taste and smell. You cannot taste the ABV at all. The appearance is unbelievable. If you can get this beer, buy it."
Bomber poured into a matching Stone pint glass. The brew appears a perfectly clear golden copper color. A white finger appears atop and fades back leaving patchy lace on the glass. A swirl revives a finger effortlessly.
Great overall double IPA. Definitely one of our favorites. We highly recommend this beer to the fellow DoubleIPA enthusiast. We've managed to get our hands on every bottle shipped to southern California since 12.21.12 and on tap at our local craft bar. Cheers!
"Poured this 22 oz bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Consumed well before ""Enjoy By"" date. The body was light honey colored and clear. The white head left webby lacing in the glass. Very pretty."

"A- hazy gold with two fingers of fluffy off-white head. Head retention is great, but I could use a bit more lacing."
"It was a pleasant surprise to come across an Enjoy By at my local craft brew mart. Aware of the hype, I ran to the cooler to pick up a (22 oz approx) bottle of the 12/13/2013 circulation."
11.12.13
Currently drinking 12.12.13.
Ive had almost every release in bottles in CA
"I'm reviewing 12-13-13: Stone is the brand here in SD. Having said that, I'm typically a Green Flash guy. So it was with a little trepidation that I believed the hype on this beer. From the minute you pop the cap the hop fragrance takes hold of you. Smelled of weed and citrus, with a dash of pine. The first sip socks your jaw with hop pungency and light caramel tones. Then you notice the nice head and great color this brew displays. The alcohol is up there, being a DIPA, but doesn't overpower or take your buds off of the taste. Just enough kick on the back end. Very drinkable, and the mouthfeel is full, but not cottony. Overall one of my top 3 brews HANDS DOWN. Can't wait for 2-14-14...Get you some!"
"Enjoy By 5/17/13, bottled 4/12/13 and consumed 4/20 from a tulip"
"Enjoy by 12/13/13 22oz. bomber into Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Awesome painted-label bottle (great for bottling homebrew) with green, easy to read label. Thanks to Julian at Craftshack for expediting this to me to drink before the enjoy by date. I'm sure it would"
"Enjoy By 12/13/13, bottle shared at Albany Taproom"
Appearance - Honey/amber color with an off-white/cream head. Nice foam lacing.
"09.13.13 version. Pours a two finger off-white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Light hazy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit hop nose and flavor is nearly sweet grapefruit and some pineapple, lingering grapefruit aftertaste. Higher ABV is hidden. $6.99 for a 22oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA."
"Overall, I feel that this beer series is amazing. I have now had two different of the Enjoy By brews. One was in a bottle and the other was on tap. Both times they were still good. They are definitely worth trying and I don't feel someone would be disappointed."
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Enjoyed out of the classic brown bottle with an enjoy by date that also doubles as the enormous silkscreened label. This is from the 12.13.13 batch. Poured into a Belgian tulip glass because that's all I have clean.
Quick review
Appearance: A beautiful golden orange color with a thin white head. A very refreshing look to it in which I couldn't wait to dive in. Didn't appear too heavy on the carbonation but it made it's presence known.

Pours golden orange yellow with light sticky lacing that hangs around for a while.
"Enjoy by 12.13.13 bomber. Lots of resiny smell, fresh thick hops, dry intense grapefruit aromas, colour is a bright clear gold, plenty of carbonation but the smoothest mouthfeel and no hint of alcohol, this is really awesome, smooth balanced profile, tons of hop character. Really well constructed IIPA and just an amazingly fresh tasty beer. Pleasant dry finish and a quenching juicy drinkability."

12.13.13 edition poured into a goblet
"Amazing IPA. Extremely fresh and full of citrus hops. As fresh as you can get out a bottle. Initial taste is full of fresh grapefruit, pineapple, and a bit of orange hops. Carbonation is absolutely perfect. The beer is so fresh tasting that it gives you quenching like taste."
"Enjoy by 12.13.13, which means bottled 11.08.13 (so a month old)."
This is the 12.13.13 variation of this beer. 22 oz. bomber poured into Stone pint glass.
A - Poured a clear golden amber with a white frothy head that sticks around the entire time. A gorgeous looking beer. 
"I went to a craft beer market, ask a staff for the best IPS he ever had, the guy didn't even blink and grab me this Stone IPA Enjoy By 12-12-13, pour with a nice inch foam, light orange color, floral aroma that I really enjoy it, first it had bitter taste, but in a good way, smooth finished."
"Maybe the prettiest IPA I've ever seen: absolutely transparent, beautiful golden color, small head that dissipates but I'm still pretty psyched about the color and clarity of this beer. Smell is massive grapefruit hops, some citrus, random hints of random fruits. Insane hop flavor right away! Heavy floral hops, then grapefruit, then citrus, then the massive bittering kicks in. Absolutely coats the mouth. The bitterness is a little higher than I usually like but the fresh hop character is astounding. Aside from the lingering bitterness, the finish is really crisp and dry on this - I just realized this is 9.4% abv and now I'm even more impressed. Way too easy to drink considering its strength. It's easy to love stronger ales but this one really deserves it."
"Had on tap on 11/21/13 at Stone's bar in the San Diego Airport. I'm unsure of what the ""Enjoy By"" date is."
Stone Brewing Enjoy by 10.25.13 IPA
"One of the best DIPA's I've ever had. One of the best beers I've ever had; it really is quite amazing. Tried the 12/13/13 and it was 10/10 honestly. Ingeniously fresh with an amazing hoppy flavor, bitter but not overly bitter at all. Perfect. Not a single hint of the 9.4 ABV. Not quite sure on the IBU's but either way, it is everything you could ask for in a beer. Good job Stone, good job."
Stone Enjoy by 11 12 13

Stone Enjoy By 12-13-13
"Reviewing the 12/13/13. Aroma: Very herby, slightly metallic, resinous and skunky. Appearance: clear gold, little carbonation and nearly any foam. Very dry, off bitterness. notes of cinnamon, spice, herbs, resin and biscuit are available. Not too much citrus available. Overall, one of the more basic/standard Enjoy By's I have experienced. Not bad. Bitter, alcohol filled, dry."

Enjoy By 11.12.13
Beautiful pour from 22oz into pub glass. Golden Color nice lacing and decent head. Complex hops on the nose citrus and some onion dank like pleasant fresh smell. Heavy alcohol mouthfeel. No real carbonation. A sweaty strong too bitter unbalanced finish which is the only part of this I didn't love. Really don't understand the devotion to this series as its not Stone's best. Stone Ruination IPA even thought higher in IBU finishes so much cleaner than this.
Update. 12/25/15 version.
Poured into a Stone balloon glass. 7-04-15 edition.
Poured from 22 oz bottle into tulip glass. The 11/12/13 batch.
This was the 11.12.13 vintage. Beautiful pour from a growler with a nice head. One of my favorite things when sipping this was the smell each time I put the glass near my mouth. 
This Enjoy By 11/12/2013 deserves my first beer review.
Appearance: a yellowish orange color. good clarity. a half finger of an off white head. doesn't last too long.
"Bought this a few weeks back down at Joe Canal's in Woodbridge. It was behind glass, so I had a feeling that this was pretty special since they had to open up the case to get one for me. Seeing that 11/12/13 is next week, I did enjoy this by its due date and eagerly anticipated the freshness of this. While I thought that the hype turned out to be a bit much for this, I enjoyed this beer and the easy drinkability of this, given how high the alcohol was. It was much smoother than I thought and went down easily, even though I split the bottle with a good friend of mine!"

"Great beer!!! Beside The Heady Topper, I consider this the best double IPA. This has a great smell to it. A beer you just want to take your time with an enjoy the taste. I can drink this beer all day. Stone makes some great beers. I thinks this is the best of there beers..."
Tried this quite a few times in the bottle but was lucky enough to get it on tap at the awesome Gramercy Tavern in NYC.

11.12.13 reviewed here
A- Poured into a tulip glass with a copper orange color with a white head.
"Ok, I have to start this review out with a slight disclaimer... This is Enjoy By 9.13.13... This was a lucky shelf pull late in the game for me, as this series is not readily available where I live. So, I am enjoying this beer a little over a month late... however, I am quite sure that the hop flavor has not broken down in any sort of drastic way. I believe in drinking hoppy beers fresh, but unlike a lot of the talk on the BA message boards, I strongly believe IPAs have a shelf life of several months (and even at that point they are not totally 'bad')."
"Although being the same beer everytime (just new batches) just like evrything else at Stone, its consistent. I enjoyed the Hoppiness without the distraction of so much bitterness, which was a bit wierd for a stone beer. I was expecting a booze bomb but its actually very balanced. A very smooth 9.4% abv."
"Bottle. Opened 2 days before ""drink by"" date. Clear dark yellow with a fluffy white head. Initially upon opening, there is a nice hop aroma, but it attenuates slight soon thereafter. Big malt profile that overpowers the hops. No doubt that this is a double. Some apricot in the nose, but mostly hops and malt. The flavor is good, but the bitterness is a little harsh. Palate is perfect for a double. Medium carbonation that rapidly dissipates. It's a big beer. Well done, but a little heavy-handed. I like what Stone is trying to do here. I just prefer an IPA with a bit more balance."

"I've had several of these ""best by"" beers and they have all been delicious. I have had slightly maltier incarnations, but this one, 11/12/13, is one of the brighter and sweeter specimens. it has the maltiness that an imperial should while still getting that sharp and bright hop character that Stone IPAs are famous for. "
"This is the 11/12/13 model. Light, lively and fresh. A very deceptive 9.4% on the palate, it hits the head not long after passing the gums. Mild peach and nectarine notes in the flavor, along with the same sort of tartness and bitterness those fruits can provide. A lingering top note of sweetness is there that persists beyond the IPA bitterness. "
"Very appealing, pours nice with amber color. It smells floral with piney notes in the end, some citrus hints... Refreshing taste, the fruity notes hids the alcohol very well. Smooth! Overall...me like it so much...I will definitely buy a couple of more bottles."
"Pours a clear golden orange with a medium off-white head. Aromas of grapefruit rind and vanilla. Taste begins with some massive apricot, followed by some candied dates, then some resinous, pine Forrest finish. Mouthfeel is super rich. Overall an excellent DIPA. The expiration date being clearly marked is a HUGE plus, I wish all hoppy beers were labeled this way."
"Poured from bottle into a goblet. This was the newest version of the best by series (by 11.12.13). I thought this beer was outstanding. Very mellow for a double. It poured like most IPAs with the golden hue with average head. Smell was good, but not anything special. Overall, it was outstanding. I was mightily impressed by Stone with this one."
A-pours a crystal clear golden color with a medium small off white head that has good retention and very good lacing.

I think next to American Double IPA they need to put a picture of this (or a sample). This is the stuff that this style is all about. And this is pretty much the best style there is. So this is the stuff.

The Beers of California
Copper yellow in color. Nice full creamy head with solid lacing. Sharp and dry in the mouth. Huge citrus hops with nice bitter after taste. Some herb notes. Not much malt flavors but what would think with DIPA. A nice brew that goes well with most foods. Had beef tacos with my taste.
"Pours a bright copper color. Aroma of citrus, pine and dank herb. In the taste, pine and mango like tropical fruityness. Bright citrus and tropical fruit profile with some strong bitterness. Little hint of alcohol but quite bitter with a honey like malt profile. Medium bodied, with a moderate carbonation and smooth overall feel. This is a great imperial IPA, but much too exclusive."

"Review written based on notes. So I was able to enjoy by 9/13/13, at which point the beer becomes angry and turns to molten lava which burns the esophagus."
"1700th review! 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/9/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge pineapple, mango, passion fruit, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, peach, floral, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity of tropical and citrus hops with a moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, passion fruit, pine, floral, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, passion fruit, pine, floral, and light caramel on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity of big citrus/tropical hop flavors with surprisingly light pine presence; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA as expected. All around awesome complexity of tropical/citrus hops; and dangerously smooth to sip on for the ABV. An extremely delicious offering."
"Enjoy by on the day. A day of both sadness and joy as we say goodbye to a grandma and celebrate the b-day of my son. A big 4. A memorable day capped by a memorable beer. Stone lives up to their rep and the hype. Great beer living up to a day to remember for a life, capped by 9/13/13 . Truly enjoyed as we celebrate a life well lived for 93 years and the exhuberence of a 4 year old. A great lasting Hops enfused beer memory."

"Long time craft beer drinker and enthusiast, but this is my first review on Beer Advocate. This review is for 9.13.13."
"Just opened a bottle of 09.13.13 and this is one of the best beers I've ever had. It tastes like I got it straight from the brewery. Smooth, hoppy without being over-bearing and a finish as smooth as silk. It's everything that I wish Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA would have been without the mouth-destroying feel."
"It poured a nice golden hue with a subdued white head. The aroma of hops jumped out of the bottle with fruity citrus notes, a bit of pine and even the dank hops I know and love. There are obviously a lot of hops which is to be expected from a Stone IPA, but they were handled very well. Loads and loads, but balanced so as not to give you the bitter beer face or palate wrecking experience of some IPAs. There were tropical fruits and citrus on the front end with the pine bitterness coming through on the back leaving a nice bitter coating on your palate. All of these great hop flavors were riding a danky hoppiness that held it all together. The Enjoy By IPA really handled the hops with a more delicate balance. One of my all time favorite IPAs."
"Dank, dank IPA. Very good. I have had several of the enjoy by batches, and have loved every one. Best consumed on a warm day straight from a pint glass."
Review is done from notes. I had this brew while on vacation in South Carolina. I seem to have trouble finding Stone special releases at home. Anyways...
Enjoyed 3 bottles of this fine brew between 2 and 3 weeks after their bottling date. Extremely floral on the nose and in the mouth. Very crisp and fresh. One of my favorite IPA's.
"Enjoy by 9.13.13, enjoyed on 8.23.13."

"Unbelievably fresh, aromatic, and deliciously balanced IPA befitting the ratings it's received here. I'm looking forward to trying it on draft soon. The notes of fruit are apparent immediately and the finish is undeniably smooth. Up there with Heady Topper with my favorite IPA so far."
This is a review of the 09.13.13 IPA. Drank it on 09.04.13.
"Fantastic IPA! Great aroma and color as soon as you tap it! Had the privilege of enjoying it on tap at the Craft Ale House in Limerick, PA. This beer rivals Pliny The Elder or Firestone Double Jack IPA. Great citrus from the first sip and great hops throughout with a good malty finish. This is a top flight beer!"
Served on tap at three rivers six pack in delmont
"A- poured a very light orange - practically see through,and about a finger width head that ended up dissolving. Medium lacing."
"Picked up a couple bombers of this gem from Carson Street Deli on the South Side of Pittsburgh. Specifically, this is the ""9/13/13"" edition. Poured the first one into a snifter. Don't judge me, but I drank the whole bottle myself. Good decision."
"I was so excited to see a local bottle shop, Vino Rosso in Idaho Falls got a keg of Enjoy by 9-13-13! They had it posted on a sandwich board out side the shop that said ""Get it while you can!!!!"". I was actually off the day I had it and was just swinging by the office to pick up my paycheck and take it to the bank,which is right by the bottle shop,how convenient! It was heaven in a glass!!! Nice and stinky,looked just perfect,color,carb,lacing... and it was a taste explosion. Hop bomb delight!!!! This is the first beer I have ever given a 5 to. I swore I didn't think there was a 5 out there,there is,this is it!!! Went back the next night with my built in designated driver(my wife) and enjoyed a few more! If this beer has and equal or one is ever brewed I hope the good lord sees it fit to have it find it's way to my lips...It is the holy grail of beers as far as I am concerned!!!"
Meet the new boss... 9.13.13
"Clear pale orange colored with a low white head that leaves legs of lace rising up the dudes of the glass. Low aroma of honied mslt and orange rind. Rich flavor bursting with hop flavors - grapefruit, tangerine and orange rind pith. Subtle malt balance, but this is a showcase of hops. Mild bitterness, understated alcohol strength. Slightly slick mouthfeel. Overall a great beer."
"Consistently impressive west coast DIPA. Has that prototypical yellow-gold color I associate with wcipas. Nose is super piney with a hint of citrus. This is 7.4.14 and I think it's less citrusy than previous ones. Mouthfeel is light but creamy, yet it still carries a bite. Aftertaste is really dry. This is a liquid pine cone that nearly bites your face off."

I've heard others descripe this as 'juicy'...now I know what they meant. Beautiful aroma of citrus and pear. Perfectly balanced. A nice smooth mouth feel that only accentuates the malty sweetness on the back of the palate. A 'must have' in these waning days of summer.

91313 Poured from the 22 oz. bottle into an Innis & Gunn flute.
"First off, love the feel of this beer. Fresh hops, some pine, peach or lighter fruit, and then a nice spiciness to finish. Smell is not as balanced, a bit overpowered by the hops, but it still smells wonderful. Just as good from the bottle as it is on tap in my humble opinion"
"Review of 9-13-13. Pours a glorious crystal-clear amber color with a pure white foam that dissipates a bit quickly. The nose gives a powerful blend of pine and citrus hops, with a hint of nectarine underneath. The first sip is wonderfully rich and complex, with an assertive (but not over-the-top) hoppiness evenly balanced with a subtly sweet caramel malt and an odd twinge around the edges that I just can't put my finger on -- maybe a weird blend of mango and onion? Very nice smooth texture, relatively full-bodied, dry on the upper palate. The finish is kind of short, but leaves a nice lingering bitterness. Overall, an excellent example of the DIPA style. Well done, gentlemen."
"Poured (into a tulip) almost the color of a single malt with smallish head that quickly disappeared to nothing. Nose was wonderful - citrus (especially orange and grapefruit) grass and some other herbs in the back. Taste is, at first, pretty dry and bitter but quickly gives way to sweet citrus notes of lemon, mango and grapefruit. Finish brings in just enough malt to balance this nicely. Alcohol warming is there as you would expect with the ABV, but not excessively. Carbonation is fairly low but present nevertheless. Mouthfeel is medium but doesn't present an overly cloying or sticky feel as you might expect. All-in-all, this is a delicious west-coast style IPA I hope Stone shares again."

"Okay so the only and I mean the only reason I do not give this beer a blanket 5.0 is that only God is perfect. I mean there is no such thing as a perfect woman so I guess beer would have to fall in that category, please beer take no offense. I usually do not get excited about the color of a beer this one though has a nice peach looking color to it great eye appeal, just something a little different from other IPA's and their copper-orange color. Great hit of citrus when I stuck my nose in my glass, holy crud the alcohol content is hitting me already, WOW, and lingered well after the head fizzled down. The same with the first intake of the beer, real good citrus flavor followed by a smooth and mellow wheat flavor. For being an Imperial (double IPA) this is unusually mellow yet like I said holy crud the alcohol is hard hitting. This is definately not a swilling IPA, take the time to really enjoy this IPA, you will be pleased each pull on this beer is just as good as the first. The good thing is that the after taste of the beer does not hang around leaving you with that ""I just licked a leather boot heal"" taste in your mouth that some shoddier IPA's will have the tendency to do. This is an excellent IPA, I look forward to the next batch of Enjoy By, Stone Brewing be darn proud of this beer, darn proud. Now if you all will excuse me I have a girlfriend to go drink."
"Pours a golden amber with a quickly dissipating, two finger head that settles into a spotty cap that lasts throughout. Decent lacing. Great floral aroma up front with nice sweet malt notes in the background. Hoppy bitterness hits the front of the tongue followed by a torrent of pine resin and grapefruit rind. Sweet malt backbone balances the hops nicely. Mouthfeel is where this ale shines; smooth and easy drinking for the ABV. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Overall, this is an outstanding example of an Imperial IPA, extremely well crafted and balanced. Kudos Stone."
Finally tried this. On tap at Bottle Revolution in Raleigh. Looks great. Fantastic aroma with lots of citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor heavy on the bitterness over the more subtle hop flavors. Great stuff. I hate that it's hard to find but like the emphasis on freshness.
"A beer, I have been wanting to try...that doesn't come along so much anymore. I'm not saying it's hyped up but I love fresh IPA. The concept was something I fell in love with the date is 8/24/13 the bottle says to drink by 9/13/13. Look it's expressive in appearance, copper bright body almost an orange layered hue to the beer with cream almost white head forms thick. Fine speckled lacing I'm again in love, why does this have to be the beer, one which sells out quicker than stores can get it in. Aroma has bright grapefruit, citrus notes that expel any notion of less than fresh hops. It's actually an explosion of hops withheld in a room of fresh hops, earthy qualities are dumbed down by bright citrus. Each gulp goes down smoother than the next, beautiful beer I'm drinking each sip thinking where is the next drink coming from that's a strong hook that radio DJs look for in every overproduced song on the market. This is not overproduced it's just the best quality beer of every quality IPA you have ever tried. Slick oily mouthfeel leads to expressive carbonation levels soft and excellent between every twist and turn get me a case and I will drink it."
thanks phillyz for bringing this over as a surprise one morning
Clear amber golden colored ale with a puffy white head. Surprisingly light colored.
"I've had a few versions of this brew, but tonight I had the 9-13-13 version twice on tap at the Global Brew Tap Room in O'Fallon, IL. Served in a Boulevard tulip both times. Clear body, dark yellow with slight orange tint. About a one-finger head and decent lacing along the glass."
Pours a brilliant brassy hue with a foamy cream colored head. Patches of sticky lace.
got the 9/13 brew.... solid attack on the senses. 
Finally. I've been trying to get my hands on this for a year now. Bottle from Mainbrew. 
Review By 9.13.13
Review of 9.13.13 variety. First review on 8/23. 2nd review on 8/31 Poured from bottle into IPA glass.
"A - Yellow-orange. I could care less about appearance, so unless it's really beautiful or really ugly, it will get the average of the other ratings. Who drinks a beer for appearance anyway?"
"Bottle purchased from Fleming Place in Topeka, KS. Bottle on 08/?/13. Enjoy by 9/13/13. Enjoyed out of a Tallgrass cervoise glass. Poured straight from the fridge. "
"Bomber into a nonic pint, 9.13.2013 batch."
"22 oz. bottle, with the bottled on date chipped and smeared away. The 10th batch of this beer, and the first I've managed to get my hands on. Stone Enjoy By 09.13.13, a more than obvious vintage date. I've been sitting on this bottle for about a week now, so I don't see the need to wait any longer! Exponentially stoked to have gotten this."
10 day old bottle into an unbranded Rastal Luttich.
On tap poured into snifter. 
A-A nice golden color with low carbonation. A very clear pour.
"Having tried this a couple years back and not being blown away, I wanted to give it another shot right after trying the Unfiltered version (one of my favorite DIPAs). This version (4.20.16) is definitely better than the last version I had (less dank and piney), and clearly shares the same hops as the Unfiltered version. However, where Unfiltered was a bright hazy orange, this is a clear gold. Unfiltered also has a much more juicy and full taste."
Poured from bottle to tulip.
Appearance- Pours up a copious amount of head which has pretty good retention. The head is pure cotton white while the body is a pale amber which glows a little bit lighter when held up to the light. Some lacing left behind.
"This is the best beer I have had since I started to get into craft beers. I have always loved skunky beers and this beer has tremendous hoppy flavor, but it also has a piney slightly skunky flavor. I've had Pliny the Elder and I think this beer has an edge on it."
"9/13/13 version. Pours a translucent, golden orange color with a finger length head that dissipates somewhat quickly and leaves a sticky lacing. Aroma is amazing. Tons of of overly ripe pineapple, some grapefruit, orange, papaya, mango, peach, more tropical fruit notes, pine, tiny bit of breadiness and sweetness from the malts. Taste starts with some bitterness, but more tropical and citrus fruits like pineapple, papaya, grapefruit, mangos, some floral qualities as well. Was already smooth on the front end, but then gets even smoother and creamier in the middle from the malts that somewhat balance it. Then finishes dry with more tropical and citrus fruits, as well as some pine qualities. Very smooth and crisp finish that cleans the palate and makes you want to take another sip. Has a slight sweetness throughout, which complements the hop characters and gives the hop flavors almost a gummy bear-like taste. High medium, oily body. No alcohol detected at all. From what I read, this beer is made with mostly flavoring hops and not many bittering hops. I agree with this, as there are just massive amounts of juicy fruits in this. Better than Ruination in my opinion. Well done!"
My wife picked a few of these up for me at her work.

"22 oz. bottle, Enjoy By 09.13.13. Poured into a tulip glass."
"Enjoy By 09.13.13... bottled on 8/9/13. I've had a few vintages from this series in the past. 22oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a beautiful transparent golden with a slight haze, fluffy eggshell white head that sticks around and leaves great rentention and lacing. The aromas are great and full of sticky mango, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, lime zest. It's extremely tropical. There's some pine needles in the mix as well. The flavors are wonderful, but not aggressively bitter. There's a subtle amount of malts that give this one a decent sweetness. There's a little bit of pine in the finish. Mouthfeel is nice. It's on the lighter side of full-bodied; moderate carbonation. Alcohol goes completely unnoticed and this is extremely easy to drink."
"Originally reviewed on 6/15/13. Despite the modest review, I kept coming back to this beer. Now that it's back in my neck of the woods, I'm ready to try it again. "
9/13/13
"Based on the 08.02.13 batch. Poured a gorgeous clear amber, with a half finger white head. It looks fantastic poured into a tulip. Scents of pine, citrus, especially grapefruit, pineapple, slight tropical fruit and a bit of malt. The scent is fantastic and entices you to drink. Each sniff made me want to take the first sip more and more. Flavor begins with a burst of bitter citrus and grapefruit pith moving into a blend of grapefruit and bitter pine and finishing with a nice resiny pine flavor and aftertaste. A hint of malt sweetness in the middle blends wonderfully with the hop flavors and a noticeable alcohol presence hits at the end. An amazing double IPA flavor profile, comparing favorably with the best of the others of it's style I've tasted. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It's standard, but not bad. A sublime double IPA. Full of hop flavor, with an extreme bitterness and citrus flavors. It slams your palette with it's assertive flavor and doesn't relent. Well worth getting, a fantastic beer and a great showing from Stone."
"I had the pleasure to have this in bottle and on tap. For a beer with a abv of around 9 it sure doesn't taste like it. It was a nice aroma and an excellent hoppy taste. The only bad thing about this beer is its avalibility. Unless you live on the left coast its gonna be hard to get some here in mass, but if you are fortunite to get your hands on it enjoy every ounce of this wonderfull beer."
enjoy by 9.13.13 poured into a Stone Ruination pint glass
This pours golden with a delicious looking creamy head. Where are the bubbles?! Very few are surfacing. I see through this and the body appears lighter than I would have guessed based on the abv. 
"I've been told that ""Enjoy By IPA"" varies from batch to batch. In that case, I've had a taste from an amazing batch, because this was as exceptional as an IPA gets. The nose was fruity, floral, not too herbal or piney; I won't bore anyone with talk of lacing or head retention, lets cut right to the flavor. Oh my god. The marriage of fruity and citrusy hops is mind blowingly delicious and so different from the herbal, piney IPAs that Stone is known for. If you are a fan of IPAs, you must try this and see for yourself. I dream about this beer at night and think about it when I'm thirsty. I'm hooked!"
this is the best beer i've ever had and I drink alot of beer. Amazing how they've dry-hopped the 
"Golden colored and pristine clarity. Moderate head retention. Beautiful. Lots of of busy carbonation bubble business. Intensely pine aroma, very freshly picked and it shows in the nose. Taste is intensely hop oriented. Did I just bite into a hop straight off of the vine? Wow! This is truly a unique and wonderful experience. Must try."
"651mL Enjoy By 12.21.12 bottled on 11/16/12 and consumed 11/27/12. Hot tamale. Big thanks to peteinsd for this one! Pours still near chardonnay white to brilliant gold. Full clarity, not bottle conditioned like it should be. Medium, buttermilk head. Spotty lace. Nose is soft orange fruits, nectar fruits, peach, white grapes, Alpine style butterscotch, salted caramel. Yumm. Taste is oily, lightly bitter, not too aggressive, actually very soft with white grape juice, white peach, some white pepper. Very nice. Reminds me of Alpine Duet. Palate is oily, spicy. 8/4/8/5/16=4.1"
Bottled: 6/28/2013
"This was for the 7th batch, reviewed in early May. Light tan head. creamy, one finger high. Good retention and lacing. Pale golden color and crystal clear. Aroma is wonderfully hoppy. Crisp, pungent, and fresh hops. Mango, citrus rind, tropical fruits, pine, and notes of grass. The taste is much the same with plenty of tropical fruits/mango, big citrus kick, pine, loads of bitterness, grassy notes, with a light malt backing that adds just a nice rounding to the barrage of hops. The mouthfeel is great. Not too full at all. Moderate carbonation works well to keep it lighter feeling, light-medium and filmy consistency, medium body, and a nice and bitter crisp finish."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, pineapple, and small orange citrus hops. In the taste, big fresh hops, with orange citrus and a mix of pine hops, and a small minty like burn. A nice hop bitterness and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dryer fresh pine hop like aftertaste. Big and fresh hops, the only flaw, it is almost too fresh, but really nice."
"Marvelous beer - Enjoy by date 8/2/13, bottled 6/28/13, drank 7/7/13. It just doesn't get fresher than this in a bottle. Smooth mouthfeel, awesome hop fragrance, dry and not very sweet, definitely leaves the palate clean like unsweetened lemonade or grapefruit. "
Enjoy by 7/4/13
"Served from a bottle into a snifter at cellar temperature. This bottle reads ""Enjoy By 07.04.13,"" and it was bottled on the 31st of May."
"I understand there is a huge demand right now for Double IPA hop assault beers. And Stone’s masterful play to this demand with the Enjoy By series has to be appreciated. They are not just playing to the market, they are also making multiple crazy hop balanced, big IPAs, that make your palate ride that sharp toothy edge of huge IBUs without drawing blood. If you know how to brew, you know it’s not easy to do."
"This is one beer by Stone which surpasses all others. This beer provides a less bitter apathy, which stone usually comprises in their beer. I believe enjoy by is a great taste that one should definitley have if one has not tried."
"Excellent sudsy mouthfeel. Handsome orangey, golden amber in the St. Bernardus globe. A nice foam that renews with each small pour. Spicy aroma and huge flowery, resiny nose."
Appearance: Copper in color. Clear with no haze. Nice lacing that holds onto the glass.
"Great change for Stone, vearing away from their Special B malt notes and hitting the nail on the head with their Enjoy By 7-4-13. Really pretty amber gold pour with a finger of white head. Nice strong fruity flavors with a plesant after flavor of citrus. I got like 5 bottles... Score!"
"7-4-13 Bottle, reviewing live. (first EVER Enjoy By, believe it or not)"
"What can I say? Perfect Pilsner-like color* For those who would argue that it should be more appropriately copper colored... *The first officially designated American craft brewed IPA was Grant’s, and it contained Pilsener malts of this golden hue. The nose is an exquisite melange of grapefruit, Mandarin orange, tangerine, pinapple, mango, kiwi, and lemon/lime. The flavors follow suit, and the body is medium to full with just the right amount of malt backbone which is more of a textural thing, in this case, than a flavor enhancer. The hops are given free reign to truly shine here. The balance is nearly flawless, right through the long, dry finish which is crisp, and remarkably refreshing. Wow!"
"Newest batch: 07-04-13. Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that goes down quickly. Scent is immediately floral, but quickly fades to DANK hops. I can't help but be reminded of the hoppy beers from Alpine when I smell this special offering from Stone. The hop scent on this is just so damn inviting, it's ridiculous. Sweet, but not malty...it's a sweet, hoppy resin aroma. Some pine and a ton of citrus fruit with a hint of pineapple and mango. Taste is just as it smells. It is so hard to explain this beer, because it is so delicious and everything an imperial IPA should be. So fresh and so clean...as Outkast would say. Mouthfeel is crisp and medium bodied. Drinkability is VERY high! This is a top notch IPA that reminds me of the quality that Alpine produces. Definitely my favorite hoppy Stone beer."
"A: Pours a crystal clear bronzy gold. Head off white, tight bubbles."
"07.04.13-I've had other entries in Stone's 'Enjoy by' series, and while all were excellent, I think this one stands out as the finest, though that may be just because it happens to play to most of my prefferences . I'm really in the midst of a New Zealand hops phase, and this tastes strongly of Nelson or similiar hops."
Enjoy By 7-4-13

This review came from notes (3rd batch):
Enjoy by 04JUL13
"Best IPA I've had to date. Had it as a sampling at a beer distributor by me. Picked up a few singles of other beers, left, drove halfway home and turned around. Picked up a Growler."
"This beer was amazing. It had a really fresh grapefruit aroma that exploded out of the glass. I was amazed at the tasty freshness. I can't really put into words the actual taste of freshness, but it was such a clean IPA. The malt backed up the massive hops pretty well, although lets be honest with ourselves, this IPA is not so much about the malt. I would love to get my hands on more of this stuff. If I were to compare to Pliny, I would say they are actually quite similar, but more grapefruit on the Enjoy By and more tropical flavors in Pliny. Enjoy by July 4th is truly a great beer."
"Move over Pliny, there's a new Sheriff in town. This is the freshest beer I have ever tasted. It is exactly what an IPA should be. It has a massive hop smell that hits you right in the face and does not let up one bit in the mouth. This tastes like liquid heaven for a fan of hops. The alcohol is very present, but that is no reason to apologize. This beer is not for the weak of mouth. The appearance is also amazing. This is probably the best looking beer I have ever seen in my glass. Get some!"
"Light pour, some foam. Clear, darker yellow. Doesn't look bad nor does it look all that great."
"Enjoy By 5-17-13. Oops, I'm having this 3 weeks too late. Oh well."
Enjoy By 02.14.14
"Two fingers of foamy head on a clear, medium straw colored body. Looks great."
"Presentation: Awesome looking bottle with extremely eye-catching painted on graphics and font. Gives really nice back-story on the beer, web info, ABV info, bottled on date(4-12-13), states “Enjoy Now”, “Live For The Now, The Present”, “There Is No Better Time Than Right Now To Enjoy This Beer”. Awesome!"
"Pours a very clear, straw color, decent head. The smell is strong and nice. All hops, with a touch of that oniony smell/flavor. This one leans away from the citrus side and goes more for the dankness. Taste is good, just like the smell. They did a really nice job of infusing the hop flavors into this beer. The hops are strong, but the beer is by no means bitter. Mouthfeel was good. Well carbonated, a bit of body. All in all, it's a very solid DIPA with great hop flavor, even though it's not quite the hop profile I would have gone for."
"had this quite a few times, but it is time to do a review. "
Enjoy by 5-17-13. Poured from 22oz bottle into captain Lawrence tulip. Pours a slightly reddish golden with a finger of white head. Really nice piney and fruity hop aromas with some great malty balance. Taste is crisp piney and citrus hops with a nice malt backbone to even things out...its smooth and easy especially for the abv. Really great DIPA....cant wait for the next edition!
Hazy and golden in color. Minimal head with a precise pour from a bottle into a snifter glass. 
Poured from 22 ounce bomber into a perfect pint glass.

"Very pale amber, almost too pale in my opinion but looks aren't really important at all."
"A - Light and very clear bronze color. Medium-sized, tight, bubbly, smooth, creamy, white head. Good retention leaving a nice lacing."
"Ipa cant get any better than this! at least not to my knowledge. this is THE BEST ipa i've ever had, stone does it again, idk what the i.b.u.s are on this one but it has to be close to 130 or more i'd guess. the aroma is heavenly, i wish i could get a car air freshener that smelled exactly like this.

Batch 5.17.13
"Appearance: Pours a clear pale to medium amber with a nice, frothy head and nice retention. Lots of lacing around the glass as you drink."
Got two bottles of seventh batch (05.17.13) from Corks 'n' Kegs. Poured into a snifter.
"A 5.17.13 edition thoroughly enjoyed on 5/3/13. (Also got some 10/25/13 with another great experience). Pours golden with a fluffy one finger head and perfect clarity. Beautiful aroma of floral grapefruit, pine, lemon zest, grass, wow. Slick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Flavor is grassy pine and sweet citurs. Lighter flavor and mouthfeel than I expect from a top double, but incredibly easy drinking and makes this even better than I expected. Nice beer for sure, and so fresh!"
Batch: 5.17.13
"A: copper, clear, white head, lacing, good head retention"
This was a bomber poured into a snifter.
"A - Slightly hazy, beautiful coppery color. Reasonable head, nice lacing. Very little in the way of carbonation."
"This is a really great DIPA. Just finished the ""Enjoy by 05/17/13. Everything I would look for in a DIPA. "
"A - slightly clouds, limited head"
Batch #7 - 05.17.13
"My wife-to-be suggested dinner near a wine and beer store that is normally out of the way, so this was something I picked up. I got a bottle of the 7th batch, Enjoy By 05.17.13. The pour is a translucent flat yellow with orange notes. A fluffy finger and a half of cream colored head sits on top."
Batch #7 5/17/2013
"This bomber went fast at the Big Guys, but found a few bottles hanging around out-of-the-way shops, so picked one up. I believe the best by date is 5/17/13, if I'm reading the arcane coding right. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife. "
"22oz. bomber bottle with a large silk screened forest green label. In the middle of the label is the head of the Stone gargoyle. The back of the bottle has the usual Stone novel. This version was from the 7th batch, 05.17.13. This beer was enjoyed on May 6th."
05.17.13
"Pour is clear golden orange with a fairly tight white head. Nose is hop forward with a light grain malt balance. Herbal and citrus hops with a touch of sticky resin behind. Taste is a huge hop punch and quite syrupy and resinous. Sticky feel, assertive carbonation balances, tons of citrus and grapefruit. Some bitterness in the finish that lingers a bit. Overall not bad, very syrupy and hop forward."
Poured from a 22 oz bomber into an IPA glass.
"This offering by Stone is definitely incredibly fresh. It pours a beautiful golden yellow color onto a teku glass. The angel is fruity, lemon, musky, but also contains strong notes of onion and chive. The chive and sweet vidalia are quite strong, and carry through on the taste which is also permeated by bitter hops and slight malt. "

Poured into snifter. Enjoy By 05.17.13
"A - Pours with one finger of white foam on top of a clear, golden body. The head fades slowly and leaves nice lace."
"Half finger bright white head on a slightly hazy golden with slight amber hue. Aroma is as good as it gets with full nose and all hop character varieties including citrus, herbal, earthy. Flavor is nicely complex and near perfectly hopped with pine, tart citrus, earthy hops. Only knock is just a little less malt presence but those that are there are musty and semisweet. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This one is a little too dry but the aroma is excellent. Flavor doesn't quite live up to it being less complex and malty than I wanted but still very good."

Huge thanks to Rutager for this 
"Stone Enjoy By (batch 5/17/13) pours out a hazy golden color with a smaller head that retains very well. The nose is crazy hoppy. Tons of tropical and grapefruit hop flavors with an undertone of piney bitterness. The taste presents a literal ton of tropical fruit and grapefruit hops, with a strong hop resin aftertaste. One-note, but tasty as hell. The mouthfeel is on the light side and fairly carbonated, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, Stone Enjoy By is an extremely tasty and enjoyable IPA. A little more depth to the hop blend would make it absolutely best in class, but as it is it's one of the best IPAs on the shelf for sure."
"Saw this in the store today and had to pick it up, given all the talk about this beer on BA. I must agree that it is most definitely an enjoyable IPA. However, I think it may be lacking some of the malt character that would balance this out a bit more. I would definitely drink this beer again, but I'm not going to replace all my DFH 90-min with this one."
Enjoy By 5.17.13
"I had the Enjoy By 05.17.13 and to be honest it was just good. I'd heard a ton about this beer and was really looking forward to this brew. Poured a bomber into a tulip, and the head dissipated rather quickly. The color was a perfect pale gold, and the head was a nice white/pale straw. The aroma didn't do much for me, a touch of spice, and sweet and earthy/flowery smell. The taste isn't as sweet as I was expecting and, although I appreciate west coast IPAs, this one didn't really have the malt character to balance out the appreciable hops. After all of that being said, I did enjoy this Enjoy By, and will probably pic up one of them again, but likely in late fall if they put one out around then."
Seventh Batch - 05.17.13 
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip.
5.17.13 Edition.
Thanks go to EgadBananas for this bottle.
"A: shiny, dirty orange body, finger head white sticky head, amazing"
Not much head but a powerful smell. Like a weird cheese. Tastes like pungent cheese. You really can't drink other beer after this. Tried to have the Avery IPA as a second shift drink after this one and that excellent beer tasted like water. I must say I love this beer. Very powerful. Believe the hype?
Enjoy By 05.17.13. My friend Chris shared this bottle with me. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a tulip glass.
Poured into a Dogfish Spiegelau glass. Seventh Batch.
"Poured from a bomber, 5/17/13, into a tulip. It pours a hazy gold with a 2 inch head, nice lacing. Lots of pine on the nose, notes of tropical fruit. The brew is full of bitter pine, notes of tropical fruit, lingering bitter finish. The beer is surprisingly easy drinking for such a big beer, good carbonation, full bodied. A good DIPA. Love the obvious freshness dating, but I think the beer is a bit overhyped."

"A: Came from the bar in a 13 ounce tulip glass. Had a dark orange color (the bar is dark with no windows) and a half inch of white, tight foam that leaves attractive lacing on the sides of the glass."
05.17.13 Enjoy By
"Poured a clearish golden body body with orange tint with a two-finger head and lace thanks to extreme carbonation. Classic Stone IPA aroma of hops, hops and hops. Wet, soapy, lots of sharp citric with touches of grape and floral notes with minimal malt smells. Malts are more noticeable in the taste of this beer as it has a slight sweet edge, and in fact I notice that it seems to sweeten up a little more as it warms. Enjoyable beer (no pun intended), very crisp, dry finish, good balance, overall a hop lovers delight as it has a very strong hop presence with lots of citric and grapefruit flavors and even touches of sweeter fruits."
Serving type: 22 0z bottle.
22oz. bomber poured into a Flying Dog goblet
"A- Pale amber body with a slight haze to the body. Has enough transparency to see some carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. A thick, slightly off-white head lingers around and leaves a ton of lacing."
"Pour is a yellow orange but look a bit light. An ok amount of head and lace, maybe a bit avg. The smell is phenomenal. Great hoppy smell that is not quite like any other double IPA. Maybe based on the the smell my expectations were extremely high. The taste was a very slight let down from the smell. Hoppy yet, not nearly what you would expect from the smell. The feel was a bit thin too. I felt like for this double IPA, the hoppy presence peeks very quick then fades into more of a watery mouthful. Overall, I do like this beer but was expecting more from it. It did fall short of being a world class beer but I still enjoyed it. I do have another bottle that I will try as the first beer of the evening to see if I've been thrown off by the other beers."
Very happy to finally try this one... Enjoy By 5.17.13
"The look: clear, crisp, golden-hued, active carbonation, enormous head, pillowy white, lace-leaving and lovely. Very nice looking brew."
"This is a general review. I don't want to get into the exact details. This beer is not jaw dropping. It is not a Pliny, Hopslam, or even a Nugget Nectur. But, this beer sends a message to IPA beer lovers. That message is freshness. While it is not anywhere near the best IPA I have ever tasted, it is one of the freshest and I think that this concept is missing. As a IPA drinker I have been feeling that sometimes I'm cheated. Nugget Nectur ( I consider this an IPA even though it is an IAPA) is one of my favorites, but I always feel like I have to buy it when it first comes out. If I don't, I run the risk of buying an old batch in which the hops are gone and it taste not the way it is intended. Ever wondered about the ""create your own 6 pack"" special at some beer stores. Yea.. don't do it with IPAs because the single beers they sell in that form is always three months old. So... while it is not the best IPA, it is an IPA that I would rather drink than a 3 months old Hopslam. You have to respect a company that takes the quality of their beer seriously and that is why I will probably continue to wait and stalk a beer store for when they receive an ""enjoy by."""

"Very good ipa. Pours a yellow-gold, with a nice white head. Aroma is big, big hops. Pine and citrus rind fill the nostrils. There is a deep, somewhat dark note to these hops. Taste is a little sweet and simple at first, I'm getting maybe just base and a caramel malt, but then the hops open up delivering puckering lemon rind and a hint of grapefruit. Deep pine notes overwhelm. The finish is nice bittersweet at first and then just bitter. Mouthfeel is okay, maybe a little thin. Overall great hop aroma and good hop taste, but not one of my elite dipas."

Enjoy By 05.17.13 -- Poured from a bomber into a sam adams perfect pint. Bottled on 4/12/13.
"Gorgeous lemon-orange color brew with exceptional clarity and a few, tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Solid finger and a half of egg-white head retreats to a thin film which remains for the rest of the drink and leaves behind small spots on the glass."
"Stone's good, good for you, good to the last drop. I didn't realize but apparently the r Enjoy by series makes its varying appearance in different states at different times of the year, and that explains why it took a couple months for me to get my hands on one after the 12.21.12 which made its appearance at Beermageddon 2013."
Enjoy by 05.17.13 being enjoyed on 4/24/13. Poured from a bomber into a stemmed tulip.
22oz bottle. freshness is apparant with this one.
"WOW...this beer is really really FRESH! i have never tasted a cleaner, crisper, more pure beer in my 2 years of enjoying craft beers. this brew is extremely bright and clear with a rocky head that laces all the way down the glass. the aroma is off the charts fresh and pungent...it goes beyond citrus rinds and gets into the meat of the fruit. the scent seemingly filled the entire room."
22oz bottle into a snifter
"Gotta love the concept of deliberately ensuring a DIPA be enjoyed fresh, and this freshness is devilishly evident. Poured from a bomber bottle of Enjoy By 5-17-13 into a tulip. Inviting amber appearance with a sizable white head. Big hoppy and citrusy aroma. Taste follows the nose and is hop forward, leaving a syrupy bitter resin stickiness lingering on the palate."
05.17.13 batch. Hot dang this is fresh (10 days old). 
5.17.13 batch.
Saw this and grabbed it immediately. Been a while since I've reviewed anything from Stone. 
Had this rated close to a 5 until I tried the 12.26.14 version... really didn't hit the spot for me. Don't know why it wasn't so bright and vibrant like the other versions I've had. Maybe this was a fluke and didn't turn out the way they intended.
"Poured from 22oz bottle - bottled 4/12/13 - into a snifter a nice light golden color, which was somewhat translucent. "
"Picked up a 05.17.13 bottle and drank it on 04.21.13. This beer is insanely hoppy. Nine different types of hops ( super galena extract, motueka, citra, cascade, simcoe, delta, amarillo, nelson sauvin, and galaxy) were used during the hop bursting and dry hopping process. Amazing bitterness and hop characteristics. "
Tracked down a 05.17.13 version yesterday at the Happy Valley BevMo for $6.49. 
Seventh Batch: 5/17/13
"Re-reviewing this yet again because now I am now drinking batch # 7 on 4/20/13. I figured since the hop is a cousin of the cannabis, a very fresh IPA was a very appropriate beer for me to enjoy on 4/20/13. Poured into my Stone Arrogant Bastard pint glass, this batch of this beer poured a clear medium golden color, certainly much clearer than the other 2 batches of this beer that I have had the pleasure to drink. Initially with lots of little bubbles rising up to the surface of the beer and a white head about an inch thick initially when poured that settled pretty quickly to a nice medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass along with some swirls of foam here and there covering the beer's surface. Decent lace, but I do also notice that the head retention and lace aren't as good with my serving of batch # 7 as they were with the other 2 batches of this beer that I've drank. Crisp aromas of piney and citrus hops and some nice floral notes as well. Has the nice aforementioned and very fresh piney and citrus resinous hops along with a nice slightly toasted caramel malt flavor. Also has hints of brown sugar, mango, and honey. Very nice and a bit of a different flavor profile from the other 2 batches of this beer that I drank. Has a somewhat crisp and smooth, chewy, somewhat oily, medium to full bodied mouth feel with moderate carbonation. This one really coats the inside of the mouth nicely and doesn't leave any time soon. Very drinkable for a 9.4% ABV beer. Excellent!"
batch 7 thanks to the Coppermine Pub
"Amazingly fresh, Stone Enjoy By 4-20-13 pours a beautiful honey-golden color with a touch of amber in there as well. An inch or so of white head caps the brew, and it slowly dissipates while leaving a ton of sticky lacing. Hops aromas burst from the glass. Citrus, pine resin, and freshly mowed grass provide a dominate hop presence in the nose, with just a touch of burnt toast providing any malty hints. Fruity citrus flavors, as well as caramel malt sweetness open up on the palate as floral hop flavors, and a bit of pine resin pull through the finish. The sweet malt flavors provide excellent balance. This amazingly fresh and tasty brew is medium in both body and carbonation. The next batch out is 5-17-13, get your hands on this amazing Imperial IPA!!"
Amazingly this showed up in my little rural burg. Thanks to Stone for throwing a bone to the little guys.
"Enjoy By 09-13-13: My second tasting of this fantastic DIPA . Great hoppy, pine aroma, balance and you can truly taste the freshness. The alcohol is a bit high, but to me, the bottle is just the right amount for personal consumption. But, the price went up at our local wine store... I hope it's not going to get more expensive so I can hord a bunch of these without breaking my bank."

Bomber received in trade with iguenard - thanks! Batch 5
Enjoy By 09/13/13 22 oz. bomber pulled straight from the fridge and poured with 4-5 oz. intervals into 10 oz. snifter
"This poured very nicely, with good head retention, and a nice coppery color. from there I got a floral hop aroma and some caramel notes. Flavor was fine. Standard high-hopped American IPA. This was an OK beer for me, but I'm not sure what the fuss is. I wonder if some of the oooh and ahhh might be because in general Stone makes great beer. This is not a great beer. It's a good beer, in the current tradition of ""more hops = better beer."" I went from this one to a Bear Republic Racer 5, which I love."
04/01/2013

"A: Got it on tap at the City Beer Hall in Albany, where they were serving it in 8 oz glasses. . . . Body is clear golden with a white head that leaves behind really good sticky lace."
Batch 5 (04.01.13)
"Enjoy By 2.14.14 is easily the best batch of this beer that I have had the pleasure of having. I'm not exactly sure how much of this has to do with me getting it a mere two weeks since it was bottled (and about six days since it arrived in stores), since I had the other two batches I've gotten my hands on a little later than that. Perhaps there's something to do with recipe variation...Who knows. All I can say is, I am blown away by how complex this batch is: incredibly juicy and aromatic and the carbonation and mouthfeel are super spot-on. And where is that alcohol!? Hats off to Stone, the standard bearer of hoppy beer. "
"batch 5- Enjoy by 4/1/13. What a delightful beer- I really love the whole idea of the lengths they've gone to encourage freshness in an IPA. Nothing like a fresh IPA! Wonderful delicate floral aroma with some citrus blossom and a touch of floral honey. The taste is beautifully balanced with citrus, floral, herbal, and a touch of pine in the finish. Vibrant and fresh tasting with just enough sweetness to keep things zippy. A touch soft, but just a great beer all around."
4.20 version
Just brought a bottle home of the 04.20.13 batch from work tonight; even better this time than the last batch I had last year.

"First review: t'was (currently tipsy, felling pretentious) an excellent demonstration of flavor 'complexity'... Swish it in your mouth and taste the changes! This is one of those that changes with temperature, and has an evolving aftertaste. 6th batch was indeedly a treat; smelled and tasted herbal... Basil/rosemary/other garden thangs. I'm wondering if there is any legitimacy to the drink by date-or just newly minted marketing majors making a stamp on the craftbeer scene. I'm visiting the northeast this weekend, but wish it were available back in Lousiana where I'm working. Strong work Stone."
Beer dated 12.25.15. 
"Batch 5, 04.01.13."
Enjoy by 4.01.13 - 22oz bottle poured into a stemless wine glass. 
"Enjoy By 04.01.13 (enjoyed on the ides of March, ’13), opens to a hop-heavy nose, redolent with pine resin, pink grapefruit, grapefruit rind, lemon oil, dandelion stem, mint, and eucalyptus, immediately presenting a full complement of aromas that showcase virtually the entire range of hop possibilities. These rest atop a lovely set of near-Jolly-Rancher-like orange, berry, cherry, and apricot fruit esters, as well as brown sugar, and a good, if light, earthy base of toast crust, biscuit, and floury baguette. The aromas are obviously heavily geared toward hops, which constitute perhaps three-quarters of the aromas, and should set any hophead’s tastebuds aflame in anticipation. As a whole, this is an excellently balanced, finely nuanced IPA, that sets a brilliant standard for others to follow."
"Pours a light golden color, clear, nice white head with lots of lacing."
"Bomber of Enjoy By 4/1/13, enjoyed on 3/2/13 courtesy of vonschplieffen. Thanks Drew!"

On tap at When Pigs Fly. Have I mentioned what a great tap list they have?
"Stone Enjoy By 04.01.13 IPA: Pours hazy gold color with bubbles racing up the middle and a very nice 2 finger foamy off white head that was full of tiny bubbles which dissipated slowly, leaving good foamy lacing and rings as it went down. A good looking head, better from a growler than the bottle. The lacing always coats the sides and looks great as it goes down no matter the source (tap or bomber)."
A-pours copper with a white foamy head with great retention
"22oz from Total Wine. Enjoy By 4.01.13 - still good for a couple of weeks! Poured into a DFH ""IPA glass""..."
"This beer is just fantastic. Props to stone for upping their game, yet again. On tap at rustico, best by 5-17. You MUST have this beer on tap, it excels over the bottle noticeably in that format. "
Enjoyed a 4.01.13 version. Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz. bomber.
"A - Enjoy by 4.01.13. Poured from a bomber into a tulip. Orange, honey-like color with a medium, 1-inch head. Not clear, but light."
"My first ""Enjoy By"" was the 04-01-13 brew out of a bomber. It was immediant love at first sip! Hop madness straight out the bottle! Poured a golden yellow imto a standard British pint glass. The bitterness of the hops was easily disguished by an amaziing smoothness and overall drinkability not found in average IPA's. "
Enjoy by 04.01.13
Very bright white head with a thick foamy texture. The color appears more golden with less orange hues typical for an IPA.
"Re-review of newer batches. The 7/4 Enjoy By made me realize that I have this one way underrated. It's got the perfect blend of bitterness and hop flavor for my palate. As such, I now hunt this down every time it shows up in MD. "

"original tasting from 2012, will update for each batch from here on out..."
"On tap at 2 Bros in Salem Ct. Enjoy by 4-01-13. Pours a murky burnt orange color with a half inch of head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is hoppy with some sweet citrus and tropical fruits. The taste is more of the same sweet citrus and tropical fruits but some pine as well. Good amount of bitterness. Some malt flavor but this one if hop forward for sure. Creamy ,heavy mouthfeel. A bit reminiscent of Ruination. Overall, this is a damn fine Imperial with that typical Stone taste. Glad I got a chance to try it."
"A: clear, perfectly golden beer with a few bubbles streaming from the bottom; fat, double-finger head of off-white ivory foam with good retention that leaves ample lacing down the glass"
A- golden to amber...
"22 oz 02.14.14 bottle shared between three people in three wine glasses. Happy to see this in Michigan on the (relative) cheap, $7.99/bomber. I'm much more willing to buy this at a reasonable price in MI than I am at $10 in NY. "
"A - A truly beautiful beer. Ever so slightly hazy to let you know that this is indeed filled with hop resin. Golden honey colored. Poured into a tulip glass with about a 1 finger head, doesn't stick around for too long but leaves great lacing. "
Poured from a growler to a tulip glass
Enjoy the aroma to judge all others by.
"Fifth batch, 4.01.13. Had on 3-7-13 Poured from the bottle into a snifter. "
"Fifth batch, 4.1.13. Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, golden-orange coloring with a slow, steady flow of carbonation bubbles and a thin, filmy, bright white head that recedes into a surface coat that clings to everything it touches. Aromas of resiny and piney hops fill your nose on every sniff. Tropical fruit and grapefruit sweet and tart ribbon through the aromas, also. Smells green and tasty. Flavors are amazingly balanced. Green, resiny, hoppy punch initially, with a dose of bitterness that quickly washes into a tropical fruit blend of mango and grapefruit. Resiny and bitter at the end of the palate, with a slightly roasty and tangy sweet caramel backbone coming through. Hoppy and peppery spiced aftertaste, with a bitter feel that leads to the clean, dry finish. Smooth and clean in mouth. This beer is tremendous."

A: pours a clear yellow gold with two fingers of white head that fades into a bubbly ring with good lacing.
"Very clean, golden color with a great head on top at first. sticky and gummy lacing on down the glass. Big and fat hop aroma right in your face. Grassy as all get out. Massive flavor assault in both malt and hops. Freshly mown grass, papaya, citrus with a touch of sugary sweetness. Really could not get any fresher. Excellent mouthfeel-just a huge body that is very well balanced against the enormous flavor. WOW! what a great beer all in. Reminds me of Moylan's Hopsickle just picked off the bine. Just killer all in. Had no idea about this beer until the guy in my local turned me on to it. Well worth finding, having and enjoying over and over and over...."

I was told I got the last one of these at Specs in Round Rock...4/1/13 version.
Excited to try another hoppy offering from stone. 
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a golden yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grass, grass hop, citrus hop, and spicy hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, grass hop, grass, onion hop, and spicy hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This one had a pretty big explosion of hops going on here while still managing to be refreshing. There was quite a nice balance here as well. The aroma is quite inviting and the flavor has just enough hoppy resin in it to remind you of the style it falls under. A really well done brew that I would definitely have again."
"22 ounce bottle, Enjoy By 04.01.13. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's also a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells mostly like citrusy (grapefruit, mango, tropical fruit) and pine hops, along with a bit of bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some lemon peel, floral hops and a bit of onion. There's an enjoyable bitter hoppy finish, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and sticky with moderate carbonation. It's also easy enough to drink. I think it's a good brew overall, I hope Stone keeps making it (and Ohio keeps getting some). $6.99 a bottle."
Enjoy By 4.01.13

Picked up a mini growler at Hop City. Enjoy by 4.01.13.
"Enjoy by 04/01/13.Pours a clear medium golden with a large blooming white crown that is just billowing and never really comes down,it sticks like glue to the sides of the impy nonic I poured it in.Hop complexity to the hilt,resiny,piney,and the sweet onion notes abound,mild biscuit malts are noticable.Leafy and real minty hops stand out up front on the palate,again Iam getting some thin slice red onion in there,Iam guessing Summit hops used?It's fresh tasting and has your not so typical hop flavors,interesting and damn good."
"Appearance- Super clear pale orange, great head retention with plenty of laceing"
"32oz growler from Hop City (Atlanta, GA). 9.49. Enjoy by 4/1/13. Served in a pint glass. "

22oz bottle split and poured into a tulip. Enjoy By 04.01.13.
Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Jester King stemmed glass. 
"Enjoy by 4/1/13 is one of the easiest drinking double IPA i've had the privilege of encountering. Appearance is a golden/brassy blond, with smallish bubbles and little head. This might be due to the fact i bought a second growler to enjoy today following my first liter on the release day. The aroma is outstanding; floral, herbal hops with hints of tropical fruit lingering in the back. This is a fresh IPA to be sure. More tropical notes and some citrus across the palate, and a fine balance between bitterness and maltiness. The 9.4% is completely hidden until you've had a few pours! I love the fact you can detect the potent hop aromas before the glass is in your face. Solid, solid piece of brewing."
Took a little while to transfer my notes to the forums. Based on a bottle of 2.15.13 in a tulip.
4-01-13...finally scored a bottle of this. fifth times a charm!!!:-)
04.01.13
A: Pours a beautiful clear deep golden color with a one finger white head. 
"Fourth time trying this beer, three times in bottle, once on tap. Had 9/21/12, 21/21/12, and 04/01/13 twice."
"Fresh, wet juicy hop aromas and flavors that are very assaulting, even for a Stone beer. I have the feeling that this beer was refrigerated from when it was bottled all the way to in my stomach. Very, very sweet and fresh hops reminiscent of a lot of Lagunitas beers with none of the bitterness typically associated with Stone. Maybe my favorite Stone beer, along with Sublimely Self-Righteous."
"Received the bottle of ""02.15.13"" in a trade from Jeremy6566. Poured from a bomber bottle into my Deschutes tulip."
"Pour is a transparent golden yellow with a relatively small white head, dissipates fast, and doesn't leave a lot of lacing. "

100th Review-Enjoy by 2.15.13
Fourth Batch 02.15.13 Poured into a Stone Imperial glass. Bright yellowy orange color. Crystal clear with many medium sized carbonation bubbles that lead to small one finger head. Head is a tad bit off white and creamy in appearance. Lace is sticking just a bit and does an okay job down to the bottom.
Enjoy By 2.15.13 opened on 1.25.13.
"02.15.13 version from a bottle. Poured into a wine, er, beer glass"
Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a brandy snifter. Enjoy by 15 February 2013.
"Batch 4. 2/15/12 Enjoy By. Had this on tap initially in 12oz glass than had it in bottle poured in a snifter. Taste really good on tap, really smooth, a bit hoppy but had a good balance. For 9.4% it was really tasty. In bottle, same result, its pretty damn good and worth the hype in my opinion. Really fresh beer and so far my favorite stone beer."
Pours a pale clear orange color with lots of bubbles sticking to my glass. Nice fluffy off white head that falls to a ring with some nice lace.
"This is the Enjoy by 2/15/13. Served in 12oz tulip. Poured a very clean, clear medium gold color with about 3/4 inch of off-white head that had OK retention and good lacing."
I had the fourth batch of Stone Enjoy By. It was a very interesting and delicious IPA. It's a bit different in the sense that it emphasises weed and umami flavours.
Fourth batch - 02.15.13 bottle poured into a tulip
"Appearance - Pours a crystal clear, bright golden orange with a white, half finger head and sub-par retention. Fair, somewhat spotty lacing with good stick."
A-hazy amber color with a nice white head and good lacing
"Picked up a bomber at Tacoma Boys in Puyallup, WA. Enjoyed on 18 Jan 13. "
This review is for the 2.15.13 batch.
22 oz bottle of 4.1.13 into a Duvel tulip
"Aroma was potent right from lift off. A hop bouquet of citrus, mostly of sutle tangerine and maybe pineapple. Malts are sweet and bready."
22 oz bottle from Ned's. Enjoy by 02/15/13. Bottled 1/11/13.
"Pour = Clear,Clear, Clear. Light, rusty orange. Half a finger head. tons of streaming bubbles"
"A: This is a gorgeous beer. Crystal clear, light copper in color. Pours with about a half a finger's worth of head featuring nice tight bubbles."
Imagine riding on a mower through your overgrown lawn or a golf course while sipping a nice cold beverage. If you could bottle that overwhelming hop and citrusy pine smell with satisfaction of watching the tall grass fall and become lane of acomplishment you would still come up short. fantastic all around
"Enjoy By 2-15-13. Deep gold color, very clear. Medium white foam head, holds decently. Light, streamy carbonation. The bouquet on this beer is just heavenly. Deliciously fresh citric hops hit the nose with a piney, almost peppery bite. This is much reminiscent of an Alpine style IPA. I've been waiting for Stone to wow me like this for some time now. This beer is 9.4%? It's hard to tell, as I smell all hops and very little malt character or alcohol. "
On tap at Smokin Joe's the other day.
"Poured from a bit-overpriced $16 bottle that I grabbed out of Pittsburgh, PA."
"a: beautiful honey in color. Absolutely no head. Lots of bubbles, but no lacing. "
"On tap @ Pinocchio's in Media, PA. Served in a tulip. Clear gold with rich white head. Robust look. Big floral and piney nose with underlying tropical fruit. Plenty of bright citric bitterness and resinous notes tempered by herbal and tropical notes on the edges. Full on hop flavors here with incredible balance and drinkability for a 10% DIPA. Sign me up for a glass of this anytime!"
Reviewed 5/7/17
"Pours a clear golden color with a tight, white head that leaves rings of lacing."
Enjoy by 12.21 drank 12.03
"Pours a luminous honey color with a touch of amber in there, and the head is full, rich, and creamy. Nose is simply a delight with a medley of tangerine, grapefruit, and pears. Palate offers a candied malt presence that is overtaken by the hop bitterness and fruity flavors - those that were noted in the aroma. Alcohol presence is completely masked. Light to medium bodied. Sinfully easy to drink."
"Lightly hazed golden amber, moderate cap of sticky white froth. Scent brings strong notes of grapefruit, tropical notes, pine needles and alcohol. Taste is obviously big on the hops - grapefruit and pine up front, ctirus, floral and grassy in the rear - malt backbone lightly crackery but covered up by the dry bitterness and alcohol notes. Fuller side of medium bodied - heavy on the palate but no too sticky or chewey. Solid all around fresh IPA, not quite in the league of the top dIPAs."
Enjoy by 2.15.13.
Very excited to try my first bottle of this.

Enjoy by 12.15.13 IPA - I think I'll tackle you before then.
Had on tap at Chucks.
"2.15.13 version. Poured into an Arrogant Bastard Ale pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a half finger white head that slowly dissipated to a thin film with a thick ring around the glass and light lacing. Aroma dominated by herbal, earthy and almost dank hops, a bit of sweet malt in the background. Taste follows aroma with very complex herbal and piney hops with a hint of citrus hops. Supported by solid sweet malt, orange and citrus rind, finishing with a moderate hop bitterness and residual herbal flavors from the fresh tasting hops. Does not overwhelm with hop bitterness, but delivers intense hop resins and esters. Medium bodied. Definitely delivers on what it promises: as fresh and intense a hop experience as possible without excessive bitterness. A hop lovers dream. I have to say the presentation of this really went over the hype boundary, even for Stone, but it does deliver. I was so intimidated by the instructions to drink quickly that I drank this the evening after it arrived in town. I do not regret that."
"An Enjoy By 2.15.13 poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a translucent red amber with a larger white head that dissipates to leave a nice thin foam layer and nice lacing. Smells of sweet piney hops and more hops, with a slight citrus hint. Tastes of citrus notes and nice piney notes with great hop bite. Medium bodied beer is carbonated perfectly and finishes very nice for a beer with a great hop bite that it has. Overall, a world class beer."
"big ups to sarge27 for the trade...says enjoy by 2.15.13, i say, why wait? enjoyed via a spigalau glass."
Enjoy by 2/15/13... duh?
"Enjoy By 02.15.13 (bottled 01.11.13) into a tulip. Six days from the brewery to my glass. Pours a perfectly crystal-clear copper w/ a sudsy bright white head, lazy carbonation. A good-looking beer, appears refreshing and clean."

Enjoy by 2.15.13 - on tap in Boise ID @ Bier:Thirty.
Bottled on 1/11/13. Tried on 1/16/13. Best by 2/15/13.
"Beer on draft at Churchkey, kegged 5 days ago. Served in a becher of sorts. I've been very excited to try this beer and I'm really glad I got the opportunity to do so on draft. A phenomenal IPA for sure. I would definitely have this again. At the time of this review, this is #29 on the ""Top Beers - American Double / Imperial IPA"" list on beeradvocate, a well deserved spot."
"Resiny, dank hops were evident in the aroma before I got close enough to pour."
"I had the Enjoy by December 21st bottle that I picked up in Oakland. This beer was pretty awesome, I expected nothing less from Stone but this beer delivered above and beyond. One thing that really stood out was the smell, which was amazing. "

22oz bomber poured into pint glass
Enjoyed the 12.21.12 version on 12/22/12.. oops!
"This brew was served from the bottle (Enjoy By 12.21.12, Third Batch) at the Tap and Mallet Vertical Epic tasting event. It arrived in a tasting glass, showing a clean yellow golden. No head was noted, but spots of lacing were left dripping down the glass. Carbonation appeared average, and no haze or sediment was noted. The aroma was gritty as hell. The nose was filled with earthy hop bite, metallic and soured yeast, and sweet nectary hops of grapefruit and soap. With warmth came plastics and light booziness, mineral, and an enhancement of those paler, toastier malts. Peach sugars blended in as well, giving nice and syrupy depth to the vast array of hop varietals. Our first impression was that there was a huge hop variety through all the bitterness, but things were exquisitely juicy. The flavoring opened with dirt and grit of pine resin, mineral, booze, pale malts, and faint caramel sugariness. The middle came to a peak with softer pine, massive juiciness of citric flesh, more pale toast, and biting yeasty metallics. Citric hops washed through the finish, with juiciness of peaches, nectarines, apples, and flesh of grapefruit, mixing for an ultimate blend without any lingering or puckering extreme bitterness of hop. The aftertaste breathed of soap, pine, and grapefruit cleanliness, with spicy black pepper booze on the far back. The body was medium to full, and the carbonation was high. There was nice slurp, cream, smack, froth, and pop, with a slick coating. Pucker eventually came from the astringent, grapey dryness to the palate, in the absence of intense bittering from the gloriously juicy hops. The abv was fine, and the beer drank way easy."
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from bombers, 12 oz bottles and from draft on many occasions. Look is bright gold hue with a thick frothy head and sticky lacing. Smell is citrus, floral, lemon zest, sweetened pear juice, pine, grass and a hint of tobacco. Taste is floral, grapefruit, lemon, pear, pine resin and grass with some sweet grain malt flavors in the background. Feel is medium in body that is bitter yet smooth and a little slick in the finish."
3rd Edition enjoyed on 12-21-12 on tap at petrol station in a pint glass.
"12.21.12 pours a shockingly intense 24 karat gold color with generous carbonation and a thin but frothy head. This brew is quite unctuous, bonding to the glass with a sticky resinous coating."
"A - slight chill haze that dissipates as it warms, golden color with a thick white heat that is well retained, leaves a really nice lacing,"

"Second batch Enjoy By 11.09.12. Bright orange color, super head and lace. Super juicy citrus and hops in the aroma, definite west coast. More citrus, pine, bitterness, typical west coast and typical stone. This is a good DIPA and I would expect nothing less from Stone. I sure hope we get another batch of this in Colorado at some point. Winner."
"Gift from Johnny Ramirez. Enjoy by 12.21.12 - the ""end of the year"" version... Sweet! Pours a golden amber color with excellent clarity and a small white head. Decent lacing - something I've now always come to expect from Stone brews. Heavy pineapple on the nose, grapefruits, tangerines, slight lemon zest; floral hops, perfume fragrance, wet grass. Very nice - it has a ""juicy"" smell, the smell you'd expect from biting into a fruit. If that fruit was loaded with hop oil."

"A-Clear light orange, some carbonation, two finger head with near perfect lacing."
Only pop in for an occasional written review these days and this beer deserves one. I picked up 5 bottles and this is my last one.
"A: Poured a transparent yellow with a nice white cap, good head retention which leaves nice lacing, bubbles and layers of bubbles clinging to the glass"
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high white head that died down but consistently left a thin head covering the surface.
"Picked up a bottle at Macadoodles in Pineville, MO"
A - Pours a clear golden-orange with a finger of frothy white head. The head fades down at a normal pace leaving behind some nice lacing.
Finally made it's way to the Bay Area and gotta drink it fast cuz the end of the world is right around the corner. Would suck to have this in the cellar after without popping it after my...er...our demise. Cool beer name.

"Have had several of these in 22oz bottles then served in tulips. First and foremost it was most similar to Pliny the Elder. I sensed a lot of Cascade and Simcoe hops, with most of the aroma coming obviously from the Cascade. The beer is way hoppy and has a touch of sweet midway through, and finishes crisp. A great drink overall."

"On tap at RIBCO in Rock Island, Illinois"
"Poured into one of my half-liter german mugs, this is a bright amber-gold beer with a thick creamy head atop it. The nose offers very pine-resiny hops, in great abundance in fact. The taste: it's fair to call it a hop bomb, with massive grassy, piney flavor hops, and a fairly goodly amount of straight bittering hops. Some sweetness comes through, but the body is surprisingly light given the strength. The finish, bracingly dry. "
"From the brewery that celebrates everything arrogant and brash, this might be their boldest move yet! As many breweries avoid bottle dating, in fear of turning consumers away, Stone Brewing Company embraces it. In fact, the design of this ""devastatingly"" fresh IPA has only a 35 day window of consumption. Not that the beer won't be fantastic after that, but the supreme freshness of this beer captures all of those volatile hop compounds that are fast fleeting in even reasonably fresh examples. By the way, if you have an adverse reaction to the word ""fresh"" you may want to avoid the following review:"
You had this beer. 
"A. This beer is crystal clear, dull rust bronze color. It has a big foamy white head that leaves a ton of lacing. There are sporadic bubbles that make their way up the glass."
Enjoy by 12.21.12
"Enjoy By 12-21-12! A welcome new addition to Houston. Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. Pours a transparent golden orange color- not much head. Smell- PINEY goodness. Some citrus elements as well. This aroma is world class- I get some buttery sweetness (honey?) behind the pine aroma. Guessing Simcoe was a key dry hop used here. The citrus aroma is orange rind. Smells terrific. Taste- the fresh piney hops pop off my tongue, followed by a mildly sweet (not syrupy) honey backbone, finished by a lasting and delicious bitter piney finish. In my book, this is an absolutely delicious and world class Imperial IPA. Up there with the best on them. For the ABV, there is absolutely no hint of it being 9.4%, esp because the backbone doesn't have that bruising sweetness that you normally expect to achieve that ABV. The piney hops are delicious. Really think this is wonderful, significantly better than Ruination 10 in my book."

Stone Enjoy By 12.21.12 Poured into a snifter. 
"12-21-12 version. 22 oz. bottle served in a Duvel Tulip. Pours a brilliant gold with a finger of white head. Very fragrant hop aroma. Lots of citrus, esp. pineapple. Also a fair amount of caramel malt in the aroma. Not as bitter as the aroma would suggest. Lighter side of medium bodied. Not a lot of malt backbone, but this is about hops. Drying hop bitterness in finish. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV. Great way to highlight the importance of drinking hoppy beers when they are fresh."
"My bottle of this states enjoy by 12-21-12 (tasted on 11-24-12). Interesting marketing in this regard--absolutely in your face about when the beer will start to fade. In Boston, my favorite store had only two cases available. Both were kept in back for the ""regulars"". Good idea to produce just enough for us beer geeks."

Batch 3: Enjoy by 12.21.12. 
"This was review was done with the 2.14.14 batch. Enjoy By was clear and a copper/orange color. It had about an inch head that was off-white and frothy. Plenty of lacing was retained along the edges of the snifter. The aroma and taste was spectacular. Both citrus fruits and a resinous quality came through perfectly. Hints of grapefruit, orange, and pine flowed throughout. Overall, I have had an Enjoy By both fresh (a few days after bottling) and on the 30-day mark. As this was my second time enjoying on the 30-day mark, I think I may prefer this one with a bit of age on it (and by age, 30 days!)"
Sooo looking forward to this one. Probably hyped it up too much. We'll see.
"Pours a lager-clear golden color with a quickly attenuating off-white head. The nose is comprised of BIG citrus and pine. Once the beer settles, hop resin breaks through. The mouthfeel is peculiar and affected more than I like by the flavor. Mouthfeel should accentuate the flavor, the flavor shouldn't molest the mouthfeel. When first pulled into the mouth, there's a pleasing fullness that quickly is overtaken by the harsh hop burn and sting of carbonation for which Stone is so famous/infamous. Strong, resiny pine flavor that is, oddly enough, balanced with the grain bill. I'm not sure how much grain it would require to balance this hop assault, but they've figured it out. Another disappointment for me. Stone is just not in my wheelhouse."
Pours bright crisp golden yellow. Inch or so of head. Light lacing and retention.

11.09.12 batch
A citrus forward IPA from Stone that doesn't stand out to me. All earth and citrus and hop profile that doesn't have the dimensions of a lot of the strong DIPA's out there. Has a puckering bite but not much else going on or lingering in the aftertaste.
A: poured a golden orange in color with yellow highlights and a nice finger of head that left plenty of bubbly lacing sticking to the glass.
Just made it.

"I gather this is the second release of the Enjoy By series. A set of beers specifically designed to be enjoyed within a month of production. I say 'set' and 'series' but the beers are all produced with the same recipe, as best as I can tell the only difference being the production date and the markets into which they are released. This is done to add a level of control over the distribution time-frame that is usually not as closely tended to. The reason for all of this attention to detail is the beer is heavily hopped in the first place and burst hopped in the second."
"Serving Type - 22oz bottle , this is the 11-9-12 version."
"22oz bottle dated in large letters ""Enjoy by 11/09/12""."
Enjoy By 11.09.12. Poured in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass for sexiness. 
"Pours a light golden with a yellow hue, slight white head and lots of effervescence. A pretty nice aroma; huge sweet and juicy citric hops on top of a slight malt underbelly. Slighlty dank. Similarly wonderful flavor. Huge citric hops that are so juicy and sweet, a touch of some hoppy resin, all on top of a thin malt underbelly. A nice crisp, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, I'd have to put this as the best Stone ipa offering I have yet to try."
"dont know how or why this beer has haters? it is amazing. the pour is an unassuming clear apple juice color with an average white head that leaves some thick lacing. the smell is incredible fresh hops. a little floral, but mostly citrus flavors here. grapefruit and sappy dankness. the flavor is just as potent. its nvery fresh beer, alive almost, light in the mouth, but uniquely hopped. theres some lighter malt that turns a bit sweet as it warms, and the alcohol comes out then too, but when ice cold from the fridge this is a special article. its it a wet hop beer? it sure seems like one. if this was an everyday beer on the shelf i would buy it regularly. one of the freshest and most complicatedly delicious ipas around right now. certainly stones best work to date in my opinion."
"A: Pours a clear bright gold copper with minimal head that wore off quickly. Decent carbonation, looks nice."
From a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Enjoy by 11.9.12.
"Excellent golden yellow body; great clarity; thin white head; appears decently carbonated. Citrus, lemon, pine hop aroma; gently sweet. Beautiful combination of tastes initially: light caramel and crystal malt flavors with a gentle hop bitterness; bitterness comes on more strongly at the finish and lingers along with a creeping alcohol heat. Clean dry finish. Medium body with a soft, light sugary feel."
had about a month ago. Poured a medium/orange color with small head. 
"Poured from a 22oz bottle on the ""enjoy by"" date of 9/21/12. "
"Have had the 9/21/12, 11/09/2012, 12/21/2012, 4/1/2013 and 5/17/2013 iterations of this world-class DIPA, and they've all been near-flawless. While , from what I understand, the recipe has stayed mostly the same (though I'm sure some tweaks have been made with each batch), I would call out the 9/21, 12/21 and 5/17 as standouts. "
Poured from the bottle into a Speigelau stemmed tulip glass.
"Had a few pours of this one tonight at the ""Stone Tap Takeover"" at Bier Thirty in Bown. Greg got the 1st pour, but I am pretty sure I was within the first 10. :-)"
Wow....this is a great beer....9+%....WHAT!!! Hard to tell with such great flavor. The beer poured a hazy cream orange with thick foamy head that has settled into about a finger width thick. The lace is nice an sticky! The smell is fresh pine and subtle citrus hop. Some coriander but mostly pine and citrus. The taste has a very nice balance of bitterness and hops along with a touch of sweet malt. The mouthfeel is full body with smooth carbonation. Overall this a a very good beer.
"On-tap 8/23/2012 at Cloverleaf Tavern in Caldwell, NJ, served in a goblet glass."
"Thanks to Heavytaste for sending me two of these, an awesome Beer Advocate and great trading partner."
clean golden yellow pour with 2 fingers of head (great retention).
"A: A very nice golden orange, with a two finger off white head that stays for a bit, a nice lacing around the glass as you sip this one."
"Pours a clear, soft orange color, with a 2 finger of white head. Left lots of lace. "
You had this beer. 
"22 oz bottle, thanks Richard."
Bottle to Bruery tulip. 
On tap at O'Brien's. Pint glass.
"04.01.13 on 3/5/13, which is four days after it came into local stores. Pours a nice bright medium honey tone. Looks pretty clear, maybe a touch of haze. Medium white head. Fine bubbles. Some lacing. Aroma is full of bright hoppiness. It's a mix of floral, sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Some things that come to mind: sweet grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle, peach, pineapple, papaya, kiwi, lavender. Very nice. Little to no malt contribution. Maybe just a bit of simple sweetness. The taste is chock full of hop flavor, and the bitterness is tuned just right for my palate. There's no bland bitterness to this beer. It's always complex and delicate hop flavor. Absolutely wonderful taste. Mouthfeel is light. Gentle carbonation. Long-lasting hop finish. No booziness. This is an excellent DIPA. I tried the first version and was less impressed, but perhaps, I didn't have a big enough pour or something. This beer is tasty. If you like hops, I can't recommend it highly enough. Kudos to Stone."
Pours a bright golden orange clear body with a bone white contrasting head. I swear this thing would glow in the dark.
"A: Lighter shade of yellow-amber. Slightly hazy. Forms a large, fluffy, off-white head that has good retention and leaves a good amount of lacing on the way down. "
Pours a transparent golden color with a big white foamy head that settles leaving plenty of splotchy lacework. 
"It pours a lively light gold; the head is just off-white and has a few big bubbles bursting. I get a big, juicy aroma from 10-12 inches away. The head settles within a minute or two to a light covering, and after a few sips to a light ring, leaving the beer looking a bit too quiet, or too much like apple juice."
"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours a clear orange with two fingers of soft fluffy white head. Head dissipates to a film of foam on the surface after a few minutes, leaving a lot of sticky lacing. Some carbonation visible, rising quickly, and allows for two fingers of head to be swirled up easily."

Poured into a 13oz tulip.

Bottle shared by Mike (AgentZero). Served in a Bell's tulip.

On Tap
Poured from bomber into a pint glass following a 4 hour chill. Thanks to Sol Markets for selling their 2nd to last bottle. 
"I bought 2 of these bombers for $6.99 each, because that's all that my store would sell me. But if this stuff was readily available, I would buy it by the case at that price. Moving on..."
"A classic representation of west coast ipa, but fresh for an east coast guy. "
"Beautiful yellow-orange oy, excellent clarity, scattered carbonation streams, topped by four fingers of white various sized micro-bubbles. Gorgeous drippy lacing."
22 oz bottle being enjoyed nine days out from bottling. It was poured into my Brooklyn Brewery tulip.
"This beer pours a clean, golden color with a thick, modest-in-size head. A steady stream of carbonation is visible pouring from the bottom of my tulip glass. Pretty standard for a DIPA... nothing to hint at any distinctive qualities."
A - pours a crystal clear golden color. Massive amount of thick mouse like white foam. Leaves decent amounts of lacing as it slowly dissipates.
"On tap at The Daily Pint in Santa Monica, CA."
22oz bottle into a tulip.
"Growler from the brewey for $15...Nelson on steroids! If you appreciate both Alpines Nelson and Stones Ruination then you will love this crazy beer. Never thought Stone would brew this but they continue to amaze me. Tastes like a small batch brew, but from a big ol' brewey. Keepin' it real....Amazing beer, buy it if you can get it before 9/21/12!"
"Those crazy guys at Stone. First they tell mi I'm not worthy, then they tell me when to drink my beer. It's mine now, I bought it. Sure it was yours back then but this is now. So I drink this NOW of my own choice, not through any Stone coercion cause I don't play that game if you know what I'm sayin'."
Poured from a very fresh bomber on 8/25/12...
"Draft at The Blue Monkey Tavern in Merchantville, NJ. samples on 8.24.12. "

"A: Clean, clear amber brew with a foamy white head that pares down to a thin head."
"On-tap at Beachwood I,"
"Another excellent beer by Stone, shame they're so hard to find & will only be around for a month."
Holy hops Batman!
"Thanks, Shane."
"I like what Stone is doing with this branding... definitely educates the consumers and retailers about the necessity of freshness. Anyway... poured into glass, crystal clear brilliant gold appearance with soapy white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is pungent and fresh with tropical hoppy goodness along with some pine, sap, orange, apricot, and grass. Taste starts with moderate tropical fruits and caramel sweetness, followed by piny bitterness along with and herbal and syrupy component. No booziness here, nice balance. Mouthfeel is moderate to heavy with medium carbonation. Overall, one of the better IPAs I have had from Stone. Super fresh and super delicious."
22oz bomber - bottled 1 week ago - picked this up at my local Binny's - the bottle was still cool to the touch as I picked it up from a short stack of cases - fresh off the truck I presume!
poured into a pint glass
Bottle dated 8/17/2012 
"Glad I stopped into my bottle shop today and found out about this one. I'm on the final few sips and I hope there is more at my shop tomorrow. I'm not an expert reviewer nor very familiar with DIPA. This is probably my 9th or 10th. I'm not really a big IPA fan...But this DIPA does the trick. Minimal malts, beautiful citrus, floral, and slight tropical fruit from the hops, and a bit of heat coming in but slapped around by the hops. My favorite DIPA and probably Top Five (of 400+) in my young beer drinking career."
Bottle dated 8/17/2012 into a FW tulip.
"spent most of wednesday, 08.22.12, searching for this beer. i live in san diego too! bottle on date: 08.17.12"
Light golden color and you can easily see right through this well filtered beer. Hop aroma is present a good distance from the nose. Hops are strong on the spices - almost fresh cracked pepper and basil - with a small amount of citrus. Some malty sweetness on the backend but certainly not the star. Thank you Stone for enforcing freshness of this hoppy beer.
8/21/2012
Bomber poured into my DFH pint glass. Small head that recedes over a the period of a minute.
"Stone continues it's roll. This innovative release program rewards those who keep it fresh,and move it quick. After all the videos and how too's I finally get my hands on a fresh specimen today. Having enjoyed, very much I may add, the Ruination Anniversary as a youngster, and thought the 16th was OK I really had no idea what I was about to fall into. This pours a pale copper, the cap is dense, white and recedes rather quickly. My first inclination that I'm into something special is when I bring my tulip to my nose. Seriously, the most intensly aromatic nose I have ever enjoyed from Stone. Very Alpine Nelson meets KRBC Citra nose, totally intoxifying. It just gets better as the flavors fall in line with the nose delivering sweet mango, tangerine, lemon, orange and white pepper notes. There is a beautiful bitter blast from the enormous hop bill, just enough malt to keep it all in balance, remember this is totally a west coast variation, so were talking hops, dry and fruity. The mouth is dry, clean and utterly refreshing, there is absolutely no detection of the 9+ abv lurking underneath the entire package. Gains complexity as it warms and never is hot. This would be Stones biggest seller by a land slide if made available year round. If you can find a fresh bottle now do what you have to, it's that good."
Had on tap 5 days old. Not bad for being in New Jersey.
I drank this when it was super fresh (>1.5 weeks if I recall correctly) and the flavors were in your face! I would of loved to let another one sit for a month to taste the difference because I could see this beer really coming together with more time.
"L - yup, that's haze alright. Peachy orange glow. Minimal head with just a ring when all is said and done. "
"Medium-pale gold beer, hazed to opacity, under a couple of fingers of white head that trailed arms of lace down the glass... Typically citric and tropical fruit impressions abound in this New England-style IIPA from Other Half, providing zing and tingle in a soft, smooth, amply carbonated malt body... Featuring Motueka, Mosaic, and Chinook hops, this is yet another quality entry in the flooded NEIPA style from one of the masters at brewing them... 2/15/18 canning..."
"This beer pours a completely opaque golden yellow color with a slight orange hue and a two finger, pillowy, creamy, bright white head. Retention is excellent and there are many filmy rings and chunks of lacing left on the glass."
"Acquired from brewery on release day, poured vigorously into a teku for maximum foam. Nice 2 finger head that lingers and laces. Dark orange and brown haze, nicely blended. Sweet candy, cotton candy, bubble gum, spices on the nose. All carry over to taste, but a couple unpleasant notes on tastebuds. Smooth drink that mellows and balances nicely, more harsh than anything. This is an interesting brew that opens up nicely. It comes off way too harsh at first, but balances into a nice refreshing and complex brew."
"Pours cloudy gold orange color with a big 2 finger white foamy head that was packed with small bubbles, dissipating very, very slowly and leaving excellent foamy lacing with thick foam rings clinging to the glass as it dropped. Another great looking OH DIPA, which is pretty standard at this point."
Canned on 12/20/17 ‘STR8 GAS’.
"Drank on tap at Other Half Brewing Co., Brooklyn, NY"
"Looks like orange juice, but don't let the look fool you. This is BEER. The nose gives away the true ingredients of the can. Smells citrusy, but hoppy overlays. The taste is smooth and delicious with a bitterness that is unmistakably IPA. The after taste is slightly bitter. Awesome beer."
IP swap at sand city release this morning for some cans if this. Missed it the first time around and heard it was better than the ddh version which I loved.
"Picked this up when it was released midweek a month or two ago, as I had no idea how popular this was going to be. Sure enough, it sold out quickly and after having this, it's easy to see why. Smooth, creamy, and full of onion, this was a slightly odd beer that went down so easily and didn't have any hop bitterness, burn, or excessive heft to it."
16 oz. can dated 08/11/17
Taste wise this is the closest thing that compares to juice machine imo. Feel wise.....there's this weird sandy fee on my lips. Flavor lasts though...sticky! Killer beer other than that weird feel.
"If someone gave me this beer blind, I honestly would have thought it were a tree house beer. "
This is dangerously close to being too green oniony for me but they somehow pull it off. Color and mouthfeel are perfect. 
"A: It's an OH DIPA... Deep gold erring more on the side of orange vs. yellow. Thick, hazy, opaque... No questions there. Not much head retention."
Holy Honeydew Smoothie. This is one of the creamiest DIPAs I've yet to try from OH. The chinook hops do a nice job of giving the powerful melon taste some edge. This is absolutely delicious.
"Pours light orange / golden, hazy with white head. "
Trying to get caught up on ratings. This one is a close second as my favorite CT variant. Citra edges this by a little but the El Dorado in this is like candy!
"This is absolutely incredible. Love the slight honey notes that complement perfectly the pineapple/orange combo from the hops. Tropical flavor all over, pours creamier than most Trilliums."
"Really hazy peach color with off-white head. Aroma has sweet malt, some honey, overripe orange and a hint of peppermint. Taste is sweet and fruity at first but gets really dry, slightly astringent. Aftertaste is long and quite sweet with dried orange peel flavor. Medium body and carbonation, quite dry. Overall it's quite interesting with a different hop profile."
"Picture perfect hazy bulby orange juice color with bright orange/yellow tints. Head is gorgeous as always, lots of lace, but doesn't get in the way of enjoying the beer."
"Opaque bright peach-orange with a light bubbly foam that settles to bubble bath surface, then nothing."
Cloudy light gold color. Nearly no head and only a few spots for lace. 
"Like every trillium ipa, nothing short of an orange juice looking, fruity smelling, juicy tasting, soft velvety felling DIPA that leaves wanting to live inside their Fermental tanks forever! I haven't had a bad trillium beer yet!"
A: Poured into a Duvel tulip to a hazy deep yellow topped by a finger of dense white head that fades to a collar around the edge of the glass with some lacing
"L - pours a glowing orange juice. Has a lighter, more translucent paleness toward the bottom of the glass. Almost seems like it radiates its own light. "
"My brother in law just brought me a case of Trillium (woohoo!) and this so far has been my favorite i've tried. I thought the raw wildflower honey would be a weird addition, but it's not extra sweet or syrupy.. just seems to make the tasting notes linger a bit longer. This is one of the most balanced and drinkable DIPAs I've ever had. Orange creamsicle with a perfectly mild bitter finish. Outstanding! I can only imagine how incredible the galaxy version of this tastes."
"Pours a hazy pale orange in color with a half finger of white head. Aroma is lime zest, a touch of honey, and a whiff of alcohol. Taste is lime zest, a hint of alcohol, white grape juice, an earthy note, and some more subtle alcohol in the finish. Medium-ish body, moderate carbonation. Overall I just really didn't enjoy this one, this must be my least favorite iteration of Cutting Tiles. I miss OG Artaic."
Easily one of the most tastiest and drinkable doubles I have had. Stellar.
"Bright hazy golden and orange hued, small head and moderate lacing. Dank and pineapple hoppy aroma. Notes of pineapple, orange juice, grapefruit piths, and honey bun. Medium, really drinkable, and dry. Stunning DIPA held back only by appearance."
"hype aside, this beer is darn near perfect. a colossal thanks to my friends for saving this, then sharing with me, i feel special! lucky to have people around me like this who genuinely want to share their stuff with me, life is good! this is a one of a kind beer, for one, probably the best expression of el dorado hops i have ever seen, straight up, but more interestingly because the honey is so interesting and flavorful in here, but the beer isnt sweet at all, and the residual flavor of the seemingly raw and high quality flower honey with the hops together is just insane, never tasted a union like this, and i am in love with it. the honey is so floral in the flavor, waxy almost, and really pretty forward in the taste, right up there with the wheat, which i think is a genius add for texture to the mash. the hops have an almost candied quality about them, frosted and fresh, crystalline and juicy, budding, and powerful. tangerine comes to mind, essential oils, fragrant and bright, amazing with the honey flavor that pushes through. i like that its still bitter like an ipa in the end, and i love how smooth and frothy it feels, its second to none. without a shadow of a doubt this is one of the most memorable ipa types i have ever consumed, no kidding. the freshness is obviously a major factor to it tasting so awesome, but those who still want to hate on the cloudy ipas cannot have possibly had this beer, or any of them from these guys for that matter. trillium is positively setting the standard for the style. this is from heaven! not sure another hop varietal could do what the el dorado does here, but id sure like to try!"
Poured from a can into my DFH snifter glass. I got this via trade from @Labret.
L - Hazy orange color with a murky body. A finger of white head
"A double IPA with raw honey! This beer has a very soft mouthfeel. The nose is rich with citrus, stone fruits and also lots of aroma of different kinds of melons. Flavor also follows the nose and I feel the honey makes it quite complex and gives almost a rounded feel. Delicious!"
16 oz. can dated 3/1/17 and poured into a Belgian ale glass.
"This IPA pours very cloudy almost like it is thick. The nose is heavy of fresh orange juice, but still hoppy. First taste is surprising with the citrus and yet a nice bitterness that an IPA should have...in my opinion. This an an outstanding beer that I would drive from Kentucky to Boston to get more of..."
"Trillium brewers continue to use their faithful base flavor from their Cutting Tiles series as an excuse to play the hop field. This time their flirtation with the tropical, citrusy and grassy El Dorado hops translates to a candied and creamsicle taste on the the palate."
So here I am thinking this was dialed-in w/ grape must. Blind and I'm picking up a crazy grape scent and taste. Sweet though. Sure enough Tommy surprise this is cutting tiles el dorado w/ wildflower honey. This beer is stupid good! As is all of their beers its rindy.
The bees must have collected from the hops to make the honey. A flowery bouquet welcomes orange citrus with mellowed honey flavor in this uncoventional double IPA with an acidic effervescent finish. Enjoy fridge cold to reduce the heavier mead mouthfeel.
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"a: super super hazy dark orange/caramel color. head poured 1 finger, light tan but immediately fell to a thin film on top"
This is straight orange/pineapple juice. The smell is overwhelmingly juicy. This is hazy and juicy. Taste is a nice balance of sweet and bitter. It's like I'm drinking a glass of juice in the morning.
I didn't realize this had honey in it until i got home. No mention of it on the board or when i asked the person about the beer. I'm not into honey in my beer which is reflected in the taste rating. The color is a beautiful orange with a fluffy ass white head. The smell is very citrusy with just a hint of the honey. The taste starts as delicious trillium goodness but the honey asserts itself in a negative manner. Silky smooth and thick mouthfeel. Overall i would not get this again as there are so many other delicious trillium beers that are without honey.
"Pour hazy, slightly orangish yellow in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is semi-sweet orange juice, lime, and light orange peel. The honey provides light sweetness in the backbone. Slightly bitter, light bodied, super juicy, with moderate carbonation. Goes down way to easy. This is perhaps my favorite Cutting Tiles to date..Should have gotten more of this. In my top ten of Trillium."
"Love the hop, let's see how this one is, canned 3/01"
"Super nice beer. The honey adds a very distinct flavor. There's a lot going on here... lots of different flavors, but I think it's well balanced."
L - Turbid gold with minimal head and lacing
16 oz. can dated 03/01/17
"Aroma pineapple big time. Nice lacing as always with sand city. Pours golden. Taste big pineapple, orange, mango and banana. Super crushable. Great collaboration."
"Sand City/Finback collab, 8% abv DIPA, ""refermented on heaps of pineapple,"" double dry hopped with Mosaic and Azacca hops... 11/25 release... Opaque pineapple-orange juice-looking beer with a finger or two of head on top and some thin lacing left behind... Bursting with tropical juiciness, pineapple at the fore, underscored with elements suggesting orange and mango... Smooth and soft, tingly with tanginess - another entry into that beer fruit juice smoothie category... Excellent stuff..."
Tall can
"From the can, pours cloudy yellow color with a 1-2 finger foamy off white head that faded slowly and left very good spotty lacing, with a lot of sediment floating in it. It really looked like pineapple juice."
"If you like pineapple, seek out this beer. Outstanding fruit expression that transitions into a wonderful, archetypal Sand City DIPA base reminiscent of the ONE series as it warms. Adjunct addition really adds to the base here rather than detracting or working orthogonally."
"Unber juicy, soft and fruity! Incredible dipa!!"
Worth the wait!
"I have been called a homer before and often wear that tag with pride as some of the best suds in the country are coming from New York, but there is the rare occasion that homerism aside...we've stumbled upon something special and homerism shouldn't be considered a factor...and this is just that beer. Sure this is from finback and sand city...two of the areas finest ipa makers, but this beer....THIS beer!!!"
"Can, Oct 2018"
Crisp and fruity very good beer. Taste of nectarine Malin and citrus very soft mouth feel. Well balanced and solid color and drinkability. 8.4% ABV well taken.
"Picked-up a four-pack of cans at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for about twenty dollars. One of my favorite brews from these guys, although very expensive."
"L: Hazy, like half-pulp Tropicana and amber "
thanks kevin
Same-day growlette into a tulip glass.
"16 oz can, into glass"
"Very good beer. Went to Trillium this past weekend and this was my 3rd favorite beer after Upper Case and Permutation 52. Definitely a group favorite though. Very smooth, juicy, flavorful DIPA. Didn't think it had as much flavor and aroma as Upper Case though."
Canned 11 days ago.
Drinks lighter than the ABV. Soft pillowy mouthfeel. Bold citrus flavors on the front end. Just enough backing bitterness. Malt profile allows flavors to shine.
"Dated 5/11/18 on the bottom of the can, 11 days since brewing."
"Trillium knows what they're doing. Their beers are big, lush, juicy, and balanced with a bite. This one is no exception, and is a fine example of what they're capable of."
"16 oz can 2/23/18 poured into a tulip glass. A hazy milkshake yellowish orange (think high pulp OJ) with a two finger white head that moves to small layer of foam rather quickly. Aroma is grapefruit/citrus and melon. The flavor is as described, a good amount of peach/citrus flavor and some mild grass/dirt comes in at the end. The heat is well masked, though it comes through every now and then. The feel is medium, it starts smooth but finishes sharp/dry, a scoche above medium amount of carbonation. Thanks to Rick for the delivery, heard a lot about the Trillium stuff, and this did not disappoint."
"This one I finally got a chance to try, courtesy of a fresh can from Sean at work. Great man. Equally great beer. Delivers on mouthfeel and aroma to the nth degree. Very high drinkability, could be dangerous...ly amazing!"
Pint can. Canned on : 2/23/18 opened on 3/11/18
A: Hazy gold with great foam and lacing.
"Can from the brewery in Fort Point in Boston, MA, whilst in town for EBF. Hazy yellow-orange with light white head and mild lacing, smells like overripe peaches with a hint of lemon drop candy and passionfruit, taste is white wine must, a drop of passionfruit, and malt sweetness, finishes with a mildly spicy and boozy grapefruit bitterness, medium bodied. Solid DIPA, not to be meddled with."
Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned on 10/19/17.
Thanks goes out to larryi86 for this brew.
"Had this on tap at the Publick House in Brookline. The beer was bright orange with thick lacing but no real head. The aromas were a very thick, hoppy flavor mixed with a vocal orange aroma. The taste was a pretty piney, orange citrus wrapped in a crisp, medium body. Overall, I really like the flavors sensed in the aromas and taste."
One of Trillium's finest offerings; and they have a ton to offer!
"Canned on May 1, 2017. Not at its freshest but definitely still worth the taste."
Just pure orange juice. Totally awesome. Head diminishes a little fast for me but that's the only caveat. Nice rocky head to start. 
Lots of grapefruit here. The nose is so pungent and the flavor barely leaves any bitterness behind. It has that particular Trillium flavor all over. Grassy.
"P- Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City spiegelau.Canned on 03-AUG-17."
"Pours a turbid, golden pineapple with some nice white lacing. Mango, peach, white grape, and light grassy hops on the aroma. Mango and pineapple front in the taste with a bit of sweet peach and notes of white grapes. Dry spice on the finish from the Amarillo hops. Feels full yet soft on the palate with fair carbonation. As someone who absolutely loves the combination of Citra and Amarillo hops this beer has all the right flavors for me. I wish I could get my hands on this regularly."
"L - pours a hazy light orange. Hint of yellow. Touch of green. Surprising amount of heat for a Trill brew. Still dissipates quickly, leaving a ring of lacing. "
"personal favorite DIPA from Trillium. Crisp, powerful DIPA w/o too hoppy of a finish."
"I'm a hopsider. This is my favorite beer, and my yardstick by which I rate everything else I drink."
"Extremely cloudy IPA with an excellent smell. Crisp tasting, and no malty aftertaste."
Look: Murky pale orange with a moderate white head. Minimal activity. 
"Medium gold and juicy-looking, with a coupla fingers of ivory foam leaving some lace lines behind... Aromas and flavors of unripe melon and pineapple, little bit of orange and lime... moderate sweetness and bitterness... smooth and soft but vibrant with juiciness and tang... medium-light body... I kinda knew this would be a hit with me... 5/31/17 canning puts this at just a week old..."
Thanks to HighLowJack for sending this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 16 oz. can into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.
One of Trillium's better brews that's available often. When I make the trek up I hope this is on the can list. If someone asked me to name the quintessential Trillium beer this might be the one. So tasty and full of flavor yet so smooth and drinkable. Excellent

appearance- Yellow orange color and turbid. Pours a one inch head that dissipates pretty quickly.
"Definitely had this before (alongside an Enjoy By actually, split with friends probably over a year ago at this point... time flies!), but revisiting from a pounder can given to me by my good friend and roommate Chris! Cheers dude!"
"Canned on 2/22, poured half into a teku glass. Yielded about an inch and half of quickly dissipating head that left substantial amount of lacing on the sides. Hazy pale orange juice that smells like peach, tangerines and fresh cut grass. One of the more pleasant aromas to be honest. Getting more of the grassy flavor upfront with bitterness throughout that leaves a lasting coating. The flavor slowly fades away into a citrusy and malty finish. Slightly less full body than other DIPAs I've had but the carbonation is spot on, just enough. This is the third Trillium I've had (2nd one I rated/reviewed) and I can understand why they are so coveted. Very spoiled with the recent selection but this one is up there with the best so far!  Thanks for sharing Matty!"
Thank you Doug537 for this
Pours a murky orange with thin white head that dissipates quickly.
L: Poured a cloudy orange color with a thin layer of white head that dissipates quickly. This has the standard NE style IPA look to it. Looks like orange juice in a glass.
"Really hazy bright yellow color with slightly off-white head. Aroma has a really soft hop profile, mostly grassy and herbal. Taste starts slightly sweet and juicy, some dank hoppy notes, finishes with a light to medium bitterness. Medium body, really smooth mouthfeel, well carbonated. Really nice NE style IPA, straight forward, well made, awesome."

"really strong beer. This is a very hoppy version of the basic trillium beer that all end up being called ""american pale ale"" very fruity citrus NE IPA. I like to call it headroom light because its very similar."
Pours turbid with a medium sized head that fades quickly into a ring. Smells of orange rind with a little pine sap. Tastes follows the nose with a slight dryness and alcohol tinge. Not as creamy a mouthfeel as I expected. Good Dipa but not mind-blowing.
"Poured from can, obtained less than 2 weeks from brewery. My first experience with trillium and I was excited to pop the trillium cherry!"
Yellow hazy orange like most beers of this type that excite your anticipation. Smell is tropical citrus with slight peach and pineapple and an underlying dankness; juicy. The taste does not live up to the smell. Sweet stone fruit in the end but a mishmash in the middle and bitter back end. The aftertaste leaves a resiny coating that lingers and coats; not pleasant. The feel is medium with a normal amount of carbonation. Overall the beer is good but far from great as it is way too bitter and resiny for the top end of this style.
"Bright, almost fully opaque orange with a soft but thin bubbly blanket. The lack of 100% opacity makes a ton of large floaters unappetizingly visible in this beer."
L: Poured from a can a nice hazy yellow. Orange tinge. Quite expected and to style. 
"I really like this beer, in spite of what I'm about to write. Can dated 10/24/16, so only 2 weeks old."
"Poured into a tulip glass from can. Very cloudy and amber in color. Couldn't smell very well today but picked up citrus smells (tangerine?). Tasted great with great balance between alcohol and carbonation. I think I could drink these all the time, but was included in a trade and unfortunately I'm not in the distribution."
"Pours nice white headthat fades quickly with great lacing. Hangs to the sides of the snifter. Aroma of hops, mango, peach, grapefruit and pineapple. Taste is nice citrus, grape juice, mangos earthy, pine needles,grass and hop finish. Another strong brew from trillium."
"Poured from a can in a shaker pint. Pours light golden and very hazy,!with a moderate white headed and lacing that lasts. Nectarine and citrus mixed. Taste is same, and hip forward, aggressively but not harshly and--certainly!--not unpleasantly so. Is there malt in here? Dunno. Don't care. Just spent a weekend in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom and so my palate is pretty jaded, but came home to this, and I say: it rocks. !"
"16 oz can dated 8/30/16. Inscription on the bottom of the can reads ""BREWTAL."""
Thanks to JLindros for the can.
"Pours hazy, orange-brown in color, with minimal head. Taste is peach, nectarine, mango, and cracker. Slightly bitter with a heavy body. Just a beautiful juice bomb. My favorite Trillium beer so far. I will be back again to pick up more."
On tap at Armsby Abbey
Appearance - Pours cloudy orange color decent white head that dissipates but leaves good lacing.
Amazing-grapefruit/peach
"BANG! This is an excellent DIPA. RIght in the ranks of Heady and Sip, Pours an opaque light-medium gold. Nice thick white head. Some lacing. Exploding with citrusy aromas. Some earthy hints as well. Taste is similar with a consistent malt backbone. Feel is a tadddd bit undercarbonated for my taste. Even at 8.4% I feel like I could down these bad boys all day long!"
"From a 16oz can, dated 08/30/16, served in an imperial pint/nonic."
Pours a turbid golden color. Aroma is juicy citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is juicy citrus with a hint of tropical fruit and a mellow smooth clean finish. Has a nice body and overall a very delicious beer.
16 oz can
"Poured from a 16oz can into a teku glass, can dated 8/30:"
"i cant imagine a double version of this! its so pungent and intense already, it seems near perfect for the style to me, and was probably my favorite of the handful of trillium beers we just had. hazy as expected, but somewhat brighter than the others, sunny and glowing too, and sporting a full inch of shaving cream thick white head with fine lace. it smells great, juicy orchard fruit, red apple and apricots, grapevine, meyer lemon, definitely a softer citrus, this is loaded with citra hops i am sure from the aroma. the flavor holds up too, and unlike some of their others, the bitterness doesnt creep in until much later on, so the juicy fruity ripe fruity hop experience lasts through the entire beer. peach and pear in the flavor, with grapefruit notes too, pungent but also approachable, this is an entirely different kind of ipa, and its shocking to me that its so strong, it drinks like its half of its abv, and i could see getting into some real trouble with this one if it we had an infinite supply. creamy full body seems aided by whatever sediment is in here, very harmonious flavor and textural integration. this is among the best beers i have had from these guys, a really splendid offering enjoyed fresh as can be. hard to beat that! this gives heady topper a real run for its money..."
I made a trade for this and it was well worth it! Trillium puts out some excellent beers as we all know. I haven't been lucky enough to try many of them but this one makes me want to make a trip and spend way too much money! Excellent beer!
Reminds me of street green.
"Smooth, well-blended hoppy flavors. Malt is good. A very pleasing IPA."
A: Hazy yellow golden with ample fine carbonation head.
"Poured from the standard 25.4 oz bottle into my Spiegelau IPA glass. I don't see a date stamp, but my friend got this from the brewery a couple of weeks ago, so I'm sure it's fresh."
5/5/16 bottling date
Hazy and slightly orange in color.
"Nice hazy look, as one would expect for a New England, and a wonderful nose of peach and citrus. Same flavors on the palate with a balanced but assertive bitterness. Mouth filling with pleasant carbonation. Lovely beer!"
"Sunshiny-haze color. Scent and flavor of this beer is more delicate than other offerings from Trillium. I get mainly passion fruit on the nose and perhaps some grape as Trillium describes. Taste follows the nose but it is subtle enough to let the alcohol come thru midway thru which isn't ideal. Wish they did a better job hiding it for this... but overall a quality beer, just not among my favorites for Trillium."
"A - nice murky orange amber kind of color, with a loose fluffy head that sticks and leaves great lacing"
Consumed 5/7/16
Pours a cloudy bright golden yellow color with a small creamy white head. Leaves some pretty good lacing.
Bottle Date: 4/1/16
Hazy golden sunset orange. White head with lace.
Bottled 4/1/2016. 
"This beer pours a cloudy and completely opaque bright golden color with a bit of an orange hue. The head is 2 fingers, dense and bright white. Retention is fantastic and the lacing is some of the best I have ever seen. There is more spots of white lacing than there is visible glass. Smell is grape, pineapple, mango and dank citrus. Taste is the same with a very mild bitterness. Feel is medium, slick and resinous. Overall a very good beer, but I'm not huge on the grape flavor."
"Picked up the bottle yesterday, two hops I really like so hopefully this comes out swinging."
Service: Bottle
750ml bottle dated 04/01/16
"great citrus nose, mouth feel us notable. impressed with this."
"750 mL bottle. Hazy orange body. Smell is citrusy, Kinda herbal. Rye? Smells pretty sweet too. Taste is citrusy again. Sweet pale malt. A little of that rye flavor also. Medium heavy. Not really that interesting, but nice."
Poured into a Trillium tumbler from a bottle bottled on 1/22/16.
"750ml bottle. Served in a minisnifter glass. Pours a cloudy & hazy orange-copper body, one finger white head, good retention, some lacing. Smells of wonderful stonefruit, citrus and pine; very aromatic with a nice mellow caramel presence and some grainy sweetness. Some floral notes finish things out. Flavour is similarly hop-forward, plenty of stonefruit, pine, caramel, cereal grain, touch of tropical fruit with floral bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, hefty with a really nice refreshing dryness on the finish. Not very bitter as usual despite the double IPA designation. Another very nice double IPA from Trillium, who are making the best hoppy beers in this country right now. It's not even close."
my 5th brew from Trillium. probably the lowest rated so far..... but still so good!
Look - That signature murky/turbid golden NE IPA look. 
"The beer comes in a deep gold to pale amber color, fluffy white head, rich and hazy."
Love almost everything I have had by Trillium up to this point and this one was no exception! Loved this Trillium Hop Bomb! Trillium knows how to do hops right!!
Bomber poured into pint glass. Bottled Feb 3. 
another great Trillium offering.. the are clicking on all cylinders... love the dank citrus notes on smell and taste.. mouthfeel is medium and really nice. not too boozy
"Probably my least favorite of the Trillium IPA, DIPA and APAs but still very good!"
"bottled on January 22, 2016 (so just under a month old). Huge thanks to my man mark for the generous goandpickitupformebro. split with the Mrs into two Willie bechers. really amazing beer...bursting w tropical fruity juiciness. very light and easy drinking. so much flavor. so good."
"A - Cloudy and opaque tan orange color with a thick, frothy lacing ring, gentle carbonation. "
"From 02/08/16 notes. Picked up 2 bottle of this at the brewery in Boston on 2/5, drank one on 2/6 and one on 2/8. Poured into my Trillium tulip."
"This poured out as a nice golden color, some haze to it with a little bit of head on top. The smell of the beer is quite hoppy. The taste is blended well between hops and malt. The feel of the beer is medium bodied, pretty smooth. Overall it's another solid IPA from Trillium."
"By far the best Trillium beer I've had. The first that really compares with the top IPA's from hill farmstead and treehouse. Might be one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Just a perfect production of the ""New England IPA"" style."
Growler fill. 
"Great DIPA with the classic Trillium aroma that makes you feel like you've stepped into the brewery. Dank, citrusy smell bursts forth from the bottle. Taste of unripened mango, pineapple, orange peels and sweet malt. The malt is actually the sweetest I've tasted from any Trillium beer. Strong alcohol heat envelops the mouth; not off-putting but it makes its presence well known. Extremely bitter."
750 bottle poured into tulip. 12/10/15 
"This one pours a clear reddish color, with a half inch head, and a good amount of lacing. Clear and red?! This is entirely unlike any other Trillium IPA I've had, in terms of appearance at least."
"yet another great double IPA from one of the masters of East Coast beers. pours a darker orange color with haziness, beautiful head that lasts a while and leaves gorgeous even lacing on the glass all the way down, but i've seen better looking heads, even from them. smell can be described as tropical without the ""warmness"" and sweetness that tropical fruits typically have. peaches and that dank hop profile are the 2 main flavors when sipping this beer. malt is there, and is actually very sweet when compared to some of their other beers. feel is right spot on to Trillium, carbonation carries the flavors through and breaks up some of that slick mouth feel that DIPAs are known for. overall another awesome one from Trillium, can't wait until this or Heavy Mettle comes back again."
Bomber poured into pilsener glass
Not the trademark haziness of their pale ales. Very good dipa bit on the boozey side. But their pales still reign supreme for me
"750 ml bottle. Hazy apricot orange with thick white head with lots if lace. Big ripe fruit aroma, peaches. Ripe fruit and citrus sweetness up front, backed by toasty bread. Back end earthy bitterness, dry finish. Silky soft full mouthfeel. Excellent DIPA with tons of flavor."
Bottle poured into snifter. Fresh. About 12 oz. pour.
Thanks to Dan for this one. 750ml bottle into a Grrrz teku. Shared with schen9303. 
Add it to the list of Trillium IPA success stories. First Trillium beer in a while/first time trying Mettle and it did not disappoint. Great orange color and citrusy aroma. Nice and soft on the pallet. Can't wait to grab some more soon
A delicious dipa from trillium? Totally unexpected.
"Pours hazy orange with a two finger head. Smells of citrus and sticky fruit, Amarillo hops. Taste is light (for the ABV) with hop flavor and citrus. This honestly feels a bit watered-down compared to most Trillium offerings. Peppery mouth feel that finishes bitter and lasting. Overall, better than average for IPAs, but a slight disappointment from Trillium, which usually offers more."
"Pours a nice golden orange with a bright white head. Smells like orange marmalade. Lots of orange. Some intense oranges, not on the level of Congress St as far as the mouthfeel. It's a really solid DIPA."
64 oz growler was poured into a pint glass. 
Now this is a proper DIPA! Trillium nails it every time. Perfect hop balance but with massive tropical fruit and piney zing. I'm really not sure how a beer of any style can be better. Thanks judkinst for sharing a growler!
"Growler filled 11/14/15, the same day the beer was tapped; also drank that day in a teku glass; great beer, but it is a little more grassy and bitter than other Trillium hoppy beers; as a DIPA, perhaps it could stand to age a week or in the fridge to mellow out a bit; UPDATE: drinking it again after 5 days in my fridge in a bottle instead of off draft from a growler. Great choice to let it mellow a little, excellent beer, like it much better from the bottle."
"750ml bottle served in a tulip. Pours a translucent orange-gold with a tight, one inch, bright white head that settles into a fluffy, 1/8th inch cap. Swaths of textured lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is incredible! Huge tropical fruit notes right off the bottle pop. Once in the glass you get a kiss of rind and spice and an earthy quality towards the back. Taste follows nose with a suggestion of candied tangerines and herbal notes at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light); perhaps a little thin. Carbonation is lively, but overall, the body could use a little more texture. Overall, another top notch Trillium DIPA that is totally in my wheelhouse. I can't wait until the larger production facility opens!"
"Typical Trillium haze and straw color. A swirl shows a watery look and poor lacing and head. Aroma features light fruit, vegetal notes and caramel. Flavor lacks Trillium's hop punch and lacks the appropriate bitterness of a DIPA . Vegetal notes return with a mash up of over ripe fruits, caramel and booze. Mouthfeel is soft and thin. I am one if Trillium's biggest fans, but this falls dreadfully short when compared to this breweries extensive line up of world class hoppy beers."
I was looking forward to this beer..
32 oz growler poured into a tulip.
"Great citurs, pine and tropical flavours"
Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a snifter. This was bottled today.
"Bottle in late November... Really pleased with how this held up. Candied citrus rind, caramel malt, hint of grapefruit along with some piney/grassy character. Gonna have to get my hands on a fresh bottle next round."
A solid DIPA--- one man's unattractive hazy and vegetal quality is another's love that hazy look (who wants a clear beer?) and piney flavor.... mixed in with hoppy goodness and tropical fruits make this another trillium winner (would prefer a scunch less malt but im a no-malt kinda guy)
"11/29/14 bottling. Unattractively hazy. Some nice tropical notes, but also still has a definite tinge of that old vegetal character I get from most of Trillium's IPAs."
From bottle dated 11/29/14:
Just opened a bomber of Mettle (11/29/14) that I just picked up today. This beer is simply amazing. The scent of grapefruit is filling my kitchen. I am a happy man. It is so nice to no longer need to drive to VT for great beer. Welcome back online Trillium.
"I've yet to sample a Trillium beer that I did not consider world class! Keep up the great work, M & M Tetrault"
"Nov 19th bottle, opened Dec 14th. Special thanks to costanzo_mike for the bottle."
"Thanks to jslay013 for handing this off in an in person trade a week ago. My first taste of Trillium, looking forward to it. Minimalist brown-tone label, 750ML of liquid bottled on 11/29/14. Split with my wife. "
Great beer but not as good (my opinion) as their other offerings.
"Really enjoyed the complexity and layers of hops in this one. Nose was citrusy and the initial flavor was as well but then a wave of bitter hops hit the back of the tongue and resonate for a minute before fading. Very interesting with the way the hop flavors are ""layered"". Very good DIPA."
"Appearance: Pours a cloudy honey color capped by an impressive, two-finger head; excellent retention and the lacing is a nice dividend"
Notes from 10/28/14
"God bless New England water. Pours a cloudy golden orange with about half a finger head, gorgeous. Smell is apricot and peach with strong citrus scent. very dank which i love. Taste follows up with citric bitterness and peach sweetness. Mouthfeel is amazing, Juicy with a dry finish. Alcohol is ridiculously well hidden. What a great beer from Trillium. Second best DIPA out of Boston after Heavy Mettle."
A - hazy golden yellow orange glow....cloudy beer just how I like them. 
Bottled 10/2/14. World class DIPA.
"Pours a yellow/light orange with a thick white head that lingers nicely throughout drinking. Nice lacing on the glass. Smell is thick with Amarillo hops, tropical, citrus. Flavors reflect the same, soft juicy citrus balances well with the hop bitterness and slight booze flavor. Drinks really smooth, excellent beer."
"Bottle. Pours a hazy yellow orange. Nice frothy finger head. Strong lacing. Smells a vibrant grapefruit and peach. Some peel zip on this. Grapefruit and orange. Classic TH feel. Smooth, rich, good carb, and stick."
Poured from a 32oz growler into snifter
Ummmmmm ! What's up with this batch?? Just picked this up today and it was very boozy and harsh. Super bitter . Like bitter like something that you shouldn't consume etc. ( though I will continue to sample) I don't recall this tasting this way in the past. Anyone else notice ?
Got a squealer refilled from the brewery just a few days ago... 
"32oz growler poured into a Trillium snifter. Enjoyed on 3/31/14, reviewed from tasting journal."
Growler shared by yourefragile. Thanks Michael!
Filled a few days ago at the brewery...
"The beer pours some nice white and foamy head but dissipates quickly and is hard to get a decent head going. The beer itself is a hazy orangish yellow color that looks very nice. The beer smell is fantastic. Notes of grapefruit and lemon zest and a bit of pine to even out the transition between the two. The notes also have an interesting creamy smell. Slight hints of pepper but mainly hop notes dominating the nose. The beer taste is similar to the smell. The main notes are the lemon and grapefruit with the pine showing up in the aftertaste. Unlike the smell, the taste a malty sweetness to balance out the hops a little bit. The carbonation is fairly light and the feel is incredibly light and smooth for a DIPA. Overall, a fantastic and unique DIPA. While some are heavy, this is comparatively light. Furthermore, even though it resembles their Fort Point, I would say this drinks easier."
"Mettle pours a hazy straw yellow with a small, creamy head on top. The foam disappears quickly leaving behind a few spots of lace on the glass."
"I bought and drank this beer on the 22nd, and it was spectacular. Very smooth, and not excessively hoppy for a Double IPA, which I enjoyed. Trillium really outdid itself with this beer. It reminds me of Tree House's Julius. I can only hope that it will be brewed more often. I think this beer is as good as Heady, TH Julius, and Lawson's. The only beer that I've had that is better is Double Citra by HF."
Served in the Publick House in Brookline MA as a remnant from the Trillium first anniversary party. 
A-Dimly glowing orange body. A standard shelf of white foam floats above the body. Pretty consistent lacing.
"Orange, tangerine zest, unripe mango, white peach and grapefruit pith. Biscuit malt base. Fairly balanced, skewed towards citrus bitterness. Creamy feel, medium bodied. Smooth. Semi dry, shorter finish. It is good."
"Drank on-tap at The Publick House, Brookline, MA"
"dang this is some crazy juice! i dont think it needs to be as big as it is, its boozy and a little sweet, but it sure is hard to argue with the vibrancy, freshness, and intensity of this incredible hop profile, really a standard setter in that regard for the style. wow. its hazy, brassy golden, and with a slowly settling white head from the tap. its got a lot of density to it but doesnt look overly milky or anything. huge mosaic in the nose, sliced pineapple, orange juice, and lemongrass all come to mind, with a candied sort of oily vibe as well, which i have gotten in a few of the other recent bigger ipa types i have had from other half. huge citrus in the taste, a honey notes that brings the hops and the grain together with an orange essence to it and a little sugar, and then a pretty robust tropical wave, mango juice and pineapple. there is a lot of body here, some residual sweetness, and a general booziness that is to be expected in a beer this strong. i dont think its a bad thing necessarily, but to be toned back a little on the alcohol would be nice i think. the hops are awesome, and thats what its all about, so if it needs to be this enormous to get there, then so be it. stoked to have had these guys send some beers out to trve this past weekend, everything was delicious!"
Very smooth for a triple
"If you're looking for just one can for the evening, this would be a great place to land. AGE packs everything you need from a NEIPA into one sleek can. A tide of bright, juicy hops waves carries you through the warmth of a 10%+ hammer."
A solid beer! Just a bit too boozy for me! I do love beers that are 10-11% but this one hits a little too hard for me. All the hops are killer though!
Pure golden in color. Head is white almost bright white. The nose is like a glass of orange juice. The taste is juicy and delicious. Follow through was a soft finish of citrus bitterness. This is a great New England IPA
Can Tx to Chris J
Amazing beer! Great pine and hoppy taste. Smooth finish
Great beer but I had a slight green pepper taste through the finish on all my cans! I could have been the hops but I don't know!
"Tasted from can. Pours a murky orange with thick white head. Aroma of pineapple, passion fruit, lemon. Taste is well balanced. Hides ABV extremely well. Flavors of pineapple, grapefruit, passion fruit, tangerine, resin, pine. Dangerously good imperial IPA."
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, green session. Aroma has dank hops, ripe peaches and apricots. Taste is fruity with an underlying malt sweetness, balanced out by the intense hops. Finish also has​some astringent hop bitterness."
"Pours a hazy orange in color with a finger and a half of off white head with great retention that leaves behind a moderate amount of sticky lacing. Upon closer inspection I'm able to see some fine particulates that have settled to the bottom of my glass. In the aroma I get mango, cantaloupe, peach, lychee, some alcohol, and a little bit of caramel sweetness. Taste is a bit of caramel sweetness upfront followed by aome lychee, mango, and cantaloupe. The finish is a bit syrupy without being overly sweet with some dank and lychee notes. Medium-full body with moderate carbonation. Overall this is a pretty solid beer; I'm not a huge fan of TIPAs but this isn't overwhelmingly boozy, sweet, or malty."
"This one packs a punch, be careful."
Poured from a 16oz can into an All Green Everything Other Half tulip glass. 
tall can....3/24/2017
"Canned 3/24/2017 (""Drink Your Greens"" on bottom too), it pours cloudy orange color with a massive 2-3 finger foamy head that was full of medium sized bubbles that didn't move for a while and then dissipated very, very slowly leaving a spider web of connected bubbles and a foam mountain. The head slid down and left really good foamy lacing in a camouflage pattern."
On tap at Haymaker. From notes. Reviewed 17 January 2017.
"My favorite Other Half to date. Goes down super smooth for a TIPA - I could really get into trouble with this one. I've had other Triples that were overly malty, but this one still had hops are the front-runner. Loved it!"
32oz growler from Beershop NYC on the UWS
Had on draft out of a tulip. 
Nice golden color. Super aromatic and hop strong. Not the smoothest IPA but very dank. A bit too boozy for my like but I know people who really like that boozy bite it has.
16 oz can. No date.
"12oz/$7 USD on-draught @ the brewery taproom. Due to the crowded cramped space, my notes have to be brief."
Look is a orange hazy color that poured with a quarter inch head. Initial smell dank and hoppy. Initial taste is alcoholic with hops that just layer the tongue with hops. This is just a huge alcoholic hop bomb. Only issue is that there is no balance and it isn't that smooth.
Tasted this side by side against a Stone RuinTen (RT) Triple IPA and OMG....All Green Everything (AGE) is my new favorite TIPA. Slightly lighter in color than RT with a more earthy and dank scent. AGE taste is much more dankness and much less malt than RT. Truly a world class beer From Other Half!
"Poured a clear golden amber color with a fingers worth of foamy head. The nose is very hoppy with citrus, tropical fruit, and pine with a good malt backbone. The flavor is a little boozy but still easy to drink as it is balanced by citrus fruit, pine, and sweetness from the malt. This is an great ""Triple IPA""."
You can taste all 10.5% of the abv
"Holy shit - this is awesome - canned 9/22 - featuring Motueka, Amarillo, Citra and Mosaic hops - bursting with pine, underscored with pith, remarkably crisp and lean for a ""triple"" IPA - medium body, moderate carbonation, boatload of bitterness, clean malts - just what a hop-head craves in a big IPA. I could session this."
"Shared this with about 5 other people, and to be honest just a small pour was really all I needed. It looks and smells great, tons of hops obviously. My biggest critique of this one is it's ABV. It smells and tastes boozy as hell and to me is distracting from the hops. I very much preferred the Small Green Everything we had the previous week, and to me it was a much better expression of the hops and just more palatable in general."
Fairly clear amber with an off white finger of dense foam dying to a thin film and ring.
A- The all green tallboy pours into a snifter with a medium golden yellow hue with quite a haze to it. The crown on the brew is white with a thick and frothy consistency rising up to over a half inch. Good retention and the wide belt at the edges drops a few large webs of lace.
"A: Big hoppy aromas of citrus, orange, grapefruit and berries. The beer is pungent, but not overly strong, especially for a Triple IPA."
"Pours opaque brown with a one finger head. Smells boozy and citrusy, sticky citra. Taste is bitingly bitter and boozy. Definitely packed with hops. I appreciate the beer... I'd like to give it a nicer review, but an IPA this intense is a little overdone for my liking."
16 oz can was poured into a pint glass.
A boozy and hoppy incredibly drinkable triple IPA from Other Half. Haven't had a bad or mediocre beer from them yet. Superbly balanced for a 10.5% monster. I definitely would love to try more of there beers if they were in my distro.
L: Pretty hazy golden copper just a think ring of foam lacing was better than expected for a 10.5 %
"First had on 05/20/2016, poured from pint can, gift from cousin, into nonic pint. As you would expect from something called a ""Triple IPA,"" this is a huge beer, but it is not unbalanced."
From a can to Tulip.
16 oz can into tulip glass. 2/12/16. green 4 life. 
A: Pours a clear light golden orange with 2-3 finger white head. Nice retention and some slight lacing. 
Pours a hazy dark amber color with a small off-white head. Decent retention and lacing on this one. 
A bit too malty and boozy for me but decent all around
"32oz growler from the brewery. Pours a super hazy golden brown color with a small amount of head. Lots of lacing. Juicy tropical fruit aroma with dank and herbal hops. Sweet and boozey smelling. The taste is a big blend of hops. Dank and herbal but also some piney notes and the tropical fruits as well. Mango, guava and papaya. Some caramel malts. Piney finish. Pretty boozey tasting. Very dry with a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, fantastic Triple IPA."
Pale Amber in color with minimal head and no lacing.
"Great beer. High ABV, but it carries it well."
"L: Yellow, copper hues, big white head"
Tallboy can poured into a snifter.
"My favorite Triple IPA. This reminds me of a Treehouse type beer. It has that unique smell/feel and tastes great, especially for 10.5%. Big fan here!"
"Perfection. So glad this brewery is close to me, only wish the canned even more."
Best triple IPA ever
"A- hazy golden color; moderate carbonation, slight head"
16oz can in a stemmed tulip IPA glass.
"Picked this up recently at Other Half's offering on a Saturday, never having this before. I heard this this was this best beer that was readily available and without a doubt, that turned out to be the case. Most of their beers are IPA's stylistically and this was the one that stood out head and shoulders above the rest, offering a ton of hops and taste from start to finish!"
Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Can was purchased fresh from the brewery 1 day earlier. 
Incredible triple IPA. Wow. One of the best beers to come out in the last two years.
"Pours a bright golden color from the can. The nose was tropical, citrusy, and piney. The body was piney and resinous with a medium sweet malt bill and finishes with a strong bitterness. The bitterness was quite the kick. I prefer Green Diamonds over this but this is still good."
"Much preferred Green Diamonds to this one but I think it's because I can't handle the hop bitterness punch at the end of this beer. Possible that it was made more difficult by also having some spicy food at the same time -- probably intensified it. Regardless, the nose was quite good, was the part of the overload of hops that I really enjoyed. The mouthfeel was great as well - not overly carbonated and had a nice hit for a triple. Enjoyed this one, but will not seek it out again in the future unless in NY."
L: Hazy light gold
"Dirt, pine, earthy. Just a great DIPA."
Got this amazing Triple IPA in a trade. This craft brew was amazing!
"Enjoyed initially at the brewery tap room, however at the time of scribing it was poured from a can loaded a a week prior. Thanks, Dylan!"
"Fresh can poured into a snifter. It pours an amber/orange color with an off-white head. The aroma on this one is amazing; straight tropical juice. The taste is on the same page as the smell and has lots of flavor from citrus to mango to grapefruit and so on. This one has medium body and somewhat dry on the finish. Awesome offering from Other Half for sure, cheers!"
"L - Nice looking beer! Dark for an IPA but I guess that's why they call it a TIPA! Slow, evervescing bubbles give way to a dangerous looking brew. "
"Pour: On draft at The Jeffery in NYC. Poured into a tulip glass. Appearance: Light gold in color with a wee bit of haze. Medium white head with a nice bit a lacing on the sides of the glass. Aroma: Big bold hoppy notes. Heavy and juicy citrus...grapefruit aroma. Earthy and grassy notes are detected as well. Taste: Fat and juicy. Lots of big hop tastes. A considerable amount of funky notes as well...onion? Aftertaste: Bits of alcohol warmth on the back end (which is consistent with the ABV (10.5%)), cuts through the heavy hops and bold citrus. Overall: Big bold stunner. Liked it and would return. Very good. 4.3 out of 5."
Very hop forward brew. Thick film of hop sap stays with you. Glad to have tried. Would love to see how this would be on tap.
"Description: Bright, golden color with a white head and not much lacing. Smell is pine, orange and mango with a slight bitterness. The taste is overwhelmingly hoppy and bitter with very little of the citrus fruit that it smelled like. A bit of dank, onion ""funk"" in the taste. Lightly carbonated and smooth for an IPA."
"Great taste, big kick."
Thanks to xrusha for this guy (super fresh)!
One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Intense fruit smell with smooth taste. The alcohol sneaks up on you.
A - Medium copper gold color with a vibrant clear color and light carbonation.
"Poured from a can into a tulip glass, this was canned on 9/25/15, reviewing on 11/1/15. I've had a few that were more fresh, but I wanted it to mellow out a bit for the review. Pours a bright orange, hazy but plenty of light comes through. White ring of bubbles but no lacing really. Aroma is tropical fruits and citrus, a little pine. Taste is fantastic, I'm glad I let it mellow a little, it was almost too dank of a hop bomb when I drank the others, but it was still delicious then. It's still a hop bomb, mostly reminded of grapefruit, some fresh squeezed orange juice, orange rind, a slight hint of melon. This triple IPA is a bit boozy, warms me up a little. Even after a month, it still tastes a bit like you're chewing ok hop pelets, but not as much as when it was canned. This is a total hop bomb."
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip. Tropical/citrus notes all over this one in both smell and taste. The bitterness is well-controlled and the booze is supremely hidden. Overall, one of the better triple IPAs I've come across."
"Can dated 9/26 poured into a Teku. Pours a slightly hazy deep golden orange. Awesome smell that's sweet like candied grapefruit with loads of juicy tropical hops and dank herbal onion. Also a good bit of booze. Taste follows with more dank earthy onion, resin and touch of pine. Feel is spot on, kind of thick and oily like the other great east coast doubles. This is a HUGE double. It is pretty boozy and don't think it hides it at all but it does work with the malt sweetness."
Appearance - There isn't too much to say in terms of how this beer looks. It is mostly hazy but has a great sunburst orange color. An off-white head quickly builds and falls before haphazardly sticking to the glass.
"The nose is really tropical. Sweet malts support the hops and five of a mango like scent that is potent. The taste is even better. Tons of mango, papaya, and guava. In your face amounts of pine come in and bring you to a nice high level bitter finish. The sweet malts really support the hops here and balance this just about right for me. The feel has a nice coating mouthfeel, with a medium to light carbonation. Just a tinge of alcohol can be noticed."
Look - An orange/golden color. Slight haze. One finger fluffy white head 
"16 oz can. Pours deep opaque orange, thick fluffy head slowly fades coating the glass with lace. Big sweet juicy aroma, jumps out. Taste follows with big juicy hops and a sweet malt backbone. This brew is delish, powerful but only slightly boozy, great balance. Hops turn piney into a dry finish with bitterness lingering just right. Medium soft mouthfeel. Don't know if I've had a better triple IPA, outstanding."
"World class. Fresh. Banking notes of resin, citrus and dank."
Glad that I finally got the chance to try this bad boy… Most triple IPAs are way too over-the-top multi… This one is packed with hops and does not taste like it's an 11%
"16 oz can. Burnt orange colored body, nice white head that left nice lacing and a thin retention cap. Aromas of sweet malt, citrus hops, alcohol and tropical fruits. Flavor is a noticeable sweetness up front, a bit of booze, citrus fruit and citrus hops. Really nice beer but the hype might be a bit too strong with this one."
Been a while since I sat down and wrote out a review so I figured it was time. Canned 9/26. Consumed 10/7.
Super tripple hop . Loved it for how strong it is . I was drinking it slow enjoying the nose it had on it and the light sips showed the hops but also how much the bittness was controlled .
"An exceptional beer from a great brewery! I had this on tap at the brewery. Great color, nice aroma, and a great taste! my favorite beer from Other Half!"
"First beer from these guys. As far as triples go, this is by far the best I have had. Hoppy, balanced and near perfect carbonation. This drinks like a DIPA, but packs a punch at 10.5% ABV. Boozy? nah, this is an amazing beer that has excellent balance. Totally worth seeking out. The description says double but it's a triple."
"poured from tall boy into tulip. massive amounts of tropical fruit. pineapple. mango. pine resin, very well balanced. ive never scored anything a perfect 100, until now. ive never had a better imperial IPA than this. unbelievable."
"A well done, self-proclaimed triple IPA. Great can design, poured into a glass. Great nose, definitely green, hoppy as all get out. Taste and body are nice, could be a bit more balanced on malts & hops."
This fucki'n thing is dangerous on ALL levels!
Poured from a 16oz can into a Speiglau glass.
"Dank, pine and resin right away on the nose, but the flavor brings in a smooth and creamy floral profile. good white head dissipated quickly for me in my IPA glass. Maybe my tastebuds are fried, but I think this held and hid the booze well, it did not overwhelm the awesome hop bill on this one."
"got from can release at the brewery in Brooklyn. pours a hazy dark orange. smell is a fruit bomb, tons of orange, grapefruit, and citrus. taste follows the smell spot on, orange and citrus blast, rounded off by grapefruit and sweet, yet dry finishing malts. lots of booze but works perfectly with the blast of flavor. carbonation is perfect, and still good after a month, but not too intense to the point where the beer feels super thin. one of the best Other Half offerings."
Appearance: Clear amber-orange. Head is white and fluffy. Dense and creamy. Drops out after a few minutes and leaves almost no cap or collar. Minimal lacing. Moderate carbonation on the pour. 
Canned 7/27 thanks to rudzud
Poured from 16 oz can dated 8/28/2015 into nonic pint. 
"Pours a dark orange with fluffy head that lingers. Minimal lacing. Aroma is fresh cut grass, tangerines, passion fruit, and pineapple all drenched in resinous pine sap. Taste is more pine sap and grass. Resinous. Dank. The fruit is almost overwhelmed, but sweet citrus and passion fruit are present leaving behind a bitter aftertaste of grapefruit pith. Overall, the flavor is more dank than bitter. As it warms, a caramel sweetness develops. The mouth feel is full bodied. It does have a dry finish, but this is still tough to drink. The dank, grassy aroma and flavor make this a unique experience. Its worth trading for."
"Quick dissipating head, nose is very subtle with hints of floral and citrus. Feel and finish is shockingly smooth for a triple IPA. Little to no bitterness. Well done!"
"One of my favorite beers I've tried from other half which never seems to disappoint. Well built beer. Pours a hazy orange. Lots of hops with fruit notes. The strength of the beer is well masked so it's drinkable, and you'll definitely feel it after. World class for sure."
Received as an extra in a trade. Shared with JLindros. 
Had this on tap at Tørst in Brooklyn.
"Look: Dark orange body with a white foamy head that easily slips from the sides of the tulip glass it has been poured into. The body is lighter than Hop Showers, solid, and even colored orange compared to some of their other IPAs."
"Pours a slightly cloudy copper orange color, with a white frothy head. The odor is strong, mango, peach, orange, lemon, pineapple, grapefruit, resin, slight onion, slightly salty, slight floral, tropical fruits, passion fruit, slight strawberry. The taste is a crisp, resin, malty, grapefruit peel, slight onion, pineapple, bitter dry finish."
"Drank on tap at Other Half Brewing Company in Brooklyn, NY."
L - Glowing dark orange with two fingers of white head
"super fruity an dank aroma, really hits the nose like crazy. a little grassy but nice malt presence, and a huge wallop of bitterness and juicy fruity notes. you guys sure its 10.5%? feels more like 6%. world class, gives heady a real run for its money"
"Pours a copper to orange with small but noticeable head. Smells really dank in resinous in glass but grassier in the can. Some citrus on palate, good hop bite, and hides the ABV quite well. Viscous resinous mouthfeel."
"Rating for a 10 percent triple ipa, this is easily top tier, its super heavy and almost overwhelming, but damn if it isnt delicious. Would buy again"
Appearance - The beer poured a golden copper color with a bright white head.
"Triple IPAs to me have always been a crapshoot in a way. I've had a lot of good ones(never had PtY), but one has never blown me away until AGE. This is an amazing beer in every way. It's high ABV, but you don't taste it. It pours less cloudy than any other OH beer I've had. The nose is very strong- pine, grass, dank. The taste is incredible, a feast for the palate. All of the intense flavors from the nose combine to provide one of the best IPA experiences I've ever had. Could not recommend higher. "
Wow! This is a serious beer. It sneaks up on you too. It pours golden with a head that dissipates quickly. Strong hop aroma. Lots of pine and grass notes and really balanced.
Nice citrusy flavor. Slightly bitter finish.
"Straight up bitterness with this one. Lots of pine. Sweetness. Some grapefruit. Hop resin stickiness in the finish. Dank and weedy. I thought this was good, but not as good as the rating suggest. #GreenCanYo"
One f'in fine beer. Amazing
"This is easily one of the smoothest and most delicious beers I've ever had at this ABV level. No cloying here; just surprisingly smooth and drinkable triple IPA. You can't hide the alcohol completely, but I found myself downing this much quicker that I'd normally approach a beer like this. Definitely prefer this hands down side-by-side with their Green Diamonds DIPA. AGE definitely lives up to the hype, and I will be seeking it out far more often moving forward."
Tastes lighter than a 10.5 ABV.
Can shared by Paul & Margot. Thanks!
Amazing smell. One of the best ever.
"little to no head when poured from 6/25/15 can into OH AGE glass. Bottom of can says ""Do Not A.G.E"" so this is as fresh as it gets, very piney, ABV is there, but you wouldn't guess 10.5% crushed the first half of this can then the booze hit me, but in a good way, slowed down and enjoyed the second (Other) Half of the can. Very well balanced Double/Triple IPA, this one is semi crushable, but hits you hard when it hits, highly recommended."
Incredibly overrated triple IPA. Straight hop resin and incredible bitterness. MEH
"Sweet, sticky orange juice. Good, but a 16oz can of this is way too much for me."
"16 oz. can poured into a snifter. Hazy orange body. Small white head that doesn’t last. Leggy. Thin collar, if that. Boozy. Caramel malt. Pine hops. Grassy. Taste is nicely hop forward, considering its size. Orange up front. More pungent and grassy behind it. Strong sweetness and equal bitterness. Heavy and boozy. Long alcohol finish. It’s tasty, but absurdly boozy and heavy."
"Deep, hazy orangish yellow when poured. The nose is tropical fruit mango and pineapples. Taste was not what I expected as some of the nose came thru but this was one dry finish on this beer. A very solid offering"
Thanks jtladner for this. Tulip glass.
Canned 5.19.15. Drank 6.13.15. Poured from a 16oz can to a Tulip.
Didn't care for this. Had some decent citrus flavors but found it very boozy which completely overtook the beer and muted all other flavors. Had multiple cans and experienced the same thing.
Wow. is all i can say. This beer is wave after wave of hoppy deliciousness. Tropical and citrus notes balanced by touches of earthy and grassy notes. Faint caramel sweetness in the end. Not boozy at all. really impressive.
Very floral hoppy beer (obviously). Prefer green diamonds but this is a really well made double (triple) ipa. Too hoppy for more than a glass or so. Drank at the brewery several times.
"Incredible nose and great taste, this beer is awesome... its so damn hot! you can really taste the alcohol, makes the body pretty big for an IPA. Did this beer blind and it smelled so good I would have sworn it was nelson from Alpine. Seriously good beer."
Thanks to mrbubbler for sharing this one at his tasting.
Had this at the ACBF on Friday night in a 2oz tasting glass. Was a happy surprise because it was not on the Guides beer list.
"This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a one finger, loose off white head that dissipates very quickly and leaves some spotted lacing. Smell is complex. Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, orange, dank green earthiness, sweet and bready malts and a touch of booze are all there. Taste is the same. A solid malt presence (expected for 10.5% abv) but the hops are most definitely the star of the show. A little bite on the back end from the alcohol. Feel is full side of medium, slick and resinous on the finish. Strong but in no way harsh. Overall an excellent beer. Really think this beer hits it's prime around the 3 week mark. The hop flavors are always incredible, but it seems like the boozy bite has pretty much dissipated."
"A: Opaque, the lighter side of bronze, with a dissipating foamy white head."
An incredible balance with great fruit notes and full taste
"Amber orange color with an off white head and some spotty lacing. Aroma is off the charts and out of bounds, it's a tropical onslaught. Taste brings waves of flavor, citrus pulp and pith, tangerine, orange, mango, papaya, and grapefruit toward the finish. Big waves of hop flavor and a clean bitterness. Medium body, touch boozy and dry on the finish. This is a top tier DIPA for sure and one that I need to seek out again."
"Wanted this beer to live up to the hype on BA. It didn't. Got one of the limited edition big $$$ cans from a friend. Enjoyed out of a plastic keg cup. High ABV beer, so I'm excited. Nose is really nice, all citrus fruits and hop yum. Taste -- like a shot of vodka with a twist of grapefruit. Ugh. Not sure why people are lining up around the block for this at all...."
"This is the first Other Half beer that totally blew me away and convinced me that something very special is going on at that brewery. Massive hop flavor, but somehow still balanced, and very drinkable despite the 10.5% ABV."
Another killer fruit bomb by OH. These guys are my new favorite brewery.
Appearance: Golden orange.
The beer comes in an amber orange with reddish hues.
"On tap, and in a 32oz growler from the brewery:"
"Another very good offering from Other half. It is close but I would have to give the edge to green diamonds. This was a very close 2nd tho as the flavors and the aromas are amazing, I just think its a little less balanced imo then the GD'S. But at this point were splitting hairs!"
"Wicked ass crazy amounts of pine. Wads of it. Loads of resin. Way up in my mouth. Gobs and gobs of it, but it's still crazy smooth. Alcohol isn't noticeable at all. Love it."
swung by the tasting room this morning to grab the citra and nelson cans and grabbed a growler of this. thanks for the growler assist jim! enjoyed from an OH willie B
On tap at Other Half 4/18/15. An unbelievably exceptional beer. Super bright and citrusy and totally drinks smoother than the 10.5 abv listed on the can.
"L: a tad hazy, but still clear. Impressive. "
Pours a deep gold with a good sized white head that leaves substantial lacing.
"One of a large number of samples I had at the Extreme Beer Fest in Boston 3/21/32014. Beautiful ipa, keep an eye on these guys!"
"Pours hazy gold. Smells like a goddamn rainbow, an A+ hop profile combining, as the name suggests, just about verdant variety of hops you can think of: there's the mango and citrus nodes of typical contemporary IIPAs, but these are balanced against more classic green flavors like grass, pine, and pot. It sounds like a mess, and by all rights it should be, but they fucking nailed it."
"EBF sample. Pours very hazy. Thin white fluff of a head. Aroma is a viscious hop bomb but seemingly brewed with new age hops. Dank and tropical. Really pungent hoppiness and boy is it enticing. Tropical hop perfume. I dive into my sample and am absolutely bombarded by tropical hoppiness. Mango, papaya, pineapple, citrus medley and plenty of pine. These hops are definitely new varietals. Pale malt lends to the juiciness of the hops. Finishes dry and very bitter. Fuller bodied. One of the best beers I had at EBF. Good lord what a hop bomb. Very legit."
L: golden orange
"I had this at the extreme Beer fest boston 2015. Hands down the best IPA of the fest. You only need to know one thing to understand why: motueka. The New Zealand hop that packs the most luscious and juicy grapefruit flavor you have ever experienced. Other Side signed their hop contracts two years before they even started brewing which is the reason they have access to this rare, expensive, and mind blowing hop. If you are attending EBF2015 and you don't try this beer you are missing out on something magical. Gold star for Other Side for bringing this amazing beer."
Drinks very boozy. Doesn't hide it at all.
"Killer IPA from Other Half, pours out hazy, white head, loaded with hoppy dank floral notes, the taste is soft yet aggressively hoppy. The feel is smooth and silky. Overall it very good IPA, would enjoy this beer anytime."
This is perfection in beer form.
These guys are making Brooklyn a true beer destination...
"Not quite Ephraim, but pretty damn close."
Revised review from my first taste at the brewery. 
32oz. counter-pressure filled growler into a Tree-House teku. Shared with schen9303.
APPEARANCE - Opaque light amber with a 1-finger white head that dissipates after 2 min. Some lacing
"Fairly hazy orange color, about a finger of head that clings to the glass. Loaded with citrus and pine in the aroma (you get it as soon as the can is cracked). Lots of citrus in the taste along with peach and grape flavors. The alcohol is definitely present as well. The pine character comes through really nice along side the moderate amount of biscuit coming through from the malt. Incredible mouthfeel fairly heavy body yet drinks smoothly, its hard to describe but incredibly pleasant."
"On tap at the tap room. Beer only a couple of days old. This is one of the best smelling beers I have ever had, amazing smell. Great taste and at 10.5 ABV there is no taste of alcohol at all. Unlike some of the other really big TIPAs, this is not syrupy."
16 ounce can poured into an oversized Belgian tulip. 
"From 05/06/14 notes. Had on tap at The Jeffrey in NYC, my first Other Half beer. 14 oz. pour in a tulip for $8."
On tap at Jimmy's No. 43. Served in a wine glass.
Poured from a 16oz can into a speiglau IPA glass. 
Trying to get caught up on ratings.
"Had on tap at Lulu's in Allston, MA around a month ago. Tasted like Very Green from TH. One of the best beers I've ever had."
Canned 5/19/17 and consumed 7/1/17
Wow! That was delicious! I'm gong to have to find that one again!
"The base beer, Tesseract, features Mosaic, Falconer's Flight, and Citra hops. This here double dry hopped edition features Mosaic cryo hops in addition to conventional hop pellets. "
"Pours an opaque hazy rusty gold color, and has a juicy foamy head. Nose and palate have bold juicy and tropical notes. The flavor on this is amazingly juicy and hoppy. Mouthfeel is full! This is the best Grimm IPA I've had to date."
"On tap, pours a beautiful orange-gold. A couple of fingers of off-white foam leaves lots of sticky lacing. Lots of haze, just shy of being fully opaque. "
3 weeks from canning date
"Pours deep amber with a big two finger white head that fades slowly as it hangs on the sides of the snifter. Great lacing. Aroma of hops, hard candies and citrus. "
"This one pours a very murky and hazy glowing orange, with a small head, and lots of sticky lacing."
reminds me of the VT big boyz
"L - medium haze, thin white head disappears, yeast flocculates after about two weeks in the can"
"Canned 02/01/18, ‘The Deuce’."
"on nose is powdered sugar, gummy sweetness, lemon, grapefruit and orange peel. "
"Stark, opaque orange."
Canned 2/1/18 (THE DEUCE) Enjoyed 2/6/18 in a Luttich. Acquired in a trade for Treehouse.
On tap at the brewery. From notes. Reviewed 29 January 2016.
White head. Golden orange color.
Reminded me of a typical New England IPA. Was a nice combination of a citrusy orange nose and still brought in some pine notes on the pallet. No quite on the level of TH but close
"I was lucky enough to catch the last few cans of this brew about 6 weeks ago. I’ve been rationing it since, and I have to say it miraculously seems to get richer each time. Can’t continue forever, though, and tonight I’m enjoying my last can. Still golden turbid with a nice sudsy topper. In its fresher days, 2nd Anny’s nose was more pine-and-grassy, but age has shaved off the earthiness, leaving pure orange and grapefruit. The taste is softer now as well, but no less vibrant: citrus, peach, chardonnay and just a hint of biscuit and resin. It’s a brash, fruity hop monster, one of the best Other Half has put out. And it’s dangerous drinkable, medium to light on the tongue with no hint of that 9%. At least not until it smacks you in the dome halfway through the can. I’ll miss this beautiful bastard. Hope you brew it again in the future."
"Pretty nice. It has that hazy quality that you want from a NE hop, but the balance was a little off for me. There were also a ton of little bits in the bottom. I don't mind a little extra in the dregs, but there seemed to be way too many in this one."
Snifter pour at Alphabet City Beer Company. 
So good
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass:
"This beer is a fucking mess. It's probably the ugliest/ prettiest beer I have ever seen. It also smells gross/ fucking incredible. It's boozy, I like booze. It's hoppy and juicy but piney. It's crazy how much flavor they packed into this dirty beer. 9%? Hid it well. I'm drunk."
"Cloudy in color and lots of great aromas burst upon the can's opening. The flavor is a bit surprising; despite it smelling fruity, it tastes very different from the tradition juice bomb one might expect. Lots of sediment in the glass (wish I had known upon pouring). A little flat compared to most NEIPAs I have imbibed. Nevertheless, a great beer worthy of drinking."
L - Hazy orange with three fingers of white head
"Look-poured into a teak glass from a growler, color is a cloudy orange/yellow,pours a finger of thick, white head that retains well."
"Medium hazy orange, with tons of tropical notes on the nose. Bitterness is more pronounced with the taste, but is still pleasant and goes really well with the tropical notes. Good amount of carbonation. Really great!"
Can into tulip glas. 1/29/16. Cheers 2 U
"16oz can poured into a tulip, canned 1/29/16"
"This is Other Half's best beer. A little on the boozy side, but that is OH for ya. This is the fruitiest, most tropical IPA they ever made with notes of manderin and guava in the nose, and big time orange bitters, melon, papaya, and even some hint of coconut on the palate. Minding the intimidating fruit profile, at the same time still has that dank, grainy, piney, with the slightest kiss of west coast-like IPA notes that most of the other half beers seem to possess. Yet, this is still all NEIPA. GET SOME"
Blown away by this beer. By far the best beer to come out of other half. It doesn't have the booziness of other other half high abv beers but has the full mouthfeel the the single hop series is missing. Julius like orange rind flavor with a similar bitterness.
on draft in a 10 oz snifter glass
On tap at Pony Bar UES. 
I never review beers but decided I would start with this one.
"EBF sample pour. Poured very hazy. Aroma is brimming with a plethora of tropical fruit hops thrown together into a blender and mashed. Tropical fruitiness shoots up my nose. The flavor was of citrus and pineapple pulp with a bit of greener hops, too. The aftertaste was excellent as it dried out considerably and left a dry, mealy maltiness that was pleasant. Creamy bodied with reasonable bitterness. Probably the best hoppy beer I had at the fest."
Look: Yellowish with a tad bit of orange. A nice head of an inch or two.
"Look: Darkened gold, cloudy goodness. Nice thick 2 finger head that is not quitting. Near the bottom of the glass the beer appears more yellow or blonde."
Growler into a tulip. 
"Waited in line 3 hours for this last week, hoping that this would live up to the hype. It was also on tap in the brewpub next door and had there not been more to enjoy, I would have loved to have had this before I headed home. It didn't matter since I was finally able to sit down and enjoy this on this snowy day. I've never had a Treehouse or a Trillium beer but this is how I pictured those looking, feeling, and tasting as this had to be one of the juiciest beers that I've ever had, to the point where the hops and alcohol took a backseat to the wonderful flavor that this packed!"
"can generously kicked down from Anthony last night at the end of a bottle share. needless to say it was opened almost immediately and shared between those of us still standing. It is a very good IPA, I don't know if I would call it their best brew to date but certainly up there. the real distinction in this beer is the body...very very trillium like. has a big body that is able to handle all the juiciest from the hop."
Total juice bomb...very pretty (and by that I mean murky and ugly) east coast IPA...heat is pretty well hidden for a beer with this abv making it dangerously drinkable...reminds me of a bigger version of baby diamonds..worth trading for and might be their 2nd best offering behind their single hopped mosaic
"The look is of cloudy juice, smell hits with papaya and mango and taste follows suit. As with most OH beers the dank fruity hops are just beating out the malt bill. Another win for OH"
The beer comes in a super hazy deep gold to pale amber.
"16oz can dated 1/29/16 poured into Other Half Snifter. Has the look of a New England style IPA and the taste and smell to match. Smells of pungent hops, grapefruit, citrus, papaya and other tropical fruits. Taste is same as nose, awesome mouthfeel. Overall very well done beer."
"Gorgeous opaque orange color. Dank, herbal with candied grapefruit slices and orange zest. While still dank (herb), it seems that those hops take a back seat to hops with more of a longgg citrus finish. Grapefruit and orange zest follow through, all perpetuated by a constant bitterness that manages to restrain itself. Happy anniversary to Other Half. You guys are world-class. These pretzels are making me thirsty!"
Arrived too late to get me some of those cans but I did sample a few glasses in the tasting room. Delicious hoppy nectar that was very pleasing and satisfying if not making me regret not waking up at 6:00AM and copping some cans.
No head from the bar pour. No lace. Mild haze. The color is dirty gold. 
"650ml bottle, snifter glass. Pours a darker copper body, clear, with a one finger white head, good retention, bits of lacing. Smell is grapefruit juice, citrus, a bit of grapefruit zest, light grain, a bit of orange peel also. Flavour follows, a bit sweeter than the nose would suggest, but a nice sweet tangerine fruitiness, grapefruit and lemon zest, orange peel, mild grainy and toffee sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium body, lighter carbonation which is still appropriately within limits of the style, mild zesty orange juice finish."
Appearance - The beer poured a orange copper color with a white head. 
Exceptional double from Pipe Works
"Bomber bottle, I could find no bottling/freshness dating "
"Living in central Illinois, we don't have a lot of great local breweries distributing here. Pipeworks just recently started so I had to celebrate with a new bomber I haven't had."
Another awesome beer in the fish series. Pdubs is on point with their dipas.
"L- Pours a slightly hazy, dark orange with a thin, white head. Little carbonation. Some white lacing."
Pours a dark brownish orange color. Clear once the beer settles. Thick frothy off-white head lingers for a long time. Tons of sticky white lacing. Lovely looking DIPA albeit a bit dark.
Bottled March 2016; drank 3/19/16 @ the Palace. 
"A great balance of fruit and hops - the OJ is a delicious addition to this ""fish series"" DIPA. Probably up there with Spotter Puffer as one of my favorite Pipeworks."
"Hazy dark amber with a fluffy, uneven off-white foam."
"Orange color with off-white head. Aroma has lots of hops with orange and dank notes. Taste starts with a good dose of underlying malt sweetness and lots of earthy hops with orange and grapefruit flavors. Medium body and carbonation with a bit of alcohol warmth. Quite nice overall. Balanced, with a classic hop profile, just a bit too boozy."
Consumed on 4/28/2016.
Another excellent DIPA by Pipeworks! This one was nice and juicy just as you would expect. Had it very fresh which I would recommend as I have noticed that the DIPAs from PW do fall off a bit and get rather malty if they sit more than a week or two.
"Look - dark orange, looks thick, small white head"
"L: Dark orange and crystal clear. A very light, white head, but what little is there sticks around throughout. Moderate lacing is also present."
L- Dark orange but clear. Visible carbonation bubbles. Heavy lacing. 
"Gorgeous nose on this. Blood orange jumps out on first whiff, followed by sweet honey notes. Blood orange and honey are more subdued in the taste. Taste is more floral. Best way to describe it is tea like, with the tea having notes of orange and honey. Very dry finish. Super smooth, only mild lingering bitterness. "
5-3
Juicy orange and sweet honey mix beautifully with a balanced amount of Citra. Smells like a dirty hippy as per the theme of this series. Nice alcohol kick with a slightly sticky feel.This is a really well-made brew.
"Appearance is dark orange color with the right amount of haze, hefty ivory head and plenty of lacing. Smell is mostly of hops and malts. Taste is well balanced between the orange, honey hops and malts. Mouthfeel is excellent, perfectly carbonated. Overall, Pipeworks hits another one out of the park with this beer. Easily among the best DIPAs I've had."
Look - Dark orange type color. Fairly clear...maybe a slight haze
22 oz. Bomber
"An imperial India pale ale brewed with honey, blood orange juice, and citra hops. Thanks, KidSalami!"
This beer is incredible! Tastes like a hoppy blood orange!
"The beer offers upfront a sweet bready malt, hints of honey, with blood orange zest, a bit more of juicy orange complimenting that citrus flavor with lingering sweetness with a balancing resiny bitterness. Despite being the bready and honey sweetness, the beer does a great job at hiding its size and offering a swirl of hops and juice."
"pours a dark Amber, nice Lacey head. smell is fruity and hoppy: oranges, little bit of pine, some malt on the end of the smell. taste it's a little maltier than expected but with the honey and blood orange juice it works nicely. oranges peaches that little bit of pine, then the malt with the honey mixed. feel could be a little more bubbly but overall a nice beer"
"22oz bottle that was $10.99 which is a little pricey but this was good. Orange color, slightly hazy. Aroma is sweet, citra hops, citrus, nice. Flavor is honey, citrus, delicious. Overall a good DIPA from pipeworks and after the first one I bought a second."
Okay I have been in the hunt for a bottle of Crimson Snapper for over a year and finally Pipeworks went crazy and released a ton of it and I was able to get a few bottles. It exceeded my expectations in every way. Need I say more?
"Tangerine amber body, ivory cap a few fingers thick. Plenty of orangey flavor, ample fruits and juice - moderate bitterness, big body, smooth but with some fuzz and tingle... good but perhaps I'm not as partial to orange as others may be. A good beer in any case."
"Deep copper to reddish in color, plenty of white foam that leaves good lacing, and great clarity. The aroma is big, you can smell it once you crack the bottle. Massive citrus with the blood orange leading the way. Flavor is citrus and blood orange forward as well, with added complexity. Some pine, sweetness from the honey, and enough malt flavor to keep things balanced. Body is medium-full with moderate carbonation, extremely smooth for this big of a beer. Slightly bitter, slightly boozy finish. Another excellent brew from Pipeworks."
Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter. No freshness date.
Incredible citrus. Drinks very easy for a 9.5% beer. Absolutely fantastic.
"This is a low gravity, lighter beer, almost more of a lager (think budweiser), but has an amazing fruit aroma. Very good taste, but not as good as Da Fuzz, imho... Great beer to try, would get at a restaurant or if my other favorites weren't in stock."
"Poured into a Pipeworks NvU snifter, what else? Super fresh. Dark golden amber, one of the darkest imperial IPAs I've had. That makes me think it's going to be a malt bomb, but instead it's only light and sweet. Consistent lacing with light carb. No malty flavors nor any bitterness at all. Slight zesty tang from the orange. Killer strong citrusy nose as well. Reminds me of Citrusinesis on steroids. I can see why this one is so highly regarded. Love this series from Pipeworks."
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bottle on March 20, 2016. Look is clear honey amber with a thin off-white head and spotty lacing. Smell is orange blossom, honey with floral and perfume like hop note and caramel malt aromas. Taste is orange, honey, spice,and caramel malt flavors. Feel is medium in body."
"What a surprise. Wonderful brew, is like the grown up version of Hopslam. Great balance, look, taste and smell. Would have again anytime."
"these guys are fast becoming one of my favorite breweries in the country. they just dont miss, and so many of them are real inventive and special. this is a real solid double ipa with blood orange, and the execution is polished. it has a nice head on it, pure white, thick at the bottom of it and airy and light and even wispy at the top of it. sweet looking really, yum. i dont smell the fruit as much as i smell the hops, which i like in a double ipa right? the fruit in the flavor is there, but its quite dry, which i really am surprised by in this day and age where every strong ipa is sweet as can be, especially the fruited ones. it has tang and oil and richness and the hops are robust and perfect with the fruit in here, the proportions are ideal. pipeworks is just so far ahead of the curve right now. i am in love with everything they do at the moment, and for me, they just cant miss. so glad they are sending beer to colorado finally, and that i dont have to chase down a trade partner to have one of these. love all the way around from me, for the beer, for the brewery, for the whole thing. pour me another!"
"Look: Great head and lacing, the color is a cloudy amber to medium gold. A bit too dark to be a noteworthy 'beautiful' beer, but beauty is only skin deep."
"If you're a fan of citra hops and/or pipework's IPAS then this is a must have. This has a great IPA smell of citra hops hoppy/citrusy/fruity. The taste follows the nose with the blood orange blending nicely with the hop flavor, there is a slight sweetness to this beer. Overall this a great beer that is on par with pipework's other IPAS."
"Anxiously awaiting this one........Grapefruit, mango, just tons of citra hops hit on first sip, I got more of the blood orange taste at the end, with a slight bitterness. Moderate tanginess, that is perfect for this beer. Pipeworks gets another gold star for the Crimson Snapper! Bring on Scarlett Beta next........"
This is the best IIPA I have ever had. Mindblowing shit.
A: hazy deep orange to amber. Thin off white head. 
"Look - deep orange to red with fine 1"" head that quickly laced the glass"
Pipeworks Brewing Crimson Snapper
"L: Dark orange, hazy. Small off-white head sticks around."
"Awesome experience. Great tasting beer that the adjuncts come through very well, the honey and oranges compliment this great IPA. Lucky to have another bottle, looking forward. This puts Pipeworks brewing on my radar."
Poured from a bomber into my Hopslam glass
"650ml bottle, batch 733-736, poured into an oversized Hill Farmstead wine glass. "
"Honey sweetness, blood orange pucker, and the citra awesomeness make for an overall pleasant punch in the kisser. If you like hopslam, citra ninja, or grapefruit sculpin, you're swimming toward the right beer bucket with dis guy."
POurs a orange malty color with a frothy head. Smell the orange and honey addition as it has a sweetness to the nose. Can definitely taste the honey and the blood orange which makes it sweet and not that hoppy of a DIPA
"Maybe I'm just not into IPAs with fruit juice added? I didn't really like grapefruit sculpin either. Nice juicy taste, but I don't get that amazing hop smell that really makes an IPA for me."
"This has become my favorite DIPA of all time. It has everything in my opinion. The fruitiness is there from the Blood Orange and the Citra Hops, sweetness from honey is there, and yet the hops is not masked. I had to stock up on these but no matter how many I acquire will not be nearly enough."
"22 oz. bottle, Batch #733 - 736. The elusive Pipeworks Crimson Snapper, in my hands at last, an ""Imperial India Pale Ale brewed with honey and blood orange juice and citra hops""."
"Blood orange, tropical, juicy, mango, pineapple, honey, light bitterness"
22oz bomber poured into a snifter. Batch number 733-736. 
"Hazy burnt orange. Has the classic citra aroma of tropical fruit: mandarin, pineapple. Taste is similar but there's a lot a sweetness within the tropical fruit. You can really taste the honey, and perhaps the sugars in the blood orange. Yet that doesn't manage to mask to alcohol burn, which is why I marked this down in taste and feel from most of my Pipeworks DIPA ratings. Beautiful, aromatic, but a bit of a mix-up on the palate."
"I really can't find anything wrong with this amazing pdubs offering. So happy it is back! Blood orange isn't over powering, smooth, fantastic beer. What else can I say!!??!! Get this and drink it now!"
I love the tropical fruit / citrus / juice influence. One of the better ones I've had from PW and they make some good ones!
"Pours a hazey burnt orange. Thick one inch head with great lacing throughout. Smells of citrus hoppiness, grapefruit, orange, and sweet tropical fruits. Taste is a refined blood orange, medium hop bitterness throughout, light honey sweetness, grapefruit notes, and orange rind finish which blends with a pleasant bitterness that clings to the palate. Dangerously easy drinking for a 9.5% abv. A fantastic DIPA by Pipeworks!"
"Chalky flavor may be from blood oranges or a certain yeast profile that i don't like. Mutes the hops for me, not my favorite Pipeworks."
Poured from a 22oz bottle into a gandhi bot tulip
harsh malty mess. Way too sweet.
I'll be the contrarian on this one. The honey just made it too sweet for me. Citra Ninja is much more to my liking.
This is one of the best DIPAs I've had in recent memory. 
22 ounce bomber into both a snifter and a teku. Batch 617-618.
Fine but I don't get the hype.
Pours a light amber orange with a thick and sturdy head of off-white foam.
This is a pretty good beer.
"Pours light Amber in color with a frothy off white head that retains nicely. Smell has loads of floral hop aromas along with tropical fruit aromas of guava, white grape an a slightly vegital hop atoma in the finish along with plenty of semisweet caramel malt to back it up. Taste follows the nose with caramel malt vegital hops and floral honey. Tropical fruit like guava and apricot some citrus zest is detectable in the finish."
Bright golden orange with a dense white head and spotty lacing. Clear. 
"Serving: 22 oz. bomber poured into a tulip. Bottled on 1/22/14, making this just under 2 weeks old."
The honey and blood orange nicely balance out a strong hop tange
This beer had a lot going on. Honey and blood orange killed some of the killer hops i love from pipeworks.. overall still very good but not as good as I hoped
"Pours a murky orange, fully saturated color, rising streams of carbonation visible. A finger or two of foam settles quickly and leaves behind plenty of lacing in the glass, forming drippy irregular patterns. "
Batch 617-618 poured into a tulip.
"I was very excited when I heard this was coming out and read the description. I am a huge fan of blood orange in DIPAs. My favorite is More Moro. While not bad, this one fell short for me. Very little blood orange and a little bitter aftertaste versus what should be sweet. Good but not great."
"Awesome citra-centric beer from Pipeworks. It seems that ever since they hit their stride with Citra (the Ninja series) they've been getting better and better at DIPAs. They hit a home run with Square Grouper, and have now parlayed that into one after another of critically acclaimed, fly-off-the-shelves brews in the same vein."
"With the possible exception of Square Grouper, this is at the top of the Pipeworks IPA line. The honey really adds quite a bit to the overall character of the beer without making it too sweet. The citra hops work really well with the booziness. Really pretty orange color."
650ml bottle sealed with orange pipeworks pressure cap.
"Friend got this for me at the brewery. the beer pours with a bright, murky yellow appearance with a thin head. Pretty rich smell of hops, citrus from an orange smell, and some cream. Good mix of a cream based orange citrus flavor. Creamy texture for the mouthfeel. Overall, great taste and mouthfeel and a spectacular appearance."
"Traded for this beer as it was released when I was gone in November, finally getting a chance to have it tonight. Love the label but the beer inside was just as enjoyable and colorful. Smooth, lush, and just dank enough, this had so much going for it and was tough to keep in the glass for the duration of my review!"
Given to me by a friend. Decanted from a 16 oz (453 ml) can into a conical pint glass; produced 11/20/17.
"Tall can 11/20/17, so about 6 weeks in the can."
Quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. This one knocked my socks off. Poured from a can into a snifter glass. The mouthfeel and luscious texture alone is worth having this beer. Totally blown away
"pours out a gorgeous murky golden orange color with a bright white head that decorates the glass with tons of lace. this one is pretty aromatic and brings grapefruit, dankness, orange, hint of pineapple, and some green herbaceous and grassy notes ... smells super fresh and juicy! palate follows for the most part, but is really nicely complimented by this thick creamyness throughout, thank you oats and lactose. there is a nice amount of sweet bready character and juicy notes of orange creamsicle, peaches, mango, pineapple, but these aspects are well balanced by hits of pithy grapefruit, sharp herbaceous aspects, and a smack of some danky pine on the finish. mouthfeel is lush and overall this is an absolutely great offering to my taste, cheers!"
Holy honeyed space daydream batman!
"Pours a ridiculously hazy light golden color with a well retained fluffy white head that left ample lacing. Smells predominately of citrus with a hint of malt. Tastes of orange, pineapple, sweet mango, honey, sweet malts and some floral notes. Medium to full bodied, moderate carbonation, creamy mouth feel, minimal bitterness."
Served in a snifter from the tap. 
"Features Galaxy hops, oats, and a little lactose; 8.5% abv; canned 11/20/17..."
Doesn't get much better than this... One of the biggest yet still balanced beers I've had.
Another solid offering from Trillium.
CANNED ON 06/19/18.
"Tasted this alongside MBC Lunch, Four Quarters Ghost in the Sky and Gun Hill Vox Populi. The others didn't fair well in comparison. And I love all of them. Part of that was the shear ""this one goes to 11"" of Trillium's study in utter lack of restraint. Intense tropical and resin aromas backed by juicy, massive flavor. You simply cannot not stop drinking. Pacing yourself is not an option. A beer I would likely abandon my wife and children for. A small complaint though--this beer is not easy on the eyes. Sludgy gray-ish peach color, like the complexion of some consumptive poet. From now on I'll just drink it from the can."
Draft at Trillium - Canton location.
"This one pours a super cloudy bright yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"Really starting to believe that Trillium is the best beer in New England (south of Greensboro, Vermont) and this beer is a great example of why. Hardly ever brewed but world class none the less."
"L - oh man, this just looks like a doozy when pouring it. Thick and hazy. Pineapple mango juice. Oily head that quickly dissipates in classic Trillium fashion. "
Poured into a snifter glass via draft at Trillium 
Had on tap at the Garden on the Greenway
"This is up there. This is is a fruit explosion. It’s just Peaches and pineapples everywhere in the smell and taste. Actually, one of the best smelling IPAs I’ve had. I have nothing else to say, trilliums IPAs have been nearly"
"16oz can dated today, 9.4% ABV this year."
hops hops hops
Thanks for the can Kevin!
Trying to get caught up on ratings
Can thanks to Kevin
"16 oz. can. Hazy pale orange. Smells of sweet pale malt, a hint of caramel, orange hops, and a zippy back end that's a little woodsy and limey. Taste has more of that zippy hop. Woodsy, more citrus, sweet tropical fruit. A little booze. Resiny finish. Medium heavy. Very nice, but big."
A - Pours a turbid golden orange with a two finger fizzy white head. Light soapy lacing.
"Moderate pour yields a 1/2 inch off white head over a murky body with some lacing. Head dwindles fairly rapidly to a thin ring in moments. Nice nose of tropical fruit, orange, tangerine, and other sweet citrus. Superb taste follows nose with more of the same flavors as aromas, but the mouthfeel suffers from the cloud making particulate matter. (?) Overall, delicious; but still falls flat along with too many others of this ilk. Searching for a more properly carbed, crisp finish. Is that too much to ask?"
"Dank. Earthy grass, pine resin, Grapefruit pith, orange zest and tangerine. Tongue tingling, citrus rind bitterness. Cracker malt profile. Lower end of the sweetness spectrum. Medium bodied. Delicious."
"Look: hazy golden yellow, little to no head, solid lacing along the cup "
L - Murky yellow body with almost no head
"Pure OJ appearance. Just a shade darker, which doesn't gain it any less points. Head is pretty loose but leaves delicate rings. I can't knock this at all. When I pour a beer and go ""oooh"" that's an automatic 5. Bam."
Hazy yellow liquid with a white head diminishing to a circle around the glass. 
"Look: Yellow, hazy, turbid with thin 1 inch head."
The 4.5 i gave this can deserved it. The description of this beer by the brewers is just it! I wanted to rate it a tad higher but i think the 4.5 is perfect. Nothing more to say than to read the description because that's exactly what i got!
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Canton, MA"
"Thick and murky in appearance. Huge, fruity nose that lasted the entire glass. The taste matches the aroma and did not disappoint in the least. No need to belabor the point...this is a near perfect beer and I enjoyed as much as any IPA I have ever encountered."
"Pours a turbid pale straw in color with a finger of dense white head. I love the aroma. Peach, candied pineapple, lime, citrus pith, something that seems close to white grape, and a bit of piney dankness. Tatse hits the same notes as the aroma but adds a touch of bitterness, alcohol, and maybe some yeast astringency but all these notes are restrained and help balance out the predominantly juicy character. Medium+ body with moderate carbonation. I love this beer, this experience reminds me strongly of why I fell in love with Trillium. It's big, intensely flavored, and has a delicious raw hoppyness that I love. I tend to prefer my beers super fresh but I'm curious to see how this one evolves over the next few weeks."
16 oz. can dated 29-Jun-17
"My first trip to Trillium to pick up a flat for a week-long family vacation on the Cape happened to coincide with the release of Big Bird, so I figured I should pick some up along with more traditional Trillium staples. Poured one tonight (less than a day after canning, at least according to the stamp on the can), and had two high-level reactions: (1) Love the spectrum of fruit aromas and flavors they worked into this beer. (2) Think Big Bird will benefit from a week or two of mellowing, as the extremely fresh product is quite green and astringent."
can poured into a teku glass
"Pours bright yellow in color, hazy, with 1/3 inch head. Taste is lemon meringue, mango, and pine with peppery burn on the aftertaste. Medium-heavy bodied, sweet with light bitterness, moderate carbonation. Interesting, restrained, and complex at the same time. In the upper third of beers I have had from Trillium but not yet in the top ten."
"Can purchased at the brewery today to spiegelglau snifter. Pours cloudy, dark yellow,almost brown. Not allot of head despite a semi aggressive pour. Smells of bread, melon, mango."
"Cloudy orange with thin white head that leaves sheets of lacing. Creamy orange and slight peach in the nose. Continues to the taste, coupled with moderate bitterness and a nice herbal character. Medium bodied with a classic soft feel. Very nice."
"Smell: Really citrus forward. Juicy orange, like orange juice, lemon, lime, tangerine. It has a lot zestiness. Lime and lemon zest. There’s a really mellow tropical fruit presence, predominantly mango. Underneath that there is a really light yeasty bubblegum quality. There isn’t really any malt presence to speak off."
"Pretty opaque but quite hazey, light yellow-gold. Aroma has softer tropical notes - some melon rind and stone fruit - with some alpha hops. Probably the most hop-forward of the BG beers I have had, it teeters on being a little too bitter especially on the back palate but it is still quite good. I definitely got a lot of melon / cantaloupe vibes and in general more earthy fruit than big bursts of tropical flavors, the mosaic brings some grassyness to it as well."
"Big aromas of citrus, pineapple, tropical, finishes nice and dry. Creamy, full mouth feel. Another incredible beer made by Brew Gentlemen. All of these IPAs and Double IPAs look unbelievable. They are glowing yellow orange like a big fresh glass pineapple/ orange juice. No hop bitterness whatsoever."
Pillowy soft mouthfeel. Bold citrus flavors with enough sweetness and only slight bitterness. Juicy and well rounded. Easy to drink for a DIPA. Tangerine and grapefruit.
"Fresh batch just tapped today, 750ml swingtop poured into a Brew Gentlemen tulip glass:"
"L: Beautifully crafted honeycomb, yams, and marmalade hazy hues with a 3cm white head and lacing for days"
Poured from a growler; a hazy golden color with a loosely bubbled head and lace. 
"Ridiculously hazey, almost looks like fruit juice not beer, but possibly the best smelling and tasting DIPA I've had. Mouthfeel takes a bit of a hit due to being so unfiltered. Wow!!! Well done BG!"
"Super rad beer here, my favorite dipa of 2015 and I've tried alot! Juicy and stanky like a fresh fruit or Calis finest! Cloudy ipas for days at BG and I dig it! Keep the hops poppin gents!"
"Another juicy DIPA from Brew gentlemen. Pours hazy, orange color and good carb. The nose is all tropical/citrus fruits. Tastes is similar to the nose without much bitterness. Just on the back end do you realize it is DIPA from the minimal alcohol burn. It's easy going down and definitely makes you want to grab more when your glass is empty. The body is great for a DIPA. If this was in a can I think a lot more people would be talking about it."
Straight up pineapple juice a la Trillium but with less bitterness and more sweet fruit juice like you might expect from Tree House. Really world class and if these guys keep this up they'll be talked about alongside those Nee England hops.
NE style DIPA that is a juice bomb. The nose and taste are just what you would expect with the aura this beer displays. Excellent mouthfeel and mild bitterness is subdued by gobs of juice and pungent aroma. Amazing beer.
"Poured a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Aroma was huge tropucal fruit, citrus and resin. Flavor similar, body is extremely soft, very juicy, minimal bitterness, and frighteningly crushable for its strength."
"Pours like a glass of pulpy grapefruit juice (yellow). It smells juicy. It tastes sweet like tropical fruit followed by a citrus fruit flavor. It leaves a bitter happiness in the aftertaste. The body is heavy, which is the best part. Overall, it is a tasty strong dipa with lots of fruit hops and a great body."
"There is not a better beer in this fruity / tropical double IPA category. TheBrewGentlemen have something truly special here, and it puts brews to the likes of Julius to shame. Seek out and try this immediately!"
"I don't know why The Brew Gentlemen originally created this beer as a weizenbock but the migration to a double IPA seems like a good move to me. This beer was markedly different than all the other styles from this brewery that I've tried. Alcohol notes finally made an appearance, and the malts left a more tactile sensation on my palate and my lips. "
The beer comes in a golden hazy orange. Extremely hazy.
Growler - Tulip Glass
"I feel like when I try this style, I know pretty much anything I need to off the nose. And judging from this one, I believe I will be happy. There is the bubble gum thing with cloves and the touch of bananas with the yeasty goodness. Flavor certainly follows suit in much regard. Not as boisterous as an American ticker might hope for, but it's good. This is a style rarely seen and even more rarely well executed. Yet another good one from the BG."
22 oz bomber fresh
I've been to the brewery and it's good there but I've also experienced barrel-aged at beer festivals -- and that is to die for. Stuff is so rich it leaves a slick on the glass. Amazing all-around
Picked up a bomber at Binny's in downtown Chicago on 5-11-18 for $11.99. Bottled on 4-13-18. Stored in the beer fridge upon our return to PHX.
"L- Has much the same look as the golden beers. Slightly cloudy, but transparent towards the edges. Beautiful to look at, especially with a perfect pour."
A-Pours a very nice light amber color with a generous head and lacing
From tasting notes 10/14/17
"Pours dark honey color. Nose reminds me of a barley wine, malty and bitter hop notes. Taste is bitter, citrus, stong malt notes. Mouthfeel is medium, foamy. Tasty beer, thanks @ovaltine!"
"Copper colored with an inch of frothy and creamy beige on top. The aroma is a blend of gentle, piney hops and light crackery malt. I'm tasting plenty of orange rind and tangerine with intense bitterness. There's some light crackery malt to keep things from getting out of hand. The mouth is resinous and dry."
Poured from 22oz (650ml) bottle into glass. Bottle on date is '4-11-17'.
Poured from 22oz bottle into Chimay goblet.
"From @FFFjunkie's BIF box. Poured from 22 oz. bottle into 3 Floyd's pint glass. It pours a cloudy, medium amber color with orange hues, and an enormous, foamy, ecru-colored head and tons of lacing that persisted through the pour. It's really attractive. The nose is malt-forward with subdued tangerine, pineapple, resinous pine, and floral hops. This is delicious! The first thing I taste is fairly sweet malt followed by tart grapefruit and lemon. There follows sweeter fruit: tangerine and pineapple. As if that's not enough the finish is a battle between creamy caramel and fairly biting hops. The overall taste is complex and pleasing; the flavors all blend really nicely. The mouth feel is pleasantly creamy with moderate carbonation and with its 9.5% ABV and 100 IBU, it's not for the faint of hearted. Overall, this DIPA has it all: it's attractive bold, complex flavors, and a pleasing mouth feel. I'm enjoying it immensely!"
Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with two fingers white head. 
Tasted from bottle. Pours a cloudy gold with thick white head. Tons of lacing. Big time aroma of citrus hops and some pine notes. Taste definitely follows the nose. Citrus flavors of mango and grapefruit with some piney floral notes. Very well balanced double IPA. Excellent sweet malt backbone. A nice clean bitterness throughout without the bite at the end. Hides the high ABV very well. Very smooth medium bodied IPA. One of the best for sure.
Illegible bottle date. 
"Pours slightly hazy honey orange with thin ivory head. The aroma is tropical fruits and pine. The flavor follows the nose, but I also get caramel malts and alcohol. A very thick feel for an IPA and overall a wonderful beer that I wish was available here in Minnesota. Thanks Tom for bringing this over."
"I poured half of this into a tulip and about the other half into a snifter. The appearance was a nice looking hazy to almost transparent looking golden orange to brown with a decent looking sediment rolling around and within the carbonation. The head is fairly a white to an off-white sort of fluffiness filling the top of the glass evenly and ends up leaving a decent sort of white foamy lacing all around the glass. The smell was an authentic sort of citrus hops to somewhat a nice caramel maltiness that doesn’t leave anything to be desired. It does what it needs to do. The taste was a pure bittersweet and does what it should to please the tastebuds in a very nice showing of citrus to caramel-ness coating them. There is a slight aftertaste of bittersweetness, but isn’t overbearing. There is a quick dry finish. On the palate, she sits about a medium with a sipper sort of sessionability to it. The carbonation is quite fulfilling and nice. Overall, I say this was a great DIPA, well worthy of having again."
Pours a beautiful clear amber. Some slight lacing. Aroma is blueberry and slight pine. Taste is DANK as sh!+. Big blueberry taste with nice pine resin. Mouthfeel is warm but sticky. Great classic DIPA from 3 Floyds!
Appearance - Pours semi transparent golden color with thick sticky white head. Excellent lacing.
Mostly clear orange color with three fingers of off-white head that leave heavy lacing.
bottled dated 4/11/17
Bomber poured into a teku glass
"Wow, Dreadnaught from Three Floyds, is an extremely good Imperial IPA (ABV 9.50%, IBU 100). I got it via a beer trade I can see on the price tag left on that the guy who bought it paid 12 bucks (or $11.99). Why do all prices end with 99 in the US? Anyway, if I had paid for it I certainly would have thought it was well worth the money."
"Poured from a bomber into a Teku glass. Huge citrus and mango aroma right from the bottle on the pour. A hazy orange color with a one-finger white head. Aroma in the glass has the fruit, and also malt - caramel and some toffee. Bitter orange marmalade flavor, mixed with tropical fruit. The malt is prominent with bread and a bit of caramel. Clean and dry on the finish."
A 22 oz bomber (no date) poured into a TH tulip. 
"L - pours a striking copper bronze. Reminds me of the last little bit of a summer evening sunset. Rich, boisterous head packed full of fluff and foam. White on top, tan on the bottom. "
It's ok. 
"Bottle poured into pint glass; nice carbonation with modest head. Hops, grapefruit and malts to nose. Great peppery, resinous piney taste with hint of orange and other fruits. Medium body, well balanced. Peppery hops linger nicely on the palate."
"This has been a long standing favorite. It is really nice to have after drinking NE style for a while. It soothes the palate with toasted caramel and sweet cream after a nose and front end of intense pepper, vanilla and pine and overall hoppiness. Some may not like the heavy malt back end. But give it a chance. It is highly complex and pretty good by a fire right now. The malty sweetness is balanced by the creamy mouth feel."
My brother turned me on to this....Thanks Bro' ! It was nice and hoppy with citrus and piney notes while blended in with a mildly balance of malty flavor. I like it better than 3FFF's Zombie Dust.
"Translucent amber color. Aroma is hop candy, candied oranges, ripe grapefruit flesh with brown sugar on top, malt, and pine resin. Taste is orange, Apple, and honey on the front of the tongue. As it crosses the mid palate I get darker fruits like dates and dark cherries. The finish is orange peel and pine resin with hop bitterness. Also salt and pepper as it warms. This is a sweet, sticky beer that lingers on the palate, but the carbonation and light mouth feel keep it in check. It's going to be too sweet for some people, but I appreciate the extra flavors the malt brings out. Also quite drinkable for 10.5%."
"First had 6/5/15 at Three Floyds brewpub. The hop taste and aroma remind me of Victory Hop Ranch, which is my least favorite IPA. Although this beer isn't nearly as bad, they share characteristics that I just can't get behind. This was my least favorite beer on my trip to the brewery."
Poured into a Duvel tulip. Sticker says 11/01/16.
12 Oz pour on tap into tulip
"Got this from my buddy Mike. Great IPA. Solid hops and smooth taste before and after. No bite at all. Citrusy taste, nice floral smell coming through as well."
22 oz bomber poured into pint glass. Brought at the brewery and flew home with it. 
My buddy gave me this for the first time in a bomber after one glass I was hooked. Outstanding Taste just wish it was available all the time.
"You want an orange pour ipa? Here it is. Sexy tangerine color, 1/2"" off white head. Good aromatics, leans citrus and you can pull some sweet caramel malt contribution."
Dark golden color poured from a bomber into a snifter. Also had this recently at FFF.
"A - pretty average imperial ipa look, clear golden Amber appearance with a white head that dissipates due to the alcohol but leaves a nice lacing"
Pours clear and crisp - copper colored and effervescent. Thick foamy head slowly dissipated leaving a thin white film and tons of sticky lacing. 
"Clear orange gold appearance 2 finger head. Pretty! Aroma- sticky citrus fruit juice. Peach, orange, grapefruit. Even some white grapes. Taste- a spicy hop. an arugula, kind of green bitterness. Some orange, bit of lemon. Mouthfeel, slick, creamy. Overall, alcohol apparent in the taste and aroma. This packs a punch. Pretty well balanced. A good beer. Not my favorite from a FFF DIPA, though. Permanent funeral is a little more my style. This is a shade more bitter than I prefer."
"Two week old bottle. Nice golden color. Not a ton on the nose, not as hoppy as I expected. Taste is very hop resinous forward. Pretty thick for an IPA or even IIPA, definitely has that imperial body. Very enjoyable."
from the brewery
"22 oz bottle poured into a tulip. Approximately a week old at tasting. A solid, crisp DIPA which tasted lighter than 9.5% alcohol but had didn't pick up much citrus, more of an overly sweet hop-bomb."
22 Oz bottle was poured into a snifter.
Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Bottle date was rubbed off but it was 5/11/16 if I remember correctly.
"On tap at CBC 2016. Pale golden pour with a white head. Citrus, tropical fruit and honey, perfectly balanced. Smooth mouthfeel. An excellent double IPA, would love to be able to drink this regularly."
Just had my first this past weekend. 3 Floyds is hard to get. The first sip was really smooth and invited a second sip. Wonderful taste and easy to drink every though 100 IBUs. Nice citrus notes and loved the velvet feel in the mouth. Looking to find another bottle.
L: light amber color with a nice 1-2inch head
"Pours a deep amber orange color with some slight haze. Has a nice, 2-finger off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice crown around the top of the beer."
Bottled on 4/1/16. Poured into a teku glass.
"Popped open a 22-oz bottle my parents brought back from 3F last month. Bottled on date of 4/1/16. Pours a dark yellow with some brown tint indicative of the caramel malt used. Smells almost equally of bready, almost chewy, malts with a resin like, piney, citrus hop character. Smells clean with no off flavors or hot alcohols. Leaves some nice lacing on the glass sides. Tastes malty sweet but is nicely balanced with ample bitterness and the hop character as described in the nose. Feels medium bodied. Clean & crisp with that bitter bite at the end. Some waning alcohols in the back of the throat. "
"Pours a dark, hazy, amber/orange. Great citrus aroma and flavor, with a HUGE malty after taste that actually kills the hop flavor. Too malty for my taste but still a great tasting Imperial. If you love malt bombs, you will love this."
"This poured a pretty dark cloudy amber orange. Malt and citrus in both smell and taste. For lack of a better word ""malt bomb"". Alcohol isn't that noticeable. Mouthfeel is slightly thick with medium carbonation. Overall, an okay DIPA. I was pretty underwhelmed and disappointed by this one. It tastes like a 9.5% Alpha King. The best thing it has for it is the relatively unnoticeable alcohol. It made for a pretty easy drinking beer, just not a very good one."
"Bottled 4/1/16. Excellent, balanced DIPA. Slightly hazy, amber color. Great mouthfeel--not too thick. Citrus and pineapple smells are reflected in the taste. Nice!"
Another great brew from 3 Floyds!
"Bomber. Pours deep golden orange with a slight haze, three finger white head fades slowly leaving gobs of lacing. Toasted malt aroma with tropical fruit notes. Taste starts off with some malty sweetness and big tropical fruit which is met mid sip by citrus peel and floral hops. Some nice spicy peppery earthiness in a very dry finish. Medium silky soft mouthfeel. It had been awhile since I'd had this one, wow just as great as I remember, so balanced and delish."
Poured from bomber bottled on 2-1-16 into snifter. 
Pretty sure this was an old bottle - date code rubbed off. Need to try a fresh one
"Pours a huge head, super airy and frothy with a highly cratered surface, tannish color with a light orange tint, the lacing forms very long streaks that stick powerfully. The liquid is a mildly hazy dark orange color which is full to the rims, minimal visible bubbles. The nose is stuffed with sweet citrus — tangerine, orange, pink grapefruit and then loads of cocoa, malted milk balls, toffee and scone, bitter tea leaf, tar, the pineapple, guava, nectarine fruit scents are think without becoming monotonous. In the mouth it’s full-bodied, heavy enough that the creaminess doesn’t smooth out the mouth feel. Spicy with peppercorn and pine notes, here that muscular grapefruit, tangerine citrus sweetness acts as a calming agent. The florality itself seems mostly citrus blossom. Some cocoa and sweet grains to breakfast breads type of appeal. Not very herbaceous nor grassy at all. The carbonation lends a consistent fine prickle. Ends with full flavor vibrancy and a gentle landing."
Poured from bottle into becker. Cloudy reddish amber pour with little aroma. Medium low head. Strong bitter hops consistency with pine sap and papaya flavors. Overall pretty good beer.
Large fluffy white head atop a vibrant amber orange.
"This was way more malt heavy than expecting. Definitely boozy. Good citrus, pineapple, and mango flavor. Sweet malt aroma as well. The flavor was really sweet and a weird mouthfeel with the sweet flavor but bitter finish. It's juicy as well, I would like a little drier with the bitterness"
"So far, I've been lucky enough to score a few Three Floyds beers from traders, and been slightly-underwhelmed by two of them. This third one, if nothing else, is certainly the most interesting of the group, though I'm sad I let it get away from me and it's been sitting in the cellar maybe a month or so longer than it should have. "
Bomber bottle 11/5/15
L - pours minimal white head with an amber hue
"0,3L pour in a tulip on tap. Couldn't take notes at the time, so this one's from memory of an hour ago. Beautiful honey-orange color, with a hop-forward nose with hints of citrus and sugar. Palate is balanced - dry hops, some citrus, pine, and malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is substantial. Overall, this beer didn't blow me away. It has a lot of hype to live up to, so perhaps that's not ultimately surprising. This is, undeniably, an excellent DIPA, but among the best of the best? I'm not sure I'd go that far."
"I am going to echo the reviewer below me and start by saying ""wow."" This is a truly amazing IPA, maybe the best I have tried so far. It's definitely hoppy, but the happiness is not dominating. Rather the citrus and other fruit flavors come through loud and clear. It's almost like a sweeter version of Pliny. Just an absolutely fantastic beer"
Wow. This is good. The only real gripe I have is the smell seems a bit dominated by alcohol. The taste is pure bliss tho. Citrus and tropical fruits and a caramely sweetness is like a IPA version of a fruit cake. Did NOT disappoint.
I was fortunate to try Zombie Dust and Dreadnaught on the same day and neither dissapointed. Dreadnaught turns out to be my favorite Three Floyds Beer. One of my favorite Big IPAs out there. Wow. I'm impressed.
A very good imperial IPA. Balanced dank and bitter.
Pours a rather tumultuous and hazy light orange with a single finger white head that quickly dissipates leaving some spotty lacing. 
"Starts with a strongly hop sided but malty blast , then the hops win for few seconds and the balance changes so slightly. The taste lingers and rich earthy flavored notes come out."
Pours a nice golden / light Amber color. Has a citrusy sweet aroma. Flavor is citrus with a touch of pine. The finish is a balanced malt that is slightly sweet. A great IPA overall and very easy to drinK
"Bottled on August 3, 2015 and picked up at Whole Foods Gold Coast. Had been wanting to try this one for a long time. Huge citrus flavor and tremendously soft mouthfeel. Excellent."
"Wow this is probably my favorite 3 Floyds offering, which is saying a lot. Everything they make is delicious, but this one really hit home for me. TONS of hoppy fruity notes on the nose with perfect mouthfeel and great balance. I expected it to be really bitter, but it had the perfect amount of tongue bite with a little backend sweetness."
Poured into a tulip glass.
"Not as good as Permanent Funeral or Zombie Dust, but fairly close. Honestly, Dreadnaught is a little bit unbalanced leaning towards the bitter side of an IPA that I am personally not a fan of. To each his own. The fresher the better"
Bottled 8-3-15
Serious hops and strong malt flavor the aftertaste lasts two days
"Yields an amber, sunny clear color, with a solid, fluffy white head."
Pour: light amber with a two finger head that quickly dissapated and left a nice white lace on the glass
"oured cold into a tulip glass. Bottled on 8/3/15, 9 days old."
Solid pale ale. A bit boozy but great flavor. Sweet aftertaste. All three Floyds should be proud.
"One of my favorite big IPAs. A clear, orange-gold color. Big citrus aroma. Similar big citrus flavor as well as a little malty sweetness to provide a nice balance. Extremely smooth and clean."
"I will always try any limited or unusual 3 Floyds IPA I can find, and this one is a perfect example of why. Fruity, fresh tasting, and surprisingly light-feeling for its ABV, Dreadnaught is a world-class DIPA."
"Had about a 5 oz pour of this one, so based on that, the look is opaque orange, great citrus hop smell, full-bodied with a taste that is typical 3 Floyds amazing."
"Nice IPA, but the trademark FFF citrus was not as prevalent as I would have expected or hoped."
A - Pours a almost clear golden orange with 2 fingers of head.
"Original was on tap at Gallo's Tap Room. Edit was from bomber dated October 5, 2015 enjoyed October 27, 2015 in a Hoof Hearted Teku. "
Orange tones and strong malt presence make this beer way too easy to drink! Does not feel like 9.5%. Very refreshing and quaffable.
"A little malty for my taste, but still a solid beer."
I had this beer on tap at a Chicago bar and three days later had a bomber that I brought back to Florida. The beer that I had on tap was delicious. You can tell how fresh it was with a strong hoppy smell and taste with the perfect malt backbone. Tasted orange and other tropical fruit and it was highly drinkable going down very smoothly for a DIPA. The bottle was different. Gone were the strong hoppy smells and flavor but the beer was still good with a bubble gum sweetness rather than the orange and tropical flavors. The bottle version may not have been as fresh and I definitely favor draught. My ratings represent the draught beer. If I were to rate the bottle the ratings would be a half of point lower for taste and overall.
I really did not like this beer at all. It found it new home in the drain. It tasted like burnt band-aids.
"Really piny and rind-y. Almost spicy, like an amped up version of Alpha King. Love it."
Had on tap.
Fresh keg on @beergasm PDX
"Bomber into a snifter. Pours a light, hazy amber with a big, billowy 1.5 finger head of foam. Dense lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smell isn't overwhelming, but I got pine, citrus, spice, grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Light weight, and very creamy, fluffy mouthfeel. Very easy drinking for 9.5%. Pine and hops up front with notes of grapefruit and orange midways. Has a sweet, crisp finish with a tiny bit of malt noted. Piney/citrus aftertaste. "
Hyped beer. There are equally better DIPA out there
One of my favorite FFF offerings! Lots of crisp citrus here! Wish it were a more regular offering!
A: clear golden amber. Thin head
"For me the alcohol taste was too present. I love good DIPA where you can taste the hops, malt, and bitter finish but compared to many of the great ones I have had his one had too much alcohol flavor compared to those other characters. Great brew still but not quite up there with some of the other truly world class ipa"
"To me just an okay beer, Permanent Funeral is a much better beer, just an okay IPA."
On tap at FFF poured into nonic pint. Peach and pine aroma with a hint of vanilla. Good hoppy finish. Very good!
Special thanks to ARex and his wife for snagging this delicious treat. 
Taste improves as it warms up. Had on tap at 3 Floyds and recently enjoyed a bottle. Perfect beer on tap. Wish I'd let it warm up more before starting the one out of a bottle
My favorite beer ever! Enjoyed everything about it. It's what a ipa is supposed to be.
Picked something nice for the 1900th. Did not dissapoint!!!
This beer is the G.O.A.T
Top notch from the boys of Floyds.
Highly rated 3-F's DIPA which I really have enjoyed in the past and just tried a fresh one giving it a review today.
way to hop forward for my taste but very drinkable for the hop heads out there. from a bomber to a pint glass.
Poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass
Probably my favorite FFF beer.
Fresh bomber in a pub glass.
"Orangey amber. Little booze, burnt pineapple, a little creme fresh, coconut, definitely ripe mango. Intense mango, long finish, heavy bitter"
"Look: Hazy gold, nearly orange with a small pure white head"
A great and powerful IPA.
"My notes below are truncated; I'm having this beer as part of my annual Christmas tasting. Reviewed live at high altitude in Castle Rock, CO."
"Format: 22oz Bottle, poured in pint glass. Decent, but small head."
love this beer... had 2 on draft from the 12/5 kegging... awesome stuff
"Thought this was pretty good for this style of beer. For a non-stout it was a heavy ale, which I liked."
22oz bomber - super fresh (bottled 10 days ago)
"22 oz. bottle purchased at the brewery, unknown brewing/packaging date, poured into my FFF Teku glass, drank over 30-45 minutes"
"Rich and thick mouthfeel, drinks like a port wine. Carmel, marmalade, and almost a burnt toast flavor. Interesting and complex, but not something I would finish a bottle alone. Good beer to end the night on."
Undreadful
"Citrus atoma, Golden color, nice head, sweet and multibody with the tank he hop you taste. Very smooth. Yum."
really balanced and piney. love it.
"I dont often drink the doubles, but when I do, it's this one. Outstanding."
"APpearance wise the beer is flawless, beer is a clear gold with 3 fingers of off white, frothy head that retains well, thanks in part to a steady stream of small bubbles consistently rising to the surface of the beer reinforcing the enormous head. Aroma is off the hook, tons of fruit and floral hops. Taste is like a mild version of the aroma, but with a nice dose of malt in the background, texture is very juicy and creamy on the finish."
This beer is life changing
Look: Crystal clear caramel with a thick white head. Nice sticky lacing. 
"Poured a deep gold, slightly cloudy, with about two fingers of creamy white head, which lingered quite a while and left nice lacing. Aroma is a nice, big nose of hops; noted the peach. Taste is a nice blend of the malt sweetness and hops, again with notes of peach. Moderately carbonated, but too much so. A nice, full, mouth feel and a good drink for its big ABV."
Poured from a bomber into a willibecher. This was bottled 8/27/14. Review #250 for me.
A: Pours with a light white frothy head that dies back very slowly. Sheets of lacing coat the sides of the glass and last and last. The beer has a pleasing rich amber color that is slightly hazy. 
"Had this twice at bottle shares, both a month or so old. I think it is a very balanced beer, little heavy on the malt, but the hops balance it out well"
great dipa. citrus and well balanced. strong but worth it
"As you pour you can smell the bready malt and fruity, citrusy hops. It pours hazy amber with a 1” finely bubbled foam cap. This medium full bodied beer exhibits very fine soft carbonation that produces an exceptional creaminess that leaves thick lace. The surprisingly smooth palate starts with a creamy malty sweetness and then some yeast driven light fruits play with the tropical citrusy hop fruits and then the flavors dissolve into a prolonged citrus rind grapefruit bitterness that lingers. The brewer achieves a perfect balance between the big alcohol and the layers of malt and hop flavors."
From notes on 1/17/14
Great DIPA!
My favorite Three Floyd's offering
A tad too much malt. Too little hop content.
"Great flavor, a bit of pine. I like a creamy feel to IPAs to balance the hops. dreadnought could use a bit more"
Nice mixture of hops make this nice and fruity but with a good malt backbone
Poured from 2-oz bottle into a pint glass.
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Many thanks, Darren!"
WOOOO! Just had this right after Alpha King. I was skeptical that this would beat it but I was wrong! This is a DIPA to end all DIPA's!
Poured from bottle into wine glass.
Pours a medium-dark gold/orange colour with a nice fluffy head and lots of legging.
"A - Big copper body, with haziness, and a big fat head that slowly bubbles into a thin layer up top. Massive lacing paints the glass drink by drink."
"A - Fine, white, sticky head. Clingy and leggy. The body is deep golden/orange. "
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Appearance is a nice rich Longhorn orange with a creamy head that laced the glass...very tasty appearance. I was highly impressed by this beer's aroma...it was your typical piney-tropical profile but the medley here: mango & papaya & fresh pine really sang. The taste & mouthfeel weren't quite as immaculate as the smell but still lived up to the FFF standards one would expect. The peachy papaya flavor worked with the hoppy body, and the smoothness made the bomber an easy pleasant drinker."
"A respectable IPA. However, as with other Three Floyds beers on this board, it is highly overrated. I suspect that because it is only available in a limited area with little real competition, local reviewers simply have little to compare Three Floyds beers with."
"A-Amber color, dark orange."
"Bomber bottled mid-May 2014, poured into a teku"
A - Amber in color with a light head and nice lacing
My experience with dreadnaught was from a bomber. It was pretty tasty. I am just getting into Double IPA's as well as a few different types of beers. 
"This pours a hazy, dark amber color with a slight head. The aroma is mild with hops and hibiscus. The taste is surprisingly sweet and floral for an IIPA, but the real bitterness comes in the finish. Extremely well-balanced and tasty making it very easy to see why it’s rated what it is."
"Served on tap at Spinoza's in Beavercreek, Ohio. The appearance is unremarkable, but with a solid head and fairly sticky lacing. The smell is tropical fruit--not as pronounced and appealing as, say, White Rajah, but still quite good. The taste consists of mango, orange, and lemon flavors, and the bitterness from the hops just isn't here--imagine, a DIPA without bitterness--instead is sweetness from the citrus hops. The mouthfeel is unusual, but not bad at all--this beer is on the thin side (it could pass for a session beer if not for the high ABV) and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a DIPA well worth trying."
"Great beer! There is a serious complexity to this beer. While it has the hop forward properties of any other DIPA's its smooth, and without a lingering bitter finish. There is a bitterness to it, but there is a malt complexity that changes the finish to make it smooth with a hint of sweetness. This beverage got better with every sip."
absolutely spoiled this weekend. another new brew to try. what is 'dreadnaught'? wasn't that an evil villain in Super Mario Galaxy??
"Right as you pour this bad boy into the Deschutes imperial pint, it glows a gorgeous, yet enigmatic golden orange hue like Mike Hammer opening a mysterious box in ""Kiss Me Deadly."""
"Legendary...period! this brew stands with the top dogs in a crowded field. This brew is crisp with a pine and citrus aroma. The mouthfeel is perfect, they nailed it! the taste is flat out amazing! I would seek this out, store this and absolutely buy this again. Bravo Three Floyds, bravo!"
"A-Ah, Dreadnaught! One of my first, seemingly unattainable beer desires. It's pours a copper color. My gentle pour yields a creamy, off-white head that isn't very tall. Consistent lacing rings."
Bottle poured into an IPA glass
"A: Pours a copper color with a one finger head and good retention, blotchy lacing."
"This defines the style, or what the style could be. Light bubbles. Upfront pineapple and mango pine florals balanced with caramelized citrus and butterscotch. Larger body than expected. Creamy and chewy. First rate. Almost a perfect 5, but maybe I haven't had a fiver yet?"
"Poured from a bomber into my Deschutes tulip, no bottle date..."
A - Beautiful clear dark amber beer that pours with a 1 and a half finger head that dissipates rather quickly. Almost as pretty as Pliny the Elder but lacking the continual bubbly carbonation.
A - I poured this into a tulip and it had slight head that lasted about a minute. The color is dark orange kind of brown color. Slight haze
"It was nice to drink this after recently having Permanent Funeral. These are totally different DIPAs. PF is is a huge and hop forward, while Dread has a much stiffer malt backbone and is built on integrating and balancing the bitter and the sweet. Both styles have their merits, but I'd prob give the nod to the sticky, tropical flavors of PF. Make no mistake, this is an expertly crafted brew."
Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass
22oz Bomber picked up several days ago 
Three Floyd's Dreadnaught
Poured into a tulip
Poured out of a Bomber bottle into a Tulip glass.
Poured from a 22oz bottle.
Pours a slightly hazy orange yellow with a solid finger of foam.
"Oh sweet Dreadnaught. One of my all time favorites. One of the best Double IPA's out there. The hops on this beer is amazing, especially with all the alcohol in it. They seem to be the only ones to be able to do that so well. Lots of citrus on this beer. Again you should be careful because the alcohol is high and it is easy to drink. Good mouthfeel, strong nose of citrus styled hops, the taste is really outstanding. It also is a pretty sexy color for an IPA."
The beer comes in a slightly hazy golden orange with a one finger white head.
"Pretty good. Smells nice and tropical with some musty hop undertones. there is a sharp candy sweetness to the nose. on the tongue this is not all that well balanced. the malt makes a meek appearance but the hops make this quite bitter. having said that, there isnt as much hop flavor as i would have expected. feels a little undercarbonated. this is a little bit of a letdown, but still pleasant to drink."
"As with all 3 Floyds I was expecting big things. It had a nice slow pour into a lovely dark gold with a nice 1&1/2"" finger head and memorable lacing. This is a beautiful brew to swirl and look at."
No bottling date that I can find.
Poured from a bomber into a pint glass
Poured into a pint glass out of a 22oz bomber. 
A - Hazy deep orange with a thin white head. Good amount of lacing.
Poured into a chalice.
From bottle into pint glass.
22oz bomber picked up last week at the brewery. 
"I am sitting here in disbelief that I am drinking a beer from the famed 3 floyds...my very FIRST offering from the beer gods of Indiana, sooo excited! "
"Thanks to Rainblows for hooking me up with this one, something that I've wanted for the longest time but somehow haven't acquired until now. Relatively fresh bottle, Dreadnaught pours out a murky amber and copper-ish color, so muddled and cloudy that it blocks nearly all light trying to pass through. The foamy eggshell shaded head perches softly and leaves behind some nice lace."
22oz bottle poured into a tulip.
Poured into 22oz snifter; translucent orange/gold with a lovely fluffy slightly yellowish-white head that fades slowly leaving tons of small lacing. 
"On tap at the brewpub. What a kick ass place. So much good beer and food, totally worth the trip to Munster!"

Bomber in a stemmed tulip glass.
"Dreadnaught is clear, a bright medium orange that when held up to light shines...medium orange. On top sits a big, creamy, very light tan head (ecru?). On the glass, there's a creamy ring where it settles and some leggy patching. "
Served in a tasting glass the Firestone Walker Beer Fest. From notes. Reviewed 1 June 2013.
"If I could give this beer a 10 on smell I would. Wonderful citrus overtones to an extremely hoppy berverage. Three Floyds generally doesn't disappoint, but I would wager Dreadnaught might be their best beer. Among the finest IPA's I've ever had. Hands down the best smelling beer I've ever had. For fans of Zombie Dust, search this one out it will blow your mind."
Appearance: a yellowish orange. good strong haze and a finger of off white foam that hangs around forever
"Thanks to NW2285. Pours out of the 22 oz bomber a cloudy golden orange with a thick, three finger eggshell colored head. Nice retention with soapy lacing throughout my Spiegelau IPA glass. The aroma is heavy on hops - lots of citrus, hint of pine, with some grassy/floral notes. in addition to the wonderful hop aromas, one can also detect sweet malt and some biscuity notes. On the front of the tongue there's sweet citrus, toffee, and bread. Dreadnaught finishes with nice bitterness with hints of tropical fruit, rose, grass and sweet malts. Full bodies with a thick mouthfeel and effervescent carbonation. Overall, if this isn't the best DIPA on the market, it's pretty close. Another homerun FFF."
"22oz bomber poured into a pint glass, no evident bottling date, but I know it's fresh from the sender. Thanks to Duffman929 for sending this."
22oz bomber poured into wine glass. 
On tap at briquettes smokehouse 6$ 12 oz pour in a glass that would best suit a homeade Jameson and ginger. 
Slightly hazy deep copper with a frothy cream head that leaves a foam ring.
"22 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy bright orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, peach, pineapple, floral, grass, light caramel, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Light floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big tangerine, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops flavors with a light-moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, slick, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warning noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA! Fantastic complexity and balance of citrus and tropical hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and very smooth and fairy crisp to sip on for the gravity. A highly enjoyable offering."
"golden, peach, and amber in color. good head, ok retention, with good lacing. pretty carbonated."
bomber into a DFH tulip shaped pint glass
Copper-gold color with orange and yellow hues. Thin head with short retention. Beer showed a chill haze.
Poured into imperial pint glass
"A: Poured into a 3Floyds Teku, a head with tiny white bubbles rose less than 2 fingers tall on top of the golden orange beer. As the foam slowly fell it left a lacing nearly the same hight as the poured head. The beer showed a hint of haze, but otherwise clear enough to see your digits distincly on the other side of the glass."
Poured from 22oz bomber into a pint glass.
"Poured into a glass, it produced a 2 finger, off-white head. The beer color is medium gold."
Had on-tap at Kuma's Corner in Chicago. $10 for a pint.
"Appearance: Golden orange, slight haze, off-white head that held on for a little while before fading to a slight ring. Left nice lacing"
"Thanks, Todd! Poured out of a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. Split with others. Review is from my notes."
A: Dark orange with a big head that leaves some lacing. Definitely big alcohol legs going on. 
Huge thanks to boilermakerryan for sending this my way!
A - Pours a bright citrus/golden in color with an eggshell head. The body is hazy and not clear for my bottle.
"Pours a slight apricot color, mostly clear and with a fine two finger creamy off white head."
"My wife surprised me with this one. Told me it got busted in the shipment, but then slow rolled me as she handed it to me a couple weeks later. Sneaky"
"Appearance: Beautiful head on the pour, which subsided but was present while drinking. Tons of sticky lacing on the glass as I enjoyed this one. A perfect bright orange color which has all the look a DIPA should. "
"22 oz bottle purchased from the brewery yesterday. No bottling date, but no doubt they keep things fresh. This is my third DIPA from FFF (Permanent Funeral and Arctic, the other two); so far Zombie takes it. "
"22oz bottle which should be relatively fresh since it just showed up on the shelves just this past week. Poured into New Belgium snifters and shared with a friend today, 5/19/2013."
This gets compared with Arctic Panzer Wolf a lot...will it be better?
Pours amber In color with one finger off white head that has decent retention. Some pretty good lacing is present all around the glass.
On tap at Apex for Gigantic Beer Week. 
"I know im supposed to be all drooling on the floor and stroking this brew, but it just didn't hit the spot for me like I expected it to. sometimes the hype does you in from the start. this pours a slightly hazy orange bent color, some copper hues, and a couple inches of lasting white head. the nose isn't as hoppy as I expect it to be for the style, its quite fruity up front, slightly tropical, without much bitterness at all. more English style malts in there too than I think the style warrants, which turn into a weirdly sweet finish as far as the flavor goes. the hops are big and juicy, but they aren't bitter or high alpha in the way the alpha king was (that one is definitely worth its hype!). the hops just sort of melt into the malt, which is fine and good, but in a double ipa I want them a little more pronounced than this. fuller bodied and well carbonated, but my mind has already been made up. this beer was disappointing because of all the hype, but that doesn't stop it from still being a top quality brew, it just fell short of that all time status. overall I appreciate the fruity elements and the bigger grain bill, it also hides its alcohol content expertly, but it just doesn't come out hoppy enough to fit into the style very well."
"We pour a brew of shining golden-pumpkin orange. It holds a massive two finger head of batter colored bubbles, showing excellent retention. The bubbles are soapy, cakey, and thick, leaving mountains of lacing clinging around the glass. A faint chill haze is noted, without sediment. Carbonation appears to be average. The aroma is bright and fusel, with sticky grapefruit and nectary hops and stinging booze wafting from the time you crack the bottle. Sweetness also comes in the form of warmed honey, pear, pineapple, and coconut shell, while bittered, grainy balance comes from graphite, heavy raw caramel malts, lightly toasted pale malts, sourdough breadiness, and spicy plastics. With warmth comes a curious tomato, garden fresh acidity. Our first impression is that while the beer is initially spicy, and ends with an onslaught of bitterness, the bulk of it is very nicely balanced. As we sip, the taste begins with cold vanilla cake, grapefruit and herbal hoppy bite, oily tree resin pucker, tannic lemon tea, and mango juiciness to cut. Pushing to the peak is more balanced sweetness of white sugar, nectarine, solidly pale malts, and leafy greenness. The finish breaks through quickly, giving proud revival to the initial bitterness of citric hop rind, mineral earthiness, fusel booze, plastics, pseudo-oaky-herbalness, and those same aromatic caramel malts. The aftertaste breathes bitterly of big booziness, phenolic clove and plastics, copper, bready yeast, pale malts, musk, and grapefruit rind hops. The body is on the full side, and carbonation is lighter but nicely contributory. The mouth is coated with oily slickness and sugary sappiness, with quickly following astringency and boozy pucker. Each sip gives nice slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop, with the lips left sticky and satisfied. The abv is appropriate and warming, and the beer drinks as more of a sipper."
Appearance: Great lacing. Orange with a slight green tint. Very seductive in a goblet.
Poured from a 22oz. Bottle my friend gave me today at lunch. 
"Pours a nice orange straw color, with a little haze and a small head. Smell is mildly hoppy with alcohol. Taste is pretty much the same. The hops are really understated, though it is pretty bitter and there's a fair amount of booziness too. Mouthfeel was fine, maybe a tad over carbonated and syrupy, but fine. Overall, this beer was dissapointing, given it's BA rating. There is really no individual quality for me to be impressed with. It's a perfectly good, but not remarkable high-alcohol DIPA. I'll try it again if I get the chance, but only to see if this bottle was just a dud, or old."
A - Hazy golden orange. Fluffy white head. Pillowy and sticks around for a long time. Leaves a nice lacing down the glass.
"A - Poured into a tulip, apricot/deep golden color, solid white head which settles after a few minutes leaving tons of lacing behind that stick to the glass and create little floating islands."
"Thanks to Mpayne5 for letting me taste my first Dreadnaught. This beer pours a beautiful orange haze. The aroma is full blown pineapple, peach, mango, pine. Taste is outstanding and hoppy! Bittersweet and crisp! This is what I am looking for in a DIPA! Mouthfeel is very interesting, harsh but smooth on the finish, highly drinkable which is dangerous! Overall a very good DIPA with all the bells and whistles. Get this stuff at all costs!"
A - A great golden yellow color. Good amount of Carbonation. 2 fingers of off white head that left great lacing.

22 oz bottle for $11.49 poured into a 12 oz Bell's Tulip
"Appearance: Pours an almost amber golden color…it’ s light golden on the bottom and a dark caramel golden on the top…capped by just off white head about a finger width thick…tons of bubble action in the middle, I can also see some floating sediment…when I swirl it around, the big bubble head tightens up into a nice thick tiny bubble/foamy head…a good lookin’ brew…(4.25/5)"
Picked this bad boy up right from the pup. I have mixed feelings mainly because I remember a more gratifying experience with this beer. Still definitely an awesome beer. I wonder how much circumstances effect my beer experiences. 
"A- Color is a hue of pale goldenrod. Small amounts of lacing, and retention of head that leaves about half a finger worth of foam."
Was given this gem by a cool Chicago guy at a beer festival. Can't get this stuff in the Bay Area. Waited a week before indulging.

served from a 22oz bottle.the appearance is a copper color. the smell is a combo of fruitiness. the taste is also alot of fruit notes followed by a slight bitterness of hops at the back of the tongue. very good. this is a good beer. im glad this one is year round.

"Appearance: hazy, pale, honey color; white head that rings around"
Poured 22oz bomber into tulip glass
"Pours pale copper in color with a respectable off-white head. Lacing clings handsomely to the glass as the head recedes. Aroma smells of mango, peach, grapefruit, and pine. I wish I could say the flavor was as fruity and complex as the aroma; alas, I find it difficult to discern much besides the bold flavor of pine resin. Grapefruit is appreciable, granted, and some bready malt does come through in the finish once the hops have subsided, but it's a struggle to gauge anything more. This IPA is true to form, with over-the-top hop bitterness relentlessly accosting the taste buds. If you love DIPAs, you'll probably love this. I don't love DIPAs, so this doesn't do much for me."
"Well, gonna keep this one simple. Started out great in the nose. Piney, grassy, perhaps a bit resiny. Overall not too strong, but very pleasantly present."
"Still the best DIPA around- recently had Pliny and Arctic panzer wolf, I've had heady topper many a time, and Dreadnaught beats them all."
Original Review on: 03-24-2007
Three Floyds Dreadnaught Imperial IPA. 
"Picked up a 22 oz. bottle of Three Floyds Dreadnaught Imperial IPA at Kimbark Beverage Shoppe in Hyde Park, Chicago about a month ago (just getting around to this review now). The price was a bit exorbitant–$10.99 for 22 ounces! This hop monster was enjoyed in my Chimay goblet. "
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bottle on December 22, 2012."
Thanks to whoever brought this to the Dec. '12 Philly suburbs bottle share.
Picked this up at Three Floyds. They did not have what I was looking for but on their suggestion I got two 22oz bottles.
"I'm struck by the the awesomeness of a Top 10 IPA; nervous, trepidatious, anxious all at once, but this presented itself quite calmly. Average IPA color and texture I was not ""wowed"" by it aesthetically. The aroma was nice, hops and citrus but as the label said I was detecting mango. The taste was simple at first but as I delved deeper I was more and more impressed. Obviously heavily hopped this IPA is smooth and light yet tasty. I got mango and citrus flavors but the hoppiness blended well with both. I enjoyed Dreadnaught immensely but more so the deeper I got into the bottle."
"Bottled served in a weizen glass, thanks to Mike for this one. I've been waiting for sometime to try it and I waited with baited breath as I popped the top and pour a beautiful golden amber, clear brew with 4 finger fluffy eggshell head that took some time to settle with excellent retention and spiderweb sticky lacing."

Thanks to krl2112 for the bottle.
Drank out of a Founders snifter.
"just opened the bottle, smells like funky high end weed. Surprisingly pale color, like a very deep yellow with some orange/brown. Giant sticky white head. Even with letting this beer breathe, still smells like sticky weed. Fruit scents begin to come forward, dried apricots and peaches. As the beer really has time to air out and the smells escape, smells like lightly toasted bread with a tropical fruit marmalade seeping into your bedroom to wake you up in the morning."
"Poured from 22 oz bottle into tulip. Purchased at Liquor barn Louisville, KY - ~$10."
This was a bomber and poured into a pint glass
"Pours clear light copper with medium head. Mega pine aroma with some nice citrus grapefruit. Wow. Flavor is pine and grapefruit with a nice malt balance, excellent sweetness paired with the hops, and this one comes off very juicy. Slick mouthfeel with lingering hops. Awesome. Rated near the top for good reason. Thanks to Ryan for the trade. Been seeking this out for a while, and my first Three Floyds brew."
Thanks to maximumu13 for this one. Reviewed from notes. Poured from bomber into a CCB pint glass.

22oz bottle poured into a tulip
Fresh from FFF picked up 5 days ago
"Pours a sunset golden orange color with a nice finger-length off white head. Head dissipates fairly slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Just smells amazing. Tons of resinous mango, pineapple, peach. Also tropical fruits like papaya or something like that. Very sweet smell from the carmel malt I imagine. Taste begins with an abrasive bitterness. Then fades nicely into a mouthful of tropical and citrus fruits. Finishes with a fruity, bready, sweet malt. All the while that bitterness is lingering around. The sweet, bitter fruit finish sticks around. Nice creamy mouthfeel and is full bodied. Such a smooth tasting beer."
a clean light golden/orange pour wih 2 fingers of foamy white head.. Excellent lacing and great retention.
A- Wonderful look of a clear/slight haze with a big head that is foamy light white.

Big thanks to cfrances33 for hookin' a brother up.
"Served from a bottle into an ""official 3F glass"" from the brewer."
Appearance- strong copper color with a good amount of carbonation with a nice lacing lingering white head.
A-hazy amber color with a nice white head and good lacing
"Poured into a snifter this I2PA pours slightly hazy golden-orange color with a bright white head that leaves very nice lacing along the glass. The aroma is intensely hoppy--lot of grapefruit, some spicyness, pine and underlying sweetness. The flavor has a lot going on--loads of piney grapefruit hop flavor upfront with bready, boozyness mixed in. The hop bitterness is sharp and assertive and acts to dry the swallow with lingering hop flavor and hints of booze well after the swallow. The carbonation is moderate and medium-full. Overall one hell of a beer--love how the hops work with the underlying bready/boozyness. More please."
This is one bitter beer.
A - Super clear amber body with 2 fingers of moundy eggshell cream. The head slowly sinks into a thin cap with nice lacing patterns.
"Consumed on tap at Three Floyds on September 7. Served with a decent head and deep amber color. Aroma is typical Three Floyds Citra overload fantastic with plenty of grapefruit, lemon, and mango. Taste is delicious with plenty of bitter citrus flavor to keep the sweetness of the malt in check. Alcohol is well hidden. Juicy mouthfeel is smooth despite the bitterness with drying on the finish. I love this DIPA from Three Floyds - especially nice to try it at the brewpub!"
"651mL. Pours a beautiful clear copper with a modest white head. Okay lacing. Aromas of powerful grapefruit, mango, orange peel, resiny hops, floral hops, orange blossom honey. Taste upfront is crazy grapefruit and unripe mango and then moves to hazelnut and brazil nut. Aftertaste is dry and bitter. 9.5% is nicely hidden. Very good but I feel like this is not as fresh as the Bells Hopslam batch I just tried and thus not as amazing. 2/7/2009 8/4/8/4/17=4.1"
Poured into a founder's brewing company snifter
A - Orange pour with a white foam that has lively carbonation. Cloudy look to it. Serious sticky lacing on the glass.
"Pours a substantial 2cm head of off-white foam, composed of small to medium sized bubbles, fairly dense in packing. Head retention is pretty solid for a 9.5% ABV douple ipa, lasting a minute or two, gradually fading to a thin cap of foam atop the body. The head leaves substantial lacing in its wake, which is augmented with each sip. The beer's body is a transparent golden orange-brown color, with light bringing out bright orange and yellow hues. Carbonation is readily visible, percolating from the center and sides of the glass."
Bottle enjoyed on 8/5/12 in a Three Floyds pint glass.
"Light colored for a IIPA, it has a darker golden hue, not like a pils at all but it is of the golden variety. Absolutely crystal clear with a moderate amount of carbonation. There is a one finger creamy white head, it's a stunning looking beer."
Bomber poured into a 16oz tulip. Thanks to Matt for this one.
"Six of us attending a beer tasting that I hosted in my man cave pub gave this beer a score of 24 out of a possible 30 for and an average score of 4.0 It ranked tied for 3rd out of the 12 beers we tasted. The group of six were divided evenly, 3 that favored IPA's and 3 that favored Stouts."
"Pours brilliant deep orange with decent sized head. Smells of citrus hops and tropical fruits. Taste is not really the huge hop bite I expected from the nose but still very nice. Very nice fruity character pineapple, grapefruit, mango, passion fruit and a slight hint of biscuit malt and black pepper. Mouthfeel is pretty chewy carbonation pretty low. Overall very decent year round beer."
Thanks to Dunn for bringing this one back from his travels.
"I live a couple blocks down from 3 Floyd's. A friend that is a bartender at Floyd's offered me a free dreadnaught since I had never had it. I didn't rate it as high as most others, because after having tried it, I didn't think it was all that great. Its good, it pours nice, the taste is good, but the price is ridiculous."
"Pours a light orange with fast rising bubbles and a decent whit frothy head. Probably about two fingers worth of head, very nice for its high ABV"
Im very luck to get this brought to me. All the way from Kentucky Best beer Ive ever had? If not it's damn close. Lots of grapefruit favors. The smell is very strong. I'm finding it really hard not to finishing this off quickly. Extremly smooth for a 100 ibu beer. 
"The beer pours a rich looking, slightly hazy amber with a fluffy, dense off-white head. The head remains thick throughout drinking and leaves behind some sticky lacing. The nose is pure tropical mangos with a touch of pineapple. Very vibrant, fruity hops were used to make this beer. The taste is just as fruity and sweet with a pungent underlying booziness. Rich, medium-bodied mouthfeel that's sweet, mildly bitter, and slightly boozy. Very drinkable, but dedinitely something to sip on and savor. Outstanding IPA, very flavorful and fruity with fairly well hidden alcohol."

22 oz. bottle
Served on-tap at Bavarian Lodge in a 12 oz snifter.
"22oz into a tulip. Pours a hazy glowing orange w/ a thick frothy head, great retention, sticky lacing, minimal carb."
Appearance- light golden color with a big foamy head that leaves little lacing. 
"Poured a cloudy summer gold with a nicely frothy white head. Lots of pine all over the nose. Maybe a bit of pineapple somewhere, but that's all I really discerned from the aroma, albeit extremely nice and refreshing. Sweet and juicy forefront with lots of pine, like eating a pine cone. Very bitter and kind of harsh in the finish with a strong whiff of alcohol. Medium/light body with ample carbonation. Not a bad DIPA."
"They call Dreadnaught a ""hophead's dream beer"" and I would say that's totally accurate. If you are iffy about big IPA's or extremely hoppy beer - you will want to pick something else. If you are a hop lover, you really need to try this."
"A: The beer is crystal clear orange in color. It poured with a finger high frothy white head that gradually died down, leaving a large patch of bubbles in the center and a thin collar around the edge of the glass. A few small particles are visible floating near the bottom of the glass."
Smells huge. Nose is grapefruit and tangerines with a little bit of pine-ish sticky notes. I get a little bit of lemon too. The taste is slightly more balanced than I expected. Tart grapefruit flavors come out up front with background notes of orange/tangerine citrus. Theres a malty backbone to everything that is almost washed away on the back end by pine hops that leave a sticky feeling behind on the tongue. It has some alcohol burn which makes me think its probably around 10-11% ABV. This is a beautiful orange/amber brew with a thick off-white head that sticks around forever. This guy deserves its reputation.
A: Pours a crystal clear golden orange in color with some light to moderate amounts of visible carbonation and very light amounts of particles in suspension. The beer has a finger tall dense creamy light beige head that has very good retention properties - the head eventually reduces to . Moderate to significant lacing is observed.
"A: Slightly hazy, golden-yellow with a big, bubbly, fluffy, white head. Little lace or retention."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Nice hazy orange appearance with an excellent 1 finger head. Head disappears quickly. The smell is utterly amazing with a all kinds of hoppy aromas spewing from the glass. The taste is a little sweeter than other DiPA's that I've had but I wouldn't change a thing. Lot's of grapefruit and sweet citrus gushing through. Mouthfeel is nice and thick with a beautiful aftertaste. Wow, that wasn't just good beer but a damn good beer. At $12.99 a bottle it is expensive but worth it."
"22oz bomber (and huge want) from Aaron in MN, thanks a TON man! Poured into a New Belgium Globe."
"For a long time, this was my absolute favorite beer. While it is much better on tap at the brew pub, I am reviewing it from the bottle. "
Appearance: It has a nice cloudy golden/orange color to it. It has a nice thick off-white head that dies down moderately slow and leaves nice lacing.
"A top notch, well crafted DIPA. Perhaps less extreme than I expected; it’s actually quite drinkable for its ABV and lets the detailed flavors of the hops shine without overpowering bitterness. Hazy dark orange with a modest white head that settles down fairly quickly. Nice lacing remains on the glass. Aroma is quite hoppy, with a host of tropical and citrus flavors – orange, tangerine, mango, lemon – but also has an underlying caramel malt aspect."
"The pour leaves a cloudy, deep orange body, topped by a small white head with great lacing. Aroma of piney hops and citrus fruits. Taste is of grapefuits and oranges, intense, fresh hops, and a sweet maltiness that balances out the flavor. Mouth is big and thick and the finish is long, slow, and dry. Terrific flavor, thanks!"
"A: Pours a semi-hazy golden-yellow with a bubbly fingers worth head of foam on top. Lots of bubbles in the body. Crazy complexity in the color. It looks like there's a tornado in my pint glass. No BS. Wild. Must be coming from the sediment, which in my book is a plus. Preliminary lacing is good. Can't find anything wrong."
3 Floyds Dreadnaught IPA
Poured into a tall glass.
"Second bottle from trade. Pours a beautiful murky orange. The head is fluffy white with good retention. The nose is bitter pine and citrus with a bit of toasted bread in the background. Flavor is dense sweet tropical fruits, bitter pine resin, a little caramel note of sweetness at the back end. Finishes with a bit of oily sweet tropical goodness. A very enjoyable brew."
A: Inch white head tops the amber hazy colored brew with loads of lacing throughout the entire glass.
On tap at the Bavarian Lodge. I had the zombie dust before this one. I think the zombie dust is actually hoppier. This is still an amazing double ipa. FFF does amazing work. I had this in a bottle before but it's so nice to try on tap. If I could only drink from one brewery for the rest of my life it'd be FFF.
22 oz bomber poured into a tulip glass
"Pours a gorgeous clear copper golden color with a signature white head that is continuously fed by carbonation from the bottom. Amarillo hops dominate the bouquet. The hops in the flavor are perfectly balanced with the grain. This might be the perfect beer. Of course, you throw Amarillo on dog excrement and you're bound to have something that tastes at least passable."
Tulip glass.
"22oz bottle. No bottle dating information, but this came fresh from the brewery. Poured into my Victory Golden Monkey tulip."
"WOW !! That's my one word review of this beer. Ok, ok, I can't get away with such an abbreviated writeup on such a marvelous beer; it definitely wouldn't do the dudes at FFF who brew this masterpiece justice.. So here I go with a review of this DIPA that some find perfect, while others throw rocks at, which I have no clue why."

Appearance: Beautiful golden orange color. 
Pours a darker pale yellow / golden yellow. Nose is full of fruity mangos and tropical notes with a bit of citrus. Taste starts off with sweet citrus with some caramel malt. These are quickly overtaken by a load of tropical citrus flavors. Finishes with a lingering tropical bitterness with a touch of caramel. Really nice DIPA here.

Hm Dreadnaught. Bright amber body with a nice steady stream of carbonation coming from the bottom of my glass. Thick frothy almost pasty offwhite head floating.
"This is the gold standard of IPAs. If I can't rate this as perfect then I don't know what I would or could rate perfect. It has great color, clarity, smell and taste. Perfect hop flower aroma and really packs a wollup! Definitely it's a special occasion experience. If you want to treat yourself then this is the one."
Bomber into a Duvel tulip
Thanks to fritts211! Hope you enjoy your KBS!
Enjoy withing my good friend pschul4. 
"Poured from undated bomber to pint glass the beer arrives a light translucent amber yellow with a nice 2 finger white head, supreme retention, excellent lacing. The nose is very hop forward with citrus and fruity tones: mango, grapefruit, tangerine, tropical fruit. Hints of pine as well. Fruity sweetness. The flavor starts with a gentle pale malt sweetness from which the hop character and flavors build. The same fruitiness as found in the nose together with a medium bitterness. No hint of alcohol and very well balanced. Finishes clean and crisp with a lingering bitter fruity sweetness. Very good. Medium to Full bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Tons of fruity character and very approachable. Highly recommended."

"Fresh bomber poured in a duvel tulip. Nice clear orange amber with a white 2 finger head. Excellent lacing. Aroma is tropical fruit. Mango, pineapple, and bright citrus is apparent. Flavor is grapefruit, tropical fruit, peach, and a nice caramel malt balance. It goes down really easy and the 9.5% abv is practically invisible. The mouthfeel is medium and the flavor lingers on the tongue. This is the standard I judge DIPA’s by."

Huge thanks to Billakowski for the reviewable bottle.

From notes:
"On-Tap at 3F, served in Half Pint glass.."
"Poured from 22oz bomber. Nice 1"" head, amber tone."
"This pours a nice copper/orange color with a nice 2 finger width fluffy white head that leaves behind nice lacing. This first smell I get is tropical fruits like mango and pineapple, then some citrus from grapefruit and a little piney aroma. The grapefruit comes through on the taste more that the mango/pineapple that I was getting so strong from the smell, the piney flavor is also there but a little subdued compared to the other flavors. There is also a nice sweetness that complements the bitterness. The mouthfeel is in the middle compared to others in the style not nothing really stands out, the carbonation is good. Overall this is a great beer I don't buy a lot of bottles of this for personal consumption but when on draft I do tend to get this a lot compared to other DIPA that Indiana has to offer."

"Reviewing the infamous Dreadnaught IPA from Three Floyds Brewing Company out of Munster, Indiana. This imperial IPA is highly sought after by beer geeks and is universally hailed as one of America's top beer by most beer connoisseurs. I am lucky enough, living in both Wisconsin and Illinois, to be within Three Floyds' distribution network, so Dreadnaught is an off the shelf gem that I have regular and convenient access too."

Thanks to Jeff and Erik for sharing this one during the BA tasting in Utrecht. Had this one side-to-side with the Heady Topper.

Beer is light amber with a small white head. Lots of lacing.

I absolutely love Bells’ Hopslam; but 3 Floyds has me thinking that Dreadnaught might be able to go neck and neck with Hopslam. A fantastic double IPA! that goes directly into my Top 5. Hazy gold pour with white head and decent lacing. Smell is citrusy and tropical. Taste is unbelievably wonderful with a nice balance of hops and malts. THREE FLOYDS PLEASE COME TO IOWA!!!!
"Big thanks to Schustar for 2 of these bottles in my first trade, thank you sir!"
A: Darker then your usual DIPA. A real nice burnt orange. Pretty hazy. A nice fluffy off white colored head. Looks like it may stick around.
Thanks again to jzmaxson27 for this great beer! Sadly the last I have from our trade.
A: amber with yellow hues. 3 finger frothy off white head with a nice amount of lacing but not much retention
"Pours an orange caramel color into my ccb snifter with a one finger head that disapates fast. Aroma of tropical fruits with a malty butterscotch backbone. Taste follows the nose, great citric hop taste with a sweet caramel malt leaving this fairly balanced but still a bit sweeter than the top dipas that I have tried. This is a great dipa but not the best, I don't think I will be seeking this out again."
Poured from a 22oz bomber I got from fellow BA Urbencaver who I must give a big shout out to into a chilled Duvel tulip glass.

"Live review. Poured from the 22 oz. bomber that I bought at Save-On Tobacco & Beverage in Mentor, Ohio about a week ago for $10.99 into a clean, clear pint glass. 3F just started distributing to Ohio about a month ago and so I will be able to pick up a few here and there when I find them (the selections are sporadic according to two beer stores). I had a chance to try this at Chef Paul’s Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL about a year ago but I would have had to buy and drink the bottle at the restaurant and there were too many interesting beers on tap there to drink from a bottle. Anyway, I digress. No observed “best by” date."

"A: Pours a hazy gold with a thin, creamy white head. I really dig the hazy, unfiltered apearance of this beer."
Received as part of a beertrade with spreo_superbus on reddit.com/r/beertrade BOTM
"A: Pours a golden-caramel color with 1.5 fingers of thick, white head. Great retention; leaves behind tons of lace. Gorgeous!"
"Bought a 22 FL OZ bottle of this from Binny's Beverage Depot in Chicago, IL for $11.99. Poured from the trippy bottle w/ a what looks to be Nutcracker first look but really is a man from India in front of The Taj Mahal w/ two of his friends into my 0,47 l New Belgium Oversized Snifter Glass. Does not have a freshness date (duh!). "
Bottle sent to me by Urbancaver. Thanks a lot man!
A - Clear orance with a 1-2 finger white head
Cheers to rmalinowski4 for sending this my way
"When I heard Three Floyds was coming back to Ohio, I was excited, mostly because they are known for their IPA's and Double IPA's and I, coincidentally, love IPA's. Of their stable of IPA's, Dreadnaught was heralded as one of their better IPA offerings. So, what better to put me in a good mood after a bad Browns loss than to sample some of this elixir?"
"A: Nice clear golden pour, with a half inch thick head that slowly faded away. What a great looking beer!"
Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Duvel tulip. Received in a trade with rfraga77. Many thanks!
"Pours a crisp orange-gold, like white grape juice. Thin white head with little lacing. Powerful aroma of sweet tropical fruit, honey and a touch of pine. Reminds me of a slightly maltier Hopslam. Taste follows the aroma, complex hops with just enough bready malt to hold up. Light on the tongue and highly drinkable."
Big thanks to Kayn169 for this and a number of other things from Three Floyds that have been big wants for a long time!
Poured from bomber into shaker pints.
"A: Pours a clear golden yellowish-straw color; pinky-width head, light lacing"

Had this a number of times...figured it was time to give it a review.
Bottle from sixthglass... Thanks Tim!
"22 oz bottle that I got from sixthglass poured into a Portsmouth tulip. Poured at probably 40 degrees, I took my time in drinking it so as too experience the beer at every temperature."
Crystal clear amber color with an off white head. Fairly low retention and lacing. 
22oz bomber shared with Bonis and reviewed from notes taken 10/3/2011.
Nice orange hue. Hops are up close and personal. Nice piney touch and clean at the same time. There was a nice two finger head and clean lacing. This brew is a must for all DIPA freaks. This brew most def has some kick. I go this beer through a trade and would travel a couple states just to get this beer once again.
A - A nice clear golden orange color with a tall pillowy white head. Better than average head retention and lace.
"Orange amber with good lacing. Smell was pine resin and sweet malt. Taste was strongly aromatic pine resins, slight sweet malt appears, but bitterness coats the tongue and is lingering on the edges of the palate long finish. Mouthfeel is plush and the carbonation is nice. Overall it's a nice offering, but this one leans a little one-dimensionally to the pine resins."
Poured into an Arrogant Bastard pint glass.
This has and probably always will be one of my favorite beers. Tons of citrus and fruit notes from the hops which is perfectly balanced by the malts which lends a bit of sweetness but never takes away from the hop profile which is exqusite to say the least. Extremely drinkable to the point where you're sad to see it go but glad it went down
22 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Really looking forward to this one.
Obtained from West Lakeview Liquor. Pours a hazy orange color with a nice size white head. Good lacing and better than average retention.
Three Floyds Dreadnaught is a delicious double IPA that mixes the floral and citrus characters of hops. The hops provide much aroma and flavour without much bitterness and you will barely tastes the 9.5% alcohol. Well done Three Floyds!
This beer pours a hazey ligh amber color. This one has an amazing smell to it. Right out front there is a citrus and pine followed by tropical fruits. The taste of this one is a lot like the smell. Massive hops and fruits such as grapefruit and pinneapple. I would say the mouthfeel is great on this beer as well because it leaves you wanting more. This is probaly my go to beer whenever I want a good IPA.
"A- Translucent caramel, cloudy, small bubbles, frothy two-finger head in a pint glass. Small amount of foam (tough to call it lacing) hangs down the inside of the glass as it empties."

Bomber picked up at the brewpub
Going off memory here. Tried this awhile ago...
"Looks fabulous in my snifter. Kind of an orange marmalade color, teetering on the fence between opaque and translucent. The head is a finger of white foam. It sticks around for a couple minutes then disappears, leaving only lace on the inside of the glass."
Picked this bomber up at the Three Floyds brewpub..
A- Deep amber. Steady but thin head. Slight lacing. 
so this will be an odd review as the bottle has been in a cellar for a year and a half.
Thanks to bastu for sending me this one!
Poured from 22 oz. Bomber of course.
"22 oz bottle courtesy of Zenasdassman, thanks! Poured into an IPA glass."
"A: amber orange with suspended material, probably hops. Looks great so far. The head is large at first, then dissipates due to the size of the bubbles, leaving a nice off-white lacing. "

"A - Pours a bright orange color and a hazy consistency. There was a big, foamy, long-lasting head. Nice lacing."
Poured into my effin gruven snifter from a 22oz bomber served at fridge temp on Labor Day.
"Pours a hazy yellow amber, with a thick two finger head with good retention, that trails and sticks nicely down the glass. Aroma was not as powerful as I expected, smells of pine, grapefruit, mango and citrus. Very very well balanced on the palate grapefruit, peach, even a little bit of strawberry, moderate hop bitterness and subdued caramel malt flavors. Oily but slick, does not leave a resinous hop mess on the palate, but it satiates the tongue nicely. Very drinkable, perhaps too much soo if that is possible, could get dangerous with these around on a hot summer day =). I do wish there was a bit more bitterness here, but I guess the beer doesnt really need it."
Poured a 22 oz bomber into a pint glass. The appeance is a light copper with a 1/2 in of head. A wonderful delicate lacing followed.

Had this on-tap at Three Floyd's brewpub. Poured into a half pint.
"A: The color of honey, mostly clear, just the smallest hint of a haze. Nice cloudy white head, that seems to last for quite a while. "
A - An orange slightly unfiltered like appearance. 
"22oz bottle, thanks to sobeleg. This one was poured into my Bruery tulip."
"Bottle with no freshness date, poured into a pint glass."
Thanks to Crabbicuss and biglobo for tag-teaming to hook me up with a big want. No freshness info. Enjoyed on 08/14/11.
Thank goodness for Kentucky being only 20 minutes away. I was fortunate enough to find several FFF bombers on sale at DEPs in Fort Thomas (for all you Greater Cincinnati area people)
Picked up a bottle on a recent vacation to Indy Dunes.
"I’ve been in the craft beer world too long without having a Dreadnaught. Every time I go on a beer run, it’s staring me in the face; however, because of the price and the lack of a bottle date, I’ve decided to pass. Until now! I know this bomber’s fresh, so I forked over the $12. I love me some Three Floyd’s, and this seems to be one of their most beloved brews. Can’t wait to take a sip…"
"Three floyds doesnt care about bottle date, so neither to I!"
Poured into a Lost Abbey stem. 
I brought this one to our IPA day party.
Poured a nice hazy orange hue with a fluffy white head that left some nice lacing on the glass.
"A ~ a sunset orange, hazy like a summer day... with a nice pretty frothy cap"
"A: Poured from a bottle to a tulip glass. Had a bright orange color and a hazy consistency. There was a big, foamy, long-lasting head. Great lacing."
Thanks to orangesol for sharing this -enjoyed from tulip poured from a bomber. 
I had shared a bomber of this fantastic IPA last month but I picked up a bomber a few weeks back on my trip to the brewery. This time I was able to enjoy the entire bomber by myself and I really wish that I bought several more! I poured the beer into my DFH snifter to find a dark hazy golden body with an one inch head that leaves a nice sticky lacing on the glass.
"Vibrant orange color, one inch creamy head. Excellent Retention."
A - Light copper with a one and a half finger head.
A poured a dark golden with a nice finger head. 
"A-Pours a gorgeous,vibrant orange with a slight haze that sat beneath 2 1/2 inches of durable,bone-white head.Unbelievable retention and ridiculously thick and gummy,concentric rings of lacing.Exactly what a IIPA should look like in my opinion."
"Again thanks to beergynt for this trade. Poured into a DFH snifter. Poured a medium amber orange with two finger head with great lacing. The nose is incredible. Wow. Sitting two feet from the brew and can still smell it. Very fruity, hoppy, little bit of orange I detect. The taste is incredible as I had hoped. Very balanced. Mouthfeel was a bit creamy with little carbonation. Overall an excellent beer that I wish I had access to in Georgia. But such is life."
"22oz bottle with no bottled on or freshness date, poured into Hair of the Dog tulip, reviewed on 7/27/11."
Bomber into a tulip.
Growler into imperial nonic. 
A: Hazy honey color with a big cream colored head and absolutely ridiculous lacing down the glass. 
"Pours a lightly hazed golden amber with a small, but long lasting cap of white froth, rings of sticky lacing left on the glass. Intoxicating scent of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, pine, flowers, peach with a fruity and grahmn cracker sweetness, touch of vanilla and hints of alcohol. Taste follows scent, first suprise was lack of overwhelming palate scorching bitterness which was a good thing in this case. Fruity sweet with decent grahmn crackery malt backbone. Medium bodied, dry finnish. An excellent dIPA."
"Dreadnaught IPA, Three Floyds, 9.5% abv"
"Had this on tap. served in a snifter. Hazy orange color. Pine/hops dominate the nose; this beer almost smells sticky, if that is possible. Strong IPA flavors; hops, pine, grapefruit. Slippery/buttery mouthfeel.The mouthfeel really sets this apart; points for being unique. A good strong american ipa i would definitely drink again."
"Wow, I love this brewery. I love every beer they make except the Rabid Rabbit(but I really don't like that style). Love this. "
poured from a 22oz bomber into tulip.
"A: Golden amber hue, sweet translucent magnificence in my Great Lakes British pint glass. Nice bubbly thick white head leaves good lacing across the sides of the glass. like a protein stain on a fresh pair of silk boxers (you can't wear those again). Quarter inch head lingers through tasting. Beer pours and looks like a summer sunset."
"A: A hazy, sort of orangey-amber pour. Big, fluffy white head. Great retention, solid lacing. Looks delicious."
Poured orange with a huge white head that left serious lacing on my pint glass after the pour. Smells of pine citrus resiny hops. Taste is a perfect balance of malts and hops that are spot on. This beer easily landed in our top 5 all time DIPA. The beer has a perfect dry finish witha punch of weedy hops.
Poured from bomber into slightly chilled tulip pint
"On tap at Three Floyds, Again. i've had this there so many times, about time to review i guess."
"Sasquatch just booked his flight to Munster Indiana. He’s heard the rumors of amber colored brew with an amazing balance of piney hops and malt. Three Floyds came thorough for our Northwest brethren with this Imperial IPA masterpiece. The nose is duped by the overwhelming aroma of hops. The palate also never identifies the high alcohol content of this bad boy. This is due to the fact that the initial blast of pine, citrus, and hops is quickly counteracted by a rush of malt. A perfectly balanced Imperial IPA, Deadnaught just up the ante for the rest of the field..."
Duvel Tulip
Enjoyed on 5/10/11. Reviewed from notes
"Bomber from whitemomba, poured into a tulip."
"Found a bottle of this in Bethlehem PA back in early January of 2009, It must have been one of the last 3 Floyd's shipped to this state because after having that bottle I wasn't able to ever find more here again. Without much knowledge of this beer I managed to get the bottle and give it good home for a little while. Eventually I opened it up and poured it for myself. This brew looked really nice, had a bright yellowish color with a light amount of haze to it. The head was creamy and thick looking, leaving a real nice lacing on the glass. The smell of this beer had a wonderful mix of tropical fruit aromas like Pineapple, Grapefruit and Lemons. The taste was also had the same flavors as it did on the nose plus the excellent addition of Pine. This beer was very refreshing. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and had some good carbonation to it. Overall I think that this is the IPA that changed my perception on this style. I hadn't really been a big fan of them till I had this one. This beer is great, I wanted to buy more when I was at the brewery back in April but they were sold out. Better luck next time I guess."
Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint glass.

Thanks to TMoney2591 for this one!
poured cold from the tap at yogis a translucent light copper to a 12oz snifter with a full finger white head with nice retention leaving a blanket of sticky lace to the rim after each sip.
Had on tap at the Floyd's brewpub and boy did it change my perspective on this guy.
I had this a couple of hours ago while my three young children were completely underfoot so I really could not do a proper review.
Poured a cloudy bronze color. Nice thick off-white head. Very good lacing as well. 
First Review!
"22oz bottle, unknown date. Served at around 45-50F."
"Pours darkish golden with orange highlights. Small, creamy light brown head which dissipates rather quickly. Small carbonation rising."
"Appearance good. Mouth feel good. Taste very good it had the peach, mango that I love in an Imp IPA. To mask that high of octane the way it does is impressive and well done. Every thing I have had from 3 Floyds is above average and this one was no different. I cant get three floyds where I live so maybe I overhype them a bit, but good is good and thats how it rolls. Good day."
22 oz. bottle obtained at the FFF brewery and consumed just a few days later. Poured into a tulip.
On tap at the brewery on fathers day
A - very bright orange yellow. This pours with a fantastic two finger white head that has a cute little assortment of bubbles. The retention isn't bad; it layers down to a few millimeters of white film with splotchy lacing.
A- Light hazy cloudy orange with a great white head and excellent lacing. Head sits around for a minute or two.

"Had many times, never reviewed. I have a little extra time and a patient mood, so I figured I'd finally chime in."
Big thanks to aasher for helping me get my hands on this one.
"22 oz chug into a snifter...so glad I'm doing some work in Hammond, IN, it makes the top-tier stuff from 3Fs easy to come by (it's always sold out in Chicago--try finding a bottle of Dreadnaught for sale anywhere, or for that matter, sixers of their regular stuff most the time). "
8 ounce pour on tap.
Got as an extra from stxSS07!!! Very generous trader!!!
"From the bottle to my glass, to my mouth, could life be better, I think not. Good foam action, generating a two finger head of thick, slightly off white foam, that I could take a nap, well almost. Far from clear, it most closely resembles a 8 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell, ooo la la, aromas of flowers from the hops, sweet nectars, but mostly grapefruit, lemon and other citrus flavors from the massive use of hops. Taste is lots of what I like. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, lemon peel, and lime are in the forefront, with a sweetness from hints of malt, orange, and guava. Mouthfeel is creamy, thick and zing. A slight dryness on the sides of my tongue and soft palate. I would like some more of this...please."
Thanks to iadler for the generous surprise box.
"Dreadnaught on tap at a certain bar in Midtown Manhattan, eight ounces for $4 (happy hour). I never thought I'd live to see Three Floyds pouring in New York City."
"22 ounce bomber, ""express delivered"" from my buddy Beenken straight from the brewery less than a week ago. Many thanks to Matt for picking these up for me!"
Had on tap at a whole foods in Chicago.
Poured from the bomber to my glass. Bill who sold it to me says it came in about 6 or 7 weeks ago. 
Pours a light translucent orange with a smallish white head that leaves behind some substantial spotty lacing.
"Found at Lovejoys in Austin, TX this IPA shows a deep, clear copper color with a decent off-white colored head and very good lacing. The aroma offers a faint citrus biscuit/oak. Pleasant but not very distinct. The flavor brings an immediate citrus hop burst with lemon-lime bite and sweet leafy-grass edges, almost a bit nutty. It’s a medium bodied brew with minimal carbonation for a near glassy feel. Plenty drinkable and a tasty IPA that’s easy to recommend for those seeking a bitter treat."
Pours a golden yellow with a medium white head that laces nicely.
"Bomber with no freshness dating that I can find, poured into a Duvel tulip. Gigantic 4-finger fluffy eggshell white head with a clear, golden body. Good retention and rings of lacing. Looks great."
Tulip glass.
"Had on tap at FFF brewery this last weekend, reviewing from a bottle. Light golden color. Weird, because I poured two glasses. The first had a tiny head, the seconds head was about an inch deep. TONS of citrus on the nose. Tastes of grapefruit, orange, lemon, mango, and then more grapefruit through the finish that lingers through the aftertaste. Very very nice. Reminds me of alpha king without the bitterness. This stays sweet, hoppy, and fruity with very little bitterness. Very nice brew. So glad that I can find it year round ""back home again in Indiana""."
Thank you Treebs for the smooth trade. I will be looking for more of this soon..
Poured from a 22 ounce bottle via trade with CounterVulture into my Maudite snifter glass.
A- Pours a slightly cloudy orange amber. Nice two finger head with some good retention.
"Before we begin, I should mention that I've had this both on tap and in bomber format, and the only perceptible difference for me is that the bomber has somewhat less of the tropical hops and more of the piney hops aroma, as well as a wonderfully creepy label art. This review is otherwise applied to an on-draft serving at one of my favorite haunts."
"Many thanks to Alex (page101) for hooking me up with this on an awesome trade! Clear orange-yellow pour with two finger head, good retention and incredible lacing. The smell is nothing short of heaven! Huge citrus notes with freshly picked resiny hops and a touch of bubblegum. The taste is just as incredible as the nose. Tons of citrus, fresh picked resiny hops, and pine, but perfectly balanced with just enough sweet caramel malt to offset the bitterness. The alcohol is non-existent making this scary drinkable. This is probably the smoothest imperial IPA I've ever had. Maybe the best. It's definitely in the same class as PTE, Hopslam, and Sculpin. What a way to be introduced to Three Floyds! Can't wait for my next one!"
Thanks to BlessedBeBeer for the kind trade.
"I cracked open this bomber and took a whiff of its contents and got slapped in the face by the aroma. Typical IIPA bouquet of ripe tropical fruit and flowers. I poured it into a 3 Floyds glass and it emerged a hazy apricot color with a perfect, fine, frothy white head that has excellent retention and lacing."
Poured from a bomber into a Unibroue tulip.
Big thanks to Bay01 for sending this one to me. Poured from the bomber into my DFH Signature glass. Split the bomber with my girlfriend.
"Went to the 3 Floyd's Brewery for first time today. First beer ordered was Dreadnaught. Loved it. Imagine Gumballhead on steroids. The aroma was fruity. Color was a lovely brown. Best part was the mouthfeel. The high ETOH concentration was not overpowering. After two of these, it already started to do the trick. I was able to get a growler to go too. Will save that for tomorrow."
Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass.
Thanks to given2flybrewing for the beer.
22oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass
Glassware: Bruery tulip
I have had on tap and in the bottle a great beer but very expensive. 11-13$ a bomber is a lot when I can buy a 6 pack of high quality beer for less. 
pours a translucent golden color with massive white frothy head. lots o' lacing all the way down the tulip. looks like a pint of liquid gold... nice looking beer.
Intro: 22 oz. bottle in a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.
Appearence: The color of the beer was between a deep golden and a burnt orange color which is beautiful- slight haze that dissipates as the beer warms.
Reviewing after trying a fresh bottle:
A: Pours to light orangey amber. Moderate carbonation.
"A: partly cloudy deep orange body, "
A bomber that I picked up in Munster while at DLD.
"My first time having it thanks to a trade. Of the most talked about DIPAs that often get compared to each other, Hopslam is the only one I've had before Dreadnaught, and I've been wanting to try it for a long time!"
Date Drunk: 3/3/11
A: Pours to a very clear light amber. One finger white head that quickly falls to a fair film of bubbles. Medium carbonation racing to the top of the pint.
On tap at Louisville beer store. Sipping this while chatting with the Floyds was a real treat.
Purchased at FFF brewery at DLD 2011. Reviewed 5/6/11. Poured into Green Man snifter at 50*.

"22 oz bomber poured into a duvel tulip, haze or orange with some yellow/gold highlights 2 fingers of off white tight bubbling with good lacing."
"Bomber poured into a tulip glass. A vigorous pour leaves a clear orange/copper beer with a half a finger of bubbly white head that dissipates immediately, leaving some large bubbles along the collar. Not much lacing on the glass after swirling. Some carbonation is visible slowly rising up from the bottom of the glass. "
Thanks to Another6Pack for this bottle! Poured into my goblet.
Thanks to Enelson for this bomber. Mad props!
"Opaque and golden with an out of control head. It cannot be tamed. Thick, clumpy lacing. The head dissipates and leaves a cloud mountain in the center. Awesome."
Appearance - This beer had a semi-clear bright orangish/peach color. A medium white head that was none too large. Had average retention and even better lacing. Several small bubbles rising from the bottom. The head was comprised of very small bubbles. The head settled to an inconsistent patchy film across the top.
Bright orange color with awesome rocky head that lasts and lasts. Unusually nice head for a dipa.
"A- 4.5 This is eerily similar to PtE in appearance (just had that last night)... Pure golden color and barely clear on the pour with a big 2 finger off-white head. The head sticks all over the tulip glass as it dissipates down to about a 1/4"" level through the drink. Very uniform look with micro bubbles slowly but lively dancing about give it a smooth and nice appearance."
This beer was part of the Midwestern sampler I brought with me when I moved to Texas.
Review from notes:

Pours golden yellow with a very thick lovely white head
Bomber received in a trade as an extra. Poured into a DFH signature glass.
"Dreadnaught is one of the first beers that really made me appreciate how big can also be balanced. This is truly a beer every hop head should try once in their life, and I'm happy to have sampled it many times in the past. It's on my list of beers I'll always enjoy whenever our paths cross."
"Big cheers goes out to aasher, an awesome BA trader who I hope to do business with again. "
From 22oz bomber to Bruges hybrid glass on 4/5/11
"Bomber-Pours an orange-golden, almost clear pour with an off-white to beige head. It sure has a hop-dominated aroma, fruity, tropical fruits and citrus, and pine, with a heavy maltyness in the background. Nice flavor too, fruity, piney, malty, quite sweet and an amazing Hop bite. Fruity, piney, bitter finish as well. Full body. Loved this IIPA, beautiful mix of hops and malt."
"5-6 oz. from a 22 oz. bottle in an Abita tulip glass on March 31st, 2011. "

Thanks to Thorpe429 for this
22 oz bottle from LiquidBread219. No bottling dates.
"9.5% ABV, 99 IBUs"
Deuce to tulip. TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN FOR DOUBLE IPAs! Perfect bouquet and combination of hops on the palate. Not gonna waste my time talking about obscure references to citrus fruits; take my word for it: there's a reason this stuff is $10 at the store for a 24 oz.
"Aroma definitely has a plethora of citrus hoppinesd to it...grapefruit in abundance. However, it's also blessed with a good, thick malty around in there as well. Pretty balanced."
"I split a bomber with a buddy, I wish I didn't! This stuff is so good! Pours a hazy golden color w/ a great creamy white head that isn't going anywhere and extremely sticky lacing. Great looking brew! Oh yeah, this is the stuff. Great fruity aromas, very pungent and extremely tropical. Peach, pineapple, mango, tangerine and grapefruit dominate. The flavors are extremely juicy, bitter, but balanced. Perfect! Mouthfeel is extremely creamy, smooth, awesome! Drinkability is great, alcohol is masked, easy drinking, amazing flavors make it impossible to want to stop. Holy shit!"
"My second growler ever and my first growler review. I took a whiff straight from the growler at first and it felt like I was bitch slapped with sharp, bitter, tangy hops. I really flinched at it. Anyways pour is a massive erupting foamy off white head. Took me a few minutes to nearly fill my Duvel tulip. Body is a rich amber between sunny orange. Smell is a bit more subdued in the glass lol. Smells of sweet, spicy, grassy, pineapple and tangerine hops. One of the sweeter more citrusy IPA's I have smelled with a earthy/grassy twist. "
"On tap @ Sugar Maple! Nice orange color. Aroma is sticky, stanky hops - love it! Bitterness is much of the same, nice caramel malt background. A bit of a sour, citrus finish. This one walks the walk and talks the talk. An incredible Imperial with a capital I. SO glad I got to try this on tap!"
Poured frmo a 22 oz bomber into a snifter
"Ah, the heralded Dreadnaught. I brought this back from my second trip to Chicago, which I think yielded even better returns than my first trip (if that's possible!)."
"A-Very thin, fine head. Clean amber color. Served in a Snifter glass."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy pale yellow color, with a nice thick white sticky head. the smells coming from this are fruity and citrusy resinous hop aromas. the flavor is pretty close to the smell with the citrusy and almost mango flavors come through along with a nice bitterness, this is a mouthwatering double ipa and is extremely drinkable, will definitely be seeking this one out again"
A- Poured into a laser etched DFH chalice... starts with a nice white head that leaves a healthy coating of lacing on the glass walls. Beer is a light amber color with very fine sediment within
pours an unfiltered orange with a slight head.
"Poured out of a bottle into a martini glass. Color seemed consistent with other IPA's of the high alcohol content variety, and it had a pleasant, slightly fruity smell. Regarding taste, you initially get hit with a flavorful mild fruit taste, but it fades into a musty bite that reminds me of the aftertaste of the awful Four Horsemen. It gains some points back in the fact that this ""middle-after taste"" goes away and leaves you with a reasonably happy palate. Incredibly smooth in the mouth, but slightly difficult to drink because of that musty taste in the middle."
"Nice hazey peach/amber color, cannot see my fingers on the other side of the glass. Fair amount of white foam at the top."
"Poured from a bomber, a chalky yellow haze with serious head. Smell of lots of fruit and not much hops. The taste is about the same with some caramel as well. Very smooth for a Double, no slap you in the face hops. Definately taste the 9.5%, but still very drinkable."
"Clear gold pour, with a large, fluffy head. Tart smell, almost a sour-hop smell."
Big thanks to Khazadum for this one...

"A: gotta love how this looks in my dogfish snifter. there isnt much of a head to speak of, a vigorous pour yields a slight pure white head, dissipates fairly quickly but leaves sticky legs all around the rim. the body looks like pure nectar, inviting and enticing. it really is so delicious looking."

Poured into a tulip.Slight hazy golden color. Thicker than thick white heading. Tremendous lacing and heading until the last drop.
Thanks to Vdubb86 for this bottle. Poured from 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. 
"Perfect burnt orange with a small head that faded to a ring with little lacing. On the nose it's a hop assault, piney rather than fruity. It even smells bitter. On the tongue it's a huge hop presence, pine resin, sharp, extraordinarily bitter. In the mouth it's not as huge as I had expected, maybe a medium-full body with a gigantic hoppy bitterness that lingers on and on and on. As far as drinkability, it's not something I'd turn to over and over because of its rather abrasive nature, which while pleasant in moderation could easily become overbearing. A huge DIPA. Can't decide whether I like this or Arctic Panzer Wolf better. Maybe I'll have to do a side by side on some glorious night of huge IPAs."
22oz bottle poured into an over sized wine glass. No date on bottle. Thanks to slvrmon82 for giving me the opportunity to try this.

Thanks to paulv for the bottle!
"Thanks to PaulV for this bottle! Poured into a fluted pint, revealing hazy golden brown body with a finger and a half of airy yellowed head. A little lacing. Smells nice and hoppy with a strong honey floral presence and some fresh pear, maybe some dried mango. Little bits of rich, caramel-y meatiness underneath."

"22oz bottle provided by UMNbeerhunter, thanks Joe! Poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass."
"Thanks to Agold for this trade, and the chance to try this amazing beer. Poured into my Dfh snifter, appearance is a dark yellow/orange color, about 1 finger of head quickly dies down with nice glass lacing. On the nose, there are some huge aromatic grapefruit flavors, as well as pine, and some nice tropical fruits and citrus. On the first taste, the fresh grapefruit and citrus flavors flavors mingle, along with some nice bitter hops, followed by a creamy malt at the end. This is a truly amazing beer, a great specimen of a double ipa. For the big abv, it is really hidden well, and this is highly drinkable. Bravo three floyds!"
"Giant three finger head off the pour into a pint glass. Huge retention on it, this thing just WILL not go away very impressive off white color and very foamy. Some faint cloudiness but not much, with a nice golden dark brown color body. This is a very impressive looking beer."

"This is my second review of Dreadnaught, easily a desert Island beer for me, and possibly the beer I would drink last before I die (though Vanilla Bean Dark Lord probably would be it if available). Certainly it is my favorite beer that is easily available year round. I was INCREDIBLY fortunate enough to be given a growler of Dread that was tapped the day before from my beer guy in DC. I feel it is my duty to tell the beer world that you must try Dreadnaught on tap (fresh) or from a fresh growler to really appreciate this amazing beer. "

"650ml bottle acquired from my contact in Indiana - my first Three Floyds beer that made quite an impression on me. This is definitely a hophead's dream beer without the bitterness. Pours a cloudy amber appearance. Opening salvo of mango, peach and citrus hop aromas that sit atop a pronounced caramel malt backbone. This beer retained a nice head and lace throughout. It's complex flavors is both smooth and memorable. A definite favorite of mine in the Imperial IPA category!"

"Body is a slightly hazy gold with a 2-finger head that thins to a fine layer of foam, leaving some lace curtains along the way. "
"Hoppy aromas protrude from the bottle immediately upon opening. The color is a nice amber-gold with a fine, cream colored foam that rises quickly and falls slowly. Aromas are heavy with pine, bold citrus fruits, white flower petals, and a grassy punch. Flavor is intense to match. Big flavor impact with grapefruit and a bready mid palate. Finish lingers for minutes with a hop overload. A gripping bitter finish that leaves your cheeks drained of moisture and your tongue yearning for another drop. What a treat. Thanks to yeahnatenelson for a tasty, fresh bottle."

Paired up with some spicey turkey chili as I watched my Nittany Lions go down on New Year's Day.
"A- poured a nice large head that took a while to settle, light golden color, heavy lace."
Pours a golden orange color with a very slight haze to it. An inch of eggshell colored head sits atop and leaves a fair amount of lacing as it slowly fades.
"I can't believe this is my first review of Dreadnaught since I've had it a bunch of times both out of the bottle and on tap. It pours a muddied, murky dark orange with a one finger white foamy head. It smells of subtle citrusy hops, dry, and of sweet malt. The taste is a little piny followed by a good amount of overly sweet malt. I must've grabbed a bottle that had sit for awhile. It drinks both crisp and exceptionally smooth, especially for an IPA. I think that this one is better on tap but it is still pretty good out of a bottle. It's definitely worth trying but I think that Apocalypse Cow is better."

"Poured from bottle into De Dolle tulip. Slightly hazy golden orange with a one finger white head that fades to a collar with excellent lacing. Smell is sweet and fruity hops, pineapple, guava, sweet and buttery malts. Taste is bitter up front, slightly sweet with a touch of fruity hop flavors. After the incredible hop aroma I am slightly disappointed with the lack of complexity in the taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation. A very tasty, albeit very bitter, beer. Not my go to double IPA, but I would never turn one down."
Big Thanks to TCGoalie for bringing this bad boy back from Munster
"A: Pours a clear dark orange color with a one finger head, decent retention. Head is made up of lots of small bubbles. Dissipates to a layer of foam on the top. Very nice sheets of lacing down the sides. "
"Pours an orange-hued amber color. Not much head, retention is average."
"Cracked open a bomber that I had just recently received in a trade. Drank from Duvel tulip. After a rough pour, the beer settled down with a dense finger and a half of frothy eggshell-white foam. The foam settled in somewhat quickly, leaving moderate lacing on the glass. The beer was a honey-copper color, with trace streams of co2 bubbles racing upwards in the glass."

"Bottle via trade with 12many, big thanks Patrick. Clear gold pour, rather thin white head, lots of lacing. Aroma is very citrusy/fruity - pineapples and grapefruit absolutely beautiful nose. Taste is very bitter but is well ""balanced"" by the malty flavors too. Palate is one of this beer's strongest points - Smooth and silky at first - it lets the fruity flavors develop before ending in a well carbonated, dry, hop kick in the mouth finish. I don't like IIPAs very much, but this is a work of art."
Tried this one on a rare beer night tasting with some BA friends during September 2010. Thanks troywhittaker for bring and sharing this rare find for us FL folks.

Dreadnaught poured a more yellow than red shade of amber with a very thick white head that eventually dissipated into a soft cap of foam. Lacing was pretty impressive.
A - Pours a lovely golden straw color with a big foamy head that sticks around. Looks great!
"Three Floyds Dreadnaught IPA is actually a Double IPA and a BA top 20 beer. The beer when opened smells like tearing the rind off of a plump florida grapefruit. The beer is a orange-red amber with a good tuff of soapy white foam that clings and stays. The smell is very fruity with citrus notes as well as other more delicate notes like pear and mango. The beer is enamel stripping bitter and it coats my mouth and tongue like microscopic fiberglass shards. There is plenty of malty caramel sweetness, but it's a bit too much with the clinging bitterness that it makes for an unpleasant aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good with fine, soft carbonation but this is difficult to drink much more than the 7-8 oz pour I got from a bomber split 3 ways."
A- Pours a nice bright orange color with a white head a even lace.

Nice citric combined with piney, bright and floral aromas. Taste just as bold as it smells. Grapefruit, slightly lemony and piney flavors. Bitter dry finish as expected, but leaves you unsettled wanting another sip. Very fresh and"

Orange citrus flavor, lace sticks to the glass nicely. OMG the hops and sweet citrus is a perfect combination. Bitter. Excellent IPA. This is a favorite for me would definitely drink this again."
"A- Pours dark orange/light red color. Thick two-fingered head that last quite awhile in the tulip. Brilliant, slow moving carb bubbles. The lacing is sticky with this one...every sip reveals where the beer has been on your glass with a solid (not broken up) ring around it."
"This beer pours with a surprisingly pale color for the style with almost no head (at least it did in my snifter). A great, dry hoppiness hits you right up front. The finish has some lovely citrus notes with a smoothness you wouldn't expect from a beer with IBU's this high. Three Floyds continues to show their expertise in hoppy beers with this gem."
"brian44556 set me up with this one in a trade we did a few weeks ago. I have heard a lot of good things about Three Floyds, and I have been looking forward to drinking this one."

The beer taste like it smells, with grapefruit, and pineapple. It has a lingering bitter finish. Dreadnaught is full in body, well carbonated, and has a sticky mouthfeel. My expectations for this beer were very high and it fell a bit short."

"A - Bright gold with thick head as white as clouds. The head clings to the glass as if trying to escape from the hops. High carbonation that shows you how active this beer is in smell and taste. An amazing display! To add, the head laces the glass so well, you can see where each previous drink was."
I poured into a pint glass to one finger of off white head. This beer is orange/amber in color. The aroma is wonderful. It is full of tropical and citrus fruits. The taste is full of those fruits as well. The malt balances this beer out. The 9.5 ABV is hidden well. This is a very good beer.

"Bottle. Pours a deep orange amber color with a flufy white, slightly tan head that collars around the glass as it settles. Nice lace forms as the head goes down. A very malty, sweet smelling citrus hop flavor eminates from the nose. Very nice smelling. Tropical fruit type aroma. Nice medium mouthfeel. The taste is sweet upfront with a nice fruity, hoppy flavors that lingers for a while. Very slight alcohol bite at the end. Very easy drinking for being a 9.5%. Really well balanced beer. Totally deserves to be rated as high as it is."
A: A hazy amber hue with orange highlights body and a decent size creamy head that leaves great lacing on the glass.
Thanks Dankbeers619! You are one dirty bastard when it comes to bottle sharing (in an exceptionally good way).
This was a late addition to the tasting lineup as a friend had unexpectedly brought this back from Chicago for Trey. Trey was nice enough to share this with me.

Poured into tulip. Dark golden and very clear. Fluffly white head that sticks around for quite awhile.
Poured into a tulip from a 22oz bomber. 
Pours a hazy golden yellow with slight hues of red and green. I'm guessing the green hue comes from the wealth of dry hopping. 
Served in a stone IPA glass with Real Time playing. The perfect glass and politics to enhance it all...what better setting for my 100th BA review!
Pours a golden-orange hue with a nice foamy white head.
"Slightly hazed, bronzed orange. bottle conditioned. Huge frothy caramel tinted offwhite head. Great retention. Shelves of thick lacing fused together with frosted etched lace."
"Very slightly hazy golden orange pour with a pretty decent sized fluffy off-white head after an aggressive pour from the bomber. The big head didn't really stick around long and there wasn't a tremendous of lacing. The smell is of pine and tropical fruits. There's also a good amount of sweet bready malts noticeable in the aroma. Great hop presence on the tongue. Again, a biting pine with tropical fruits following. The finish is of bitter grapefruit. Pretty good amount of sweetness to balance, but there just wasn't as much bitterness as I was hoping for. I actually thought this was a bit on the weak side for a DIPA. Perhaps I thought this was going to be something it was never intended to be. In any regard it is very good. I've just had other DIPA's that offer a bit more in viscosity and bitterness."
Got this as an extra in a trade. Glad to try it as I've heard good things. 22oz bottle...
"I haven't had this one in a while, but I've had it many times in the past, including on tap at the brewpub."
"First pour is un-impressive. Nice copper color with a real thing white head that fades quick. No - to not much lacing to speak of. Aroma is a little lacking. A little lemon and pine hop aroma meets the nose. Flavor makes up for what the aroma lacks. Good maltyness with a little crystal malt to pop it. Good lemony and pine hop up front and through the middle with a nice lingering bitter finish that lasts. Mouthfeel is a little slick, but still good. I was honestly expecting a lot more from this beer. I had high hopes. I'd give it another try, maybe my bottle was a little old."

"Slightly hazed golden blond body. Generally I look for more of an orangish tint in a DIPA but the color could indicate good things to come (hopefully the crystal malt is not over done). Three finger off white head made up of loosely packed bubbles. Splotchy lacing left as the head recedes at a moderate clip, some rocky foam left floating atop for just a bit longer. "

Impossible to date in a frustrating way bomber into a tulip over time. Say that ten times fast. 
"Big thanks to Lunch for this one! Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Pours a clear yellow orange with a three finger slightly off-white head that subsides to one finger very slowly. Maintains lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of tropical fruit, subtle malt, and nice hops. The flavor is of tropical fruit, malt, and a nice crisp hoppy followthrough with the tropical fruit mixing in with the hop flavor. It has a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this is a very interesting IIPA. All of the characteristics of this one is very nice. The hoppy followthrough isn't as smooth as usually enjoy but it is still not abrasive on the palate though. I can see why this brew gets such awesome reviews..."

"Finally!!! The time has come! I get to try my first TF Dreadnaught! Here it goes... Appearance is a somewhat cloudy orange/golden color with a very beautiful, full frothy white head. I can smell this beer from a couple feet away. The sweet fruits are very strong. I'm getting a TON of orange and tangerine along with a lot of sweet honey. The hops are not very strong in the scent of this beer. I'm also not getting much pine or floral notes in the nose either. Now to taste this bad boy... Wow, My palate gets hit with some very sweet hops at first. Then it moves to the citrus fruitiness of the orange/tangerine. A bit of grapefruit as well. Then I get some sweet honey on the back of my tongue followed by an amazing hop bitterness. This beer has lived up to the hype for me. Absolutely divine! The mouthfeel is the perfect amount of chewiness for an IIPA. The drinkability is scary how high ABV it is. You can't even taste the alcohol until it warms up a bit and toward the end of every sip. Then u get a little warming sensation going down, but I really like that from an IIPA. OUTSTANDING beer! I think I've tried enough Three Floyds beers now to say they are one of my new favorite breweries."
"Thanks Raznug! Psyched for this one! Poured this into a White Birch goblet. Pours a honey amber color with about an inch of white head. It doesn't retain, but great lacing. Smells great, tropical fruits and piney hops are flooding my nostrils. I love all the fruit I can smell, this is very attractive to me. I take my first sip and I'm bombarded with a giant hop flavor! After my taste buds become used to the hops I notice the juiciness. Tropical and citrus fruits all over the place. Great mouthfeel, the carbonation is perfect to bring all the great flavors to life. Easy to drink and very refreshing, regardless of the high abv."

Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Westy chalice.
"A: Pencil thickness of head with minimal head retention, little to no signs of lacing, dark to medium gold in color with slight amber hue - 4.00, S: Intensely resiny and pungent hop aromas, concentrated citrus including grapefruit and significant orange, alcohol is evident, some floral and estery aromas - 5.00, T: The hop bitterness almost brings this beer to the point of puckering though it surprisingly avoids being harsh, thick syrupy rum raising like sweetness, somehow balanced in all of its absurdity, lots of grapefruit and some slight orange - 4.50, M: Medium bodied with some minor viscosity, alcohol provides a slight drying - 4.50, D: All around an excellent example of the style though less of a sipper, I wish availability was a little friendlier as I have only seen this available on a couple of occasions - 4.25"
"A: lovely, bright golden color with a fluffy, 2 finger white head. thick lacing remains on the glass."

"A: A nice pale golden color, with some slight orange hues mixing around in the light, nice white head. "
"Bomber received in a trade, split with cbutova and atremains. Pours coppery orange, small creamy white head. Sticks around decently and leaves some lacing. The scent is great, fruity IPA scents of citrus, lemon, mango, tropical-ness. Taste doesn't match the fruitiness of the nose. At first I get alot of floral notes, citrus, and some pine with a nice caramel malt. More fruitiness comes into play later on with a really great mango taste and tons more citrus. Caramel is a bit part of the taste but hops are definitely king here. Reminds me of 90 min IPA. Mouthfeel is very good, creamy and fluffy with good carbonation. A little booze bite but not much. Very light fruit taste, almost tart, in the finish."
"First beer of the night for an awesome three beer tasting. Thanks to Chico1985 for trading for and sharing this one. Reviewed from last night's notes. Poured out a golden-yellow-orange with a head of about one to two fingers that has decent retention. The head is off-white and looks creamy but a bit bubbly also. Thick lace is left on spots of the glass and a fine cloud of white bubbles is left on top of the beer. Smells of lots of fruit hops (mango, pineapple, orange), citrus peel, some pine and earthy hop notes and a bit of caramel malt. The hops do a good job of fulfilling my needs. I even get some white grape hints. According to a friend's mom, ""it smells like aftershave."" Taste is also good. The hops are more piney and earthy in the taste than in the nose. I get grassy notes as well. The hop bitterness is medium-high and at a level that I enjoy. The white grape juice notes become present at higher levels as well. The fruit/citrus hop notes (mango, lemon, orange) come in bigger as I get further into my glass. The caramel malt rounds out the beer in a nice way. Apple notes even become present at some point. Mouthfeel is moderate bodied with medium level of carbonation. It feels nice for the big flavors. The warmth is of a low level and feels like less than 9.5% ABV. The bitterness lasts long on the palate but at a good IIPA level. The body is moderately creamy but a bit more wouldn't hurt. Drinkability is good. The price ($10) is nice for a huge beer with great flavors and well hidden ABV. The bitterness would get to me after a while but I wouldn't session it anyways. A nice balanced IIPA."
"Hazy amber appearance with a 2 finger white head, which hangs on the glass nicely.Leaves nice lacing. Looks to be will carbonated. The aroma has grapefruit, oranges, pineapple, peach, mango, and pine. Very nice."
What color would you call this? Hazy gold? Light amber? Anyway its pretty. I should paint my bedroom this color. Not too much lacing.
Thanks to Raznug for this bomber. Poured from a bomber into 2 pint glasses.

"On tap at the Three Floyds on 7/21/09. Pours clear light orange/dark gold. Eggshell head. Aroma of pine, lemon and grapefruit. Touch of vanilla on the tongue, then a long bitter finish. Fantastic imperial and the only knock against it is that the alcohol is a bit too heavy and present."
a - hazy orange color with a 2 finger head
"a treasured grant from Peesie, thanks good sir.."
"Three Floyds Dread Naught is a 9.5% Imperial IPA. It pours a hazy golden amber color. It smelled of sweet citrus hops, mango (some got the mango some didn't), caramel, malty and earthy. It tasted more citrus hops than tropical and bitter. It was incredibly smooth for being 9.5% and had a light aftertaste."

"On tap at the brewpub, poured into a half pint glass (uh, how cute)"
When I first got into crafts I always had a hard to rationalizing the price of FFF bombers. I dont know why I just did. I always questioned to whether or not it was worth the price when I could get a 6 pack of alpha king for the same price. This is 100% worth it. I haven't never bought a bomber from FFF and been disappointed.

This beer pours a dark golden color with a white head that laces the glass as it dissipates.
"Pours dark gold with lots of white head. Smells and tastes of pungent grapefruit hops. Plenty of malt behind the hops and quite bitter, as expected. Body is medium with fairly high carbonation. Overall, a pretty good beer, but I probably won't go out of my way to get this again."
Much thanks to sjccmd for this one.
"Picked this up from phaleslu, looking forward to this for some time. Poured a golden amber with a big chunky head. The smell was the best part, big sweet citrusy hops dominated, and kept you going back for more. Taste was also big and hoppy, but seriously, with all the hype, I felt it kind of finished on a thud. Don't get me wrong, this was an ""A"" beer, but I was expecting something more. Mouthfeel was a little light, but overall very drinkable, i'll have another."
"Appearance - Clear, copper pour, two fingers of stiff, khaki color head, lacing aplenty."

"Picked this bottle up towards the end of November on a trip to Chicago, and it has been sitting around since then. I was worried before opening it that the hops might have faded some, however after tasting I'm fairly certain they did not. 22 oz. bottle shared 3 ways, and poured into a tulip. "

"22 oz bottle poured into my Coca Cola bell glass (it's shaped sorta like an imperial pint glass...). Picked up two bottles of this while visiting family in Cincinnati, OH (technically purchased in Bellevue, KY at the Party Source).

Taken from notes
A: 2 fingers head that is white and fluffy - hangs around forever an leaves some lacing along side the glass. Appearance is like dark apple juice. Very easy to see through this brew.
"Copper-orange pour with a small off-white head. Big grapefruit and tropical fruit aroma with a sweet clover honey background. Juicy hop flavor with lots of tropical fruit notes and clover honey lingering on the palate after you swallow. Strong floral and pine notes come out after a few sips. sticky, oily, medium body with lots of carbonation to break it up. The alcohol sticks around on the palate for a while in the aftertaste too."
Pours a light copper color into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass with a full 1 finger of head. Delicate lacing as the beer slinks down the inside of the glass. First aromas are of ripe citrus and herbs.

"Fresh bottle purchased from the FFF brewery. Poured into a goblet and consumed Dec 30, 2009."
Served from a 22oz. bottle acquired in a trade from Dunt (Thanks man!) into my Brooklyn snifter at the appropriate temperature (12/30/09). I have been waiting to get my hands on a bottle of this for some time.
have one of these with a friend about once a month. Of coarse I split a bomber but we usually end up drinking 2 after the first one. Kick ass beer! This is a highly rated beer for good reason.First off is the very clean citrus aroma. Pours a cloudy copper with a small head. This beer taste like a fresh grapefruit with sweet honey overtones and hops. Carbonation is dead on perfect!

Reviewed from notes on 12/19/09
"Made a good appearance, poured a hazy golden hued amber with a small, sticky pale tannish/white head. Had a big tasty hop aroma, a sweet piney and grapefruity, a faded tropical fruitiness and bare whiffs of alcohol. Moderate carbonation and a chewy, creamy medium bodied mouth feel, very good drinkability. Sweet piney at the start, then comes in a sour grapefruity, a gentle rolling hop bitterness in the palate, grainy and buttery malt flavors towards the end and a sweet, puckering piney bitter finish, the alcohol content only makes it's presence known in a slightly burning, lingering bitterness in the aftertaste, a delicious hopped up IPA."
Received in a trade with bulldogp04.
Pours a dark amber body with a rocky off-white head that leaves a crazy amount of lacing behind in the glass. Aromas of dusty caramel malts and muted fleshy fruits. I think this may be an older bottle considering the hops are not as pungent as I would expect from reading other reviews. It has a creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Flavors are sweet malts mixed with subdued hop resins. A bit of an alcohol warmth in the finish. There's a bit of earthy and woody flavors too. I would really like to try this fresh from the tap at the brew house. Maybe some day.

"Got this in trade from my BA buddy Kyle (Mystikyle71). Poured into a Great Lakes Christmas Ale series glass. Poured an amber color with thick pillowy two finger head. Nice sticky head but setteled a little fast. Smell is strong pine hops, some sweet malt, and grapefruit. Taste was everything I had expected. Very strong pine hops balanced by sweet malts, with nice hop bitterness continuing perfectly at the finish. Mouthfeel was thick like I love. Drinkability is very good."
"Big, pillowy white head on top of an amber, semi-cloudy liquid. Leaves gobs of lacing. Smells of citrus and pine hops with a decent dose of sweet, bready malt. A bit of a letdown as the malt seemed to overpower the hops. Taste picks up some of the citrus and breadiness but then turns pretty bitter (it lingers forever too!) and boozy. Smooth, full bodied mouth feel and low carbonation. One of these is plenty for me."
Had a bottle from Archer Liquors.
"Pale golden, hazy, medium white head, moderately active, no lacing. SMELL grapefruity hops, fruity boozy esters, and sweet malt backing. has legs. TASTE smooth and balanced. Big sweet malty base with citrusy and other fruity flavors, some booze, and an assertive but not overwhelming bitterness. FEEL rich, thick viscosity, full bodied, drying bitter finish. OVERALL for hop heads, this one is an easy drinker. But this is definitely a big, bold, strong beer."
"BAM finally get to try this bad boy, and it was worth the wait. First of all I'll thank BUNKYPOP for sending me this all the way from Illinois! Pours a dark gold body, with some cloudy orange properties. Head is just off-white, short lived and medium sized. In the end the head just sorta sat around the edge of the glass. Aromas are a huge blast of hops, citrus (lemon and orange), sweet malty candies, and some grassy notes too. Complex! Taste is like a hops train coming straight for your mouth, and it explodes in your mouth. HUGE HOPS, bitterness, orange peel, candied malts, grainy and grassy, and a slight boozey warmth. Finish is boozey and warming, huge bite in the mouth. Long lasting hoppy aftertaste. Suprisingly smooth and enjoyable for the alcohol content. Awesome and prime example of the style. Well done Three Floyds!"
Thanks to Hayesez for this bottle as an extra. 
Pours a beautiful hazy copper color topped with thin lacy white head. Tropical hop aromas are unique and are very strong. The flavor is sweet and also tropical. Flavors like sweet mangos and peaches flow well with the hop bitterness. The body is deliciously smooth and mildly carbonated to help move the flavors around the palate. Finishes very subtly and smooth into the sweet tropical bitterness.
"This is an IPA like no other. They serve this at 3F in a very small half-pint glass (you don't need more!) and the first thing I noticed was the amazing smell. Very floral with mango and orange. Thin white head with sudsy lacing. Great dark gold color. This beer must be experienced, the taste is phenomenal. Sure it has loads of hops like any IPA, but there is also a strong malt presence that can't be ignored. Sweet, spicy, almost caramely and a finish that just won't let go! This is a beer that epitomizes the ""It's not normal"" image of Three Floyds."
Bottle bought in Madison while on a business trip. Poured into a plastic hotel cup.
"treated myself with this one, has a really great look to it, surprisingly it has a small head, most IPA's have a nice lacy head, this doesn't have a very big head at all. the aroma is great, a hop explosion, but the hops are very floral and almost candy like, its really impressive. the taste is flawless, its incredibly smooth and well balanced, still has a great ipa bite, but it also has a character to it like few other IPA's i've ever had. its just a spetacular beer, mouthfeel is perfect."
A - Hazy orangish amber color with a nice head that dissipated leaving a small amount of lacing.

"22oz bottle. Pours a very cloudy dark orange. Strong bitter and hop taste, tingles on the palate. The very slightest hint of the alc.% tingles on the tongue. Damn tasty though. Very solid beer. Wish I had more access to Three Floyds. Would like to find a fresher bottle too."

This offering was poured into a Unibroue tulip. A nearly clear copper amber color with a beautiful creamy almost butter yellow head sitting atop it. Head craters as it fall creating a miniature mountainous landscape.
Thanks to abbddull for the trade.
Pours a golden copper color with a slight haze. The stark white dense head stays around for a very long time and leaves an incredible amount of think lace and a thick coat.
"So today is my 2nd anniversary of being a BA member. And, it's my 100th review spectacular! I've been saving something great for it. I almost cracked my Westy 12, but decided to save it for an even better occasion, and when I can share it with someone. Got this great gem of a beer from either AgentZero or rjacklin in great trades. Poured this bottle of awesomeness into my oversized DFH snifter."

Celebrating the opening match of Manchester United's Champions League campaign with the much heralded Dreadnaught from FFF Brewery. The 22 ounce bomber poured into the Leffe goblet glass that I recently got off a clearance rack at Whole Foods Market. This bottle of brew set me back $11. Label is a typical crazy looking FFF brew. 
Thanks to iconoklaztor for the opportunity to try this beer. The reputation of this beer is hard to ignore. Pours a clear amber color with one inch of off-white head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Heavy spotty lacing is left on the glass. Slightly sweet aroma before a complex hop profile of citrus and tropical fruit takes over. The flavor is complex as well. Not up to Pliny levels but it is very good. The caramel malt gives just a touch of sweetness but the hops are fully on display with their citrus and fruit notes. I am wavering between 4 and 4.5 because of how hot this beer is. My preference is to have the alcohol a little bit tamer than what is demonstrated with Dreadnaught. The alcohol also hinders drinkability. Medium body with a soft carbonation gives the beer a nice soft texture. The alcohol cleanses the palate and adds warmth.
"On tap at FFF, and then again out of a bomber via trade thanks to dug. Nearly flawless - this and Pliny the Younger are the best examples of this style out there IMO."
"22oz. bomber served into a New Belgium globe glass. I don't know the freshness. Thanks, FernMaster's IL-resident roommate!"
"A - A straight amber brown, with dark red and light yellow highlights depending on how the light is hitting. A white head that disappears quickly. Fairly clear through."

"Dreadnaught pours a deep, reddish auburn color that lights up bright gold when held to the light. The head is thick and sticky looking. Pours a bit syrupy, this is one viscous looking hop bomb."

Exceptional this is a great beer traded by Heliosphann to me.
Poured from the 22oz into a Duvel tulip.
Received in a trade from Beersis81.
Huge thanks to brentk56 for the trade! This is one I've been looking forward to.
"This bottle is a keeper; I don't mean because of the superb taste, but because the artwork is pretty badass as well. I had this from a bottle poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. My roommate and I were already in awe of the beer as it poured, a very light gold mixed with amber that just looked like a beer should. The smell was also something that even my other roommate who is not a fan of IPA's, wanted a taste after smelling. The hops and wheat are noticeable to the nose as well as the present mango and citrus added to the beer. The mango and citrus cut into the hops, preventing it from being to hoppy, but creating a perfect balance in the process. The citrus and hops combine so well that I almost couldn't stop from continually lifting my glass until the bomber was gone. Sometimes IPA's can be difficult to drink because of the presence of hops, to some, but in this beer such a great balance was created that even my roommate who dislikes IPA's enjoyed the taste. It's easily drinkable and delicious. "
"Fresh Bottle bought at the brewery 2 weeks ago at DLD. Poured a dark orange color with a thin white head. Smells like I'm walking in a hop field. I think they should patent this for hop perfume. I'm not sure about mangos and peaches, but I smell hop fields, pine, and some slight sweetness. Has a medium mouthfeel. Tastes like I'm chewing on a sweet resin candy bar. Has a sweet punch in the face pine, gregarious sweet caramel, and spank the monkey finish making me want more. Overall this is a great brew fresh."
I picked this up while in Chicago and love lots of beer from 3 Floyds.

A: Vibrant tangerine with a one finger sized head.
On tap @ the FFF Brewpub on 8/7/09. This was a 10 oz or so pour in a 1/2 pint glass. 
GLASS: Snifter
"This poured a hazy light copper with some off-white head. It smelled like mango and apricot hops, with sweet caramel and honey malt. It tasted like mango and apricot and copper hops, with lots of caramel and some roasted barley malt. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very tasty beer that was clean and balanced. However, the hops seemed a bit faded, which was very disappointing. I enjoyed the malt flavor, but I was hoping for stronger and juicier hops. It still had great body, and it hid the alcohol well, so it was very easy to drink. A generally great beer, but it still didn't live up to the hype. There are definitely better 2IPAs out there."
Poured into Founders Pint Glass
"Well here it is ""the Dreadnaught"". I've been dreaming of sampling this one. It pours a muddy orange amber. A moderate head resides on top of my pint glass. A thick coating of lace covers my glass.. The aroma is like an ocean of hops. So piney and sour smelling. It's an amazing boquet of sour fruit and hop cones. The flavor is huge. A blast of pine and sour then malt smoothness with a touch of alcohol on the finish. This seems like a perfect balance of hop bomb and smooth malt. The medium body with plenty of carbonation to round it out. The high abv is there but fits nicely and makes me feel warm and fuzzy. This is my first IIPA and I must say I'm really starting to enjoy becoming a hop head."
"22oz. Second time trying this delight - first time was a couple of years ago and I was fairly unfamiliar with the style. Pours a bright tangerine-amber color with a relatively thin head with some nice sticky lacing. Aromas are of fresh, sweet pineapple, grapefruit, and orange with a great floral bouquet of hops with a hint of honey. Tastes are bitter up-front, but also sweet with a malty presence. Grapefruit and orange rind with some citric hops and a pleasant piny finish. Some hints of caramel from the malts, but remains bitter on the finish. Mouth-feel is medium bodied with some hop oils that cover the palate nicely. Alcohol is very well concealed. Excellent offering from 3F and I am very satisfied with finally getting a chance to re-try this great IIPA. Solid representation for the style."
"Pours as a hazy copper with the haze settling halfway through. A two finger, off-white head. Aroma is an awesome hops/citrus bomb. Flavor? Wow, I'm surprised, not the overwhelming hop bitterness that the aroma led me to expect. Nice malty sweetness to balance the hops. Grapefruit and something sweet that I can't put my finger on. Feel is a little heavy/oily, pretty thick for this type of beer. Drinkability? I want more, but because of the ABV, I'll have to stick with the bomber I just finished. I have to admit that I've never been a big fan of IPA's, but damn, I've had some great ones in the last two months and I'm becoming a fan."
pours a little cloudy amber golden orange with a big 2+ finger head that left lacing all down the glass
"Got two bombers of this great brew from BitterPachyderm. Thanks again, Mason, for your generosity. Enjoyed in a sniffer. "
Presentation: 22oz bottle into a snifter. No bottling or best by date. 
"Split this with a friend the other night whilst watching TV. Poured a hazy, golden color with white head that faded slowly and left good lacing. Smelled of floral/citrus hops and fruit. Tasted the same, balanced very well with malt. Smooth, yet slightly dry and bitter finish. Packs a punch, but I could have had another one."
Paid a pretty hefty price for this one. It better be worth it!
Received a bottle from VandenBossche last week.
"Thanks to Greg and his brother, who brought down a bottle of Dreadnaught for us to try."
22oz's into a pint glass and then some.
I drank this from a bottle into a chalice.
"We were able to get our hands on this at the Rotten Apple in Grafton, it was a nice cap to a great Sunday afternoon. "
"This is my first encounter with a Three Floyds beer and it's pretty great. It's a big, sweet, citrusy/floral DIPA with good hop resin bite. The beer pours a deep gold with little head but lots of lacing. The smell is thick with clementines, limes and floral hops. The flavor is similarly great. The hop flavor is very strong nearly to the point of having a solvent character. The malt is still quite sweet adding an excellent caramel character. The hops taste strongly of oranges, sweet and citric. The defining characteristic with DIPAs for me is the bitterness level and Dreadnaught is within the optimum range for me. The mouthfeel is oily and thick without being cloying. The drinkability is very high despite the fairly high alcohol level."
This is a great DIPA. Competes with the best. 
"bought a bomber of this and it poured a peach orange color with a nice retaining head and sticky lacing the smell was grapefruit and mango and hops and sweet caramel malt... b4 my first sip i already knew it was going to be outstanding i could smell it 2 feet away from me... yep the grapefruit and mango explode in your mouth and nose the hops hit your tongue your mouth puckers you just want another sip fast wow!! the taste is outstanding..its a perfectly balanced dipa that is so well balanced i cant believe its 9.5 abv ..you taste no alcohol just a perfect hop/malt creation of goodness.. this one ranks up their with double trouble, pliney, hop stoopid and hopslam as the best a dipa can be.. only drawback is you drink it to fast and its very pricey.. however it is a must try highly recommended and will drink this anytime anywhere..oh crap my bomber is gone .."
"Since FFF is not distributed in OH, I was thrilled to find this when I drove to IN to pick up some brews. "
"Poured a Super hazy as fuck orange gold. The off white head is frothy, creamy and smooth. Aroma is fairly hoppy with a nice hint of peach. There is a tad bit of pine and lots of citrus. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. This is similar to many other awesome IPAs that i have had except for the slight hint of peach/apricot flavor. Feel is tingly from the carbonation and slightly oily. Super drinkable."
Poured from a bomber into my caracole snifter
What a looker. I can almost taste this one just looking at it. The color is a glowing orange with a little bit of haze. It looks like freshly squeezed fruit juice of some kind. The head is huge and fluffy and the lacing is insane. After a few minutes the head dissapears but you'd barely know it from viewing it from the side because of all the lacing stuck on it. 
"Pours a very orange hued amber color with a nice firm, bright white head that slowly dissipates. Moderate visible carbonation."
"Dreadnaught is easily one of the highest rated Imperial IPAs out there. Three Floyds almost never disappoints, so this beer has big shoes to fill. Here is my review:"
This pours a magnificent hazy amber with a foamy head of about a half inch poured into my mug
"Pours a very pale orange, almost a dark straw yellow type color. Kind of light, it's fairly clear, with a bit of haze, on the second pour, I could watch a little cascade of haze fall through the beer. Really a beautiful sight. The head is massive, and pillowy, it looks loose, but it has incredible retention, and leaves some decent lacing. This one looks like PTE, it's a little paler than you'd like, but stands up perfectly in the other categories. The smell doesn't jump up immediately and punch you in the face. I could actually smell it, in brief intervals, at a distance, before I even tried, but it's not as powerful as some. The smell is very pungent. There's a leafy kind of spiciness, resting on top of some smells of tart fruits, maybe a bit of tropical fruits. Very little resinous smells, but there is a bit of citrus, like orange and maybe a bit of sweet grapefruit. The maltiness is slightly crackery and subdued, which is a good sign, it means this is fresh. The taste comes off upfront with a kind of sweet, powdery maltiness with a thick layer of grassy, almost herbal hops. Then comes the fruit, something is almost like biting into a young peach or plum, or maybe a juicy tart cherry. Really pleasant and great. The bitterness is subdued, but it comes in little bursts, along with some resins, and some citrus peel kind of feeling. The leafiness of the hops is really a great introduction to the ultimate taste, it kind of draws you in, then seems like something familiar, the turns to something altogether unfamiliar, it comes out punching, with the fruitiness, which is out of the ordinary, I mean, you can find it in other DIPAs, but a lot of times its battling with either bready malts, or really piney, grassy hops, but the fruitiness comes off alone here. Really interesting and wonderful. I'm really loving it more as I get into it. The body is perfect, the perfect balance between dry and sweet, it's a bit full, you know, with some nice sweetness and some hoppy resins, but it stays dry enough to keep you diving back in for another drink. This is definitely a bit more full than it appears. The carbonation is light, there's a nice tickle, and it keeps it lively without stinging. Nice. And overall, this is a brilliant beer. I mean, I could really see myself drinking this every day if I had the opportunity. If you ever get a shot to try it, and try it fresh, I would recommend it without hesitation. Really a standout DIPA."
"Poured from the bottle at cellar temp ~50 degrees. A good 2 finger head the color of ripe apricots hung around while I drank from my snifter. A very intense smell of flowering orange trees, and grapefruit zest explodes immediately upon pouring. The major flavors are lemon peel, grapefruit and hops, hops, hops! The taste is complex beginning with an initial rush of cirtrus and quickly becomming a very smooth pine-y American-hops taste. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth which lends to the easy drinkability. The flavors work exceptionally well together; I think the bitterness will please any Imperial IPA drinker, and the smooth richness will attract most others!"
"Fresh from the brewery. Pours deep gold with only a slight veil. Three fingers of resilient head developed with a standard down-the-middle pour. The smell is mostly on the fruit side of the hop family: peach, lemon peel and pineapple, with a little bit of pine and carmel underneath to round things out. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with medium carbonation. The taste leads with a hop uppercut that should please any DIPA devotee: orange and mango make an appearance but pine is much more present in the taste than the smell would suggest. About halfway through a sip, the beer takes a brief malt break, giving you a nice taste of carmel to balance things out before the finale. The finish is classic for the style: prolonged, full-flavored bitterness with complex citrus accompanyment. A standout DIPA that demonstrates everything that hops can do. Pairs well with a spicy mole or rich BBQ pulled pork."
A- Pours the standard light caramel-golden color with about an inch of sandy head. Laces very nicely.
22oz bottle poured into a Portsmouth goblet. Received in trade from rlcnmeyer - Thanks! I see no sign of a date or freshness code on the bottle.
Bombers purchased at brewery during DLD09.
I picked up a Bomber over the weekend.... Very excited to try it.
Big thanks to bulletrain76 for sharing.
Thanks to straffordmilitia for sharing this bottle with me.
"22oz bottle. Honey-orange color with a medium white head that sticks to glass. Very nice aroma that is a showcase of fruity citrus like orange, grapefruit, and tangerine. all enhanced by a sweet maltiness. The flavor has tons of juicy hops that burst with grapefruit and tangerine. There is a big malt body that is on the sweet side, but a massive bitterness perfectly balances it. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Malty, but in a way that enhances the hops instead of takes away from them. I was worried that I might not get a fresh bottle, but this seems pretty spot on as to what I was expecting. Maybe not the freshest, but hardly worse for wear. For how much hop goodness this exudes, the balance is spot on."
"Appearance: Comes off the pour somewhat viscous in appearance. Color is golden with tones of honey, and the carbonation shows moderately throughout. Head is a well-retained white and thick 1/2 finger skim that leaves behind tons of bubbly, sticky lacing."
"Intense citrus hop aroma. Grapefruit aromas combined with some malty sweetness. Poured amber with huge off-white head with good retention. Malt flavors slightly dominate with hop bitterness right behind. A big malty beer with lots of hops (100IBU). Medium bodied with a dry finish; no lingering bitterness here. This is similar to the Apocolypse Cow, less the lactose milk sugar. A VERY GOOD Imperial IPA."
Poured In: Tulip Glass
"Thanks to Kels for bringing this back from a recent trip to Indy. A very nice IIPA. The bottle says there are elements of peach and mango, and while I did not necessarily get those in my tasting of it, it was definitely a bit of a hop bomb that provided a ton of citrus."
"Bottle received from akokandy in a recent trade. Thanks so much, Adam! "
thanks to natasharai for the trade.
"My second FFF offering, and it's breaking in the brand new Duvel tulip (thanks to the lady friend for the awesome gift). While the label isn't as terrible as the Alpha King one, it's still pretty lousy."
Buddy brought this over today.
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. Poured a really nice orange color almost an orange yellow color with about a one finger head with ok retention. Leaves lacing down the glass. Smell is really good. Hops, fruit, grapefruit, citrus, and a bit of some piney smells come through. Really nice aroma. Taste wise is very similar, grapefruit and hops are pretty apparent. Kind of piney but not much and citrus. Surprisingly not very bitter if any at all, goes down really smooth. All I can say is it taste awesome. Has a real nice mouthfeel too. Overall a great IPA, probably would go up there with one of the best I've had yet. This was my first time drinking this one and it definitely wont' be the last."
Got this brew via trade with Chrizzle. My first completed trade.
"Appearance: Bright Yellow, Light white head"
Chilled bomber into a glass. Courtesy of a trade with Hexxed. Thanks!
A- dark golden moving into the amber range depending on the lighting. soft white head that hangs around for a little bit. nothing too special here.
"Paid $9.49 for a bomber from Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, WI."
Solid one finger beige head atop an orange-tangerine haze. A bit of sheet lacing and wispy retention. 
"Served from a bomber, poured into a pint glass..."
"I've had a few bottles of Dreadnaught in the past, but they've never tasted fresh, and I've always been disappointed. The freshness issue seems to be a common one with Dreadnaught, and it's one that could be resolved with the use of bottle dating. Anyway, this is a review and not a discussion about that. A trading partner recently picked this up from the brewery and I do believe this one will be fresh. Thanks a lot Deuane."
"Thanks to BitterPachyderm for this bomber, poured into an oversized snifter."
So we finally rented our condo after many months of stress so we decided to celebrate and what better way than with my first taste of a 3F which is a fresh Dreadnaught courtesy of MasterSki. Shared with my wife.
Pours a very clear crisp orange/maybe copper color. It's got well-bodied cream/off-white head.
Thanks to Yetiman420 for his generosity; a truly great BA. Split the bomber with a friend and poured my half into my Duvel Tulip glass.
"A - Cloudy dark orange/light brown with a white head, retains well. Average lacing."
This will be the third time I've had this. Bottle thanks to dug this time.
"A: Yellow side of amber. Two fingers of foamy head that reduces to a ring around the glass, leaving a nice bit of lace."
Man this stuff is good!
Thanks to my lovely fiancee for picking me up a bottle from the newest batch.
In a snifter:
"22 ounce bomber bottle split with psycohops. Poured into my One Guy shaker glass. Appears a cloudy deep apricot color with a full three fingers of super dense and creamy light ecru colored foam. A thick, sticky lacing is spackled to the inside of my glass as I sip my way to the bottom. Smell is full of citrus and tropical fruits such as orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and caramelized malts. Tastes of apricots, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, resinous pine, all soaked in rich caramel. Alcohol? None to be found here. Rich and full bodied with medium carbonation. Great stuff!"
Pours a beautiful dull gold color with a slightly glowing haze. A white one-finger head quickly dissipates leaving thick heavy lacing. Smells of biting citrusy hops. First sip is all creamy grapefruit-citrusy hops. Super balanced with a huge sweet malt backbone to match the massive spicy and tangy hops. Creamy mouthfeel and perfectly carbonated. Does it get better than this?
Bottle courtasy of buckeysox!
A - Pours a big 2 fingers of fluffy off-white head. It sticks around for a long time and leaves tons of sticky lacing on the inside of the glass. The beer is a nice orange-amber color
Poured from a bomber at room temperature. Distinct copper-orange with a moderate white head.
"Drank this while listening to Bill Callahan's album, ""Sometimes I Wish I Were An Eagle."""
"A -Hazy orange copper with a thick off-white head that held on strong and left lots of thick, clumping lace. "
Bottle into red wine glass - big thanks to Dev (buckeyesox) for this one.
Lugged this one home in a checked bag. Happy to give it a try. 
Acquired via trade from alleykatking...thanks Josh! 650ml bottle poured into a snifter. No bottling info or abv info is given.
"22 oz bomber thanks to the great spointon for a crack at this brew. I have heard a lot about this brew and all has been good, so why not give it a shot. The artwork is crazy in typical FFF fashion. Served this one up in my shaped DFH pint glass. "
Poured from a 1 pint 6 oz amber bottle.
Appearance: This beer is a deep amber color with a bit of red thrown in. Not a lot of head as you pour. Thin white patchy head and a nice glob of lacing that sticks to the side of the glass when you take a swig.
"This was my least favorite of the Three Floyds I've had. It's got a very nice citrusy aroma but the flavor doesn't hold up to other DIPAs I've had. Had a pretty malty flavor and mouthfeel, more than I'm looking for in this style. Still decent but not really my thing."
"22oz bomber, capped off our night of tasting Three Floyds beer, thanks to alleykatking. Vibrant hazed orange, thick head, nice lacing. There's really a lot going on with this beer. Yes, hops a' plenty in the nose and up front in the taste, fruity and floral, but there's a huge sweet malt character to this beer as well. It almost takes over for the hops, providing a sweet creaminess under the hops. Almost like vanilla ice cream. The flavors really battle each other here a bit, and I'm not sure if I could say this beer is well balanced, but it makes for an interesting brew, and a nice change next to the many super piney IPAs out there. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. A little hot perhaps, but this is a great beer. Unique for the style, and that's always a plus in my book."
I received this bottle in a trade from alleykatking. Thanks Josh!
Bomber into AB tulip. Thanks abbddull for the awesome trade!
A: Pours a beautiful dark orange with golden hues and a huge frothy white head. Nice lacing. Good looking beer
"Love this beer. On tap @ FFF's. Pours medium-dark orange in color with a white head. Smells fruity/citrus with a good amount of hops. Right off the bat, you are hit over the head with that wonderful hoppy taste and a slight amount of citrus taste. Soooo fresh! Good mouthfeel, medium carbonation, very clean finish. This beer beats the crap out of your taste buds so 1 bomber or a couple of tulips towards the end of the night is a good idea."
Thanks to keithricker for this one in a trade. I've been looking forward to trying this for a while. 
A: Pours a bright copper color with a one inch fluffy white head that leaves just the right amount of lacing in the glass. 
"An absolutely beautiful Dark orange, or amber color with a big white fluffy head that stuck around for a short while. "
"Beautiful beer. Nice amber color with fluffy white head floaty on top. Strong scents of grapefruit/pineapple/pine coming off of this. The taste has quite a strong hop profile, dries the mouth out a bit. Wonderful grapefruit aftertaste, slight sweetness mid-profile. Surprisingly light mouthfeel for an almost 10% DIPA. Wonderfully drinkable. Awesome DIPA."
A= Great translucent amber color with a small head that is dense and leaves some spotty lacing. The head lasts throughout the entire drink surprisingly.
"So, yeah, hey, I really liked this right off the bat. The color is a bit light (way light) and the head? What head? But it smells good and tastes good. Of course, then I thought about it for a couple of seconds. Right. Of course I like this right off - it tastes really familiar... Why, it's just like a Cascazilla! I ran down to the local store and grabbed one - to compare. So, here's the deal... The dreadnaught is like cascazilla with a little HSA thrown in (for a little more body and a bit of diacetyl). Well, and the color is a little lighter than the cascazilla, too."
"Pours incredibly clear, a nice amber color. This is only my second beer from FFF, both have been crystal clear."
I finally got my hands on one of these thanks to my sister taking a recent trip to Chicago.
22 oz bottle purchased for me by a friend at Keg Liquors in Indiana. Poured into a Duvel Tulip.
Got a bottle from Jeager. Thanks man.
"YAY my 200's Review, I have drank a few of these bottle already and I might as well get around to reviewing it :) "
22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass. 
22 oz. into a snifter/ no freshness date
Poured from a bottle into an imperial pint.
"I had the honor of tasting two different releases of Dreadnaught, and this tasting was a major event in my brew-education (not quite as brutal a lesson as the night I discovered that 5 green flashes after several other beers on an empty stomach may in fact cause sever hangover-like symptoms...respect beer indeed!)."
Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. It pours a nice copper color. A 1/2 inch off-white head forms and quickly reduces to a thin lacing. No sediment and minimal visible carbonation.
"Pours a brownish copper color with very thin white head into a Courtyard by Marriott plastic, waxy white hotel guest cup. "
Big thanks to Masterski for providing this in a recent trade. Alex is an excellent trader and a man of his word.
"Got this in a trade with fogdog. Kevin, you rock!"
Acquired via trade from Chicago. Thanks again rudylaw
Poured from a 22 ounce bottle courtesy of Perry's in Livermore...Poured a nice dark golden and clear color with an average head and lacing. A sweet and fruity scent up front with the hop scent coming towards the end. Taste is very balanced...may be the best balance of malt to hops I've ever tasted. A very nice citrus flavor with the sweet malt flavor can't get any better. Overall one of the best Imperials that I've had to date.
"A: Cloudy amber appearance with a bit of white head, some lacing."
"The aroma is very nice with pine, citrus, flowers, mango, peach, and caramel. The appearance is hazy amber with an average head for the style. The flavor is like the aroma with a very bitter finish. The palate is typical for the style. Overall this is a decent beer but overrated."
22 oz. (older label?) courtesy of macdomer into a Mason jar. Great extra - thanks Ian!
"A nice cloudy amber color pour with a thick white fluffy head that hangs around a while,lots of nice lacing left all the way down the glass. Aroma of hops,resin, high alpha hops such as citrus, peach, melon,and pine,with some sweet malty notes coming through.Flavor is awesome very fat and hoppy,you can feel the bitterness in your cheeks,piny,fruity hops and a nice sweet caramel,toffee malt backbone to balance things out. Very smooth mouthfeel,a little sticky. Nice bitter hop finish and just slightly boozy. Top shelf stuff for sure, one of my new favorites."
"This beer is definitely one to admire: a very pretty copper orange; the head wasn't quite as full as I had pictured, but it stuck around for a while and left some incredible lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell was similar to that of other DIPAs: fruity, piney, wonderful... no other style can compete for my nose's admiration. The taste was... a bit like most other IPAs -- which is to say wonderful, but this one was a bit underwhelming for what I had looked forward to. Perhaps it was what everyone had built it up to be, but this one didn't strike me as any more challenging or enjoyable than Stone's run-of-the-mill IPAs or equally hoppy Southern California IPAs. Still, a very enjoyable brew. The 9.5% a.b.v. snuck up more than I had expected it to."
Grabbed a new bottle hot of the line - they seem to have updated the label. Served in my Kuhnhenn tulip glass.
Poured from a bomber into a pint glass.
"Orange center with pineapple edges, small off-white head, decent lacing. Very nice pine citrus aroma, and a good sweet backbone in the back end of the nose. Taste follows the nose. Mostly piney hops, but plenty of citrus mixed in, lots of tropical fruits, some grapefruit and orange peel. The malt is there, but the hops are the main player in this one. Thick, juicy, delicious. An excellent DIPA. Leaves the tongue numb by the end of the bomber and that will conclude this evening's tastings."
"A friend happened to have a number of these and was kind enough to share with us, thanks Tommy. Pours a very hazy burnt orange color. A foamy 2 finger head lingered for some time. It is definitely a different looking beer than i expected. The smell is an overwhelming hops punch, with some sweet citrus and pine hints in the far background. Taste follows through on the promise of the smell, as this is a very hoppy ale. There is a far greater sweet malt backbone that helps balance out all those hops. This makes for a unique, and good, sweet/bitter mix. I really like the taste. The brew itself is a little thick for the style, and therefore slightly less drinkable than a number of other DIPAs. Still a great brew."
Appearance: Poured with 1cm bubbly off white head that dissipated over ~3 minutes to a rim around the top leaving almost no lacing. The beer is a clear orange golden color. 
Consumed on 2/14/09
A- Golden orange color with some red hues. Small head that dissipates quickly leaving little lacing. 
Poured from bomber to 20oz snifter.
A: Slightly hazy bright amber/orange color. Poured a 2 finger off-white head with fair retention. Ample lacing in globby rings that developed some short fingers waching down the glass. Decanted continually.
POured a golden yellow with a big head. SMelled piney and grapefruit and some grass clippings. Taste didn't do it for me at all. So sweet and syrupy it was way too much for me. Mouthfeel was average with just an overabundance of bitterness. Drinkability was low for me too sweet with no balance. Would like to try again because Im so far off of what most others are saying. Severely dissapointing!
A: Dark orangey-amber like body. Thick and hazy.. Huge offwhite head. Great retention. Lovely lacing.
22 oz bottle poured into brooklyn tall stemware. Big thanks to cari at Kahn's in indiana for helping put together my package!
Traveled up to Munster this weekend to visit the old Three Floyds brewery...love this place.
"Bottle. Pours a copper color, fluffy off-white head that stuck around for awhile. Aroma is hops and citrus. Hoppy, pine - citrus flavor, couldn't really detect the Mango and Peach flavors, oh well. Finish is nice bitter and drying. Very good beer, lived up to the hype."
22oz bomber received as an extra from a generous trader. Thanks for the opportunity! 
"Finally was able to score a bottle of Dreadnaught through a trade. The brew pours a dark orange amber with a humongous, foamy, off-white head. Honey-caramel sweet aroma with some dried apricot. Grassy/pine/citrus hops aroma. Light-medium bodied brew with a slightly slick texture. The beer starts off with a juicy fruit flavor with flavors of honey and apricots. Juicy hops flavors, citrus, grassy, herbal. The sweetness is then balanced by a palate-shattering bitterness as the beer finishes with an aggressive, earthy-pine, bitter dryness. I'm guessing Amarillo and Chinook hops might be used in here somewhere. This beer is very good, very complex as it's initial sweetness and bitter finish are polar opposites. Extreme bitterness slows the tempo on this one and the ABV is felt half way through the 22 oz. bottle. I'm glad to have had the chance to try this one."
Thank you to stfun37 for this one.
I love this beer and I drink it on a regular basis on tap at the brewpub and out of the bottle. This makes it very hard for me to give an accurate review... but I must try.
A - Pours a great amber color that produced a white head and retained ok and left a great lacing around the glass
"Appearance: Straw-golden-orange-yellow, nice big head and good lacing."
"Genuine amber with a white head that settles to a ring in a jiffy. Given the style, you know you're gonna be balls to the walls with lacing."
"Appearance: Slightly hazy amber color with thin white head that quickly fades to pond scum (and I mean that in the best way). There is carbonation rising up from the bottom of the glass. There is nice, intricate lacing left on my glass."
Great beer thanks to Slater1313!!! Wanted this one for a while!!
"Aroma: Clean, balanced hop aroma with some alcoholic aroma. The aroma was strong full when I initially open poured my beer, but it quickly dissipated."
"Appearance - Certainly passes the eyeball test. Almost a deep orange with some gold highlights shining through. Head is a very gentle layer of off whiteness, that fades into a white ring with tiny retreating trails of lace."
"Poured a nice deep copper color with a white foamy ring around the edges. It left nice lacing around the rim. The nose is perfect hop deliciousness. Nice pine and citrus hops with a slight twinge of malt at the end. The taste is not quite what you would expect from the nose. The bitter hops are the forfront of the berr mixed in with some slight malts. I was expecting to have a bit more sweet taste then bitter. It's very interesting but not what the smell leads you to. The mouthfeel is low carbonation and a slight oily feel down the throat. Overall this is a great dipa. Its on par with some of three floyds best beers. If you love hops, and can actually obtain this, try it out!"
22oz bottle poured into a snifter. 
appearance- pours a medium dark amber with a thick cream colored head. good lace
Thank you again Scubarex for this fantastic brew in my SS BIF box
"I just got this in a trade, really nice to come home to a bunch of east coast beer I cannot get on the west coast. "
Pours a medium orange-amber color and clear. Nice 3cm white head.
"Pours an amber color with a 2-finger, cream colored head, that recedes to a thick layer with moderate lacing."
Thanks to Tattorso for this!
"Bomber through a trade, big thanks to crazynelson. I think this bomber was much more fresh compared to the few that I had about a year ago. Only had on draft once at the gabf in 2008. Never makes it to philly. "
Tap at brewpub.
"Lucky find at Kenny Road Market.. Got to talking with the store clerk and was fortunate enough to be on his good side that day, as he whipped one out from the back for me."
Big thanks goes out to jac5084 for splitting this. Poured into my flute glass...
A light copper bubbly ale with a mass of white fluffy foam for a head. Bubbles are big and brisk but unable to strike down that head. The beer is flawlessly clear. The head sticks and clings to the glass as you drink. A beautiful aromatic blend of citrus and pine hops aroma with just the slightest hint of sticky resinous hops. Malt sweetness is palpable but subdued compared to the hops aroma. Could use a touch more vibrant citrus aroma to put it a bit more over the top and earn the 5 for smell. The creamy rich caramel malts combine with a bread crust heartiness to prepare the palate for the bitterness to come. The hops flavors are bold and crisp and cling to the palate as the beer passes to the stomach. The bitterness slowly fades but is never excessive or harsh. A citrus hops flavor remains on the lips once the bitterness has subsided. Would be perfect if there was just a hint of hops flavor up front to accompany the malt. Medium to Heavy body. Carbonation is enough to buoy the head and eject the hops' aromatics into the air but not too much to be gassy. Rich creamy and superb. This is an absolute must for all hop heads.
Shared a 22oz with my brother in law on Christmas Eve. 
a: off-white frothy head fades quickly but leaves a thin sheet of lace; clear amber body
"Reviewed on 8/10/08. #400!! Bottle. Pours a deep orange with hardly any head. Aroma is very citrusy, some grapefruit, iced tead and some sweet malts sneak in. Flavor is very sweet, lots of iced tea and citrus. Not as bitter as I was expecting. Quite drinkable for a 9.5%. Just a little too sweet for me. This is a good IIPA, but not my favorite, and there are plenty better. "
"this might get deleted for not being descriptive enough, but this beer is the bomb.... so legit i love it try it drink and then drink it again"
"Had the pleasure of going to Three Floyds today with my buddy Brian. Food was good, server was real nice and it was an enjoyable afternoon. I had the Dreadnaught on-tap in a half pint glass - as the brewmaster suggets."
"Pours a nice coppery orange, vigorous pour produces an 1/2"" off white head that leaves beautiful lacing, ok head retention."
"Pours a decent copper-orange color with a bit of initial head and a bit of lacing, but not much on either end. Nice scent, good hop characteristics, floral mostly, hints of citrus (but not much), and a very strong maple aroma. Good hop taste, almost over the top, but not for the style, almost a malt balance, with a large maple syrup aftertaste. Goes down fine, a bit thick, but almost no (bad) alcohol taste, nice considering it's almost 10%."
Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a quarter inch slightly yellowed head on top. Decent retention and some nice lacing.
Dusty orange in color this beer is one step away from being hazy. The head looks like raw unbleached wool. Nice retention and good lacing. I have to admit that this one looks like a beer I would want to try. But then again what beer doesn't look like that?
A: A dark orange/amber color with a white lace head. Not a ton of carbonation
"Slight haze, orange to light amber color, with thin wispy head."
"I've been saving this bottle since our early September visit to Three Floyds. 22 oz, poured in two portions over the course of an hour into a large snifter."
A_Pours a medium brown with hints of orange. A one finger head collapses quickly into a wisp of a cap. 
"Picked up this bomber from West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, IL."
scored this from a undisclosed location with one of my good ole beer buddies. who's name starts with a v and ends with a bitch...ok maybe not...ok...it was victor. any hooters. 
"Thanks for this, crazynelson."
"First off, I'm just happy to have Three Floyds back in Wisconsin. I won't take you for granted this time baby, I swear! On to it then..."
12/19/08 - Update
"Bright clear orange pour. Thin swirling lace. Huge pineapple and mango aroma's. Some ethanol and sweet candied malt aroma's there backing up the tropical fruits. Huge tropical hop flavors smake the tongue into submission, then on come some sweet malts but they only temper the enormous oily hop flavors. Alcohol leaves a small amount of warmth on the palate. Thick and boaderline syrupy. This one begs to be enjoyed slowly. World class double Ipa."
22oz bomber poured into a tulip pint.
"This pours a orangish brown with a silky tan head. The nose has fresh citrus fruits, bitter floral hops and pine over a bed of sweet candy malts. The taste is a perfect blend of tart citrus, big flowery hops and rich caramel malts. Medium body is delicately carbonated. Crisp and refreshing yet thick and creamy. This is a very well balanced IPA from Three Floyds. Top knotch."
"Ar - Smells just like a fresh bowl of hops, sweet, grassy, citrus. Pleasant, floral, with an herbal mint leaf quality, but in sum I can't say greatly out of characteristic of many others of same style. (4)"
"Got a 22oz bomber, thanks to a trade with pantanap on rate beer. I've heard good things and was really looking forward to this!"
A : Pours a nice golden color without much head
Poured out of a 22 oz. bomber into a snifter.
"Bit of a white whale for me, been pursuing for a while and finally got it in my fridge and finally busted it out last night and shared with a buddy."
22oz. bomber 
"Poured into pint glass. Murky copper bronze, nice unfiltered look. Not much head for a hard pour. No lacing."
"Thanks to ThirstyBird for sharing this one. Poured a yellow-gold; translucent with a quarter inch white head. Nose is big, bold grapefruit with a sweet quality behind it. Taste follows nose - floral and piny with a citrus astringency and a lightly lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied with an even level of sparkling effervescence in the background. Incredibly well-balanced and drinkable. I'm not usually a fan of IPAs, but I'm quickly falling in love with the DIPA style."
Got this in the Comic Book BIF from SirSketch!!
Thanks to unclejedi for this beer.
"Impressive brew, not as aromatic or full bodied and texture, and the finish was Ok. But very complex and interesting from the 1st taste. Hops are complex, a friend said ""Stone IPA"", which isn't a bad thing. Bottled seemed fresh. I have several more and look forward to trying again and again as this brew isn't around So Cal. Alc above 9% wasn't noticable, well on the palate that is!"
"got this one courtesy of a trade with TheodorHerzl, and then shared with CrellMoset and dkachur..."
Drank from a 1 PINT 6 FL OZ/22 FL OZ/650 ML bottle
A - seriously orangish amber and hazy
"Pours a fogged brown/orange/slightly gold thing. Decent creme head. Nose is a citrus earthy thing. Flavor is fully on the earthy side. Touches of caramel. Loads of malt. Theres that muddy earthy thing I really like. I'd say this was really damn good on the flavor, but... Too much noticed alcohol. It doesn't blend enough IMO at first at least. Seem to get used to it eventually though and what's left is a nice earthy, full double ipa. Good carbonation and a nice liquid feel. A really smooth example of the style. Calm the booze down and there's really no need or improvement."
"poured from a bottle. deep orange in color with off white head, slight lacing. smells were very citrus, slight pine. taste was malty with big hop bitterness. slight sweetness through out. carbonation was medium and perfect. overall i was impressed although the price is high at $12. thats almost 3 bottles of pliny which STILL reigns king of the DIPA. If these were $5 and under i'd drink the hell out of them. overall a great DIPA."
"Thanks to moose3285 for sending this along, I've been looking forward to trying it."
"After having this brew several times in the past year thought I should put a rating in for this fabulous IPA. 22oz bomber pours a hazy, dark coppery color with thin white foam that left a small amount of lace. Aroma had hints of resinous pine, lush citrus fruits, and sweet malts. The carbonation is low to medium & the body is full. The taste is a balanced mouthful of a creamy, malty, sweet finish, along with an unbelievable, intense hoppy flavor and bitterness equaled by the intensity of the richness of full bodied mega malt. This definitely is one of the best IPA's I have to date. I could drink this stuff all night!!"
A - Orangish brown with thin head that quickly fades away. Leaves very good lacing.
Of course I'm excited to try a DIPA from the BA Top 100. Even more so with one that is pretty scarce in these parts. Here goes....
22oz bottle that OHLRangers picked up for me at the brewpub recently. My previous bottle (review below) was about 6 months old and I'm re-reviewing it to reflect the fresh bottle I have. Into my Duvel tulip
22oz bomber poured into oversized wine glass
"Since today is my birthday I decided to celebrate by cracking open something special. I received this in a trade from bakerslp, and have been very much looking forward to it ever since. I poured the 22oz. bomber into a Duvel tulip glass to get as much nuance as I can from this highly-hyped beer."
"Had this on tap at the brew pub. Appearance is golden with thin head. Was served in a small glass. Wonderful hoppy aroma. Clarity reminded me of whisky for some reason. Head was thin. Tasted very bitter with a touch of peach. Packs a real kick but doesn't taste strong. Was served a fairly warm temperature, which I normally don't like, but was wonderful in this instance."
A: This beer poured a cloudy brown/orange with a quickly falling head.
"WOW! Deep hazy orange, creamy white head. Nose is full of sticky sweet pine, grapefruit, caramel and a hint of apricot. Flavor is an intense hoppy bitterness with a sweet rich malty backbone for balance. WOW! Full bodied, soft carbonation, smooth, bitter-sweet dry finish. Now I know what all the fuss was about."
Got this bad-boy as an extra from Jeager.
Dread not. Pour is a mostly cloudy golden color with a slight orange-yellow hue through out. A little help with the pour provided a think soft whit head. Guess it didn't need help. Great retention and lacing through out.
Served cool in a Boston lager glass from a brown bomber.
"Had this the same day that I had a fresh ""Pliny the Elder""; so it may have been a little unfair to judge this beer. Especially since I got it in a trade and may have lost some of it's freshness due to aging."
A- hazy golden orange with a good sized off white head
been waiting to try this bad boy for a while! unfortunately i had about five big IPA's before this one so i was a little blurry....
"Sampled on tap at the Map Room and served in a combo of a flute and tulip glass, I don't think there is a name for it here at the moment."
"22 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Purchased at Mustard Seed Market in Akron a few months ago. Was told it was from a fresh shipment, we will see..."
"Got this from a trade with Beereality, much obliged."
"A: dark amber in color with a moderate orange haze. decent head that disappears pretty quickly, although it does thickly line the glass near the top and provide for some uniquely intricate lacing."
"A- Nice clear copper color. Very little head, just a slight bit of white foam."
"Bottle at Coles. Glowing orange beer with almost no head. Aroma is very spicy grapefruit, a bit of pine and some mango. After the first sip I just get all grapefruit. Bitter and sharp but juicy. This is an easy drinking DIPA but its not as complex as the Alpha King."
"Got a bomber from my mellow my man hopflop as a groomsman gift (this dude is really the man--he gave us bells, three floyds, and the brooklyn brewery brewmaster's book about beer with food). "
This beer was tasted from the 22oz bottle in my 22oz Terrapin Snifter.
Pours a light red color with a slight haze in it. There is a great amount of carbonation that creates a good thick head with a very nice retention.
Poured from 22 oz. bomber into a snifter.
"This beer simply screams technical perfection. It is balanced, refreshing, and fun to drink. Why, though, don't I find it more exciting?"
A- Pours a translucent copper color with a thick beige head that recedes into heavy lacing
"i've been starting to become wary of beers that have tthese litle cult followings, but three floyds is a brewery that i believe is living up to the hype somewhat. enough has been said about this great, great, dipa, but what i liked the most about it was the fact that it didn't lack in any department. beautiful appearance, great nose, and wonderful balance of bitterness, spicyness, fruitiness, and maltiness. still not quite perfect, but once i have this brew on cask, i'll edit my review. keep 'em coming three floyds!!!"
"Got this one in a trade with Joeybeerbelly, thanks for the opportunity to try this."
"A- Beautiful honey color, golden brown and pretty transparent. Head is 1/2"" after soft decanting. The head seems oily; not thick and soft. "
"This thing is a grapefruit, tangerine, citrus bomb!"
"Dreadnaught is a glowing, sun-kissed orange that ripens to more tawny shades at off angles. Its toasted complexion contains a great deal of natural haze. A khaki tan head did once shield the top; its role is now reduced to merely outlining the beer."
"Pours a deep pumpkin orange with moderate lacing. Smell is very alcoholic and citrusy. The alcohol makes the aroma very sweet. Tastes absurdly alcoholic with an almost overpowering bitter hop taste. This was not one of the more balanced IPA's I've ever had. Even for the being a Double IPA, it was almost too hoppy. Overall, a good DIPA, but the lack of balance keeps it from being truly exceptional."
On-tap @ the brewpub. This is my favorite beer ever! I've had it bottled before and loved it. This beer on tap kills!
pour from a bomber.
I picked this one up a little while back when I was up in Indiana for a wedding. It was a couple of months before I decided the timing was right to enjoy this one. 
Enjoyed in a pint glass
"Bottle. Poured an amber color with a nice thick white head. A ton of lacing. Aroma is very powerful and hoppy. Very nice mouthfeel for an IIPA. Flavor is really hoppy, but not overpowering (in a good way). This is a very tasty beer, with a nice citrus kick to it and a pleasant aftertaste. Quite possibly my second favorite IIPA (after Hopslam)."
Picked up from the brewery and sent to me about 3 weeks ago. Should be pretty fresh.
Big thanks to bgramer for this beer that I have been waiting to try for quite some time!
Taken from notes.
"Three Floyds Dreadnaught Imperial IPA pours up lively with a grandiose, creamish frappé head that mounts the slightly hazy, burnt orange-tawny amber body. Lots of lacing with very good-excellent head retention. The pungent aroma showcases a plethora of resinous hops ranging from floral to fruity (mango, peach, pummelo, tangerine, tropical fruit) to woodsy (evergreen, pine nuts) with some toasted maltiness & alcohol complexity showing through as it warms in hand. The flavor starts off just a touch cloying with a sweet underlying caramel maltiness reminiscent of a bananas foster flambé with a defined toasted (biscuity/soda bread) character that carries into a dominating bitterness that delivers a big, bold, warming finish. This medium-full bodied DIPA is well carbonated and slightly astringent from all those wonderful hops. Three Floyds Dreadnaught is a hop lover's wet dream and should be feared by light beer drinkers! "
Purchased at Dark Lord Day 2008.
"I won this in jeonseh's LIF, many thanks go out to him for this brew. "
I poured this one from a 22oz brown bomber bottle into a tulip glass.
"Got this from joe1510, a big cheers to him, been looking forward to this one since I split a bottle with Dauss last summer!"
Three Floyds Dreadnaught Imperial IPA
Got a 22 oz bomber received in a trade. 
I got two 22's of this brew in a trade with israel.
"Pours a murky honey amber. Aroma is well balanced with a strong maltiness with a solid hoppiness behind. Taste follows the nose with a nice malty sweetness in the front with a moderate hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is nice, with a bit of lingering malt and hops. Very drinkable."
"Picked this up at DLD, time to break it out for deliciousness rating"
"pours a crystal clear amber into a tulip. Fluffy two-finger head slowly fades with spotty lacing all around. This is one of those DIPAs that you can smell from clear across the room. Huge grapefruit & pine notes are balanced nicely with a caramelly sweetness. Taste is similar, with a bitter kick in the finish. Smooth & creamy, with a bit of alchohol bite. The 9.5% is definately noticable, which hurts the drinkability a bit."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a deep orange, cloudy, with almost no head. Aroma of, you guessed it, hops, citrusy hops. Initial flavor is somewhat sweet, with fruits that come out as it warms a little (I think it is apricot, but it could be mango or some other fruit). Flavor turns drier with the hop presence. After taste is very hoppy and you tend to keep that taste in your mouth for a while. Light to medium body, limited carbonation, limited lacing, and obvious alcohol involved. Very drinkable, wish I had a fresher bottle, but you take what you can get."
"This one didn't do it for me. Perhaps it wasn't aged properly, but it just seemed dull and ordinary."
"Pours a clear bright rich amber color with 1 inch of foamy and frothy off-white head, great retention and lovely sticky lacing. Smells big on hops, lots of juniper and spruce as well as some caramel, grapefruit, citrus rind, and a slight alcohol warmth. Tastes of earthy notes are quickly taken over by a sweet caramel flavor followed by an explosion of hops; citrus, grass, and a huge pine cone forest attack mingling with some spicy hop notes as well. Medium in body with good carbonation, a big bitter hopbomb with a good caramel backbone to balance out the assault and sweeten it up a bit. Pine loaded with a dry but sweet finish and some alcohol warmth but not overpowering. A superior DIPA with fantastic hop flavors and a good sweet malt presence. Though it is higher in alcohol, dread not, this stuff is easy to drink and fantastic."
"DEep orange amber with a sticky wheat colored head that puffs up and retains very well, generously coating my goblet in lace."
this beer poured a cloudy orange with decent head. a good looking beer.
L: Poured into a tulip glass. It pours an almost orange/burnt copper color with a rich off white head that leaves a trail of lacing on the glass as it disappears. Carbonation can be seen bubbling up within the cloudy color.
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Chimay glass. 05/07/08.
Thanks to dschuster03 for this extra!
"Presented in a brown, 22 oz. bottle with a psychedelic label illustration depicting the Taj Mahal, a crazed assassin, and a British Raj that's a dead ringer for Sean Connery. "
"thanks to hopasaurusrex for this fresh from the brewery bottle! Wow, 631 reviews as of my writing. This is a great double IPA. Hops, Hops and a side helping of HOPS. Oddly there's a smoothness in the hop effect which left me quite happy with this brew. Definitly a must try!"
Purchased during my DLD adventure at Archer Liquors in Chi-town. Pours a fairly clear amber with a thin head. Big smell of citrus hops. Taste is all citrus hops (Amarillo I think) with a bit of acidity going down. Mouthfeel is smooth & the ABV is well hidden. An outstanding DIPA. We still get this beer in PA from time to time and it is worth seeking. 
"Golden color with a slight strawberry tint. Huge hoppy scent with a big citrus backing, with some fresh mango. The scent is perfect, nearly euphoric. Big hoppy punch with creeping citrus lathers itself down your throat, dominating your senses. Caramel flavor comes in later, with alcohol so well hidden it seems almost unnoticeable. Mouthfeel is impeccable, bitter sweetness rolls through the mouth with no remorse."
poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter.
"Pours a hazy, peach honey with a messy, tight bubbled white head that resides to a disk afloat the beer. Leaves a coat across the walls of the glass. Smell is piney, maple, carmel, grapefruit, brown sugar, beautiful. Taste is very similar, hop aroma comes through nicely, not overly bitter, candied fruit, apricots, short bread covered in carmel. Very dry finish that still coats the mouth with a balanced hop aroma. Nice!"
"The beer poured a thick head with medium sized bubbles which immediately began to dissipate. This was a very clear copper in color and the nose was filled with scents of grapefruit, piney hops, caramel and spice. In the mouth the midpalate was rich and mouth-coating with solid weight. While there were tons of hops, they were well-balanced with some sweet malt. Again, with tons of hops, the finish had the bitterness one would expect but it was well balanced with malt that it did not come off as overtly bitter and dry. This is an extremely balanced with that has lots of everything. Yum!"
"Thanks ever so much to Kingpin for the bottle. This poured a clear reddish amber color(on my second pour, the yeast which had settled to the bottom poured out and now it's a hazy reddish amber). The smell is slight, but has a hoppy as well as a butterscotchy smell. The taste-where to begin? It has an almost burning hop presence, with citrus and earthy flavors predominating, although there hints of spruce or pine as well. There is a strong sweet malty flavor and a hint of butterscotch to round it out. While I wouldn't call this a smooth blending of contrasting flavors, it is instead that harder to achieve all- out war of competing yet complementary flavors, all of which demand my attention. This is an amazing beer and the best DIPA I've ever had. Now if they could only distribute to Minnesota!"
22oz bottle poured into a snifter courtesy of sativen. Thanks for sharing the Midwest goodies!
From a 22oz bomber poured into my GI tulip glass.
Poured out of a 22oz bomber.
Got this 22oz bottle in a trade with johnnnniee-thanks for the chance to try this monster! 
Thanks to abankovich for a great trade that landed this jewel in my collection. I poured from the capped bomber into a tulip while sharing this brew with friends at a tasting event held on a dock located on the Columbia River in Southeast Washington.
On tap at Chicago's Long Room for 4 dollars a goblet. Fresh as can be... just tapped. 
A- Hazy burnt orange in color with a nice white head.
"thanks to Lightindarkness for this one! Poured into a goblet. Nice hazy orange/amber color. thin white head that leaves good amount of lacing. Smell is delish- lots of citrusy hops. Taste warms me! Solid flavor, lots of biterness, but also smooths as it goes down. Good balance for a DIPA. This one gets better as I drink it. Some graininess, but overall very drinkable. Another amazing offering from FFF."
Appearance: Cloudy and dark golden brew. Tiny head disappears leaving a slight ring around the glass.
"Poured into a snifter from the 22oz bottle. The off-white lacing disappeared almost entirely very quickly. However there are a lot of carbonation bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass below the meniscus. The beer is a nice, soft orange/amber color with a slight haze."
"Hazy orange pour with a lasting creamy beige head atop. Smell is nice and aromatic with big fruity, citrusy hops in the nose. Taste was hopped but not nearly as much as expected and had strong notes of orange, peachiness to it. Candied bitter orange peel flavor to it. Much more balanced than expected. Decent body and a bitter orange finish. Mild alcohol presence but a very nicely drinkable IIPA. My rating will probably go up drinking this in more than a sample glass size at a time and looking forward to trying it again."
Thanks to bakerslp for the trade!
"Beautiful pinkish orange color, especially under the light, no head or lacing."
Bought a bunch of this at Binny's to stock up with.
"Obtained in trade from MuenchenerKindl, contents poured into a Stone OG tulip glass, currently #13 on BA"
Thanks to bassmantin for this brew! Cheers!
"Props to iconoklaztor for letting me sip this one. I traded it to him for a Ten Fidy, but he was good enough to let me sample it anyway."
"22 ounce bomber received in a trade with pimpp, thanks for giving me the opportunity to finally try this brew, poured into my Duvel tulip glass last night"
"Pours a nice copper color with a thick tan colored head that laces the glass really nicely. It smells of some roasted malts followed by a ton of hops. All sorts of citrisy, earthy, floral, and piney hops. The taste is excellent with a nice rich roasted malty base followed with a huge hop bitterness but it blends very well with the malts. The citirisy hop bitterness is blended very well with the piney and floral hops. The mouthfeel is crisp and bitter. The drinkability is good, especially for a beer this big."
Thanks Jay23 for the opportunity to sample this fine beverage
From Notes. 22 oz bottle. Review #500!
bottle thanks to pimpp. you're the man!
Three Floyds does a hell of a job with hops.
Thanks to autumnaldave for knocking this want off my list!
22 oz received in an awesome trade with jdoncbus .... shared with my trading partner .. huge thanks John. My part poured into my New Belgium snifter.
"Had this out of a bottle. It pours a reddish copper color with a small white head. Citrusy hops dominate the smell. The taste is also of citrusy hops, but is backed up by a fruity like malt sweetness. The bottle went down very easy, which is surprising given its strength. A good DIPA that I would recommend trying."
Thanks to WankerWeasel for brining this over to watch the superbowl.
"The color is a dark orange, with a strong smell of citrus. Tastes as it smells; orange, grapefruit, with a very strong aspirin bitterness. Could have used maybe a tad more citrus compared to the bitterness, but that's nitpicking, isn't it? Overall, a first rate IPA (or is it double IPA?). Either way, it's drinkable as hell. Yeah, baby."
"From notes... Consumed at JP O'Malley's in Allentown, Pennsylvania on 03.10.06..."
Sampled on 2-8-08
"The crazy-hyped, vaunted, hyperbole-slathered Dreadnaught has a pretty weak head despite a good hard pour. Color is nice though, a subtly clouded copper/amber/orange that absolutely shimmers when held to light."
Ordered a bomber at The Farmhouse in Emmaus.
Poured from a 1pt 6oz bottle into a tulip. Almost no head. No lace left down the glass. Murky burnt orange color. Not much active carbonation.
Appearance - Extremely hazy burnt orange; it's very nearly opaque. The off-white head has great retention.
Holy smoke!!!!
1/17/2008
"Starting with the appearance I see a nice cloudy light orange color with a nice white head that is evident at the end of the glass and the lacing is beautiful down the glass. Aromas are a great sweet fruity citrus hops. Taste is much of the same as the hops hit you with a nice juicy orange/Peach flavor and a great sweet malty backbone. mouthfeel is creamy with a touch of alchohol burn to be expected in a beer of this style. I would love if this was available in my area, as I would have only one of these in a sitting, I would always have one in the fridge waiting for me."
"a: This beer is a somewhat hazy golden color. It pours with a medium white head, lots of lace."
22 oz bomber
"Into my Duvel glass, pours an opaquish orange, a nice half inch white head forms for a bit, the lacing coming thick but don't stick for the most part, just slide down until it warms, then sticks. A good swirl brings back the head right back, all smooth and gentle like. The nose isn't quite as potent as you'd expect from an IIPA, but that doesn't stop it from being lovely. There is a bunch of hops, a resinous load of hop oil with citrus and gooey caramel."
L:Thick off white 2 finger head. The beer itself is a browish/red(amber)
22 oz. bottle in a snifter.
"No freshness info, bottle was purchased on Dark Lord Day in April of 2007."
"Split a bomber of this with a buddy into our Duvel tulips. Slightly hazy orange color with a negligible head, though it left lovely froth on top that looked like cirrus clouds and had decent lacing. My oh my, this smelled delicious! Hops, hops, hops, of course, but also plenty of citrusy notes. Lemon, orange, grapefruit. Notes of pine and alcohol, too. Wow! The smell hit me as soon as I popped the cap. Tasted like a hop sensation. It's been a while since I've had a hoppy brew and this reminded me of how much I love them. Both deliciously sweet and harshly bitter at the same time. I love it. Nice and full body, without being overly thick. I will definitely get one of these the next time I need a hop fix."
Pours a cloudy orange with no distinguishable head.
Taken from notes over the summer.
"This is the king of IIPAs. Hands down, no questions asked."
22 oz bomber
"Pours a hazy orange with an inch or so white head that quickly dissipates. Looks good, but not great."
"A 22oz bomber, delivering a keg's worth of taste..."
Reviewed from notes
"Orange gold in color with almost no head, probably due to 9.5% alcohol. It has visible yeast from bottle conditioning. Taste is overdone in way that I am quite fond of. Lots of sweet malt, lots of hops some sweet fruitiness. The more I drink it the more I like it. Its a little light on carbonation but has a nice sticky mouthfeel."
Snagged a bottle of this at Sams in Chicago while at home for an interview. Been wanting to try this bad boy for quite a while. Drank from my Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale glass.
This is my favorite IPA. I heard a lot of hype about it and it lives up. It exceeds. It's almost worth a roadtrip to Milwaukee or Chicago (the nearest distribution that I know of to MN).
"I had high hopes for this expensive beer, which is locally available in bombers. I was let down. I like bitter, but the bitterness of Dreadnaught overpowered the taste, as is true of some other over-the-top double/imperial IPAs. I want to have enjoyed this more than I did, but the taste just wasn't there. If it were a bit cheaper, I'd give it another try to be fair."
Poured from a bottle a warm hazy apricot color with a light off-white head and not much with the lacing.
Bowtie on tap from the brewery. 
Great beer sent my way via westweasel in a nice trade  salud!
"Poured into bowtie glass at the Three Floyds Brewpub in Munster, IN."
This beer is not normal
One of the best of the style for sure and maybe one of the best beers i've had period!
"Pours a clean orange-ish copper, with a tan head. Aromas of a balance between grapefruity hops and a sweet malt. In the taste, a sweet malt and dry grapefrutiy hops. A hoppy, yet smooth mouthfeel and a grapefruit hop, bittersweet aftertaste. Big hops, yet balanced. Not too bitter in the mouthfeel. A fantastic double IPA."
I got this bottle in a trade with autumnaldave. Thanks Dave!
Purchased on 3/5/07 at Warehouse Beverage
"Thanks to my friend Jonathan for this sampling. Served in a University of Michigan glass, Go Blue!"
22oz bomber. No date coding. Thanks Tangfoot!
Purchased at Lone Hill Liquors.
Poured into a La Chouffe tulip.
"A: Pours a hazy, bold orange with two fingers of foam. Active carbonation is present. Solid lacing on the glass."
Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a New Belgium globe glass.
This is a GREAT DIPA! Seek it out. Go for it. 
I had the unique opportunity to review this beer when a dumb Bud swilling friend went into my fridge and opened this thinking it was a cheap beer!! Dumb$%!
3 Floyd's- Dreadnaught
"I grabbed a bottle of this while I was in Chicago at Sal's in Villa Park, Illinois (where they have an great selection). I think I was less impressed with this beer because of all the hype surrounding it. I wish it would have been a little maltier. The aroma was very strong of floral hops and was great."
"A thick looking beer that has a golden body with a touch of orange mixed in. A fluffy cream colored head that stood strong for a bit and then made its exit. Sweet caramel malt and some pine scent from the hops touched the nose subtly, nothing overpowers the senses. A nice balance of piney hops and maltiness that was not too sweet, yet very bitter in a good way. Some slight heat from the alcohol, which is barely noticeable. I didn't detect it until the end of my glass. I got that nice warm, relaxed feeling you get when you finish a DIPA. A nice beer that didn't start off all that special but became better as it warmed up a little. Another great offering from Three Floyds."
"Pours a golden tan with two-fingered white head with plenty of lacing. Smells like floral hops with some malty sweetness. Tastes of floral hops with perfect malt balance. Drinks far more easily than any IPA I've ever said. If not careful, could easily start trying to session this thing. Really, an absolutely fantastic beer."
22oz. Bomber from Dilly Deli poured into a pint. No dating.
"This beer represented something of a Damascus Road for me since I was unfamiliar with these high-alcohol IPAs prior to meeting the Dreadnaught at the FFF brewery. The world has never been the same again. Pale mahogany and slightly hazy upon pouring with a modest yet structured head. The (obviously hoppy) aroma is arresting, but the palate is what it is all about. Others have written extensively about it; suffice it to say that, after Dreadnaught, almost all other beer is boring. My only reservation: at $10 a bomber it isn't cheap."
"Thanks to dertbert for this one, again."
A- Pours an amber color with a thin head that lingers for quite a while.
I've had this one a couple of times but I'm just getting around to a BA style review. 
A- An aggressive pour only produced a 1 finger creamy white head on this one. The body is a beautiful translucent rusty amber color that is full and vibrant. Head fades rather quickly to a nice collar and some lacing is left behind in the glass.
"A 650 mL of Dreadnaught that I purchased over a year ago as part of a case. As it has at least a year under its belt, I thought it was worth a re-visit."
Ohhh thanks enola. You are the man!!
This one is for Michael Jackson. May he drink in peace.
"RIP Michael Jackson, I drink this in your honor. Im a huge fan of double IPAs and this one has such a malty biscuit-juice like backbone, I was pleased how that layer counterbalances the bitter pine cone grapefruit-esque hops which stand out in the finish. Balance is not an operative word here with the intensity of flavors all around. A bit too much on the tea side with that bittersweet honey biscuit flavor but all around an enjoyable beer. Its also a bit astringent with the overload of hops. Thank you NEPA case split club for this bottle."
Pours burnt orange with a milky head. 
One of the first big beers I tasted when I first began this quest. Thought I would review now that I am on BeerAdvocate. Pours from the bomber a hazy orange type color with a small white head that stays for a moment and then just simply leaves a small white head on top. Smell is pine hops with some fruits coming through like grapefruit. Taste is all hops with grapefruit and leaving a bittering delicious hop feeling. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky and allows your palate to concentrate on the bittering hops without too much overpowering carbonation. After sampling lots of other IIPA out there I come home to this one and am thorougly impressed again.
22 oz bomber 
"Pours a hazy amber orange with small head but great lacing. Smells of huge hops, piney, grassy and citrus rind along with grapefruit. Taste is a wallop to the buds and I love it. Delicious, power packed hops but as soon as you want to pucker a nice balance of fruit and malt make this an incredible balanced DIPA. Alcohol is not present other than a little warming. Carbonation is perfect as is the medium mouthfeel and crazy drinkability. Finishes a little dry and bitter from the hops but does not sting or linger. If I had access to this I would have it batting cleanup. A must try for any true BA."
"In an effort to try some of the best according to BA subscribers, I went to Vintage Wine and Beer and bought a 750ml of Dreadnaught. Three Floyds is known for brewing some great brews so I was very excited to try this one. I was able to share this and some other great brews during a tasting night with two of my good buddies. We saved this for last because we knew our palates would all used up after drinking this famous DIPA."
"received in a trade with tpd975, much appreciated!"
"22-ounce bottle, shared with fellow anonymous northern Colorado B-A. Thanks for hooking me up! "
"I recieved this in a trade from jdoolin, Poured into my De Garre snifter. "
Clear orange with a fast-fading head.
excellent
"A- A beautiful gold liquid fills the glass. It is slightly cloudy, just how I like it. The drawback is the tiny head that formed and then settled to almost nothing- leaving a fairly lonely looking liquid in the glass."
A-Very hazy orange as I poor it into my glass. Small to medium head as I wait for the beer to settle. Very good to look at. Very orange with a cloudy/amber haze. 
"I flew to Chicago and drove to Munster, Indiana for this beer. After loading the rent-a-suv, I drove straight home, to Boston with it. "
22 oz. bomber into a tulip glass.
"Pours a clear dark amber with a healthy three finger off white head that leaves some lacing around the top of the glass. Citrus and malt aroma, hints of soy sauce and pineapple. Tons of flavor, first taste is hops, then dark caramel, then malt and soy sauce. Thick after taste with less citrus and more something or other, cant really put my tongue on it. It leaves the taste of Fall in the back of my mouth. Could use some more hops, and a little less malt. Not my favorite beer but still one of the most interesting I have ever had."
"Thanks to Talisker for the trade! The beer poured a semi-hazy copper orange with a thin head that slowly diminishes to a ring. The aroma is a strong blend of pine hops and sweet malts. The taste is dominated by an absolutely wonderful blend of hops against a strong malt backbone. Pine dominates but makes way for some undertoned citrus. There is a decent alcohol presence, but it is strongly masked by the beers great taste, making a heavy beer seem lighter than it is, and also making it incredibly easy to drink."
Thanks to Jay23 for this prestigious brew.
Many thanks to kssweene for this legendary brew 
A: Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a deep orange with an almost copper appearance. A small white head is present with decent lacing. 
Another beer purchased for me by my brother. Boy am I glad he works right down the road from 3 Floyd's
"22 ounce bottle, not sure how old it is but I know I've had it a while. The Dreadnaught pours an orange/copper color with a half inch off-white head. The aroma is very nice, the pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops are strong, with a bit of malt in there too. Taste is mostly piney hops, with some grapefruit hops and sweet malt noticeable. It starts off a bit sweet, and has a nice hoppy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is very full, and it's also slick, smooth and a bit syrupy. Carbonation is low and the alcohol isn't very noticable which makes this very easy to drink. Overall I think this is a very good beer. If you get the chance to try it, you definitely should."
A - Pours a copper color with a nice tan head
Been waiting a long time to sample and review this one and finally got a 22 oz. bomber to split with a friend last night. Let's see if this brew is really up to all the hype I've read about it. This sample was a 2006 vintage.
"Dreadnaught, thanks to Westweasel. Decided to review this one tenth on my one year anniversary as a BA member. :-) Cheers!"
"Thanks to Monsone, genog, and Reed415 for this amazing brew."
"On tap at the FFF brewpub. Served in a bowtie glass. Pours a deep hazy orange with a small beige diminishing head. Leaves some nice thick lacing. Aroma is heavy on the hops with some sweet peach and grapefruit undertones. Medium to full body. Taste is hops, pine and peach. Very satisfying beer. Nice bitter finish with lasting peach taste. This beer lives up to its strong reputation. One of my favorites."
22oz bomber poured into a chalice.
"First and foremost, this is a great beer but I do believe there are better DIPA's out there...I've had a few I thought were better already. "
Bomber. 
"Appearance: Orange-gold with millions of hop or yeast particles in suspension, good carbonation, nice head and lacing."
"Enjoyed this on draft at the Clark Street Ale House in Chicago for $6 for a snifter. Man oh man, this one packs one punch of citrus, mainly grapefruit. Nice orange with a half inch head that stays in the glass, notes of light hops. Cannot tell the alcohol content in this one. Refreshing, complex, and satisfying to the last drop."
Another impressive Three Floyds brew that I got thanks to StoutsNIPAs.
Served at 50 degrees F.
"An amber, orange beer with a thin head."
Pours out a cloudy amber yellow with three fingers of white suds. Not a lot of lacing occuring here.
"It pours a hazy orange with a slightly thick foamy head. Sorry, but I.P.A style beers don't look that great, especially when you compare them to any stout out there. Though, they do look a whole lot better than your average peepee yellow lagers."
The color is an amber-light reddish orange. It has a good strong hops smell with fruit and nut in it. This beer is all about the hops. It does a much better job that so many other microbrews looking to push all the hoppy goodness they can. Its bitter but doesnt have that tree bark bite that usually goes hand in hand. Good stuff but expensive.
This beer by Three Floyds is all that an IPA should be and more. Dreadnaught pours clean and golden with a light white head and a bit of lace. 
"I have waited long enough! I got this in a trade with akorsak, so thanks!"
Three Floyds Dreadnaught Imperial IPA
"Poured into pint glass. Dark Orange in appearance, almost rusty. At first, the beer showed a nice fothy half inch white head which later turned to mediocre lacings."
"I was very excited to try this one. However, I got an old bottle that had started to oxidize. There was no hops in the nose; only a sweetness dominated by wet cardboard. The appearance was clear and the head formed nicely but fell too quickly. The flavor had some good hop flavor, pale malt sweetness and pineapple type goodness. But the staleness was prominent and could be tasted around but was still disappointing. Anyways, I am adding this one just to let others know that there are stale bottles of this on the market; so buyer beware."
"Poured in tulip, finger head with lacing. Color is bronze and thick. Pungent aroma of orange, wood, lemon. Sweet, pine taste with a nice alcohol kick that leaves a pleasant touch; excellent malt & hop balance."
"Purchased at the brewery, should be the latest batch. "
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It's balanced wonderfully with loads of malts and hops. The hops really call out to me. I've waiting to try this beer for a long time. The taste is awesome! It's smooth and malty with a huge hop explosion. It goes down easy and finishes bitter, but with a balanced malt taste as well. It's high in alcohol, but not warm in the finish. It's huge with hops, but not overbearing. The malts are there, but the bill is not too complex. This is a beer done to perfection. The mouthfeel is great. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is the best Imperial IPA I'v ever had; period."
Went to Chicago recently and came across this highly-praised brew at a little beer store outside of the city. I had to see what all the hub-bub was about.
"A good, but overrated beer."
This review has been edited after I've tried this a second time...
"Pours a nice light copper color, with a nice white head."
"this pours a nice, thick, orangey light amber with just a slight haze. just looks big and menacing in that little bowtie at the pub or a tulip at home. off-white creamy, beautiful head and persistent lacing. aromas are huge and upfront, with the citrusy sweet hops (like fresh orange blossoms) dominating along with some fresh bread dough, honey, pine, and floral notes. prominent sweetness at the beginning is eventually overtaken by the huge, but smooth hop bitterness in this beer. absolutely refined and not in any way rough around the edges like some other ipa's or dipa's. balance is superb. super long finish, only at the end of which is the faint warming alcohol (hidden in the aroma and taste)kick noticeable. huge bodied and viscous. dangerously drinkable. the best dipa i've had, hands down. note: i have had a light-struck bottle or two wherein some fishy aromas have developed. make sure it's fresh and not light-struck...just go to the brewery if possible."
"Dreadnaught proves, to my delight, that the West Coast does not have a monopoly on the DIPA style."
"A - Poured an extremely hazy, and nealy opaque orange. A huge white pillow like frothy head on top did not want to fade, eventually it relented leaving behing a ton of white lace dripping down the glass.	"
a - poured a two-fingers thick bubbly and off-white head that left sticky sides and thick lacing throughout. into a large weizen glass. the body was a clear amber.
"The beer pours a deep gold color, almost amber, and sitting atop the beer is a slightly off white head that leaves decent lacing. Inside the beer there is a continuous flow of carbonation bubbles flowing from the bottom of the beer. The aroma is bitter American hops reminding me of something citrusy. Also present in the nose is a sweet fruity malt backbone. In the taste the hops become more present with a red grapefruit flavor the over powers everything. The malt trying not to be out done, but fails at this, brings out a strong backbone behind the malts giving it a sweeter taste. It is a big beer that leaves a long dry finish that begs you to take another drink, one of my personal favorite beers."
"Pours a dark copper. First glass has no foam, second glass has 1 finger. Very minimal lacing. Aroma is predominantly sweet malts with plenty of hops behind it. Pine hops slightly overpower the citrus and floral, but it's a nice blend. Taste is hard to pin down. The sweet malts blend nicely with the hops. The interesting hop blend is not as aggressive as I would expect from 3Fs. Not too sweet, which is my primary complaint in the genre. Very easy to drink by DIPA standards. Mouthfeel is creamy and does not get syrupy. If this were $6 instead of $11 for a 22oz it would be a no-brainer."
"Dreadnaught pours an amber color with a slightly off white head. It has a sweet aroma that isn't as full as hops as I would have assumed. There are some hop aromas, but it is mostly malty sweet aromas. The taste is similar to the aroma. There is no blast of hops that I would expect from a double IPA. There is a very strong sweet malty taste and enough hops to balance and stand out, but again, they don't dominate the flavor. I think that I'm getting more accustomed to hoppier beers, so it might be a bit before I can get a stable base to review from. That being said, it is still a good beer. It tastes fairly full bodied for a lighter beer, and is pretty good to drink. I would definitely drink it again."
Thanks to dhchatfield for the chance to try this one.
A very big thanks to Westsidethreat for this gem of a brew!
Bomber with standard cool Three Floyds art. Now if they could just start putting dates on the bottles...
Light orange color with a subtle golden context. Small slow developing pure white head dissipated rapidly. Only a meager few carbonation bubbles rise to the top. Thin lacing clings in rings around glass.
"Pours a nice yellow orange color with a decent head and plenty of lace. Smell is grapefruit , hops, and alcohol. The bitterness of three compliment each other well. Taste starts hoppy and bitter and finishes a bit sweet and malty. Very enjoyable. Mouth is dry and crisp, with a crisp alcohol kick. Drinkability is outstanding, a great DIPA."
"Bottle acquired from Viggo and shared with Fisherman34 for the MB DIPA throwdown. Much thanks Viggo for this tasty hop bomb treat! Pours out a solid dark amber. Decent head a lacing. Aroma was more about the malts than expected. For the rep of this beer, I feared that my nose hairs would burn off sniffing this sucker. Taste is beautiful blast of citrus hops with a heavy creamy toasty malt backbone. Very creamy indeed and had a great finish to it. I can only imagine what it would be like fresh from the brewery. No astringency noted and the alcohol was well hidden. Fantastic brew and was almost more balanced than I thought going into it. It was a flavour explosion on an otherwise dull March Saturday. Best of show in the throwdown."
Sampled on-tap on St. Patrick's Day at the Brewhouse Grille.
22oz bottle into tulip glass.
"A - big white creamy head that doesn't stick around for long but leaves nice lace behind. Good clarity and beautiful orange, copper color."
I remember the first time I had a Dreadnaught. It was at a slip-n-slide party where everyone was running around in the end of a hot August in bathing suits with water guns and beers. And I had this. This masterpiece of IPAs. I used to hate IPAs. They are an acquired taste. Or maybe you just need the right IPA to turn your fancy. This was The One. The gateway IPA. The IPA that opened the door to all other IPAs to come.
"This beer is light and refreshing with abundant and delicious citrus notes, but at the same time packs a big hop wallop. Dreadnought lives in its own place on the beer landscape, as it closely walks the yin-yang line between certain attributes. It is both extremely light and bitter/heavy, it is very sessionable yet satisfying, and is drinkable yet strong. This beer can be wonderful, my only complaint is that over a handful of times I've had this beer, it's character (or quality? or age?) has been extremely inconsistent. The bottle I had the other day was delightful and everything good I remember about this brand from the first time I had it (on-tap at Three Floyd's). But I've also had bottles of this that are extremely malty and stale. The bad bottles I've had are made worse by the hefty price tag ($10 for a big bottle) this beer frequently carries."
"Picked up a bottle at Chuck's Wine & Liquor in Chagrin Falls, OH."
"This was as good as advertised, and one of the more complex beers Ive had. Started out pouring from the bottle to a bright orange-red, with thick off-white head that stayed around for the entire glass, and excellent lacing. Initial aroma was strongly hoppy citrus, mainly grapefruit and oranges. However, as the beer warmed, the aroma became more influenced by a malty sweet aroma. Likewise, the flavor, which started out heavily on the bitter, hoppy citrus side, while retaining that throughout, became nicely blended with a malty sweet syrupy taste. Alcohol also made itself more known as the beer warmed, perfectly complementing the hops and malts."
"Pours an orange, cloudy color with minimal head. Smell was overwhelmingly hops, with mostly citrus and some vegetable-like characteristics. Taste was a blast of bitterness at the start with some vegetable flavors mixed in and a sweet finish. Thought it was too sweet and that it did not blend well with the hop flavors. Full-bodied and fairly drinkable. Prefer 3Fs Alpha King over this brew and think it is a much tastier and drinkable brew."
"22 oz bottle thanks to Nflmvp. I shared this with a good friend and poured into two pint glasses. The color was a bright orange and hazy. The head was white and fluffy. The smell was faint but my sense of smell sucks most days. The taste was pretty damn awesome. I definitely tasted the simcoes in there. Pine and citrus are of course present. This was a really awesome brew but totally NOT worth $10. They need to drop that down to around 6~7. I can't get it here anyway but the price is ridiculous. Oh well, I had wanted to have a glass since i first sampled this at GABF."
"Bomber purchased at Printer's Row Wine Shop in Chicago ($12), and flown down to Mobile by a friend over Christmas. I've been waiting to drink this since, and feel that I better go ahead and do it."
"Sampled from a bomber, not sure how fresh this one is as there is no dating system I could find but carbonation is present and it tastes pretty damn good. Pours a perfectly clear golden amber with a slight head. Smell is sweet: strawberry, rasberry and orange. Also, some alcohol but not overbearing. Taste is sweet almost like bubble gum flavor alongside fruity hops, good balance with enough maltiness to counter the hops. A hoppy bitterness followed by a nice malty finish. I could drink this all day but I really couldn't. Wish this one was available in my area as I would also keep a couple available."
22oz. bomber
"Thanks to my good friend Zach who brought some Three Floyd's down to Columbus. We split a bomber of the Dreadnaught amongst four of us. Served in pint glasses. Pours a slightly hazy pale orange. Medium head. Great retention on it. Smells of plenty o' hops, orange, cinnamon, clove. Taste centers around hops like crazy, but there are some nice sweet, caramel flavors as well. Overall, a great balance to the flavors - I love that in IPA's. Medium mouthfeel - perfect complement to the hoppiness. Overall, an excellent beer. Fine example of the style, and wonderful to take in with friends."
"Appearance: Nice one finger head after pour, though it dissipated rather quickly. Beer is a light copper colored beauty."
edit: thanks to jwaks for this bottle
"Got this while in Indy for Xmas and shipped it back to Texas. Poured from a 650ml bomber with no dating system into my New Belgium snifter. Even with a good pour there was barely any head and what was there went away pretty quick. Several of the other reviews I read talked about a nice size head so not sure how fresh this one is but here it goes. It was a copper color with a few pieces of yeast floating around. It was mostly clear until the final pour when more yeast got in there and clouded it up some. The smell was out of this world. Pure smack in the face hops. I'd had several of this style lately and this is top 2 in smell. The taste was also tremendous. The hops attack the palette and have you begging for mercy but in a good way. Since it is intense this is best suited for a nice long drinking session instead of a quick thirst quencher. Again top of the style for me. The mouthfeel again hits a 5 with a nice smooth and creamy texture. Overall this is a exceptional beer and worthy of the high rankings. You must find this beer and try it. You won't be disappointed. (4.5, RR, T, Y)"
"Dreadnaught from Three Floyds poured a golden-copper hue topped by a creamy, eggshell head. Aroma had bright citrus and pine elements. Apricot, orange, honey and grapefruit flavors emerge. Full body with a medium-high carbonation level."
Note to self...back-to-back with Southern Tier UnEarthly
"Well that was interesting. That was my thought after my very first forey into DIPA's. Never has my tongue felt the way it did while drinking this brew...well except that one night in Austin, but I digress. The appearance of this beer is nice enough, a yellow/orange hue with about a half finger head on it. Upon first whiff, my olfactory senses were cranking with the aroma of a whole lotta citrus, oranges to specific. And wow, could you smell the hops! The taste of this beer, as stated before, was a crazy. It numbs the back of your tongue with an overpowering (naturally) hopped up taste. It is also very bitter. I'm not ashamed to say the first few sips were on par with witnessing Rosie O'Donnell in a bikini. It was that rough. However, after the opening stanza of sips, the orange and citrus flavor started to creep up and neutralize the bitterness a little. As I said, in the mouth, it definitely sticks on the tongue and provides a unique feel. As far as drinkability goes, well, I drank it. Can't say how many more times I will though. Definitely not something I could sit down and have a few of, but definitely something to break out every once in a while. Once you get paste the first few sips, if you get past the first fews sips, the taste and sensation get a better and become part of the norm. Try this beer for the experience alone and try to forget about Rosie and her bikini."
Thought I'd finally review this one. Here goes!
"Pours a hazed golden copper. Creamy one finger head showing decent retention and producing minimal lacing. The first whiff is of sticky cannabis buds. As it warms, aromas of peach skin, grapefruit rind, floral citrus, and fresh cut grass blend together to form a corniacopia of american hop madness. Also detectable behind the hops is a toasty malt aroma and faint buiscuity notes. The flavor is sweet at first, with caramel, pale malt, and a subdued nutty flavor. Then an onslaught of herbal, minty, and pine hop flavors. The Aftertaste eventually dries, with a peachy/orange taste lingering and a sharp alpha acid sting that only true hop-heads could call ""balance"". The body is medium-full, and a fine, slow-moving carbonation keeps the mouthfeel fliud enough to allow ease of consumption, while qualifying the syrupy viscosity expected of DIPA's and Barleywines. Finshes with substantial residual toasted malt character and a myraid of american hop complexity to match. A real eye-opener as to what a DIPA can be."
Presentation: A 22oz bottle with no freshness date to be found.
Poured from bomber into a tulip glass
I've recently acquired quite an appreciation for big IPAs and just had to try one of the best there is out there.
Poured from bomber into my Dogfish pint glass.
"Thanks to a friend, Nic, I finally got to try this beer!"
"22oz. bottle poured a hazed peach color with small white head and leaves a few specks of lace. Smells a bit sweet and malty with a strange funky odor that might be yeast. This isn't the hop bomb I thought it would be, it seems more balanced with a bit of sweet malt at first and a slight hop bitterness towards the end. I also taste alot of yeast in this brew and it seems to hide the hops and give it a thick feel. Overall I would have to say that its easy to drink but doesn't seem to fit the style (double IPA) so much. I'll try this one again if I can find it."
"22 ounce bottle from the glorious Lone Hill Liquor in Glendora, CA (A good 50 miles away from me). The guys in front of me bought a case of Miller Lite for just over half the price. I think I got a better deal."
Served from a 22oz bomber into a tall weizen glass.
"This is one good IPA. Poured a clear golden yellow in the off light and a reddish orange in the direct light. 1/4"" head that disappears quickly. Smells grassy with apple sense. Tastes like a bitter apple with the sweetness of a grape. Hops hit you like a pillow fight and make you sit back and relax. This is how hops should act. Shock your mouth then level off into a flavorfull film on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a tinge creamy but more like skim milk, but so flavorfull it makes up for the thin body. Alcohol level is extremely well hidden and as of now I could drink many more of these. Luckily I only have one as I have to work tomorrow and if I had more than one I probably wouldn't get up! Overall, this is one good IPA, enjoyable and too overpowering."
Appearance:
Appearance: Deep copper color with a very thin head. Lacing was superb
Poured from a 22oz bomber into La Chouffe and Loterbol tulips. This review assisted by Dr. Brian (PurdueDoc).
"damn tasty double IPA. pours a rosy amber colour that's beautiful, but less head than expected for a extra hoppy beer. to best describe the smell and taste, imagine sticking your head into a barrel of freshly picked hops and breathing in. the mouthfeel lacks the appropriate bitterness for the style, but that makes for better drinkability. this beer is a must try."
Served from a 22oz. bomber in a Duvel tulip at just below cellar temperature.
"First off, this is a very good-looking beer. Though there is no head, there is subtle lacing throughout the glass, and its color is a beautiful reddish amber. A bit of weak carbonation floats up from beginning to end, as well."
"I was shopping at Whole Foods in Columbus, when I found 5 22oz. bombers of this gem for $8.99 each. Nevertheless, they came home with me. Upon popping the cap, a blast of ruby-red grapefruit aroma hits your nose. Poured a hazy rosy red/orange hue with a frothy white head. Allowing it to sit for a several minutes, the aroma was some intense my cats followed the glass everywhere I placed it. Lovely smell of grapefruit tree(heavy hop), followed by a sweet hint of fruity alcohol. The flavor took me by surprise. Clean, crisp, medium to full body with a bitter sweet beginning that ends with a fizzy, moderate alcoholic feel and long heavy sweet acidic aftertaste. In all this brew rocks. It really reminds me of drinking fresh squeeze rudy red grapefruit, it even leave a nice tart and sticky feel on your lips. Folks, if you can find this brew. BUY IT! It worth the money. Enjoy."
Found a 22oz? bottle at a great bar called the Small Bar(Logan Square) in Chicago.
"when i first craked this and smelled it, i could of sworn i smelt marijuana, i was once told that hops and marijuana are in the same family of plants. Besids the point, great brew, reminded me alot of the goose island Imperial IPA, the taste of the thick almost syrup like hoppiness, but at the same time sweet finishing, is to die for. if you havent tried this, do it."
This is my fourth or fifth bottle and after the first one I wanted to try it again since the first time I tried it I was unimpressed. I thought maybe it was off for some reason so I asked for three bottles in a trade to try it fresh and then aged a year or so.
"This was one of the first double IPAs I ever tried, many years ago, and I haven't tried it since (unavailable where I live). Bring it on!"
"Thanks, shbobdb, for the bombers of this fine brew!"
22 oz. from Lone Hill in Glendora.
"Sometimes when you go to a fancy restaurant, they give you bread with spicy olive oil that has been infused with chili or whatever. Thats prettymuch the color of this beer. It turns more orange and almost ruby when light strikes it a certain way. The racing carbonation forms a thick head like whipped egg whites that leaves a layered wall of lacing and it perfumes the air above the glass with what may be one of the most pungent and simultaneously inviting aromas of any beer ever. I would describe it as sweet, deeply resinous, and a thick, sticky, drippy blend of honey, mango, peach, and grapefruit, with prickly pine notes in the background. I also get some grape aroma, curiously I can not make up my mind if we are talking red or white though. Deep quaffing of the beer actually pricks and tickles the back of my throat with an odd sensation. "
Poured a bright yet cloudy medium copper hue with a half finger foamy white head. There was decent retention and good lacing.
"22oz bomber sans date. Pours a honey color flared with bursts of gold. The two finger white head recedes rather quickly, never firming up much, but leaving ample strands of sticky lace."
Poured from a big 22 oz bomber it a pint glass. The Liquid was a very think malty looking orange amber with good carbonation. The head was also thick. a big 2 fingers off white and had nice lace.
Served in pint glass from a 22 oz. bomber bought at the Dilly Deli
"22oz bomber picked up from a local bar, What a great find! "
"This beer offers a showcase example of what incredible flavor (and not just bitterness) hops can add to a beer. This showcase starts with the aroma. Huge floral hop essences are easily perceptible when it's still a good six inches away from the the nose. The show continues with an explosion of flavor on the palate. A near perfect melding of bitterness, flavor, and malt. The hops flavors and essences run the gamut from fruity-citrusy, to woody-resinous, to oily-sweet; and are huge and juicy."
Thanks to Witbier for the opportunity
"Poured out a murky orange pumpkin brown color with a chunky orange/off-white head with huge lacing. Nose offers orange, grapefruit peel, some malt, lemon blossom, and floral hops. The taste is incredibly bready before going to white grapefruit. The flavors are extremely obvious, but not overbearing or cloying. Incredibly big and balanced, this double IPA hits on all notes. There's a little alcohol, a tiny bit of malt balancing things out, and even some more orange citrus peaking through. Finishes dry, with a little hop oil coating the tongue on the way down."
"Dreadnaught arrived in a bowtie glass, crystal clear and somewhere between apple juice and amber in color. The head was a creamy thick blanket of beige foam and the lace was sinfully thick and sticky."
22oz bomber -&gt; imperial pint
"Served on-tap in a tulip. A rich, caramel color with a nice frothy head."
"Review #300 is a worthy accomplishment and shall be rewarded as such. A gigantic thanks to Ego for stumbling into a few cases of this in PA, let's see if this lives up to the hype."
Unbelievable....If you are into hoppy HOPPY bitterness...
Had this sitting on my back deck watching the leaves fall. Huge thank you to todd1 for this beer.
"A - Brownish-red color, slight white head."
"Poured 1 ½ finger head that dissipated rather quickly and left little lacing. The beer was golden in color. Wow, the smell is the absolute best part of this brew - strong on the citrus. When first tasting Dreadnaught, I picked up more piney hop taste than the smell indicates. The more I drank, however, the citrus hop flavor came through. The mouthfeel was spot on for my tastes: medium-bodied and well-carbonated. Drinkability is high on this beer. Sure, the alcohol level is elevated on this beer, but it fits the category and the beer is easy to drink. I paid $8.99 for this bomber and it was worth it (although pricey for an everyday beer)."
"Gold-tinged orange beer. Cloudy, with very little bubbling. Topped with three fingers of cream-colored head -- probably the product of a particularly violent pour -- lacing in rings. You could be strolling down the sidewalk outside my house and still catch a whiff of grapefruit from the Dreadnaught, but you will have to lean over the glass to catch the caramel malt and dizzying booze."
CONTAINER VOLUME: 22 oz
Dreadnaught DIPA: 22 Oz. Bottle
"22oz. brown bottle, no date information."
Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Stone IPA glass.
This is a very complex beer. Pours an amber/yellow/brown/red color with very nice foaming-to-lace head. 
Many thanks to Everett for the opportunity to try this beer.
"Cloudy deep orange with a billowing tan head that diminishes but never dissipates. Wonderful smell of pungent piney citrus hops and a hint of biscuit malt somewhere beneath the murkiness. The taste follows suit perfectly. Spicy orange citrus hops dominate the forefront of the palate, with a presence of pine and resin, but are rapidly brought into check with some bready caramel malt sweetness. Ridiculous layers of fruity complexity can be found within the hop bitterness on this one. Sticky and full on the mouthfeel, with a dry oily finish that lingers on tremendously. The taste has a surprisingly better balance than one might expect from an Imperial IPA, without the typical one-sided nature. Extremely satisfying."
"Pours with copious amounts of creamy, tan head slowly settling to the top. Brilliant amber, orange and copper body with an abundant stream of slowly rising bubbles. Excellent head retention and lacing on the glass. "
"I've been quite tardy in updating my review of this American classic. $10.99 for a 22oz bomber at Keg Liquors in Clarksville, Indiana. A two hour drive from my home in western Kentucky, but an easy sidetrip off Interstate 64, when passing through Louisville, for points north, south, or east. I'm disappointed that I can't find this in Evansville. "
"Pours a beautiful warm amber, almost rose', but not really. If amber could be mixed with rose. The head is not to crazy, but mildly present. The smell is amazing, one of the best smelling beers. Sents of pine, pine apple, mango, citrus, with a strong bitter hop character. The mouth full is fresh, clean, and a little sticky at the end. The bitterness is balanced masterfully with the fruit. It finishes dry and makes you want more. The taste lingers on your palate for quite some time. The after taste of pear, chocolate, pine and more fruit. This beer is complex, compelling and great, but if one is not prepared for such complex intensity they might be thrown off, but not me. I love you dreadnaught."
"This was different from every other DIPA I have had. There was tons of different floral notes in it. Things like a bit grassy and piney. The malts came through but did take a back seat. The flavors ranged from citrus hops to floral hops and to malts. The alcohol was well hidden. I picked up tastes of lemon, grapefruit, a bit of orange also. The smell resembled the taste very well also. I really wish I could get this here but at same time I'm glad I can't at $10 a bottle I would be broke. This is probably my favorite DIPA and most different one I've tried. I would defiantly pick up another bottle of this if I ever find it again."
"Wow. Where to begin. This bomber poured a gorgeous chill-hazed bronze, with a massive foamy ecru head that bubbled down to a blanket that covered it until the very last drop. Sticky lace remained. Before the pour, before the head, as soon as tha cap was popped, the aroma hit- fresh-cut pink grapefruit, citrus, pine. Amazing nose."
"First, I should state I am not a huge fan of this style. I love hops but it seems DIPA brewers are in a contest to see who can overload the most hops into their brew. That said, this is the best of the style I have tried and much better than the Dogfish Head 90 minute which is in my opinion more a novelty beer than anything worth drinking (the 120 is simply putrid)."
"Bomber from Bowling Green. Managed to keep this king of IPA's in my fridge for all of two days before trying it. Too much anticipation.. anyways, here we go. Pours a clear dark golden with an orange hue. A medium/large persistant white head laces the glass. Smell is glorious sweet, spicy and citrusy hops. Piney and herbal hop notes are present as well. Taste is spicy then citrusy and sweet - like grapefruit and honey. Earthy and piney hop flavors come in. A delicious sweet malt backbone manages to complement the hops perfectly. Finishes with a hint of warming alcohol and a pleasant lingering herbal hop bitterness. Fantastic. So much going on here and it's all great. Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect- creamy and slightly heavy. Extremely drinkable. I must say that this did not disappoint- quite a feat given my high expectations. Just an awesome beer. The best IPA and actually, for me, the best beer I've had so far."
A great warmup for the lupulin flogging I'm going to get in my upcoming trip to the west coast...
Thanks to Nlmartin for the trade. 
thanks to Viggo for sharing this bottle with me.
"Picked this baby up recently at Stateline in MD for $8.99. What an absolutely delicious, mouth-watering DIPA! Pours a bright amber-orange color. Produces a thin, 1/4"" head which fades to a thin wispy coating. Beautiful, rich, sweet fruity aromas of oranges, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, pine needles and caramel fill the nose. The hop aroma profile in this beer is simply incredible. Mouthfeel is moderately full, but silky smooth and a perfect subdued carbonation level. The flavor would in my estimation be pretty tough to surpass. Perfect balance here between the hops and malt. Starts sweet with notes of caramel candy, toasted malts, and apricot. The hops then kick in with avengence showing off flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pine resin, flowers and herbs. Finishes with a stout, assertive hop bitterness which is followed by a mild alcoholic warmth. Just a beautiful, classy brew."
"Pours bright amber. Nice white head, smooth carbonation but not too much to impart an acidic flavor. Aroma gives off the freshest hop odor you'll get this side of Dogfish Head. Slightly grassy, like many IPAs, but in addition strong pungent, sweet, oily hop aromas abound. The flavor carries a fantastic blend of floral hop tastes, with sour apple, grapefruit, and sweet citrus at the forefront. Yes, many beers carry these hop flavors, but the Dreadnaught manages to make them taste FRESH. Almost no alcohol phenols present, and though there is a great sweetness to this beer, it is not presented as a malty heaviness. Overall, this is a fantastic double ipa that emphasizes the beauty of hops without simply delivering grassy bitterness over strong malts."
Poured into glass a hazy orange/copper/amber color. Head disappeared to nothing in no time.
"Thank you kmudrick for bringing this up from Beeryard in PA. Soon after arrival, it became a contestant in a blind dipa tasting. The other double ipas tasted: Dogfish Head 90 min, Stoudts Double IPA and Lagunitas Shutdown (the double ipas I happen to have on hand). Though it did not win in all five categories (DFH won appearance, Dreadnaught won smell and taste, Stoudts won mouthfeel & drinkablity) it did come out on top overall, with Stoudts a close second. "
"A - Pours a slightly cloudy dark golden color, nice carbonation, nice creamy tan head, lots of lacing afterwards."
"Beautiful amber color, crystal clear and almost sparkles in the glass. Head wasnt that big to start with. Solid white half inch that reduced to scattered layer of bubbles on the top."
"I'm not a DIPA person but I like this beer. I have been trying to find out what it is about the DIPA that attracts so many. I have to say first off that I prefer doppelbock, hefeweizen, quads & stouts. I knew there was a reason people called themselves hopheads and I was going to find out why. I've tried a number of DIPA's like Ruination etc., but have been put off by the lengthy bitterness at the end of each drink. I can understand that some drinkers will like that bitterness but it would have to be a studied, acquired taste for me. "
"Pours with a nice head and good carbonation. Just right. The smell is of citrus and stone fruits, while the taste is fruity up front followed by a long, long, long hop beautiful hop tastes followed a lasting astringent (but pleasant) bitterness. The malts are well integrated, but dominated by the hops. The mouthfeel is a tad sticky, but still relatively dry. For me, this is a great beer that is eminently drinkable."
"Appearance: Pretty, peachy, clear orange-autumn-amber. Bone-colored head is decent in size with fair retention."
"Very cloudy, almost murky, but vibrant burnt orange with a very small, slightly off-white, creamy head that quickly diminishes to light wisps of bubbles. The nose is huge. Heavenly hops aromas of pine, citrus and resin and backed up by a malt backbone that miraculously isnt completely shut out by the monster hops. The buttery toffee aroma it brings adds balance and makes the nose mouth-watering. Fabulous. The taste follows suit with more of the same balance between the two heavyweights. Theres the spicy, bitter hops that rush in full-force initially, but quickly back off a little to let the malts show through with a sweet flavor vaguely similar to an oatmeal cookie made with some brown sugar and a touch of molasses. A good amount of fruit in there, along with a little white wine and a hint of licorice. The finish is bitter and long, with hops oils refusing to let go of your cheeks and tongue. It has a medium-full body oily texture and low carbonation. What can I say, I think I set the bar a little to high on this one. However it almost met up to my expectations, I think mostly because of its fantastic aroma and great balance. Im not sure if Id consider this one of the best DIPAs in the world, but it certainly was an enjoyable experience that brought a smile to my face. Thanks, hero27, for the opportunity to try this big beer."
"I wasn't originally planning on reviewing this beer, but after tasting it I was more then obliged to give it the review it deserves. It pours a sublime amber color, with a medium sized white head that quickly turned to a small white lacing. Smell was full of complexities...lots of grassy earth, some herbs such as cinnamon, some grapefruit tastes, and plenty of hops to go around. Taste really made my day. The citrus flavors along with the intoxicating hop flavors completely complimented each other in a way that few other ipa's i have tried have achieved. The mouthfeel was absolutely perfect, balanced in every sense of the word...hoppy yet smooth to the point of being almost too good. If this beer wasn't suvch a rarity for me, I probably would have drowned my glass in one fell swoop, but under the circumstances, I savored every single sip. This beer is the reason why beer should be respected and revered as an artform. I would go so far as to say that this is the best Imperial IPA/IPA in general that I have ever tasted. I never thought that another brewery could exceed dogfishhead 90 minute ipa, but this one completelly blows it out of the water. If you ever see this beer or have the oppurtunity to get it, dont even ponder it for a second, just get it, i promise it will not fail to satisfy. One of the most lovely beers i've ever tried. EXTRA special thanks to warriorsoul for a beer enlightening experience like none other. Cheers"
"I cracked this bad boy open when the World Cup Finals went into overtime. I figured if this is to be a special occasion beer, now would be an appropriate time to partake. Also perhaps unconsciously in honor of the World Cup, I poured it into a gold-rimmed goblet."
Poured from a 22oz. bomber bottle from the brewery.
"Maximum respect to nflmvp for sending this my way in a trade. Poured into a Duvel tulip, Dreadnaught is a glowing orange mass with a dense, clotted ecru foam head. Orange and tangerine blossom citrus scents mix with a thick and sweet crystal malt aroma. Perhaps this isn't the freshest bottle, but I expected a bit more ""oomph"" in the aroma. Orange spiced sugar cookie dough, with a pleasant finishing pine and grapefruit pith bitterness. Some peach flavors emerge, as well. As it warms, more and varied fruit flavors become noticeable. This is much more balanced than I expected. Many reviews emphasize either an extreme blast of hops or a gargantuan sweetness, but I find that this strikes a nice equilibrium. There's a slightly sour, almost vegetal aftertaste. Quite interesting flavor profile, to be sure; many different hop-induced flavors are apparent, but not a single one stands out as a ""crutch"" flavor. There's lemon verbena, grapefruit, bitter orange, nectarine -- a very surprising and welcome panoply! It's not as juicy as I like my IPAs to be, but it's not too thick and syrupy either. 9.5% alcohol is expertly masked. All told, this is indeed an excellent DIPA, but not quite at the top of my list. Overall, it's beautifully crafted and surprisingly balanced. Glad to have had the opportunity to sample it."
"Hot damn. This is a fine treat. Thank you Lone Hill Liquors. Poured from a 1 Pint 6oz into my Stone pint glass. Nice golden amber colour. The smell is flowery and definitely super hoppy, very nice. Now I'm about to get cheesy but these are the damn notes I took so bare with me. ' One of the best beers I've ever had, hands down a nice symphony of Hops balanced to a dangerously drinkable treat. Give me MORE!"" This beer is absolutley outstanding. Balance is the key word. I forked over what I thought was a bit much to get my hands on this beer but it was all worth it. MMM HMMM."

"Here it is, the fabled Dreadnaught..."
Pours cloudy orange with a thick creamy head that leaves generous lacing.
Poured a hazy reddish orange color with a thick creamy head that left great lacing. and had good retention.
A big thank you to NFLMVP for this beer. 
The beer poured an nice amber with a minimal head that quickly faded. You could tell that this beer was so saturated with hop oils that it suppressed any chances of a big head.
"Flavor is citrusy, grapefruit, mandarin orange, peach, flowery aroma and hop bitterness."
"large 22oz bottle, served around 50f. Pours with small white head, odor is immediately recognizable as similar hop profile to Bitter & Twisted (harveistoun) or DFH 60 min, though dreadnaught is a good bit more citrusy in the taste. Fabulous nose, floral and citrus."
A: Two fingers of off-white head on top of a pale-copper beer. Crystal clear. Yearns to be sipped. Bottle is psychadelic and tempting.
"Ruby color with a rich, creamy, white head that slowly dissipates. Tiny bubbles shoot up the glass to the little island of head in the middle, leaves a nice lacing. Lemon, citrus, a lot of grapefruit aroma, actually smells thick with grapefruit. Taste is loads up with the lemon and citrus, but the grapefruit is most definately dominant, almost like a concentrated grapefruit juice. Be prepared, full of juicy hops. Thick, sticky on the tongue, full bodied and high carbonation explode flavors onto your tongue. This is great on occasion, but would probably wear out your palate if had too often. Get some if you can."
Wow... (a beer that actually lives up to the hype - what a pleasure)
"My IPA, DIPA, and Barleywine beinge as of late has been absolutely amazing. And this beer does not stray from the trend. A beautiful pour unlocks a frothy white head, crystal clear strawberry blonde appearance, great to look at. The aroma is complex and full....probably one of the best smelling beers I have had the pleasure of drinking., grapfruit dominates and oily pine hops are very present, there are some more subdued notes of dark fruits (strawberries/cherries) and some sweet carmel and some grainy undertones as well....very good. The taste is great as well...there is so much hapening it is difficult to pick out single flavors, initially the beer is sweet, the dark fruitiness is back with hints of cherries maybe even a bit peachy, in the middle there are some fancy grains and you begin to understand that this one is going to kick, the alchohol comes through a bit here too. Not in a repulsive amount....it adds so much to the beer. In the finish you get your hop blast that balances the beer and then throws it over the edge...hopped to the point of perfection. While waiting for sips (which is sooo dificult) you get a warmth all the way down from the alcohol and also some of the grains stick with the taste. The mouthfeel is creamy smooth and carbonated nicely."
"appearance: Pours a low white head that soon becomes only a slight ring around the glass. The beer is a light-medium amber in color, crystal clear."
Massive creamy white head that is exploding with aroma as I pour it. Hazy copper body with no visible carbonation bubbles. The head turns into a hop meringue as it sits for a couple of minutes.
"I had to wait to review this beer until I could do a tap sampling, although the bottled beer is also outstanding, the nose and taste are incredible on tap. Pours light gold to orange in color. Beautiful bouqet of citrusy hops here, I could sit and smell this for quite a while. Aromas are big bitter grapefruit, sweet peaches, and sweet oranges. The citrus and peach flavors come through very well in the taste, this medium bodied beer has a nice dry bitter bite to its finish that makes you drink more. Outstanding beer."
"WOW! Now this is a Double IPA. It has everything I love about the style (times two), wrapped up in this beer. It pours a beautiful dark orange with a big creamy head. The aroma just knocks you off your feet from the start. It is amazingly well balance with *huge* citric grapefruit and pine aroma appropriately matched with just enough big sweet fruity malts and sugars. The taste is phenomenal. It is creamy and bold with giant hops from beginning to end, matched by a fruity malt undertone. The grapefruit aftertaste seemed to linger infinitely, that is, until the next sip when we start all over again. As most DIPAs it would be unrealistic to consider a 9.5% ABV sessionable but this beer went down so quick and easy I wished I was sharing :)."
"Recieved in a trade from badbeer, Dreadnaught pours a dark gold color, with a one finger head. Quickly falls into a ring around the glass. A little lacing, but not a whole lot. Beautiful color though."
Absolutely awsome!
A: Golden on the orange and red side...clean and filtered. Nice pillowy head with tight bubbles. Head leaves nice lace behind as the head falls to just a wispy reminder.
Poured from a bomber into St. Bernardus Chalice
"FFF go above and beyond with this beer. its appearance, smell, and mouthfeel are exceptional. my only concern is that this beer is so good, so strong that it would be an effort to drink more than one. the mouthfeel is so palate shocking that once you go dread...the beer has a light golden color and forms a nice thick off white head. very enjoyable drink and worth every penny of the purchase price! nice job FFF!"
22oz Bomber hand delivered by Uncle Flip from Dark Lord Day.
"Over-the-top, but it hides the alcohol very well. Pours a clear tawny brown in color. Thick, white head that never really ever goes away. Nose is strong of ctrusy hops and a woody tang."
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter.
"Slightly hazy orange with a 1 inch fluffy white head. Amazing strong aroma ranging from sweet tropical fruits to piney grapefruity hops. Initially sweet with peaches, apples, pineapples and apricot. Immediately balanced & eventually overwhelmed by strong bitter grapefruit and piney/grassy hop character. Creamy, but crisp medium body. Swallows smoothly. Overall, an easy to drink, delicious dipa."
"22 oz bomber, poured into a tulip, a a glowing golden copper with two fingers of off-white head, decent retention, little lacing. Nose is incredibly fragrant, full of flowery hops, pine, tree sap, grapefruit rinds, lemon juice, wow is this a hoplovers dream. Taste starts with a nice solid caramel malt, slight biscuit, which quickly gives way to a huge wave of hops, citric, almost puckering grapefruit, finishing with a nice lingering bitterness. As the beer warms, a more piney note begins to come through on the finish. Gentle warming of alcohol in the throat, though hardly detectable in the taste. Even though this is all about the hops, there is a big malt backbone that balances them out and prevents the palate from being overwhelmed. Full bodied with a thick creamy feel, this is a luscious sipper. This is absolutely one of the best DIPAs out there, and I could drink way more than my budget would allow."
Thanks to grynder33 for this wonderful offering on New Beer Sunday (week 65)
"a - golden amber color, nearly translucent, inch-thick fluffy head with a yellowish tinge to it, nice lacing"
22 oz brown bottle.
"Dreadnaught Imperial IPA 22 oz. from refrigerator, poured into a Stone IPA pilsner flute. No date. "
Poured from a firkin on Dark Lord Day at the Three Floyds brewpub..
This beer pours a light orangish peach with some slight shades of brown. The head is a buttery light yellow egg shell film that left some very attractive strands of lace.
"Light copper color with rose hues. No real head formed at all from the pour, although it appears there is nice bubbly carbonation present. The sweet citrus hop smell is evident long before I even get my nose near the glass. The aroma is truly an intense floral, grapefruit hop experience. The flavor is bright and malty up front with more citrus hop flavor carrying into a rather clean finish. Not that bitter really. The alcohol also is well disguised. Light to medium in body, the carbonation feels subtle, but overall the mouthfeel carries a silky smoothness which is nice. Drinkablilty is great for this brew, even if it is a strong one. It wasn't the amazing experience I had expected, just a slight stronger version of the already good Alpha King in my opinion..."
"Appearance is deep golden and clean and clear, the head has fallen and almost dissapeared, but leaves a good strong lacing."
"An amber/orangish color, with a small head that forms and slowly laces down the glass. The aroma in one word, WOW! There is so much going on in the scent of this beer, citrus (mostly lemon and grapefruit), pine, floral, and earthy aromas. Man that is alot to take in. The taste has a good malt flavor right at the beginning, then the hops take over from there and dominate the flavor to very end. In the mouth it is very nice, it evenly coats the palate and the hops leave a nice dry finish. This beer is more drinkable to hop heads, not what I would call a good starter beer. This beer is truely a wonderful beer."
"Poured a nice translucent, orange color with medium-high carbonation and a white, soapy head that left behind plenty of lacing. The beer appears bright and brisk in my pint glass with a soft mellow texture...very appealing. I detect aromas of grass, pine, and hops. The taste follows the smell with a dry, bitter core that is dominated by hops (as would be expected). Flavors of grapefruit and citrus also come out; crisp and juicy. Good texture, but a bit too slick for in my opinion. Easy to drink despite the high ABV."
"Have had this numerous times on tap, and had to give it a shot on cask. It was less carbonated, little head to be seen, but you could see an oily slickness on top of the beer. The smell was sweeter than regular dreadnaught, but extremely pungent with the piny and fruity, citrusy hops. The mouth was sweet, an almost sugary bread like flavor with a dry finish that is followed by heavy hops, mainly citrus and some pine. Very good on the cask, it's a shame I may never get to drink it like this again."
"Tried this firkin style at Dark Lord Day. Bright caramel golden hue. Very little head, with slight lacing."
"22 ounce bottle. Dreadnaught pours out a clear orange color topped with a large head. Nice lacing. Bubbles appear to rise quite slowly. The aroma is a barrage of hops. There are notes of peaches, pine, and citrus. Very fresh smelling. The flavor is a big, oily hop flavor that lasts long after you finish sipping. Lots of fruitiness, especially peaches, oranges, and lemons. Although this beer is very bitter, a sticky sweetness comes through at the finish. Alcohol is deceiving. I wouldn't have guessed it to be as high as it is. This is a fine ipa, well worth the praise given it."
"Clear amber body with big frothy off-white head. Masive citrusy, piney hop nose, lots of sweetness as well, caramel, biscuit, candi sugar. Initial flood of citrus, orange, grapefruit, mango, apricots is followed by lots of sticky sweetness, caramel, sugar, toffee. Incredibly juicy. Finish is medium length with a touch of bitterness and lingering sweetness. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth. Very nice beer, quite a unique taste. Would like to see this in a 12oz. bottle as the sweetness gets a big overwelming after 22oz."
Poured from 22oz. bomber into a snifter glass.
22 oz. bomber. Pours with a big head. Great carbonation. Crystalline amber offset with chunky blobs. Better to let it settle.
"Poured a cloudy orange with a little head that faded to a light filmon top. Smelled very citrusy and tasted of sweet lemon and ornage zest. Mouthfeel was a little thick but acceptibly so, considering the ABV. Overall, the beer is very drinkable but a person better be careful with this one since the alcohol seems fairly well hidden."
"Pours a bright hazy amber with a thin but persistent head that disappears just a little too easily. In a Duvel tulip, it looks like a slightly darker Duvel. Aroma is massive and floral, bright sweet oranges and piney hops. I'd wash dishes with it."
"I have been trying to get a Dreadnaught for sometime and was able to get a hold of one at a Mirco - Six pack shop. My expectations were very high and I was worried I'd be dissapointed. It poured a nice copper color with a orange tint and a nice white head. The aroma is awesome and powerful. Hops, Hops, Hops. I waited all day for this taste and it was more than I expected. Super hop flavor just exploding in your mouth with a surprisingly smooth finish. Not real bitter, just right. I being a hop head could drink this all night and everyday, but it is a special beer and needs to be reserved for special occasions. The best beer I ever had!"
Thanks to highclassdrinker for this one. I think I came out on the good end of this trade.
"Pours a nice, deep orange with a small head that goes away fairly quickly. Leaves thin rings of lacing. Aroma is fresh floral, grassy hops. Taste....yummm....delicious. Grassy, citrus hops shine through every sip. A little piney as well with just a tad of sweetness before the slight alcohol sting kicks in. Full bodied and a bit slick from the hop oils. Excellent brew. I could drink this one...and another...and another...."
I have to start by thanking David from The Publick House for hooking us up with this beer. Thanks dave. :-) (from Paige and Tanya as well)

22 oz bomber.
"Its all been said about this one hasnt it? Ive been pondering what I could add for several days but Im drawing a blank accept to say that his beer lives up to the hype. I am no hop head, but Dreadnaught works on a level beyond its insane IBU. It is crafted so cleverly as to be one of the most balanced and drinkable beers I have put to my lips. For a beer with these ABV and IBU ratings to be so stable and equalized in every way is astonishing to me. "
"22 oz bomber. Poured cold into pint glass. Small, good retaining head."
Appearance: Pours a clear medium amber color with a bubbly light beige head; retention is not great and there isn't that much lacing
"Bottle Pours a hazy golden with a creamy off white head. Head fades but produces some quality lacing. Has a great hoppy aroma of citrus and spruce. A nice medium body with good carbination. Has a slick texture. A big duration with a great finish.This is a solid beer. Very hoppy and robust. Really sits on the tastebuds for some time. Has a strong bitterness that starts slow and revs up to a wonderful ending. This is real good stuff, I wouldnt recommend a 12 oz bottle, youll just want more."
"Bright and cloudy reddish orange with a large tiny-bubbled head which ultimately falls to a thin table and solid ring. Smell is citrus with smoked almonds backing it all up. The taste is a creamy hit of hops and oils. There is an alcohol burn that starts midway and peaks in the finish. This has a great mouthfeel, quite full for such a hop monster. I can finish a bottle, but anything more might be overkill."
"Good three finger head that eventually receded into one and lingered until the end, with thick lacing - Nice hazy, orange - copper hue, expected IPA standard, poured from 22 oz. bomber. Nose of citrus- specifically grapefruit ad infinitum!! - A little bit of the malt playing the strong silent type in its backbone role was occasionally asserting itself -only to have grapefruit take center stage, as well as left and right !! Very inviting to us hopheads!! This is exactly how it tasted as well - grapefruit all over the place, on top of the caramel malt backbone , and more grapefruit again. Smooth mouth with moderate carbonation, went down very easy wtih thick hop oil coating left behind. I like this a lot, and find it easy to drink - excellent ale !!"

"This is wonderful beer. It stands right up therewith 90 minute and the Pliny twins, which are my bellweathers for DIPAs. It looks like a ferrari, smells like apple pie and tastes like the your first kiss. Ok, not exactly, but it is a stunner on all counts."
Poured from large Three Floyds bottle into a wine glass. Deep copper color (very clear) thin head. 
"A hazy honey-orange as it bounds into my glass.. A drity off-white head is nice and foamy, and just under one finger.."

Tons of thanks to WarriorSoul for this one. . .
"A: Pours a clean and clear golden with orange tints. A small head quickly subsides, leaving no lacing."
"My favorite style of beer is any variation of an IPA. I have had a LOT of IPA's/Imperial (double) IPA's, and I must say that I have NEVER had a beer of this style taste better than Dreadnaught! This beer is so much in a league of its own. I love the grapefruit flavor to this beer. I am not sure what these folks use for hops, but I am guessing maybe Cascade, Amarillo, or Nugget. Take a whiff of this beer! I can't get over how floral it is. This is such a gem. The closest beer I have had in flavor to this one lately of a similar style is Troeg's Nugget Nectar, but this Dreadnaught would still take top prize in my book! Grab a bottle! Cheers!!!"
Thanks to Bigs for the bottle.
"22oz bottle, Riley's...been wanting to try this for a very very long time"
"I'm often skeptical of a review that has the same score, across the board. This one happens to be very good, with respect to EVERY category (some pushing exceptional)."
"A - it pours a perfect amber color, with a nice off-white head that dissapated rather quickly. It also left very little lacing. "
22 oz Bottle purchased at Spiritus Fermenti in Providnce for $7.99.
"I've been looking forward to tasting any Three Floyds beers and as a hophead I'm psyched to be trying this one. I thank fitzIPAtrick's kind generosity for the ability to do so. This beer kicks major @rse! The aroma and taste are so amazing that I just don't know which one I like better. The beer pours a clear copper/amber color with a nice creamy head. Of course, the smell is all hops - citrus, pine, grapefruit - to me anyway. The taste is an amazing fruity hopness and, believe it or not, a fine malt backbone as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. For the sheer hop kick and high alcohol, this beer is surprisingly drinkable. Must...have...in...Mass."
22 oz. bottle poured into a pilsner.
"kind of new to the beer world, but this is the best i.p.a. i've tasted thus far. this beer is very hard to find in connecticut (it is not distributed here).came across a couple of bombers. "
Got this bomber from BigErn in a small trade. Many thanks BigErn!
22oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. 
"Bright copper with bits of suspended particles and a very thin head that quickly forms a ring around the glass. You can smell this one from across the room - huge, oily, resinous, piney, citrusy - EVERYTHING. Very complex, multi-faceted aroma that could destroy your nose if you're not careful. Amazing sticky hop oil flavor packed full of juicy citrus fruits and a solid sweetness. My mouth is tingling - its almost as if I've been sucking on an orange rind. Definately full bodied and warming. This is very intense and strong yet I promptly inhaled mine like it doesn't cost $11 a bottle."
"Color is sparkling brass with some large bits of sediment floating around and small head with little retention. Though not to worry, I can smell this from miles away. Resinous explosion followed by huge pine, floral, earth, and citrus. Aroma of a coniferous forest surrounded by an orchard. Tantalizing. Vicous in texture and awesomely hopped. Pine like crazy. I can't even begin to fathom what's going on, but its along the lines of amazing. Mouthfeel is complex and full...perfect crisp medium carbonation. Velvety creamy and sticky sweet. There's no way a beer with such an awesome aroma and taste could have any drinkability problems."
This beer is a beast!
"I finally got to try this (thanks Beer Yard) and wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. It poured a clear copper with 1/2 inch white head. The smell indicates it will live up to the hype, citrus hits first then spicy and piney with some grassy smells thrown in. The taste starts off slightly bitter, then there are orange and grapefruit flavors floating around, with a bready background holding it all together. Good level carbonation leads to a smooth dry finish. I am surprised with all the hop flavors that it isn't oily, I guess that's one of the reasons it's rated so high. It definitely lives up to the hype; it knocks the 90-minute IPA out of the top IIPA spot for me."
From a 22oz bomber. 
"An insanely delecadent IPA! At my initial thoughts, it must be extremely difficult to get that much flavor, hop bitterness, balance, and alcohol into such a smooth and easy drinking beer. But on the other hand, the taste makes me think it's effortless. This symbiotic relationship is the beauty of the beer."
Executive Summary: Well worth the $10.50 I had to shell out in a take-out joint. I may just go for the case.
"Poured a slightly hazed golden-toned copper color into a pint glass. Left a full finger foamy off white head that slowy declined to moderate glass-clinging lacing. Aroma is sweet and hoppy, slightly piny and citrus hops overwhelm the nose. Tastes absolutely perfect, hoppy as hell, tastes mainly of grapefruity citrus, yet excellently paired with an ideal sweetness of malt to back this superb hop profile. Leaves a tasty hop bitterness in the aftertaste that pushes for more of this IPA . Mouthfeel is on the lighter end of the spectrum, borderline medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Very drinkable brew, absolutely love it. Without a doubt will seek out again in the near future, with American Double IPA's being one of my favorite styles, this may be my new favorite beer."
"Yeah! Tipped a super clean pour for some crystal clear copper coloured joy juice. The colour of a pretty penny, only worth about nine hundred times more. Plus tax and deposit! The head blew up off a proper pour. A white pillow that crumbled in the alcoholic undertow. Appears to be properly carbonated with some fat and fast bubbles and some slow tiny ones. Lace clinging like frothy spit to a window. "
"Light orange body, slight haze. Three fingers of airy bone china colored bubbles that tops off with a level though craterous surface. Good lacing quickly evident."
Gorgeous orange color. Thin head with a little bit of lacing.

"This bottle is a couple months old, I'd like to try it fresher sometime. Pours a peach copper color with a medium sticky off white head. Great lacing around the glass."
On tap at 3 Floyd's brewpub...
"Mostly clear copper in color, with light carbonatin and a thinnish off-white head that lingers and laces the glass. This beer is dominated by a juicy, orangey hop aroma w/ hints of pine, accompanied bysome light caramel notes struggling to make themselves noticed. Firtst thing noticed in the mouth -- wow, this is pretty damn hot in terms of the alcohol. The hops are very piney, with some sharp grapefruit character as well."

Found a few 22oz bottles at a local specialty house. $8.99 per bottle seemed a little steep but I bought 3. 
22 Oz bottle Sampled through the efforts of SS 05 BIF and Meathookjones.
"This bottle was brought back from Chicago thanks to my friend, Autumn. Great stuff."
"I've waited. Ohhhh, how I have waited. And now, this dog has had his day. According to my fellow BA's, this beer is the King of my favorite style, the mighty and mystical American Double IPA. For years have I sought and failed. Then, through the good fortune of a trade with Beerbeing, the bottle was mine. I stared at the bottle for a week. And now I must have her. Now, studying for a financial exam that will allow me to get paid more money and give me some letters after my name, I decide it's time for a study break. It's time for Dreadnaught. "
"Holy fucking hell. This is damned close to IPA perfection, and by far the most balanced, well integrated DIPA i've ever had the pleasure to imbibe. This said, I give almost everything a 4 in appearance. Pours hazy dull yellow-orange with a nice white head that holds a respectable collar throughout, with some lacing. Smell is incredible, smells like fresh hops, completely fresh, green leafy hops, with a slight caramel undertone. Incredible, simply fantastic. The taste is like the smell x10. Fresh leafy leafy hops, oily hop essence, backed by a substantial, but not overly done malt body. If this brew has any faults, it could be just a tad less sweet, but it's pretty damned good all the same. Hop profile is like no other IPA i've ever had, terrific, and terribly hard to define. To me it's not citric, pithy or piney, like so many are, just fresh leafy greenness. Starts off slightly sweet across the palate then leafy green oily hops hops hops hops, slightly spicy hops through the finish. It's almost not bitter at all, not that bitter is bad, but this is hop essence sans bitter harshness, and it's awesome. Body is relatively full with with decent, but not strong carbonation, i wouldn't have minded a slight bit more. Drinkable? This is more drinkable than 95% of the IPA's I had that i drank before NC popped the cap. ABV is undetectable. Absofuckinglutely incredible. Second...perhaps third best beer I've had to date, and that's saying a mouthfull. My god, the hop burps after this ar eincredible."
"Holy freakin' crap! This beer is fantastic! Upon pouring, it doesn't look all that special, just a slightly cloudy, yellow-gold brew with a nice white head, but then you smell it. Oh man. This is by far the best DIPA that I've ever smelled. Very, very hoppy, just all over the place hops. The taste basically follows the ssmell, with a truckload of hops nicely balanced out by a good, but not overpowering amount of malt. A perfectly balanced beer. While I was getting cottonmouth from the extreme hops, and the beer was bitter, at no time did I want to stop drinking this beer. The malt does it's job perfectly. Wow. "
Clear orange amber with a good-sized light tan head. Sticky rings of lace were left around the glass. Big up front hoppy punch aroma with plenty of citric and piney hop notes coming on strong. Some nice floral notes and a solid sweet malt backbone with some light toasty notes as well. Flavor is equally big with plenty of strong hops and a nice big malt taste. Sweet caramel and toasty malts contend with the big bitter grapefruit notes. Piney resins with some earthiness. Perhaps a bit sweeter overall than I would like it but its damn tasty. Ends with a nice bitter sweet grapefruit bite. Pretty thick and hefty on the palette with some of the bitter tongue raking expected of DIPAs. Very drinkable stuff as well as it went down like a pale ale. Great brew that I wish was easier to come by.
"Pours a nice hazy gold color, white heads forms quickly and thickly, but fades almost as fast."
thanks to orbitalr0x for the bottle!
from the hudson acme
"The beer pours brassy amber with a thick white head, which recedes to a thin cap. Each sip leaves a ring of lace on the glass. It is a very attractive beer."
"Thanks to OldSock for this bomber, which I shared with my burgeoning non-BA roommate."
09/15/05- Purchased via mail order through Archer's Liquors in Chicago.
"Simply amazing. Poured a coppery orange color with a tight white head that quickly faded away. The aroma was a sweet grapefruit smell with a hint of pine. The first sip is all hops but that is mated well with the surprising malt in this beer. The mouthfeel was a medium build, with a pleasant film left on your tongue. Overall this is an excellent beer. The great flavor masks the higher ABV, but again, this is an excellent beer"
"S: Out of the bottle and in to a pint glass, I bought a bottle of this stuff while I was in chicago, and brought it back and drank it in SF."
Pours a clear amber/orange with a medium sized white head that does leave some lace. Hard to believe something so innocent looking contains so many hops.
I received this one in a trade with cmaruchak...thanks a million!!!
I served this beer in a pub glass. 
"hazy orangy amber with a not quite white head. huge piney citrus nose like fresh cut cedar. has a grapefruit rind type smell. sprucy as well. herbal qualities sneak in as it warms. the smell really builds the anticipation. the taste is hands down the most complex that i've ever had from such an unbalanced beer. grapefruit rind, bitter lemon rind, resinous citrusy pine sap. beneath this is an herbal asprin quality due to the amarillo hopsprobably. the bitterness hits you like a ton of bricks, but it also has a sweetness provided by some of the hop flavors too, that does it's small part to try balance the brew, but ultimately falls short to the coating hop wrecking ball of bitterness. the alcohol is well covered, but it is slightly warming going down. it has a medium body with a very coating quality to it. the carbonation is delicate providing a very smooth drinking experience. overall 4.5 drinkability because while absolutely delicious i'm not sure i'll even be able to taste the end of the bottle. this is an absolutely balls to the wall double IPA, that proves three floyds is one of the best breweries out there. an absolute hop bomb, hop heads seek this out."
"Absolutely huge Cascade bud pine hop aroma. one of the best smells ever in a beer, reminds me of the freshly cut tree smell on the green chain section of a lumber mill i worked at years ago."
"I am staring at APA perfected. If an artist, 100 years from now when MillBudco, a subsidiary of AOL Time GE Virgin MegaCorp, makes the three types of beer Americans are allowed to buy and people want to take a look back into the dark ages at what beers used to look like, he'll paint this."
"I may have found the perfect beer for my tastebuds - and nose. This is one amazing olfactory and taste bud experience. Holy hops/malt balance, Batman!"
On tap at the brewery.
"Clear amber with a thick, bright white head. Very good retention, with foam remaining in the glass at the end, and it left a heavy layer on the inside of the glass. You could smell this one as soon as the cap was popped... Pine, pine, pine, like walking in a pine forest, but very clean. There's also a bit of faint malt hiding back there as well. Some malt sweetness and a pine/citrus hoppiness to start with an aggressive bitterness. Light alcohol flavour and warmth creeps in at the middle and continues through the finish. The pine flavour really hits you after you swallow and stays quite strong for a long time. The only complaint would be that it's a bit one dimensional as far as hop flavours go, but that's a very minor complaint. Smooth, moderately low carbonation. Moderately full body, a bit creamy and viscous. Overall, a world class DIPA with excellent balance for the insane hopping rate. Definitely a beer to seek out and experience. Just don't expect to be able to taste anything afterwards. Thanks Viggo!"
"What no better way to review your first beer then reviewing one that is such highly regarded. A friend and I split the last case at Three Floyds, so I feel very grateful."
22 oz. brown bomber.
"Dreadnaught pours a clear golden amber, big white head forms, super lacing on the glass. Smell is like strolling through a pine forest while inhaling hop resin, some malt is detectable though. The taste is all PINE, insane pine all over, as your taste buds are destroyed the substantial malt character begins to show itself, and the end of the beer is very balanced, with a nice caramel sweet maltiness offsetting the huge hops. Mouthfeel is very full, with perfect carbonation. Any beer that is hoppy enough to be painful must be good, this beer is corrosive, but oh so good. I want a Dreadnaught IV."
"Yet another fine creation from Three Floyds. Ahhh, the nose, the delight of big pine oils - spruce - (pine of a midnote vs. the divine loft of silver pine); this married with sweet of both malts and pine resin, a delicate but detectable citrus mix, softened with a mere touch of butter. This Dreadnaught poured a hazed (cleared midway through) golden orange with a hard pour settling to a 2 finger creamy topping. Ten minutes let it rest to a creamy wash. The up-spring of carbonation held fast for half a pint and rested. Sweet malts begin the taste (suprised me) with a hasty following of hops as they hit the first third of the tongue and reside on the roof - sticking. They remain there to enjoy for a near endless time, sometimes yielding to a bitterness. Somewhere in here the taste and dryness of grapefruit compliments. The alcohol is well hidden yet in time comes up in the physical."

Props go out to BA Beerguy (Frank) for the sample. 
A clean amber/orange beer. Has a nice bubbly white head with some nice lace. The aroma is all hops with atleast two distinctive hop characteristics standing out. The first is a bittersweet grapefruit. The second is a peppery spicey hop and the two armwrestle for equal time. The peppery hop hits your mouth first and slowly gives way to a sweet malt note that quickly segues to the bittersweet grapefruit finish.
"Nothing surpasses the joy I feel when a new batch of Dreadnaught hits the local stores. Well, almost nothing. If you are planning to consume this beer it must be poured into the proper glassware. If you do not have this, wait to consume the beer."
"This poured from the bottle a deep copper color with a thick cream colored head. The head retention on the beer was astounding, it stuck around forever. The nose has tons of hop. Every possible character of an over the top hop beer. Hop flower, grass, fresh cut hay, pine and a ton of grapefruit citrus come across in the nose. The taste has an almost orange hop flavor that morphs into the expected grapefruit. The pine character remains and provides a sharp bitterness on the side of the tongue. Malthmmm whats that? There is a defined sweetness, a mild caramel on the finish, a slick mouth feel and a nice alcohol warming. The drinkability is good, not great, but this beer is still a wonderful experience."
"First off thanks to hoppedup for sharing his bottle,pours a hazy burnt orange with a nice two finger fluffy head,aromas are straight hop all the way bigtime pine and spruce not much citrus just like an evergreen pine forest.To be expected this was totaly hop based big pine and very and I mean very resiny it made the tongue curl it was so piney and dry.One dimensional to say the least didnt pick up any malt although I know it was there,a hop bomb no doubt and very good at that."
"Poured into a snifter, a mildly hazy light orange. Nice head and good lacing. "
Was really looking forward to this one. This is the 4th of a group of three floyds that my brother brought home from Indiana. Saved it for the 4th of July. Was very pleased with the other 3. Poured a golden/orange color with considerable chill haze and minimum head. The chill haze dissipates as the beer warms which confirmed that it was chill haze and not floaters from being bottle conditioned. Leaves nice lacing. Smell is all hops and lives up to what i was hoping for. Taste however just didn't deliver. Overly sweet caramel flavor that overpowers the hops. Alchohol is well hidden. Overall just did not live up to what i was hoping for. I have another one in the cellar and will re-review if my opinion changes.
"Bomber obtained by a buddy from the brewery in spring 2005 and consumed about a week later (review recorded on paper). Pours a two finger off white head over slightly cloudy and light orange or copper colored liquid. Smells of grapefruit pith, gentle pine needle, and apricot. Much more fruity than I was expecting. Tastes is rich sweet with nice grapefruit bitter. Not too rough of the grassy co-humulone but certainly enough to intrigue. The hops hit front and high, then they drop lower and to the back of the mouth. Great bitter with a nice aromatic hoppy aftertaste. Fruits are gentle and consist of apricot and (with reaching) some pear. Really nice mouthfeel, it's not just thick, it's thick like an oatmeal stout. Carbonation was moderate to md-heavy. The best offering I've had from 3F."
"App: Deep, deep orange and cloudy with a thick white head that laces the glass."
"Had this from a 22oz bomber I bought for $10 at the Northeast Taproom in Reading, Pa. I'm always a little anxious when I buy something at a bar because you never know how old it is. The bottle was not dated, but I figured this beer would age well, anyway."
Thanks to cubedbee for this one.
Bottle: Poured a clear medium brown color ale with a huge off-white foamy head with pretty good retention. Aroma is totally dominated by floral hops of the kinds I wish we would see more of. Taste is very particular and not what I expected or what I had taste before in other Imperial IPA. Delicate floral sweet hops on top of well balance malt. Body is full and alcohol is well hidden. Not the malt and hops overpowered monster I was expecting but more of well balance and extremely enjoyable beer.
"So, would those be Amarillo hops lending definition to the aroma? Smells delicious, with a fair measure of bubblegum. Shows refined clarity with slow CO2 and a soft beige head. "
"This was an incredibly fresh draft version consumed right at the brewery. It is deceptively light in color for a beer of this character. The head is not big, but forms a nice tight lacing. The smell and taste are dominated by a huge flowery hops and sweet malt. It was so fresh and hoppy on tap. The mouthfeel is great, well rounded and substantial. The drinkability mainly suffers due to ABV. Otherwise it is very drinkable, just don't drink too many."
"Slightly hazy apricot colored, with a full inch of lumpy meringue sitting on top of the glass. It recedes to about a half inch, and there it sits and waits for me."
"Flowing from the 22oz bomber, this hazy ale fills my snifter with a very attractive deep orange. About a finger of head rises to top off this beautiful brew. Oh yeah, this is what an IPA should smell like! Lots of citrous aromas dominate the nose. Very clean piney hops add to this powerful aromatic experience. The smell is completed by a little caramel and malt. The taste is wonderful. Hops are quick to attack the palate with sharp citrous and pine notes. The hops are wonderfully potent, but amazingly not overpowering. Sweet caramel and malt flavors form a solid backbone for the taste. There are some spices present that dance with the hops and tantalize the tongue. This is IPA on a Biblical level! Mouthfeel is big, creamy, and smooth - at the same time staying sharp from the hops. Residual hop oils coat your mouth and provide a bitter dry finish, although some of the malt and spice also stick around. Alcohol, although slightly warming, is well hidden in the taste. Wonderfully drinkable, I want to drink Dreadnaught until the day I die. I was a little skeptical about paying $9 for a bomber, but I wish I would have bought everything the store had! "
22 oz bomber.
"I started out wondering why I was paying $11 for a 22 oz beer, and ended up wishing I'd bought a second one. Pours nicely out of the gate, a little more than light amber in color, thick, and with a nice creamy head. Smell was great...grapefruit citrus aroma characteristic of Alpha King, but both richer and smoother. Satisfyingly thick mouthfeel that begs you to savor the brew before swallowing. Those who can hold off on that are rewarded by huge citrus, with maybe a hint of pine. With the finish, the hops kick in, but in a completely accessible way...not sweet and bitter but not, if that makes any sense. "
"Crystal clear, light amber with a minimal but creamy looking head, that rebuilt itself with each sip, leaving a bit of lace behind. Slow and steady streams of bubbles were visually evident. From the second I opened the bottle, I was blasted by massive aromas of grapefruit and orange blossom honey. Sticking my nose into my imperial pint glass revealed big-time apricot and pine sap. I couldn't wait to try it and then, goddamn, I said goddamn! Hugely spicy and super sweet all at once. The bittering dries the mouth and builds gradually and lasts until who knows when; I couldn't wait long enough to find outthis stuff is top notch. Another gulp. Sweet, honey-laced grapefruit pith. A pine tree that offers grapefruit instead of pine cones. A perfect balance of malt and hops, that although powerful, neither is too aggressive. There's always something that balances the other out. The mouth was unbelievable. Fine carbonation coupled with a medium-thick, slick body contribute to an amazingly delicate feeling on the tongue; it's as if someone draped a piece of silk across my tongue. The mouthfeel and taste combo easily garners a perfect score. I always question the price of 3F beers in my area but this one was well worth it. Glad I bought two."
Thanks to the very generous onecrazymofo for this one...one of many.
Pours out a radiant deep orange with a thick rocky head of light yellow foam. Monster lacing in my tulip. I'm just going to go ahead and call this the most beautiful beer I've ever seen. 
Pres: 650 cc bottle with insane looking British officer and an assassin lurking in the background
"Appearence: In my Goblet it's a glowing orange with a thin, creamy beige head."
"Pours out a somewhat thick and viscous pale amber color, with a modest off white head. Wow, the aroma on this one is huge. CITRUS!!! wow, grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, pine mint, damn near every hop aroma you can imagine. Just wonderful on the nose. Wow, this is not as bitter as I imagined. There is a very nice caramel malt backbone to this one. The sweetness is balanced by the magnificant hop flavor. Super citrus taste, but not in the puckering grapefruit manner. More of a citrus spectrum. Moutfeel is creamy, and highly drinkable for the octane on this one. I would love to drink this one more, but at the $9.99 price tag my wallet would be very mad at me. Please lower the price on this one to something more reasonable and I wont drink anything else"
"Appearance: Into a tulip, this beer is an orange-golden with a sticky and well retained head of yellow stained lace."
Served in an imperial pint glass
"Clear orange, lasting tan head. Light even bubbles. Fresh rich hops carried by alcohol in the aroma. Big sweet malts balanced by fresh aggressive hop flavors and robust bitterness punctuate this brew. Lively mouth feel. Malty hoppy finish. This is one really well made brew. A bit on the strong side, so be wary."
"Pours a nice copper color, with a beautiful head, good head retention and good lacing. Smell of hops, and some metallic aroma. Taste is okay, kind of sharp and acidic, hops are there, but not enough for an Imperial or Double IPA. Mouthfeel is appropriate, not great, but not bad. I don't think I'd look for this again, especially not if they are raising the price to $10 a bomber."
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for this particular bottle, but also to AKSmokedPorter for the duece!"
"Pours out to a glowing amber color in the glass with a medium-sized head. The aroma starts from the top of the bottle and comes on strong right at the pour all the way to settling, giving forth a pleasant nasal experience that reveals citrus and plums. The taste is absolutely superb, with grapefruit and pine coming to the forefront. It is so well balanced, despite its abundance of hops, that I was taken aback at just how balanced it is. The alcohol in my opinion, is remarkably well hidden. This is a great beer."
"On-Tap in Bethlehem, Pa. Guess where!? Dark red from the tap with not much of a head. The aromas are subdued as well, but I get some nice hop whiffs, and that distinctive Dreadnaught fruit punch aroma as well! Perhaps this keg is a bit off? The taste is a hoppy mix of sweet fruity malts, and mind-bending hops....nice! The mouthfeel seems light and watery for this brew. It almosts seems like a cask brew, but this was off of the tap! The drinkabilityy, of course, is awesome, as this is a FFF brew! Hmmmm, this was an interesting pint! Maybe the keg was a bit old? Who knows, this shit is still awesome!"
"My first Dreadnaught. I'm really excited for this beer. The beer pours a dark hazy orange color. The head is two fingers that sticks around as well. The nose is full of earthy hops, with some grapefruit in the background. There is also some nice caramel in there as well. The flavor is The hop is really nice in this one. Its not dominated by one hop flavor in my taste. The bitter from the hop is rather strong, and the malts have a touch of bready background. The finish has a really strong apricot flavor onthe finish. The alcohol is also rather apparent as well. The feel is thick and nice. Drinkability suffers just a bit from being so strong in flavor and the apparent alcohol. This is a good beer, but I might need a few more to make a real decision on it."
"Bottle Conditioned. This is the last beer of a massive evening with Spiesy. We warmed up with some lesser beers before finishing with the two big beers of the night, this and Hop Rod Rye Ale. Sadly not impressed with either. Appearance of this is a slightly cloudy lightish amber with a very slight foam on top, slightly below average. The aroma is of an American Pale Ale - the sticky malt and the orange and grapefruit hinted hops rise in a pleasant, though not astounding manner. Nothing impressive so far. Mouthfeel is tingly and medium bodied - not quite as stickly as expected, though it has a tackiness that clings slightly to the mouth. Acceptable. The alcohol is well used to bring flavour and warmth. Flavour is orange flowers with a smearing of honey. There is a wow! intensity about this, and that seems the biggest asset. Impact. The flavours don't move much from front to finish, though it does linger pleasantly, shifting as it fades in the mouth - but here I am struggling to find good things about this, the 5th best beer in the world. It's nice. It's big. It has impact. It lingers nicely in the mouth. It's really not that great."
Appearance: Pours a cloudy orange/carmel color with a small ivory head. It leaves beautiful lacings down the glass.
"Dark golden in color. Nice lacing. Strong bitterness that's pretty rough around the edges. Floral / grassy hop flavor. Somewhat lacking in malt balance. All in all pretty decent. I'm aware this is an Imperial Pale Ale, but I would have preferred a better malt / hop balance."
I am having this beer to celebrate my 1 year anniversary of being a beeradvocate member.
"I would like to thank the great Iowa BA, BuckeyeNation for hooking me up with a bomber of this awesome stuff."
"This one pours an orange color with a nice head. The aroma was way strong and smelled very strongly of hops - I don't know what kind, but it was way strong. The hops dominate the flavor as well - very strong, but somewhat well balanced. Extremely good for an I2PA."
I was lucky to find this 22 oz. bomber...as I've been so excited to try it.
"22oz bottle purchased at Vienna Whole Foods, Vienna, VA."
"Pours bright orange with a small, bubbly head."
"Appearance: Brassy, hazy golden color with a moderately-sized off-white head; lots of broken lace and moderate carbonation."
"IPA (including Double IPA) is one of my favorite styles, so I opened after much anticipation. Color was orange-copper, and slightly hazy. Aroma was potent, there was no questioning there are plenty of hops in this one. Mouthfeel was chewy and a bit sticky/resiny. "
"22oz Bomber bottle...thanks Ed you are a King among men as a trade partner. Decanted into my tulip glass as a deep amber orange liquid with a frothy sticky 2 finger off white cap. Great aroma: musty grapefruit, hint of pine... some malt sweetness...a hop heads dream. Starts big with ample citrus-spruce hops up front and a huge malt body to balance it off... then some salty- soapy tastes where the alcohol tastes mingle with the hops on a creamy delivery... then the finish is long with citrus pine bittering going to more metallic tastes...what a great big APA! I love it...Ed...send more!!!"
Bomber Size bottle - The perfect serving size !
"This is packaged in a 22oz bomber on which the label has fell off, brought to me by a friend traveling through Indiana. It has the Three Floyds cap on it but that is the only identifier besides the employees at Kahns swearing that it is Dreadnaught."
"Despite a relatively light color for what I had expected, this beer has a lot of depth to the appearnce. The color is deep and rich and the head, while not so much big, is thick and foamy. The smell is hoppy and spicy with some chocolate flavors. The taste is very spicy with a thich hoppy taste, with tons of syrupy pine and some good citrius. The mouthfeel is perfect for the beer, and although the beer is hefty with alcohol, you wouldn't necesserily stop while drinking the beer to notice."
22 oz brown bomber with the funky label design and one of the coolest bottle caps I have seen in a long time. 
Aroma: Pinesap & Grapefruit infused into a solid malt base. Nice juicy fresh hops busting out of this puppy.
First off: Big thanks to deejaydan for the chance to sample this.
Sampled from a bomber.
"Appearance  The bomber poured out a cascade of dark, hazy orange beer. The head built from the bottom. I enjoyed watching it rise through the liquid and open up at the top like a bed of tulips blooming on fast-forwarded film."
Big thanks to Buckeyenation for giving me a chance to try this brew!
Orange / yellow in color with a one inch head. Some nice lacing developed. The aroma is full of floral hops and a bit of malt. The flavor is huge as kicked up malt levels are matched perfectly with the grassy hop bitterness. Citrus tones (leaning towards orange) and mildly noticeable alcohol round out the taste. 
"I think what I like most about this beer is its solid nature. It is an all around solid great beer. It is not the most complex, but that works in its favor here. Sometimes, a complex beer loses points in drinkability with me because after one, my palate is tired. Not so with this one."
"Another American IPA beaten to death with hops. I reckon this would be great if they toned the hops down a bit. Massive grapefruit, lychee and pine-citrus (pine-o-clean) flavours. Malts are smooth lightly sweet, but quickly (too quickly) hidden by the fatty hops. Tasted like deepfried hops in the end, little balance. I understand that its not really meant to be elegant or anything, but it could have done with some restraint or something. I don't even think i liked as much as the score i gave it."
Thanks to Uncle Jimbo for the sample!
"Bomber bottle I was very happy to pick up on a recent trip to Maryland. Pours a lovely light golden/orangy cloudy kind of color. Alcohol, fresh fruit, hops in the nose. Suburb tan,creamy tiny bubble head. Leaving intricate, fine lacing. Flavor notes of rum soaked raisins, a ton of malt, nice crisp and balancing hops. Finish is suberb. Alcohol obviously present, warming. Yummy, yummy stuff. Wish I could purchase locally. Seek out and consume."
"I would have to say that this gets a perfect score. Golden orange appearance with an almost white head and nice sticky lacing drapes the glass. Sweet, citrus hops taste all the way through. Taste is vibrant with intense tropical fruits, and nice bittering hops. Alcohol is very well masked. The benchmark for which all IIPA's should be compared to."
Pours a hazy orange with a billowy white head that floats on the surface of the beer like a great big cloud. Fantastic lace sheets the glass with each sip.
This beer is orange. Full hop nose that waters the mouth. Citrus and pine all at the same time! I pick up some carmal malt somewhere in this hop explosion. Slight prick from the carbonation and a silkly smooth mouthfeel. High ABV is well concealed. I sure could go for another!
"This beer impressed me as soon as I began pouring it. It was practically incandescent orange out of the bottle. It struggled to put up just a little bit of white fuzzy head, but couldn't quite achieve much more than a thin layer of fizz that lasted the entire glass. The smell is dominated by citrus and piney hop notes. The taste was simply divine. A bit of caramel malt sweetness lead the way into a citrus and pine hop overload with a dominant tangerine fruitiness. Mouthfeel is very light, carbonationg relatively low. This brew drinks so very easily, but the hops and alcohol would soon put me off to sleep after a few of these. Truly a great relaxing brew."
"From a twenty two ounce bomber, this beer poured out a light and golden color and had a touch of murkiness. The beer was topped off with an average sized head of creamy foam. The complex aroma is very floral and lively. Piney with touches of freshly mown grass. Fruits like oranges and lemons are strong. The taste is perfectly sweet and full with fruity malts and an estery bitterness. This beer is quite drinkable for being so strong. Also, it isnt as heavy tasting as I thought it would be. There is a sticky sweet orange fruitiness that coats the tongue."
"I realize this is actually a decent beer, but I'm going to have to be the dissenting opinion here. Maybe I just don't have a taste for IPA's (and I don't, in general), but to me, this one tasted like burned popcorn. Everything else about the beer is great! But, the taste is off-kilter to what beers should taste like."
"Pours a cloudy, glowing orange/amber. Medium sized off-white head that imparts pockets of thick lace on the glass."
"This is great stuff! I had the Dreadnaught initially a year ago on tap, but recently I managed to get a case of bombers, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The bottled Dreadnaught poured a deep, slightly reddish amber with a full, fluffy off-white head. The initial smell is of imposing hops, grapefruit, roses, and sweet pine. The taste is rich and textured: lots of strong hoppiness to be sure, but underneath there's so much going on--bitter candied caramel. The mouthfeel is medium thick, and the alcohol is disguised cleverly, but clearly it is potent. Too bad this stuff is so hard to get your hands on!"
poured out a deep amber color with a decnet size head on it that went away medium to slow.
What a pour!!! Me 12 oz English pint took this roar pour with 2 of sticky tight spumescent beige head over a noticeably clear golden amber & dark sunset orange well carbonated pour. Head retention leaves a huge pillowy coating on me drink.
The bottle was purchased last fall.
"This beer is a hazy, orange-amber with dark flakes on final pour. A medium-sized, dense, cream-colored head leaves sticky, foam lacing. Hoppy, sweet, creamy nose with a hint of milk chocolate. Wow. Super bitter in the front with some sweetish cream. The middle turns almost chocolatey. It's creamy sweet with a touch of sour milk (not a bad thing here). Very bitter again in the finish. Some crackers and lots of alcohol. Amazingly intense flavor. A slightly odd background effect might be due to the alcohol. It certainly tames with temperature. Bottom line: an outstanding, bitter, creamy, sweet, intense beer. Hoohah!"
"This is a very good best bitter accompanied by some hops. Spruce, a lot of grapefuit, some citrus in a malt base. Orange colour, somewhat cloudy."
Dreadnaught pours very clear with a small head subsiding to a ring of foam with a little galaxy of whiteness in the center that continues to be refreshed by a stream of bubbles emanating from the center of the bottom of the chalice as I continue to extend this run on sentence to embarrassing length. 
"Pours clear, dark orange leaving a decent white head. Piney, resinous, citric hops assault your senses as the beer fills the glass. Lots of malt accompany the loads of hops. Starts and finishes with hops, hops and more hops. With all that is going on in this beer it is extremely drinkable even at 9.5% alc."
"Clear dark gold/orange body with a white film. Possibly the best hop aroma I've smelled. They are there, all over the place, the big juicy grapefruity hops, but they're more than that, they're a perfume, they're the pine cardboard you put on the mirror in your car, they're the orange you ate this morning, they're the lemon juice you've put over your salmon yesterday, they're your freshly cut grass on a sunny june day. Hops, all over the place and then some, and a bit of alcohol and some heavy malt. Quite complex adventure. The first sip then adds some, grass, grapefruity, but more than that. There's a mineral saltiness in there, alcohol peaks and thick malt layers, honeyish chewy malt. Texture is smooth, creamy, very thick. Definitely my favorite I2PA and it may even convince me to seek a few others out, but I'm still far from sold to the green side, the hophead clan. Worth another tribute to Raindog for providing me with this modern classic."
"The beer pours a brilliant orange, almost OSHA safety-like in it's vibrancy. A bit of a chill haze intensifies the glow, with a thick, almost white, well beaded froth settled atop. The head lasts throughout, diminishing into a thick collar surrounding splotchy mist. Plenty of lace clings to the glass, leaving a broken, even, filmy covering. My only complaint at all is the lack of a tight film throughout. With this much hops, I expected incredible head retention."
"I am drinking this brew at room temp in a snifter. Big Thanks to Jables and BIF 6 for letting me experience this brew. The beer pours a clear copper color with an offwhite fluffy head foaming up pretty easily. The head fades to a surface layer rather quickly. Aroma is all hops, I get a mixture of rich resiny pine scents with some pungent sour grapefruit hits as well. "
"22 oz bomber bottle. Purchased September '03 at Jungle Jim's in Cincinnati,OH. Consumed April 8, 2004."
"Thanks to fellow BA Qarre for this bottle!! Using a nice clean pint glass, I poured myself a lovely beer. Hazy medium amber with a huge frothy head, that died down quickly, but still left a layer on top which left little bit of lacing throughout my glass. Smell is surprisingly rich and creamy, of candied hop pinecones. Taste is also rich and creamy...alcohol is not really detected via taste or aroma, but I can't ignore that warm alcohol feeling in my tummy :-) Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, very smooth. I know the malt is in there someplace, but the hops are very smooth, and come across as grapefruit and sugar. That flavor lingers, but surprisingly the bitterness is kept to a minimum. I couldn't give it a five for drinkability, as I only had the one bottle. I would love to try this on tap, and then to see how many I could drink...Definitely a very tasty beer."
"Pours a somewhat cloudy, yellow amber witha foamy white head and nice lacing."
"After much searching for a trading partner to get this elusive brew, we finally meet. Thank you AragornUnplugged. The beer leaves the 22 oz. brown bomber (with a really funky label I might add) and finds itself in my imperial pint glass. The appearance is clear orange amber color with a nice white head, both pretty standard for a good IPA. The head leaves a lot quicker than a single IPA which is likely due to the high strength of the brew. Carbonation is also low and is gone rather quickly. The aroma is surprisingly mild for an imperial IPA. It is clearly hoppy, but the aroma does not hit you across the room like a Ruination or a Celebration. There are strong notes of alcohol and caramel malts on the nose as well. The taste is quite sweet with a strong peppery kick due to the hops. Smooth silky mouthfeel with a syrupy thick consistency. Strong alcohol burn detracts somewhat from drinkability. Overall I think this brew is very close to being on the fence to being a barley wine, not that there is anything wrong with that. I will try to eventually get some more to cellar to see if it ages well like a real barley wine. Too bad, it will take a quite a while to get some more in."
"I was very pleased to find this in the local wine-with-some-beer store, but the price was a bit much, so I split one with Budsboy on for a Sunday afternoon tasting."
"Largely clear, coppery-bronze in hue, the white head reached about a finger in height before dissipating to soapy foam. The subsequent lacing was very minimal. Honestly it looks like a typical IPA. Then I took a sniff. Its not normal! A violent assault of hops assails my nose, grapefruit rinds, grapefruit flesh, a forest of pine trees and a wild flower potpourri. The potent aromas are big, bold, and juicy. It is oh so inviting, my mouth is watering. Let me start the description of the taste this way, after about two sips I had hop burps. Sometimes when I quaff a Double IPA the gross trusting of hops down the gullet gets tiresome and sometimes I really yearn for a little balance. But Three Floyds has proven an IPA can be produced that is massively hoppy and unforgiving in its lack of balanced. Yet it is graceful and soothing but it also manages to be threatening as well. I am impressed. The hops are so juicy, so oily, so fleshy, so bitter, and so tasty! The hops stick to my lips. The malt influences are minimal and damn near pointless in mentioning, maybe, I mean maybe I could detect a trace of malty sweetness in the form of caramel. At this point I dont care, the hops have captured my attention, I am hooked. The alcohol provides some noticeable warmth. I could jibber-jabber about how great this tastes all night long, so Ill move on. Medium-full in body, very syrupy, the carbonation is very modest but it seems appropriate for the hugeness of this beer. If drinkability is a question of do I want another? The answer is an overwhelming YES!! This IS the best tasting IPA I have ever had. It is great; it is wonderful it is near perfect on the tongue. Thank you so much PhantomVodoo!"
"The coppery color was slightly hazy I didnt notice the yeast in the bottle nor did I worry about upsetting the conditioning. The head was nothing exceptional but the nose was happy when it went for the first whiff. The hops didnt move me but the malt did. The taste was an even better experience. The malt was still noted but the hops balanced it very well. The citrus notes peaked my interest in this beerHmmm, dont I have relatives in Ind. That can ship me some of the stuff. This is a VERY drinkable brew!"
Dreadnaught! Great name outstanding beer. This is probably the best IPA I've ever had. Pours a cloudy mixture of amber and orange. The nose to this beast is unlike anything I've smelled to date. Citrus and hops grab you by the nose hairs and never let go. The first sip is like a thousand little hops jumping up and down on the tongue in a dance to please the beer gods. Oily slick as the dance is finished with a slight malt after taste. Finishing this is down right depressing because the flavor never disappoints and always leaves the mouth wanting more.
"Dreadnaught. What a fantastic name! Pours a pretty, cloudy orange-brown color with a bubbly white head that continues to leave plenty of lace on my glass as I drink. The scent is unbelieveable - pure hops is what comes to mind. I know that makes no sense, but this is hops in all its hop glory. Even before tasting, I wonder if I'm going to dream about this beer."
"It is a hazy orange color. The aroma screams of hops with citrus/grapefruit notes, though there is a detection of some maltiness (caramel?). The mouthfeel is really nice. There is so much bitterness, but the maltiness rounds out the beer extremely well. It is sweet with tastes of tangerines. The finish is an herbal, citrus bitterness. This is a fantastic beer that any hophead will enjoy."
"Wow, how many accolades can one lay upon this beer? After reading many of the reviews on BA i was a bit intimidated when opening my first bottle of dreadnaught. As I poured it into my glass my intimidation grew. The monsterous smell of hops nearly filled my college apartment's kitchen. As I held the beer up to a light it left a beautiful clear amber/golden hue. I put this beer up to my mouth expecting a bitterness not to be described put i was pleasantly surprised. I will not lie, this is a hop monster but it is also incredibly balanced. A nice malt backbone supported the hops wonderfully. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth but leaves a bit a oily hop resin on the tongue. This is one of my favorite beers. Hopefully sometime Nick Floyd will see fit to lower prices on this bad boy. A definate must try."
"Hazy, rich orange-amber; more the former than the latter. The head is dark cream to very light tan, is large to start, eventually falls to a thin disk and leaves a decent amount of lace in fat rings and sheets."
Pours hazy orange with a thin white head.
"Hazy light orange, big yellow-tinged head with tight lacing and retention. Deep orange peel rind with sweetness, a bit of grapefruit, and a hint of crushed aspirin. A motherload of hops with some cookiedough malt. Flavor is a tidal wave of hop flavors riding on a wind of sweet light caramel malt. Powerful alcohol carries it all across."
After finally purchasing one of these beauties I wasn't the least bit dissapointed. 
After reading many of the reviews for this beer I was so excited that I would actually get to dry it. (thanks to weefisheads for the beer tasting)
"Huge Cascadey nose dry-hopped to infinity cut by a raw hop palette. Fruity and well-balanced with bitterness. It could induce a tear or two, but the perceived sweetness, actually the intense floral and fruit character of the hop, does well to balance the bitterness. Hm . . . late-addition hops balancing early-boil hops. "
Review #1 - hope I don't blow this...
"Presentation: A 22oz classic Bomber that has a label like that of the BA Database, but with a black background as opposed to the white one shown. No freshness date or strength listed. The label is colorful and attracts closer attention whilst drinking the contents."
"Finally, the keystone in my beer search has been cast in place: Three Floyd's oft-rumored, rarely-delivered Dreadnaught IPA. $4.99 for a 22-ounce bomber. The lack of pertinent information on the bottle intrigues you that much more."
Grats to weefishheads for this. Thin blanched white topped the yellow to red and impossibly transparent ale. Slight trails of lace etched the path of the beers disappearance. 
"Sampled at weefishheads' Beer Night--Jan 17th, 2004. Color was a clear light orange, with a low fine white head that quickly disappeared...ordinary. Far from ordinary were the energetic aromas wafting from my glass...lush peachy malts were followed by a blissful bouquet of fresh floral hop notes without the resin spectrum. Taste...just as I suspected, a masterful piece of work, sure to earn the love of any imperial IPA fan. A zingy citric malt backbone with notes of honey and dried fruit sweetness was rounded out with an exceptional herbal bitter finish...which lingered on long after a sip was taken. A fantastically melded collection of flavors and hoppy bitterness. The alcohol was well integrated and remained well-hidden. The beer felt smooth and full, with a good level of carbonation..all in all quite satisfying. I imagine I could drink a 22 oz bomber of this at least. Very good drinkabilty for a style that can at times be a tad over the top or overly sweet. Dreadnaught is simply one of the best brews out there. Huge thanks to weefishheads for putting this one up for tasting!"
"22oz. Bomber Bottle: My first one from the Floyds. The beer pours a slightly orangish-amber color. It is a bit hazy. There was some head to it, with a bit of lacing. The aroma is killer: Hops, hops, hops. You could even get a good whiff of them just from the open bottle. Some pine and grapefruit notes to the aroma. The taste is ful of hops, but the balance is superb: they don't overwhelm you like Stone can. There is even a hint of sweetness to the beer."
"Glowing orange with some haze. Fiery appearance. Nice, lightly whipped ivory white topping. Retention is very good. Nose is filled with orange rind, grapefruit rind, raw hop resin, pine and sweet caramel malt underlying it all. The taste is fantastic. This is some great hop juice. Pure humulus bliss. The rind characteristics are pretty hefty and nice. There's a sweet orange marmalade characteristic that adds depth. Hops also impart pine resin, pungency, tropical fruit tones and a sturdy bitterness. Just the slightest sting of alcohol surfaces every now and then. Body is about medium-full and the carbonation is just light enough to lend a creaminess and drinkability to this one. Even though there's a bit of an edge to this beer, it's quite drinkable."
The beer poured deep golden amber with just an ever so slight haze. The head was large and in charge and overflowed the glass forcing me to lick the counter. The head was off-white and very lasting.
"This beer deserves all of the praise it has gotten. Pours a bright and clear orange-amber color with a medium thin and frothy off-white head. Thin and quick lacing. Heady aroma of flowery hops (duh) along with some citrus. Rich and smooth with a great hops kick that never becomes overpowering. There is enough of an undercurrent of malt to make this easily drinkable despite the abundance of hops, and that is exactly the right idea. The finish is crisp and has long, lingering hops with some spice. They don't get much better than this."
"Rich bronze color...hazy clarity..tan bubbly head...sweet hoppiness on the nose...mango, pineaplle, tropical fruitiness on the nose..."
"Nicely put together IPA in the over-hopped American style. Big malt base overshadowed by citrus hops that go over the top, but pleasantly."
Typical look: reddish amber liquid with perfunctory mousse.
"Woah! Huge beer. Nice. This beer reeks of hops, in a very good way. Smells like big ole football sized hop cones scented like flowers, nondescript citrus fruit, and evergreens. Malt comes across as juicy, a little estery, and creamy milk chocolate. Each sip is an obscene mouthful of floral, resiny, juicy hops that reminds me of strawberries. Once the mouth becomes acclimated to the onslaught, the soft pale malt with caramel notes comes through, but before that its nonstop celery-tasting bitterness."
"Beer number 700 on my personal list, so I picked something special. No question, this beer goes for the big hops brass ring. Aroma is a massive smack in the face of hops. This beer is all about the hops, everything else is secondary. Seemed longer on bittering than aromatic hops, even though I let the beer warm a bit for maximum effect. Some rubbing alcohol notes were disconcerting, but these might mellow out if the beer aged a bit. "
"Sampled from a 22oz bottle. Tons of information, including directions to the brewery, but I couldn't find a date and considering it is bottle conditioned, I would think that info would be very useful."
"Made the mistake of reading a bunch of reviews before drinking this one down, so it had a lot of hype to live up to right out of the bottle. Needless to say, it met my heightened expectations."
"A sweet and yet bitter slap upside yo' head. Slightly metallic tang. More, I could not say besides to echo what I had written about the draft version because, you see, I was at Nick Floyd's unveiling of his Alpha Klaus at the Map Room, and some other guy, a friend of one of the brewers, insisted we should also try the Dreadnaught. So he bought my buddy and me each a bomber bottle out of the blue. And even though we had been sampling Belgians before, this was the brew that actually got us S***-faced."
"Turbid light bronze hue. Stiff, dense, persistent one fingered head leaves frothy lace. The aroma is dominated by a vibrant, fruit driven melange of ripe melon, sweet clementine, lemon zest and juicy, slightly acidic pineapple notes. Mild ethanol heat, yeast derived bready tones and simple caramel malt surfaces as the volatile hop oils dissipate. Bright, well rounded and appetizing aromawise. Orange flesh sweetness incipient in flavor is quickly complemented by a combination of bittersweet lemon marmalade and sharp, sappy notes of crushed pine needle. Fruit character is dynamic, beginning with a citric acidity then becoming akin to ripe peach mid palate, before stabilizing as a static, sugary honeydew presence. Malt character is underwhelming, but subtle biscuit tones and light toffee provide ample foundation for the assertive hop profile. Moderate in body, with a firmly dextrinous, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes with a light, but transient surge of residual sweetness, which lends a lingering impression of hopped orange candy. Ethanol warmth surfaces slowly from the esophagus, reminding the palate that this isn't your everyday IPA. Dreadnaught is a rich, superlatively hopped brew. Assertive hop bitterness and vibrant hop flavor ride parallel, and neither becomes obtrusive. With a more pronounced and distinct malt profile this would be untouchable. Superb overall, and unparalled in drinkability."
22 oz. bomber served at cellar temp in a Brewer's Art chalice (had to baptize it with something worthy). 
"Well, here I go with the Dreadnaught. I've not read any reviews yet, so this'll be fairly impartial. I first cracked it open and a whiff of hops hit me from an arm's length. Wow. Very aromatic hops in this one, I like that. Pour is cloudy orange-brown, not much head (but I don't care!). This beer smells fantastic. First taste: damn. That's some good stuff. Good heavy malt characteristic, which I think most IPA's don't have. Hops are dominant though, and it's a nice blend - whatever blend that may be, I'm not that good yet."
"Giant light tan head that leaves a solid coat of lace. Hazy amber colored beer with a moderate amount of bubbles floating to the surface. It has a sweet citrus aroma that is nice and strong. Mildly sweet flavor kind of like a cross between citrusy hops and butterscotch. The aftertaste is barely bitter and the body is solid without being too thick. The only hint of alcohol is the warm feeling it leaves in your stomach. I really like this IIPA, but Wailing Wench shares many characteristics and is way cheaper."
"Holy Moses! Intense! Thanks to trbeer for carting a sample of this bright, orange-amber, gem-like brew back to Michigan for me. Hoppy grapefruit, pine, and corn sugar nose. Peachy orange fruit highlights. Complex in that how-many-aromas-can-you-pluck-out-of-this-hop-combo-? sort of way. Like chewing on a carnation and quickly chasing it with a wild combo of grapefruit, rind, and a pure, leafy hop plant. Truly an epic, full body on this brew. Not something I could drink every day -- a 9.5% brew with tongue-numbing hops and a body so thick it might be a stew? -- but well worth the sample."

"Hazy orange amber color, topped by a thick, creamy head. A perfect looking beer. Sweet floral aromas waft up from a distance, while up close it's a bit more spicy with some distinct citrus. The taste is pretty freaking amazing, with sweetness, floral notes, bitterness, malt, hops, and citrus all intermingled. Each takes a turn at the front of the stage, then slips in to play a supporting role for the next star flavor. Mouthfeel is also very well done, being at once light but yet solid. However, the carbonation expands just a bit too vigorously (a nit-pick, yes). But this beer goes down very well. I said to myself, I thought this was a double IPA? Then I check the ABV. The alcohol is well disguised in this beer. I can feel a bit of warming in the pit of my stomach after a while, but nothing like many beers in this range. This is really a nice brew."
"Pours a fuzzy orange color that was hard to pin down, with a nice thin-foam head, with impressive slick lacing in tendril form."
"I picked up a few bottles of the Dreadnaught at Kahn's in Indianapolis last week while I was on a business trip and sampled the first tonight. I believe I paid $5.50 each for the bottles. The Dread poured into the glass somewhere between polished bronze and light copper color, topped with a light tan head that slowly faded away. Aroma is very grapefruit hoppy, also sweet and a bit alcoholic. Medium to slightly heavy body. Taste is bursting with fresh hop flavor at first, then bittering a bit and tranitioning into a malty sweetness and finishing a bit tart and sharply hoppy again. Definitely some significant alcohol warmth on the way down, a good beer for a cold day but well drinkable any day."
"Pours with a deep cream colored head, very sticky and long-lived. Gorgeous deep bronze colored liquid, slightly hazed. Loads of bready maltiness in the nose with floral, herbal hoppiness coming in behind that. The taste is a substantial malty backdrop...doughy and sweet that's shoved aside by assertive, but not overpowering hoppiness, quite bitter without dominating the palate. Subtle alcohol notes are tasted mid-line. Finishes wonderfully between sweet malt and bitter hops, very hearty and flavorful...why isn't this availiable near me???"
Boilermaker hit it on the head with much of his review. This is a BIG beer. 
"05/15/04 Re-review: I had to walk thru an update to Dreadnaught after it won my double IPA blind tasting over the likes of Ruination, 90 Minute, Yulesmith, and Hop Wallop. The biggest thing I picked out this time 'round was the aroma and flavor of oak. Everything about Dreadnaught is huge and it all melds together seemlessly for a simply glorious beer drinking experience. Absolutely first-rate! "
"Served in the 22 oz. bomber. The color is copper, with a ring of white head. The smell is a nice citrusy hops with a bit of alcohol behind it. The taste is a very nice balance of hops, not overly done, but with a great balance behind it, and a hint of alcohol that doesn't take away from the beer at all. Mouthfeel is slightly heavy. Drinkability, quite good, and could have a few."
"MMM hooops. Pours out a nice orange gold color wiht a creamy white head that leaves some decent lace. The aroma has hops hops and more hops, very citrusy. The taste...a hop lovers dream. The hops hide the alchohol very well, and it does havea certain malty sweetness hiding amongst the hops. I will drink this one again.and again..and again."
"This is not a commonly found beer in Philly so I was excited to find a 22 oz bomber at the Foodery. When I cracked open the bottle, the fragrant aroma wafted up to my nose. It had that classic citric grapefruit smell. It lacks the pungent notes of several other imperial IPAs The aroma is beautiful and can be detected from several feet away."
10-13-2003
Appearance: Golden Amber with great clarity. Rocky white head.
"Appearance: Slightly hazy, copper color. Thin, beady head dissipates quickly, but sticks to sides of the glass."
"Orange gold color. Small head. Aroma is grapefruit and citrus. WOW..ZOWIE.. A VERY smooth, full-bodied IPA/American Strong Ale. Great malt/hop balance. Complex flavors are dancing around on my palate, grapefruit, pine, citrus and malts. This beer is more than worthy of all the acclaim it getting. This may be the best IPA I have ever tasted. Hoppy and malty, yet incredibly smooth. WOW. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Finish is very slightly bitter. No noticeable alcohol despite the 9.5%"
"Let's start out by saying there is no quesiton why this beer is so highly sought after, you'll know from the second you crack the bottle. Appears: a deep copper orange hue with a huge frivilous cream colored long-lived head that has left me with some visually appealing full bars of lacing. Aroma: Now this is the selling point of this beer a succulent layer of piney hops masked by an undertow of earthy floral hops this beer is just as malty as it is hoppy adding to the balance and pure greatness of it. If it makes sense this beer's aroma smells like buttery sweet caramelized whole leaf hops it's hard to picture that but once you smell this you realize why this is the most incredible hop nectar I have ever quaffed. Taste: Equally if not surpassingly more amazing than the aromatics, layers of sugar and hop bitterness blend into one orgy of flavor on the palate the piney, slightly earthy, citrus tones of the hops are met with an equally amazing caramel syrupy sugar quality from the malts used here. Clears out the sinuses with hop bitterness and fulfills your sweet tooth at the same time, now that's what I call a beer. Mouthfeel: The creamy texture sends you directly into complete indulgence mode here with juicy hop resin and a full bodied via the malt profile this beer is here to please not only beer enthusiasts but to turn the macro drinker toward the light. Drinkability: Well, it has to rank up there in one of my most amazing tasting experiences of all time, Three Floyd's has redefined an Imperial IPA for me watchout west coast here comes the midwest. So, good and drinkable if I were to come across this beer on tap somebody call the D.D. or better yet let's flag down a bloody taxi because whoever is with me is going to imbibe and enjoy this revolutionary beer at my side."
Sampled February 2004
well....DAMN!!! hope you like getting kicked in the mouth!
"Hey, do you like getting smacked in the face? How about by a beer? "
"Now I could be wrong, but I think there might be hops in here. HAs a hazy orange-amber appearance with a thick white head that slowly dissapates into a thin lace. You would never guess that this is 9.5%. Well after you try to stand up you'll probably realize it, but not from the taste. The hop aroma is very piney with grapefruit coming through in the taste. Another beer following the trend that bigger is better. Maybe the hops are a little extreme, but this beer isn't for everyone. It's for the hopheads."
Finally found the time to give this a try.. WOW WOW!! what took me so long.
"22 oz bomber, courtesy of TinusTime's efforts to aquire this for me at the local farm fresh..cheers, tinustime."
"Poured with a very large tan head that lingered for a good while, eventually dissipating to a good lace. Nice orange-amber color. Slight haze at first which cleared as beer warmed. Carbonation rises to the surface from the sides of the glass. The aroma immediately smacked me in the face from a couple feet away. Smells of hops and fruit - orange, pineapple, and fruit cocktail were all noticeable. Lots of hops hit the tongue, yet the taste was quite fruity sweet as well with some spice notes towards the end. Malt is apparent, but I think the sweetness in this beer is more from the hops. Dry finish with a somewhat bitter aftertaste that lingers for a while; the hops continuing to maintain a foothold. Theres a very full, smooth, slick, mouthfeel. Carbonation is moderate. Slight alcohol feel, but for the most part the alcohol is very well hidden, although it does become more apparent as the beer warms. Careful though... At 9.5%ABV, if you cant taste it, youll certainly feel it! Great brew, but the high alcohol content does lower the drinkability of this one a bit. This beer was very complex, and seemed to have lots going on. When I finished this brew, I though to myself... If the Belgians brewed an IPA, this is what it would be. I could probably drink a few of these (not in succession though) and find different nuances each time."
22oz. bomber stares at me. Taunting me...
"This is one amazingly great brew. Pours a deep ruby/brown color topped off by a moderately thick white head, which left a thin, sticky lace splattered on the sides of my glass. The aroma is definitely not for the faint of heart. A healthy punch of what seems like a thousand types of hops, attacks the olfactory senses, leaving them begging for mercy. Slight aromas of smoke, fruit and alcohol are also detected. The bold taste of hops will beat you down like a pimp beating his ho. There is a nice sweet and charred oak flavor left on the palate on the finish. This is one vastly complex brew, how can they fit so much hop flavor into one bottleI guess well never know."
"Whew !! I made it. I managed to make it to the bottom of the glass. For a beer this delicious, it's a challenge to drink most of a bomber. My wife had a few sips then gave me her share to finish (too alcoholic for her taste)."
"22oz bottle. Poured a deep orange, with a good head and plenty of lacing on the glass. Aroma is floral and citrus from the hops, with some malt thrown in there. Taste is more of the same. You had better be a hop lover to drink this! But there is some malt sweetness thrown in there just to confuse you. Oh so very good! Not as good as the bourbon barrel cask conditioned Dreadnaught I had a few weeks ago, but good nevertheless."
"Clear, bronze-orange body, full and creamy-looking tan head. Good lacing."
"Mmmm. I've been hearing about this beer for a while now, and now I know what all the hype was about!"
"Wow!!! Lucky me! My 3rd top 50 bier to sample this afternoon! After the downpour stopped, the sun came out, and I headed out to the back deck with this bomber in tow to enjoy!!! "
Draft:
"Presentation: 16oz. Shaker pint from draught. Cost: $4.50 at The Chapter House, Ithaca"
"Ok, I have to admit, all those people who have been trumpeting the praises of Three Floyds were right. This is an awesome beer. The aroma is very hoppy. It's what you'd get if you could crossbreed tangerines with a pine or a juniper plant. I'm also getting whiffs of balloon rubber, but that doesn't make any sense. The flavor is surprisingly well balanced. I was expecting some major hops bitterly unbalancing the beer, but the hops are nicely balanced by the thick almost chewy malt flavors. The perceived bitterness is surprisingly low with the actual flavors of the hops coming through. The malt is toasted buttered biscuits with a bit of caramel sauce and maybe a little maple syrup. The beer is sweet, but not cloying. The body is a dark amber topped by a nice too-dark-to-be-off-white head that isn't a permanent fixture, but not wimpy either. Damn this is good."
"22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy orangish-amber color with one finger of head. There is good head retention and lacing throughout. The smell was a burst of citrus, mostly grapefruit, and hops. The hop smell is not overwhelming at all, very nice. The taste is a near perfect blend of sweet malt and fresh hops. This one is not overboard on the hops as the ""imperial"" IPA label would suggest. The fruitiness can still be found in the taste too. The body is thick and almost chewy, good for an IPA. The drinkability is fairly nice for being a 9.5% brew. What a marvelous IPA!"
"As soon as opened the bottle the aroma just blasted right out at me and I knew I was in for a treat. Big citrusy aroma, orange, passionfruit, grapefruit and white grapes come to mind. Beautiful almost orange color, slightly cloudy from the bottle fermentation and a frothy head yielding good retention. This is the biggest IPA I've had that wasn't from the west coast. This ale has a smooth medium bodied texture that is slightly chewy and nearly perfect. I find this similar to Moylans Double IPA and maybe even better. Flavors are grapefruit, hops and more hops with malt somewhere in the background. Only a slight bitterness in the finish. I didn't realize the abv was 9.5, and wouldn't have known it if I hadn't read it here. I didn't taste it but I certainly feel it. This is one giant IPA. If your a fan of the big west coast IPA's as I am, you will love this one!"
"Beautiful clear deep gold with tan and red highlights. Substantial off-white fine head settles slowly to a 1/3"" rocky complete cap."
"I was as surprised by this-one as a big headed guy on the label. As it says on the bottle, its not normal. It pours a cloudy amber-orange with a very nice two-inch sticky head. Lace is very well. Carbonation is good to produce soft white hang-around bubbles.The aroma is most impressive. Alot hits you from the beginning to end with a floral, citrus dose of hop. The taste, again complex. You got citrus with grapefruit at the start. Sweet, almost a wine cooler citrus taste, then a surprise hop kick all the while a nice warmth blankets it all. This is the most creamy smooth IPA i've had to date. It has a cotton soft feel but does not leave a cotton mouth. Drinkability, almost to drinkable. At 9.5abv it would be easy to get ahead of ones self. With all thats being smelled and tasted here, im good for about one 12 oz. per serving, but thats just me."
Sampled at the Map Room on the AHA National Pub Crawl. 
"Appearance: Pours a mostly clear copper that seems to glow on it's own. It's tan head starts out thick and creamy, then slowly shrinks down to a small, but steady cap. Tons of spiderweb-like lace cover the side of the glass."
"Big bottle witha cool label. Pours a beautiful clear orange with nice head and lots of lace as you drink it. Aroma is very piney hoppy and a hint of fruit, almost a little tomcat. Good bite with hops and malt up front. Actually the malt/hops blend is what makes this such a good beer. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Stays wet on the tongue. I would have guessed this would have a dry finish. It was as far from that as can be. Alchohol is there too 22 oz of 9.5% beer goes a long ways!"
"22 oz. bomber pours cloudy bright copper-orange color with a creamy off-white head that sticks around and leaves a nice lace in my glass. Sharp hoppy aroma of citrus and pine, resinous sticky pine and grapefruit flavors coats the tongue, finishes sticky and bitter yet has good malt balance, has a full thick syrupy mouthfeel, IMO a great Imperial IPA."
Hotstuff and I went on a tour of their brewery. For $5 you get a 12oz glass of 3 of their beers. I thought this beer was not one of their better beers. The aroma was nice enough but its taste had an overpowering after bite that I did not like. The head was almost non existent. The color was very amber brown. Hotstuff gave it a 2 rating.
"From the 22 oz. bottle it pours a nice amber with a thick (1.5 fingers), white, foamy, and very persistent head which sticks to the glass throughout consumption. A wonderfully aromatic smell hits you, beginning when you open the bottle and continuing until the last drops are gone. The smells are primarily those of citrus fruits (grapefruit and oranges in particular) and flowers. Great sweet, citrusy, hoppy taste. Very smooth and highly drinkable--although one or two may be all you need. This was my first time drinking this beer and I will certainly come back for some more and it has become one of my current favorites."
"I've been a fan of Three Floyds since my taste buds first became acquainted with the flavor of Alpha King. Now, I am happy to have concluded a 22oz. server of another of their fine, over-the-top, wham-bam-thank-YOU, ma'm brews, the delicious, the delirious, the damnedfine Dreadnaught IPA."
"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a huges foamy white head that faded quickly and left just trace amounts of lace. A small amount of carbonation is present. A wonderful aroma of hops and pine that gently gives way to some sweetnesss. A flavor of hops, malt and citrus with a touch of pine. A heavier body than most IPAs and touch sweeter. Much more balances than many of the other IPAs that hit you over the head with the hops"
"Whoa mamma, this is a beautiful IPA. Pours a decent head. Firey bursts of bubbles inside. Amber-colored beer. The head settles to a thin layer, completely covering the brew. Smells nicely of hops and spices. Tastes amazing. Very hoppy, of course. Tastes thick and active in my mouth. Crisp -- some apples. Very drinkable. There's a lot going on here. Wonderful beer."
"Aroma is incredibly floral with hops all over. The taste begins with a bang of hoppiness but is immediately balanced by sweetness. The finish has slight notes of alcohol but still persistent hops and light malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy, very silky smooth. The drinkability is incredible but dangerous considering the ABV%."
"i couldn't fit this big bottle in my beer cozy...j/k. pours a crystal clear deep, dark copper with a thick, thick off-white head. head retention and lacing are excellent. blasts of citrusy pine hits you in the face as your raise the glass to your lips. silky, thick, chewy mouthfeel...unbelievably smooth. massive vanilla-ish and carmel sweet malts hold up remarkably well against the onslaught of hop flavor. i emphasize flavor. hops taste like sugar-coated grapefruit drenched in pine. sweet hop flavor lasts forever. tasty, never overly bitter. ever so slightly warming, deceivingly drinkable. not too many other beers can match this one, in my book. the craftsmanship is staggering. magnificent."
"Dreadnaught Imperial IPA from Three Floyds. In the brand new bomber bottle. Although I wasnt happy about it, this beer was worth wait. This is one fine beer, by any comparison. It poured a fairly clear amber color, which was somewhat surprising, as I had expected some hazing. The head was an above average height, leveling off to a faily constant 1/8th inch coverage."
"This masterpiece pours a brilliant amber, no cloudiness here, pretty damn good clarity. A large and well-retaining head forms and stays at a quarter inch throughout consumption and also provides lacing like no other IPA I have seen. Holy happy horseshit, what an aroma! Wickedly strong hops, pine forest, pine needles, pine everything. Citrus twang is in there as well, but pine is where it's at. I would just drench a piece of cardboard in this beer and use it as an air freshener in my car instead of purchasing a pine hanger. "
"This is the real deal. Three Floyds has a real winner with this beer. For a hophead this is a dream come true. Dreadnaught was menacing straight out of the growler with an aggressive, revearse cascading pour, exposing a foggy amber color and a puffy, cumulous head that settled into a thick slick along the top of the beer with great lace retention. On inspection from my nose the Dreadnaught revealed an intense pressure of hops. There were huge citrus aromas in the form of mango, orange and lime and notes of sour apple and cherry. Dreadnaught tickled my pallate and flowed down my throat with such ease. The hops were not at all overwhelming as there was a a fair bit of malts, which had a wonderful equilibrium between smokey undertow and candied fruits for an interseting brandy effect. Thanks to the malts there is a perfect balance in what would have been a too intense flavor.This beer kicks some serious ass!"
"Ah, is there any better aroma than that of a Truly Magnificent Beer? In my humble opinion, NO, Dreadnaught is a beer I have looked forward to sampling, since I read the first review, thanks to cretemixer; I now have that opportunity. In addition, one other thing I have noticed, on this site and others, either you love it or you dislike it intensely."
"Imagine how stoked I was to see this on the tap list on my most recent trip to Brew's. At last, the infamous Dreadnaught was before me."
"Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit....with a high alcohol kick."
"Crystal clear amber color, absolutely stunning appearance. Lots of citrusy hops up front w/ a slightly sweet finish. Perfection. Originally reviewed 19 December 2002. Do whatever you can to get your hands on this! Dreadnaught is a world class beer, find it!"
"Appearance is amber/straw color. Smell is hops, hops and more hops. Sweet flavor of hops, with some malt to try to tame the hops to little avail. Medium body, this is one great Imperial IPA, and as I drink it, it is even better than the 90 minute by DFH. No mistake, this is a high alcohol beer, at 9.5%, one of these was good enough for a night. This is one great beer, that I hope to visit again!"
"Perhaps the finest ale brewed in Indiana, Dreadnaught pours a glowing orange with a fluffy, off-white head that keeps itself throughout the duration of the brew. A lovely picture, indeed. The smell is huge on hops, citrus, pine, you name it. Everything you could ask for in an over-the-top imperial IPA. Taste is nothing short of intense, and is not for the faint of heart. Huge notes of just plain raw hops exist throughout the life of the brew, and linger long after. Even though it's incredibly hopped, it seems very well balanced, too, with a sturdy malt backbone holding its own along the way. Mouthfeel was very smooth and oily, especially from the handpull. Drinkability was very strong for a beer of 9.5% ABV. This is a keeper, indeed, and one that's not to be taken lightly."
Autumn golden hued with a brief visit from a large bubbled off-white topping. A few hop flecks floating around.
1/2 gallon growler
12(?)oz mini-growler from Half Time Beverages. A thanks to VENOM for the sample.
"Had on draft 1/11/03. With an orange-amber glow and a medium to small, but sturdy tan head, this brew is ""hop heaven."" A perisitent string of lace was noticed from start to finish. The aroma consists of these waves of hops that entice you, but warn you that this brew is going to give that palate a workout. It didn't disappoint. This beautiful combination of a piney and critic hoppy taste were overwhelming at the start. But, a balanced mouthful of a creamy, malty, sweet finish, gave this brew a higher level of drinkability than I was unexpecting. This is definitely one delicious Imperial IPA."
"Hazy orange color with a white head. The head lasts... Strong hop flower nose with hints of sweetness. Lots of very fine bubbles. Big bold bitter citrus flavor (orange/lemon). The alcohol is present in the initial taste, but mellows as the brew moves to the back of the tongue (slight sweetness). The brew finishes with sweet floral bitterness. Very hopped all the way through. A sturdy beer. The brew also has nice body as well. By far their best brew!"
"It seems the rumor of Dreadnaught in 22 oz bottle is true! Cant wait to try one. I served this beer on tap untill the supply ran out but more is on the way! This is a work of art. Slight chill haze on draft, deep golden color, amazing hop / malt nose - both citrusy spicey hop and honey sweet malt aroma would fill the room when this beer was tapped. The balance is unbelievable; intense hoppy flavors and bitterness equalled by the intesity and richness of full bodied mega malt. Alcohol is evident from initial sniff to burps hours later. Rich, complex and very hoppy. A truly great achievment for hop and malt heads alike. 8.5% alc / vol and very dangerous because its oh sooo good! Makes a great Imperial half n half w/ Victory Storm King Stout."
"My god this is an awesome IPA... apricot gold color, with a huge foamy head that eventually settles to a lace that clings to the side of the glass. Exceptionally malty and hoppy in both aroma and flavor. Grapefruit-like hops and carmel malt make this very complex, and at 100 IBU (yes, 100!), and 9.5 % ABV, this thing packs a punch. Since I don't consider myself much of a hop-head, I thought this beer might be too much for me... I was amazed to find the flavors in perfect balance, and I found myself not even wanting to put the glass down. This is one huge beer, and it's not for the weak-hearted, but this one is very special."
"Deep amber, pale head, served in one of those peculiar mugs they have at MacGregor's in Syracuse - like a soup bowl with a handle."
"I made a day trip to the brewery for the sole purpose of trying the IPA. It was a three hour drive (one way), and worth every second. Dreadnaught is Alpha King on steroids - bigger, stronger, better in every way! And since Alpha King is practically an IPA iteslf, well, Dreadnaught is a bit over the top (in a good way)."
"I was practically speachless after tasting this masterpiece of beer perfection. I don't know the specs but this is one big ass beer. Spicy hop attack, syrupy alcohol, substantial malt presence, more alcohol, peppery hop finish. Run, don't walk to try this awesome brew!"
Appearance - Pours clear deep golden color with huge fluffy white head. Lots of spotty lacing around the glass.
"Pours a hazy dark copper color with bright tangerine edges and a two finger pillowy off-white head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting cap. Excellent retention taking a while to settle and coating the glass wih large chunks of soapy lacing on its way down. A little darker than expected but retention and lacing are impressive. "
"Thanks to HIGHPA for this 22 oz. bottle, which comes after some post Huna Day detox. I probably shouldn’t drink until May. Split with my wife. "
Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a white head that left thick lacing.
"Dark rust / gold murky appearance, with a nice foamy lasting head. Pine and caramel on the nose and palate. Nice full mouthfeel for and IPA. East coast and west coast come together nicely on this one."
22 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.
22 oz. Bomber
"A fantastic, big DIPA. Had it on tap at Odyssey Gastropub in Colorado Springs CO just last night (2.19.17) and it was fresh as hell. Looks and tastes like a proper DIPA, and the smell is heavenly (I thought; piney mango woods!). There's a bit of harsh finish due to the high ABV, but in a good kick-in-the-teeth Ninja way. I mean...after all it is part of their Ninja series. Definitely try it if you see it. My only mistake was having it early in the evening; everything else seemed way weaker and less interesting after that one... Delicious!"
"Hazy orange color with off-white head. Aroma is juicy with overripe fruit notes and dank hops. Taste starts quite sweet with dank, resiny hops and some fruity notes. Finish has a medium bitterness and a hint of alcohol. Medium plus body, medium carbonation. Overall it's a quite good DIPA but a bit harsh on the alcohol."
"Excited to find this extra in a trade! Pours a deep orange hazy with minimal white head. Mild citrus nose, taste is stronger citrus. Definitely get a little alcohol bite too. Definitely worth seeking out."
too sweet
A: Poured into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is hazy coppery-amber that's more orangey-amber when backlit. Thin wisp of a whitish head on top.
Bottled fall 2014; drank 11/7/14 @ the Yarchives. 
"Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is big citrus--lemon, tangerine, and dried apricot. Slightly bitter, medium carbonation, and medium bodied. Juicy, but not as juicy as some New England style IPAs. Makes for a tasty sipper. One that I will search for again."
"Poured into a cocktail glass (hotel beer). A slightly hazy golden amber color with a foamy white head. Nice lacing. Huge orange aromas with grapefruit pith, pineapple, resin, and pine. I got big pineapple on the front palate. This was followed by an earthy resiny note which shifted back to a bitter grapefruit. A slightly caramel-sweet malt presence but balanced. Medium bodied and and clean finish."
Happy to have been able to get this one again. It is probably my favorite beer from the guys at pdubs.
"Bomber bottle, couldn't find any sort of bottling date info."
L- Opaque orange color with good head and lacing. 
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter glass. There was no bottling date on the bottle, but Pipeworks doesn't sit around, so I imagine it is fresh."
"Pours a hazy bright orange with off white head. Aroma of grapefruit, caramel, candied orange peel. Taste is grapefruit and orange rind layered on a strong caramel malt backbone. Finishes with a lingering resinous bitterness and candied citra for days."
Nose is holy Citra. Possible most aggressive Citra aroma I've smelled. I mean it slaps you with a fat d***. And the flavor is a deep throat of Citra flavor. Solidly bitter with a subtly sweet and boozy background. Finish is long long lingering Citra with just a tickling warmth in the belly. Fantastic brew!!
"A top Citra DIPA, and a top DIPA in general. Big citrus on the nose, supported with lots of orange on the tongue; darker undercurrents round off the briskness, something like the citric version of dank... Has a thick body with ample carbonation, sweet with orange fruity flesh; pinpoints of bitterness are bright and sharp. Deep golden amber body, opaque and apricot-colored. A fluffy off-white head, a couple of fingers high, left trails down the glass and persisted until near the end. Superior drink."
"Pours a hazy, golden orange with a one-finger, white head that dissipates quickly. Very little carbonation."
"Amber-ish gold in color with moderate clarity. Two fingers of airy white head that retains well and leaves good lacing. The aroma is as powerful as I've ever smelled in a citra hopped beer. Huge notes of grapefruit, other citrus, tropical fruit, and a touch of malt. The taste follows with the citrus and fruity character coming through. A nice malt backbone, with the hops lingering on the aftertaste. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Extremely smooth, balanced, and a moderate bitterness on the finish. Really phenomenal."
"L - amber (too dark?), not much haze (poured gently as directed on bottle), one-finger head sticks around"
"L: Reddish amber color, white lacing"
A - Great looking IPA. Deep honey gold body with 3 fingers of bone white head. Great retention and lace.
"Bomber. Pours deep clean amber with thin white head that lasts for awhile. Aroma full of dark fruit and citrus. Clean powerful taste, dark fruit sweetness with malt and piney hops. Very similar to the other Ninja brews, but with a deep fruity taste. Medium slick mouthfeel. Yum."
This one was received in a recent trade.
My first time drinking one of the single hopped Ninja's from Pipeworks.
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bottle on December 26, 2015. Look is hazy orange with a thin white head and lingering lacing. Smell is orange blossom, bitter citrus, melon, stone fruit, fresh cut pine with pale and caramel malt aromas. Taste is mango, tangerine, peach, pineapple, pine resin with buttery caramel and brown sugar malt flavors. Feel is medium in body with a bitter dry finish."
"1 week old and poured into a snifter. I may be a slight deviance here, but to me this is in the same category as SOS, Permanent Funeral, Heady, Pliny, or any top IIPA I've had. I also love Ninja vs Unicorn from them but this beats it out. Tons of citrus on the nose and in the taste, but not overboard. Balanced nicely."
Pours a just slightly cloudy peach color with a huge and thick white head that only grudgingly relaxes to lasting cap and thick slathers of lace.
"Great beer. Looks amazing. Almost amber colored, but super orange colored. The smell is citra. Amazing. Taste is super boozy in the finish. A lot of citrus notes in it, but the booze cuts through in the end. Nice bitterness and citrus."
8/8/15 - Poured into an IPA glass from a 22 oz bomber given to me by snaotheus.
"We break into a bomber, pouring into our Crooked Stave snifters. It shows up a deep, burning orange coloring, sporting a one finger head of creamy, wispy white bubbles. This retains decently before receding into thin cracks of lacing around our glasses. A dense chill haze is noted, but no sediment is found. Carbonation appears to be moderate. The aroma offers buttery caramel and pale maltiness, intense hoppiness of citrus and melon fruitiness brushed with mild soapiness, light plastic phenols, mineral water, steel, coconut husk, plastic drinking straws, VHS tape cardboard boxes, brown sugar, sharp rubbing alcohol booziness, red rock dustiness, and simple syrup. The taste comes as quite a surprise, as the nose, albeit intense, held a bit more sweetness to it. The flavoring is incredibly bitter, awakening the senses from the very first sip. Notes include bittering herbal, grapefruity citric, and nectary fruity hoppiness, salted caramel and hotly roasted pale and amber grain, dusty vinyl, cloying pineapple syrups and sugars, drying fresh rosemary slickness, perfumed floral chemicals, fusel booziness, green acorns, damp basement mustiness, cement lick, vegetal bitterness of raw Brussel sprouts, and Crisco oiliness. The body is on the full side of medium, and the carbonation is robust. Each sip gives hearty slurp and smack, with bright pop to linger on the end of the tongue. The mouth is left cold and dried with a modest stickiness. The abv is big, but approachable, and the beer drinks back on the quick side."
Received in a trade. poured from bottle to IPA glass
Poured from a bomber into my DFH IPA glass.
Great brew I received in a trade recently. Awesome color accented with a wreck-your-palate-like taste. Wicked hoppy and aromatic. Wish this brewery distributed to my state.
"22oz bottle poured into an IPA glass. The aroma is initially a strong herb and grass presence that fades into fruit stripe gum and other bright, sweet juicy tangerine and grapefruit notes with some mango. Late in the drink, the aroma turns to caramel as the fruit fades. It pours a brilliant amber with a slightly off-white, big foam head that has good retention and lace. The taste is a blend of Medium fruity sweet and a high, waxy bitter end with a light touch of sour. The texture is that of a heavy oil with a fuzzy carbonation and a medium full, bitter grapefruit rind and grass body with light notes of toast interspersed. The finish is crisp with a strong bitter pine and fruit crescendo that's quick to clean leaving a fresh pine and spice along with a light bitter waxiness that lingers lightly and isn't cloying. The aftertaste is long but light with notes of bread crust and wax."
"In my opinion this is the best smelling beer I have ever had. The taste is truly a perfect example at a DIPA showcasing citra hops. Find it, drink it, enjoy it! This one's definitely in my top 5 from any brewer and probably #1 from PW. I can only thank Pipeworks for releasing it this time along with ""Square Grouper"" & ""N.vs.U"" Cans, this has allowed me to find it all over the place. Craft beer life is doing well in the Chicagoland area!!!"
One of the best Imperial IPA's I've had. Very tasty and hides the alcohol very well.
"My first taste of Pipework, and I can't say that I'm not impressed. Very similar flavor profile to Zombie Dust, although much more in-your-face. Juicy citrus notes with astringent bitterness all the way through."
"My first Pipeworks beer back in 2013, and I've been a convert ever since. Really, just a fantastic IPA when fresh."
"I had one of these less than 2 weeks old. It really was a malt bomb, and I had really high hopes."
Bottle was from Batch 623-626 1/31/15 
for me.. what set this one one apart from the many other IPA was its super balanced sweet honey like malt profile...it was not necessarily a perfect expression of the citra hop... it is for more of a nice well balanced beer with some Citra hops.more like a better version Of 90 min ipa... less like kern river citra or pseudo sue.
Don't need to justify my rating
"Citrusy, juicy, bold imperial pale from one of Chicago's best and most innovative breweries"
Many thanks to Charlie for the bottle!
2015-02-21
"Really good with sweet citra hop taste. But, at over $10 a 22 oz bottle, it's hard to justify this over local neighbor Anti-Hero to me. 6 of those for $10, compares to over $30 for Citra. I just don't see it worth the price, even for a DIPA. Glad I tried it, but not worth the hassle of tracking it down. Not even sure it's better than Ninja vs Unicorn."
L - Deep orange with a thin white head. heavy lacing and syrupy legs
"Had a fresh bottle on Christmas Eve 2014. I was impressed, light and refreshing and less cloudy than a lot of their beers. I enjoyed it as I do most stuff by PW"
A: Dark. Really dark. Burnt orange. The whole time I was thinking that this was a joke and that it was some sort of imperial amber or red ale. Did I mention this is dark?
Thanks to Kevin_Young for this one.
Thanks to brentlepping for the share.
22 oz bottle batch 535/536 ...just released this week FRESH
Poured into a Funky Buddha Brewery snifter. Sticker on the bottle says 09/05/14.
Batch 503/504 (less than a month from the brew date)
If you love Citra hops then this is the one you have to have!
"22 oz bomber, batch # dates this at Sept 4th or 5th."
Outsatanding Imperial IPA. I've had several great beers from Pipeworks and I'd have to say this is the best. All of their IPA's are definitely worth seeking out. Ultra smooth hoppiness and complexity. Absolutely as good as it gets !
This is a TASSSTY beer!
"Pours a gorgeous golden orange. Scent is explosive, with pine, pine, pine, and a bit of citrus. Texture is dense and (in a good way) oily, Taste echoes the scent. Despite the high ABV, I tasted no alcohol. Man, I'm embarrassed how I chugged this. This is a preposterously good beer."
"Been searching for this one for a while, so very pleased to finally get to try it. I've had and liked several of the more popular and highly rated DIPAs out there, so I know what I'm looking for. This one doesn't quite meet my expectations or the hype, but it's still pretty decent. In true Pipeworks tradition, this is a very big, boozy beer. Alcohol is not hidden very well. I think this bottle is only 5 days old, but the hops don't really ""pop"" like I thought they would. There's also a very malty, syrupy finish to the beer which I'm not fond of. This one reminds me most of Double Sunshine or Hopslam. Good beer, worth seeking out, but not a world-class DIPA in my book."
The citra ninja is a beautiful offering from pipeworks. The beer poured a clear rich copper with white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent was typical of citra beers orange peel citrus mixed with pine and touch of spice. The taste follows the scent. The m outhfeel is full body with good carbonation. Overall...YUMMY!
"Thanks to 316nuts. Pours a deep reddish amber. This almost looks like an imperial red ale. It's somewhat cloudy. The head is medium to small and off-white. Bubbles fade to not much after a minute. The aroma has a lot of caramel malt with some solid citrus and tropical fruit hoppiness. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple, mango, white grape, peach, mint. Some spice. Doughy, caramely malt. Mild booze. A little bubblegum. Taste is sweet, but the caramel malt character is restrained. Medium to medium-high bitterness. Good hop flavor. More of the same mix of citrus, tropical and other fruit notes. The mixture of bitter and sweet gets in the way of the hop complexity a bit. It just gets a bit harsh in the finish. Some alcohol heat but it's mostly hidden. Normal carbonation. A bit heavy. Hop oily. Just a little cloying, at least for my taste. This doesn't fit my preferences in the style, but I can appreciate why others like it."
Thnx chidave!
"Rust orange in appearance and absolutely stunningly bright orange in direct sunlight, nothing more inviting in an IPA for me."
Appearance: deep orange color. A half finger of a white head that leaves behinds decent lacing behind. Pretty hazy and almost opaque. 
22oz bottle (batch 393-394) poured into a Duvel tulip.
Really happy to finally get my hands on this one. 
22oz bomber poured into Spiegelau tulip.
Bomber poured into a pint glass.
22oz bomber from batch #406-407.
"A - Translucent bronzed orange color. Large, fluffy, light, bubbly, white head. Good lacing leaving a light layer of lace."
Bottle dated 5/1/14 into an IPA glass.
Bottle courtesy of Jeff...thank you kindly for the opportunity.
"Poured into a Teku. Dark hazy orange, with a finger of slightly off white head."
"If you've ever enjoyed a Citra hopped beer before, you'd be hard pressed to say it's better than this one. One that comes to mind is FFF Permanent Funeral. I've blind tasted this with that, and with everyone I've done it with, Pipeworks comes out on top."
"Old review from notes: 8 oz. into a FFF Rastal on December 20th, 2013."
Acquired in a trade with wesside89
"From 02/11/14 notes. Big thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing this one; thanks Ross, another big want of mine. 22 oz. bottle into my Bell's tulip."
"Batch # 280-81-82-83 – sometime between Dec. 18, 2013 and Dec. 20…so about six weeks old. "
This is by far one of the best double IPAs I've ever tasted especially do to the fact it was brewed with citra hops my favorite hops. I had batch 280 and understanding it was more than one month old but I still was in great shape. I'm not too into having my DIPAs super fresh so it worked great for me. The malt on this beer slightly reminded me of Heady Topper but in my opinion this beats the shit out of Heady Topper and Pliny in that matter. Would love to compare this to Kern River Citra (not Noble Ale Works Citra Showers because that brew was a little disappointing for me) Highly recommend this brew if you can get your hands on it.
"Acquired via trade with MattLatuchie. Pours a dark orange with a thick off-white head. Good retention and lacing. The aroma jumps out of the glass - lots of earthy, tropical fruit, citrusy hops with some bready notes. The malt really comes out on the palate with chewy, resinous, bitter hops throughout. Finishes dry with a slight, peppery kick. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, a quality DIPA and great showcase for this very popular hop."
Received from Fusebuddy in a very hoppy trade. Consumed on 1/6/14 Batch #280-81-82-83
"Batch #280-81-82-83. Pours a hazy, orangish-golden color with a large white head that goes down rather quickly. Scent is extraordinary... very fresh tropical fruits...mango, guava, and pineapple. A hint of melon as well. Just a little bit of citrus, but mostly tropical fruits. Such a nice aroma! Taste is just as it smells... the citra hops are REALLY shining with this beer. I love IPAs that hide the malt profile, and this beer hides it well. Just hops here. Tropical hops and tons of them! Not overly bitter, but just the right amount of bitterness. Actually, it's amazing how light the bitterness is of this beer for not having a malty taste to it. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and juicy. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer has something going on. I haven't hear anything about this beer...all I know is it is the real deal. Such great flavors, while keeping the malt profile down for a big DIPA. Wish I could get this locally."
"22oz bomber poured into a snifter. Finally getting to try this one, I believe I've had every other hop variant in this line. "
"Glad to have finally tried this. Pours a dark orange color with a two finger off white head that dissipates slowly. Moderate carbonation. Smells of tons of juicy hops. An onslaught of mango, as well as pineapple, guava, papaya, grapefruit, orange, and a candied sweetness. A slight dank quality to it. As it warms, a butterscotch note comes out from the malt. If there was an air freshener that smelled like this, I would buy it on the spot…smells amazing. Taste is just as good. Starts with lots of mango, papaya, and grapefruit, but also has a nice sweetness and butterscotch flavor to accompany it. The finish is wonderful. Tropical and citrus fruits galore. Papaya, guava, mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit rind, a slight herbal (almost piney) note, a ""cat piss"" quality, along with a candied sweetness that gives the fruits a juicy quality to them. Slightly dry on the finish. A slight abrasiveness to it, but with the sweetness it is not overbearing at all. High medium body with a creamy, yet oily mouthfeel. The nice, sweet malt balance, along with the amazingly complex and juicy hop profile make this double ipa stand out. If you are a citra hop fan, seek this out. There aren’t many dipas that capture the complexity and deliciousness of the citra hop quite like this one. This is another exceptional double ipa from Pipeworks."
"22 oz. bottle, with no apparent bottled on date present. Batch #280-81-82-83 printed on the label. Another in the line up of Pipeworks' former Ninja series of single hop beers. Sad to have seen the Ninja go, but such is life and beer. Expectations are great as always."
"Pours a clear golden color with thin white head that leaves some ropy lacing. Nose is citra heaven, tons of tropical and mango aromas with some grapefruit rind and some resinous qualities towards the end. Flavor is full flavored and has a malt bill that holds up the boat loads of hops. Lots of tropical fruit up front and a building bitterness that packs a hoppy punch all the way through the finish. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium bodied. Overall, another delicious beer from the previously known as Ninja series."
"22 oz. bottle purchased at West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, IL; unknown bottling date but presumed fresh - Batch ""280-81-82-83""; drank out of a hotel glass over an hour or so"
22 oz bottle courtesy of clewis901 pours a hazed orange color with a large-bubbled white head. Spotty lace and not a whole lot of retention.
"Stealth-like precision, silent but deadly, ruthless and invisible- these are all things that ninjas are... but this beer is none of those. Its brash and in your face with the most wonderful and enduring flavors imaginable in beer."
The coloring was orange but it took a reddish hue in low light so that the two colors had a sunset appearance. The head was thick and foamy with a good white color.
Poorer from a bomber into a tulip - nice frothy head with a consistent lacing. I got a slam of citra hops right off the bat when I drank with a silky mouthfeel. The aromas were beautiful citra floral hops that just made the taste explode. 
Bottle from batch 176 poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours a dark orange/copper with a little haze and three fingers of off white head of mostly larger bubbles. Head leaves light lacing as it dissipates. 
Pours cloudy dark amber with a big 2 finger off white head
"22oz bottle thanks to LSMroz, batch 175 bottled 7/26/13 so exactly four weeks old, pretty fresh. Heavy orange color, great head. Aroma is super pungent hops, smells good. The flavor is very hoppy but it has this candy sweetness to it and the slightest hint of aspirin. Its not bad but it is astringent. Overall, it smells better than it tastes."
650 mL bottle poured into a snifter. 
1 PINT 6FL. OZ. bottle
Drank 2 bottle of this over the weekend and it is not a consistent beer
"Thx Rare_Man for the trade! This was my 2nd time having this brew. Bomber poured into a Bruery tulip. Pours a slightly cloudy, very dark orange with BIG head ;-). Aroma of citrus and loads of tropical fruit. Taste is light bitter. Citrus and pineapple and tropical fruits. Wow this is good. Full bodied with a thick and sticky texture. Lively carbonation and a super long finish. Overall, awesome. I could absolutely drink this everyday."
"This poured out as a cloudy orange color with a fluffy white head on top. The smell of the beer doesn't shy away from showing off it's hop character, neither does the taste for that matter. Overall this beer was great in my opinion, it's always fun to see these single hops working in a beer to see how they turn out."
Appearance-
"Re-reviewing this one, given that my first offering was flat secondary to poor bottling. This is the freshest batch but interestingly made it out of the brewery without a batch number. Poured into a FFF Teku."
"A: cloudy orange, finger khaki head, "
Bottle (2013)
"Murky, dark orange, with a two finger head that was off white and laced a ton. Aroma was undeniably Citra: big juicy citrus fruits, orange, mango, grapefruit, touches of caramel. Pretty spot on with the taste as well, boasting tons of citrus like orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple. Bitterness was medium, body was full with an oily creaminess, but not too heavy. Sipped pretty easy, finished cleanly on the palate. Couldn't really detect any booze. "
"Just had this two days ago, enjoyed in a 3F teku glass. It was bottled 3 days prior, Batch #176."
"Appearance: A deep, burnt orange color. Pours with about a finger of light head. Head has low retention throughout, maintaining on the edges of the glass. Very low carbonation active while drinking. Random lacing on the edges of the glass. "
"I wanted to do a quick review of this after having a second bottle, just because I came into the beer having certain expectations, and I wanted to make sure I got those out of the way."
Pipeworks - Citra Ninja
"Pours an orange-amber hue,. A decent haziness, frothy whitish head atop sticks around and laces well throughout. Aromas are firm and vibrant citrus, showing good grapefruit, lemon, and some pithy rind. Florals, grass, a bit resiny. Grapefruit juice and rind meet lemon, florals, and grass. Not complex, but by the book with flavors that flow well and work well together. Middle shows a sustained fruity hop presence, big citrus, some bready malt, soap and florals meet some decent resiny dryness in the back. Mouthfeel is medium. Overall, a solid beer!"
Pours a deep & cloudy honey color with a super fine one finger ecru head. Lacing is extraordinary.
Thanks to GRG1313 for sharing this one at his tasting.
"22oz bottle batch #109 (I would guess it is about 3 weeks old now) poured into a Bell's snifter and quaffed today, 4/22/2013."
Served into a Unibroue Ephemere tulip.
Batch 109. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into my 7venth Sun tulip glass.
"Batch #110. Pours slightly hazy, dark orange. One finger white head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is pineapple and oranges. Somewhat floral. Flavor is mostly citrus and tropical fruit, pine and a kinda graininess. Heavy body with super creamy carbonation. Very bitter finish. Excellent balance between the high hops and heavy malts. Absolutely loved this beer."
"A: Pours a somewhat hazy copper color. Semi translucent. Shiny,white, fluffy, pillow-like head. Leaves good lacing as it settles into a layer of fizzy bubbles."
Thanks to Robbie for this bottle! Batch #109. Bottled on ???
The burbs don't sell out of this as quickly as downtown so I was lucky enough to grab one. I should have grabbed two. I'll be back tomorrow to check if they have any left. 
"A Citra bomb from the spunky li'l brewery that brought us Ninja vs Unicorn? Yes, please. Served in a Half Acre tulip."

Batch 54
Big thanks to blastbeats for this one!
"Don’t review quite as much as I used to, but needed to here for two reasons…"
"I have had many IPA's that say they have used Citra hop's. But this is the first time I have had a beer that the brewery didn't go light on the Citra, Pipeworks Brewery has made a big statement with this beer and it a big WOW! This is a beautiful beer and I wish I could have bought more."

22 oz. bottle served in a Bell's tulip. Batch # 54.
Picked up a bottle from my local Binny's (excited to see Pipeworks in the suburbs now!) and poured into a tulip glass.
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Half Acre tulip.
Poured from 650 ml bottle into a becker.
"This is one of the best new beers I have had In a while. I need to preface this by the statement that I am a citra hop whore, but this beer is elite. The floral smell is intense, lots of citrus. I was definitely salivating before drink one."
"Bright saturated orange with slowly rising trails of carbonation, a thick head of white foam that has a meringue-like texture sits on the surface, slowly coating the glass with sheets of lacing. Lasting retention, looks really nice. "
"Pours an orangish yellow, slight white foamy head. When held up to the light, it looks like a glass of milky orange juice. Great citrus aroma. Flavor is sweet and milky, loads of citrus and tropical fruit: orange, lemon, pineapple, mango. Has a nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall a fun beer, I am getting a little tired of the “lactose” ipa’s, but this one has a nice balance of sweetness and hoppy bitterness."
"On tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY."
DDH Space Daydream - Other Half
Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned on 07/18/2018 (code: MIDWEEKH05) and purchased at the brewery that weekend.
"32oz growler from Other Half. Pours an opaque milky yellow with an inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is lots of sweet fruits. Pineapple, orange, lime, mango and some fruity candy as well. The taste has more citrus than I got from the nose. Grapefruit, lemon and lime along with the pineapple. Some herbal and dank hop notes. Fleshy fruit finish with a bit citrus acidity. Creamy with a dry mouthfeel. Moderate alcohol presence."
"This beer pours a completely opaque, super cloudy, darkish golden yellow color with a two finger, fluffy, creamy, bright white head. Retention is off the charts and there sticky patches and chunks of lacing left all over the glass."
"I dig it, but in the grand scheme of Galaxy wars, ddh space diamonds still wins."
This one is new to me...tha is Scott and robbie!
"Picked this up when it was released at Other Half, finally getting around to it tonight. Liked the original but this wasn't that much of an improvement over it. Dank, juicy, and deep, this had enough going for it while still being a great example of the typical dank IPA from this neck of the woods."
Tall can 12/21/17 thanks to the Brooklyn Mob for procuring this and trading with me
"On tap at Haymaker, pours yellow gold color with a 1 finger foamy off white head that faded slowly and left really nice rings of foamy lacing."
"Traded for this at Other Half as it costs a ton of money in tolls to drive out to Sand City from here. I love both of these breweries and like the other reviewers on here, this one didn't disappoint. Green, strong, and sticky, there was a lot going on here but in the end, this went down well for having more than enough heft to it!"
"Double dry hopped, featuring Galaxy, Mosaic, and Motueka hops; 12/23/17 can release..."
"Can from yesterday's release and it did not disappoint. Like all Sand City beers, it's a bit green at this point so I will do a full review in 1-2 weeks. The bones of this brew are outstanding so this will definitely get better."
"Pours like orange juice with big white head. Tons of lacing. Aroma of grapefruit, orange juice and citrus. Taste follows the nose with big hops. Excellent imperial. Better then the first collaboration in my opinion."
"Purchased from Brewery on release date, enjoyed shortly after in the proper glassware."
Poured from a growler into a willie pint glass.
"16oz can courtesy of beerloserLI. Contract brewed and canned in Sterling, Virginia, on February 23, 2018 per the label and bottom stamp. I do know a ""tesseract"" is a thing but not what kind of thing."
"A: The beer is relatively clear yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high bright white head that died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles on the surface, a collar around the edge, and some lacing down the sides of the glass."
On tap.
I feel like grimm has toned down a bit! They are probably trying to hone in their new brewery so I'll give this another go later on down the road!
Second only to Afterimage by Grimm
"Served in a snifter. Golden orange, hazy color. Little head, left lace on glass. Subtle aroma of citrus and light pine. Taste is wonderful, citrusy, smoooooth blend of hops and malt. Mouth-filling, with a clean, pleasant finish. A joy to sip and savor."
"Came in a goblet a slight hazed lighter lemon yellow color with a half finger white head atop.Big orange oil aromas with a bit of resin,caramel and sweet alcohol thrown in.Orange and sweet onion flavors with some resin showing thru,sweet biscuit malts underneath along some stinging alcohol.It's good but to me not nearly as good as the rating....not even close."
Delicious!
"A phenomenal, world class IPA that can stand up to all the cult New England IPAs. Grimm makes incredible beers, and this one is one of their best. "
Very smooth IPA for and 8.0. Definitely does not have that traditional IPA after bite. Veery smoooth.
Probably worth noting that the can I am drinking is from contract brewer Beltway Brewing. 
"unlike lambo door, which was supposed to be epic but fell short of that mark, this one is incredible, one of the best ipa types i have had from grimm, if not the very best. on tap at blue tusk in syracuse, its a pretty beer, very light, pale yellow/orange in color with a little haze. i can almost still smell it, its so pungent in the nose. these hops are incredible, i wish i knew which varietals were here, but suffice it to say its a big tropical juicy medley, and with the base being so light, its hops from the second it hits the lips until long after the swallow. surprised this is as strong as it is, it drinks like an all day from founders, no kidding, just light and easy and juicy all the way. hints of lime and pineapple in the hop complexion and only very tame bitterness here. not as thick and hazy as a lot of the now famous easy coast ipa types, but it has a similar hop flavor to it, punchy and mega fresh. awesome carbonation, not watery in feel, sneaky strong. a majorly enjoyable glass of ipa, this is about as good as they get in this direction. oddly wonderful on a kicking hangover..."
"Wow. Another excellent IPA from Grimm, whom I've known mostly for their sours and wild ales, but whose IPA offerings have proven to be consistently impressive."
A: [4.50] The can lists the ABV (8.0%) it also has a canned date (10/24/2016) it also looks really cool. The beer is a murky apricot color. It pours out with 1 1/2 fingers of really dense white head. 
Tap at Flynn's Mansfield
Canned 10/24/16. Consumed 11/10/16.
"Rosy-golden-amber with little to no head. Smells fruity! Taste is fruity and a little herbal, only mild bitterness. Very low carbonation, feels a little thin."
It's gorgeous actually and a nice amber. Very hazy but not terrible or turbid or muddy. Light would pass through but it's late at night. Thin white head that fell fast.
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (c’mon, let’s be real here—it’s my favorite piece of Jester King stemware). This is 12 days old, according to a canning date on the underside of the can (“CANNED ON 10/24/16 09:16:06”). This can was purchased two days ago, and it’s been in the fridge ever since. "
Grimm Tesseract 
"Poured from a can into a tulip a slightly hazy golden orange color with a fingers worth of white head. The nose has tons of fruits in it, citrus, tropical, and stone with some inviting hints of pine. The flavor has a great balance of fruit, lots of mango, with some piney bitterness. The feel is resinous and syrupy. This is a big juicy Double IPA with a good amount of bitterness to balance it all out. Definitely one of the best I've had by Grimm and they've all been good!"
"For the record, I absolutely love Grimm and Tesseract is the beer that got me into craft beer so I am super excited to review this new batch!"
"In addition to its name making me want to go re-watch The Avengers, the can itself is pretty awesome. I enjoyed this IPA, but would put it just behind Afterimage for Grimm's best."
Pours out a very hazy golden orange color.
Very excited to try the Grimm DIPAs finally! Been enjoyed their other offerings for a while but we don't get their hops in Iowa. Even though this can was a few months old it was still a hop bomb on the senses! Would love to try more! very smooth for a DIPA!
Tap take-over at Beltway Brewing. 
"From a fresh growler, pours a fairly hazy orange-gold. A finger of white foam leaves ample lacing. Smell is a fruit salad explosion--huge tangerine, plus pineapple, mango, orange, lemon, and more. Taste is all that, with some bready notes in the middle. Finishes with sweet fruit flavors offset by enough piney bitterness to keep it from being too sweet. Feel is a solid medium, with a really nice soft creamy quality. No hint of alcohol. My favorite Grimm beer thus far by a good margin, it lives up to the hype."
"Had this last night, tasted it against very hazy and I preferred this beer. It was pretty solid, great smell and taste. Probably the best Grimm IPA I've had so far."
"L: Poured from a 16oz. can into a Hill Farmstead tulip glass. Hazy, bright orange-brown with a beautiful frothy white 2-finger head that leaves some lacing and a nice resident froth. Looks gorgeous."
"Picked this up at various points around New York, as there weren't very many places that had this and those that did limited how much I was able to buy. I love the Grimm Ales that I've had so far and I was eager to give this a go, and while this did not disappoint, I was hoping that this would be as full and flavored as their other offerings that I've had in the past. It turned out to be just a bit too typical for me and with so many other examples of this style floating around right now, this needed just a bit more to stand out above them!"
"oh wow, wish i could get this regualrly, this was the most approachable Double I have had, look was unfiltered deep orange glow with a fantastic head, smell was deep and full of dank citrus and spice, taste was fantastically smooth and prominent in citrus, feel was just fantastic, great carbonation...just simply a great great beer."
"On-tap 5/10/2016 at Natty Greene’s Tavern in North Attleboro, MA, served in a tulip glass."
"From a can to Tulip. Can dated 4/8/16 (had it fresh, just haven't gotten around to review)"
"Appearance: Pours slightly hazy, with the honey colored liquid capped by a beaten egg white head of foam; decent stickage; splashy lacing leaves strands of foam sticking to the glass"
Really great IPA
From can. Dark hazy orange. Moderate white head that sticks. Nice orange aroma with a clean malt backbone. Elegant. Nice citrus presence with some peel umph. Good carb and juicy.
L -- Amber color with a thick frothy white head. Lots of lacing to go with it. 
"From the can, pours cloudy orange gold color with a massive 2-3 finger foamy off white head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating very slowly and leaving outstanding lacing coating the sides along with rings along the glass as it went down, and a canyon of foam that eased down like ice melting. Basically it looked perfect."
Consumed ~2 weeks from bottling date
"16 oz can, canned 4-8-16, consumed 15 days later."
"3.74/5: I love the deft lightness and the defined yet subtle malt backbone, but the onion is a bit too much for me personally"
"Poured from the can into a snifter. The first half of the can pours a moderately cloudy light golden yellow color with a thick white head. The smell dominates with a fruity tangerine citrus aroma, ripe peach, dried apricot, bubblegum for days, mild spearmint, honeydew melon, papaya, mango, some dank pine, with an underlying sweet crackery pale malt. Soft, creamy, medium mouth feel, extremely juicy, with good carbonation, and almost no lingering bitterness. The flavor is reminiscent of tropical fruit nectar, candied tangerine, papaya, pineapple, resinous pine contributes to the bitterness, honey sweetness, pale malt, bubblegum, guava, dankness, and lemon zest."
"Pours rich beautiful orange. Aroma of citrus , blueberry and peppery. Excellent all the way through."
"Pours rich beautiful orange hazy and unfiltered with a two finger head. Smells of sticky citrus hops, blueberry and peppery notes. Taste is sweet, juicy, tropical, with some earthiness. Bitterness on the back end and lingering peppery spice. Bitterness and hops come through more and more the more you drink. Actual mouthfeel is somewhat light bodied for a double IPA, but very thirst quenching and refreshing. This is a really good DIPA."
"Pours hazy orange, wispy bubbly head. Aroma is big citrus, tropical fruit, sharp piney notes. Taste is sweet tropical fruit salad with a bitter tang at the end. Minimal booze. Feel is super smooth. Great beer."
This is one of my favorite Ales by Grimm...it is absolutely amazing and refreshing. It leaves you wanting more.
"It pours a pale hazy straw. Tastes like legit mango, guava, passion fruit juice. Very little to light bitterness. This is an awesome DIPA from Grimm. Served on draft, so may be a little less aroma."
"Unfiltered pale golden, east coast IPA action with ample fruits and subtle bitterness; juicy body, soft feel, moderate carbonation. Features Mosaic, Falconer's Flight, and Citra hops. A real crusher. Finishes smooth and clean - guaranteed to leave you longing for another."
Hazy yellow body with a long lasting and lacy white head. Swirling reveals some active carbonation.
"Hazy, juicy, fruity. Best DIPA!"
this is an amazing brew!
"Juicy, aromatic DIPA with tropical fruit for days."
A: Poured into a tulip glass. Body is a hazy golden with a small white head.
Smooth and well balanced
"Really excellent effort from Grimm. Deep gold to light copper, plenty of citrus on the nose. Palate leans more towards grapefruit than the tropical fruits, and a bit less malty sweetness than Afterimage."
"N: lemon zest, honey, grapefruit, grassy hops. "
WOW. This is an excellent offering from Grimm. Nice yellowish cloudy color with real strong grapefruit smell. Very juicy taste with some grapefruit and pineapple notes. Nice smooth finish with mild bitterness. A Wonderful DIPA!
Served from a growler
"Extremely citrus, beautiful aromma with a little bite"
My first visit to Torst and this was the winner. Fantastic DIPA from a brewery I was previously unfamiliar with. Will be keeping my eyes on Grimm beers from here on out.
4.8
"Poured into a large snifter, body is peachy orange, nice lacing. Smell is excellent, tropical fruit. Pineapple juice, honeydew, a little mango, and grapefruit. Taste is also great, well balanced juicy hop bomb. Mouthfeel is nice, well carbonated. I had one of these the day of purchase, and then 1 each week or so for 3 weeks. Each time the beer has offered different notes, all delicious"
Look- pours out a beautiful yellow/orange juice. 
16 ounce can poured into an oversized tulip. 
"3rd canning 10/24/16 enjoyed 11/7/16. Excellent as always. Like the iipa you know, but with an extra dimension of complexity. (A tesseract to be sure!)"
Look is hazy yellow with golden Amber highlights. Head is thick and frothy. 
"So many layers of tropical fruit juicyness going on. Citrus, tons of orange, light peach, slight lemon, pineapple, a little grapefruit, so complex for a hoppy brew. The mouthfeel is fluffy, perfect carbonation as well. Very little bitterness at all. Well done as always by Grimm."
Received a can from my buddy Eric.
Purchased a 4 pack of this. Super bright hoppy aroma...a mild berry note mixed with orange forward citrus. Appearance was an orange yellow cloudy haze. Taste follows the nose and has a thick creamy mouthfeel. Very juicy. 
"L - A surprising pale yellow pour, enough so that I had to pause for a second and let it register what I was about to drink. Nice white head. A pretty beer."
L: Pours an extremely hazy light golden orange.
The beer comes in a medium to deep gold hazy color.
16oz can from Noble Grains NYC on the UES
"From 11/24/15 notes at Threes Brewing in Brooklyn, NY. Poured from a 16 oz. can I to a stange glass."
"Opaque gold color with quickly fading head. Pineapple, passionfruit and grapefruit hops on nose with nice slightly sweet malt in background. Flavor is strongly citrus/ tropical hops as noted in aroma, about as big as can be - and I just got back from DIPA overload in VT. Hop bitterness is relatively subtle and very well balanced against the slight grainy/ honey-like malt. That said, a slightly (slightly!) off-putting soapy, mineral-like flavor on the finish that I assume is related to brewing salts in such high aroma-hopped beers. I noticed this on some of the above-mentioned VT beers (Second Fiddle...) But it doesn't detract much, this is one fantastic dipa hop bomb."
"This beer pours a beautiful hazy golden orange. The head is two fingers and bright white that leaves thick rings of lacing. The smell is the highlight of this beer. The scent is bursting with grapefruit, pineapple, mango and orange. The taste is similar although a bit subdued compared to the smell. Feel is light and very soft and smooth. So drinkable and no hint of alcohol. Overall this is another fantastic IPA by Grimm."
"On tap at Gingerman. This is a fantastic DIPA, basically tropical fruit punch without the sugary mouth feel. ABV is completely hidden, dangerously drinkable. The only other brewery that has produced a beer this delicate that I've tried is Hill Farmstead."
Smooth grapefruit heaven!
From a can into a tulip glass- slight haze and tropical on the nose- ruby red grapefruit taste all the way- the feel is kinda pillowy in the way that resembles Trillium. An awesome beer that I hope they put into regular rotation
"Can poured into a pint glass. Opaque vibrant gold. Unbelievably juicy in the nose and on the tongue. Tesseract is an explosion of grapefruit and melon. Just a hint of dandelion and a slight bitter bite at the end. Easy drinking and delicious. Not that they were every bad, but Grimm has been killing it lately."
"canned a week ago, picked up locally, enjoyed from a grimm taster."
one of the best beers I've ever had.
Quite simply one of the best beers I've ever had. Did a side by side with HF Abner yesterday and I was surprised but this was clearly the better brew. Amazing flavor that keeps coming. Wonderful taste and mouth feel that stays. I can't say enough about this beer. Might be the only IPA I'd take over a Heady. Color me impressed. Great job by Grimm. Pulse Wave was excellent but this is their best to date. Damn fine brew. Cheers
"Had a can purchased on Long Island last night (store had a one can limit), and then again on tap tonight at a Merrick restaurant. "
I really enjoyed this beer.
Pours a very hazy golden yellow-orange with about a finger of pale head. I'm a sucker for hazy beer with this much luminosity.
"Can dated 11/13/15. Hazy orange pour; big carbonation leads to a fast fading head. Aroma is a citrus bomb that hits the nosevwhile pouring it into the glass. Taste follows, leading with grapefruit, orange and pineapple. Delicious. Light bodied and eeeeeasy drinking. Finish is smooth and sweet."
"Canned 11/13/2015, enjoyed 11/20/2015."
"Fortunate to have a contract brewer near my house. On tap poured into a tulip. Appearance is a orangish golden color. Great juicy hop aroma. First sip was great, some lingering bitterness from an otherwise citrus taste. Overall a solid beer."
"Green-hued, dirty good color. Mild chill haze. Small, bar poured, head. Excellent webbed lace on the glass. "
Unique and delicious!
"12oz tall wineglass in Midtown, NY. Really enjoyed this on a hot day."
"Served from a 32 oz. crowler. A floral, citrusy explosion as it's poured into the glass. The taste follows the nose although I did find it a bit on the sweet, cloying end of the spectrum. I would, however, definitely give it another try in the future."
"Light colored IPA. Great tropical smells right off the bat with this one. Taste is even better. So juicy and delicious, just an absolute perfect balance of a NE IPA with just enough of a bitter finish to it that also just makes the mouthfeel perfect. Lambo door was a solid DIPA, but I prefer the mouthfeel on this, as the LD was a struggle to get any feel of carbonation. I could drink a few of these every single day from here on out. Really a fantastic beer and I'm so glad these guys live in my city. Thrilled that they decided to brew this a second time, and I just wish it was going to be a semi-regular offering in the rotation. A beer this spectacular shouldn't just be brewed once or twice and never again...."
What a beer.
"Great VT inspired brew, Juicy Tropical Fruit subtle bitterness"
"cloudy straw pour, awesome tropical fruit citrus bouquet. Tastes of mango and pineapple before a small bitterness and a dry finish. Mouthfeel was a little mild on carbonation."
Very light and elegant. Pineapple and mango notes are prominent with a little bit of a hop presence [but very subtle]. Overall very light and very drinkable. Possibly the first IPA I could suggest to drink at virtually anytime.
"L - moderately hazy honey color, not much head"
"I typically like Summit hops, but this is a straight onion bomb. Really unappealing."
"On tap @ Arrogant Swine - Brooklyn, NY"
Served in a snifter at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth. 
A: Deep straw with slight haze. Rocky Ivory white head. Good lacing.
Just a short review. Amazing citrus aroma. Grapefruit and citrus taste in abundance. Incredible well done beer.
13 oz. pour at The Ginger Man.
"Growler procured from Nathaniel Square Corner Store in Rochester, NY."
Canned a month ago. 
"Solid flavor, unique taste, smooth finish"
Hazy golden-bronze with three fingers of yellowed head. Soapy rings of lacing.
Another can picked up Friday at the (now-closed!) Congress Street outpost of Trillium. Pretty proud of hitting 50 lbs. right on with my luggage; not a wasted ounce. 16 oz. can dated 9/24/18.
The smell of this beer is one of the best out there! Aromas and taste of tropical fruit come through and make you want more. Great feel and refreshing finish.
"For me, this one tastes better out of the can, as it retains the wine aromas better. Not enough hops for me. The alcohol was hidden for me as well, which could be dangerous given the ABV. Enjoyable for sure, but not their best IMHO."
Not sure if it was just this can or the batch but the first of m four pack had lots of sediment. Taste was still very good with that hint of a white wine like taste but pouring it in a glass was not making me feel good about it based on how many floaters there were. I’ve had my fair share of beers with floaters and this being only two weeks old still tasted great with only a slight notice in the feel. Hoping the rest of my four pack is floater free though.
Appearance: Pours a hazy honey color with a thin cap; dots and dashes linger behind
Poured from 16oz can into 20oz Sauvin Glass. Canning date is 11/30/17 (not fresh).
"16oz can, dated 8.2.17, poured into a Trillium Permutation Series stemmed glass. Enjoyed on 8.27.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal. "
"pithy grapefruit, herbaceous green note, pine, white grape, lemon, hint of floral, a peppery note. mouthfeel is a bit of a letdown, heavy carbonation and light-medium bodied, texture comes of sort of chalky."
"A: Hazy gold with 1"" foam and sticky lacing. "
"I get tired rating really good to great brews from Trillium. I have been there twice now and have not rated a beer under 4. Hell I don’t get close to JUST a four. I am to far away in Maine to get there more than once or twice a summer season. Trillium, then Tree House, then Hill Farmstead. How’s that for a trifecta!!!!!"
Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned 10/06/17.
"Had this on tap at the Publick House. The beer had a murky, orange color with thick lacing but a thin head. White wine grapefruit was pretty apparent with the smell, but it had with it some orangepeel and other citrus smells. The white wine taste with its flavoring was pretty strong; it covered the first sip to the aftertaste pretty well. This beer was also served pretty carbonated. Overall, a really good aroma that seemed too strong with its taste."
"Great color and aroma of white wine, tropical fruit, and citrus. Taste of grassy hop, lime, and pineapple and Pinot Gris juice. Light bitterness at the finish."
Thanks to JLindros for hooking me up with a can of this.
Poured from a 16oz can into an imperial pint glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. Pours a cloudy and hazy golden yellow body with a slight orange hue, one finger thick white head, long and good retention, rings of lacing. Smells of grapefruit, tropical fruit, a bit of spice as well as honey, light caramel and a bit of sweet grape juice. Flavour follows; grapefruit, light spicy floral notes, slight grainy sweetness, honey, a bit of white grape sweetness and some resin and floral bitterness on the finish. A good DIPA, but as I've noticed lately, the Streets are probably the best bet to go for your NE hop fix. The grape contributes a bit more complexity and bitterness which is nice."
"Hazy bulby orange-lemon color, with a 1/2 finger of head to start, and it recedes fast to a creamy thin froth. "
"Medium-gold and lightly hazy, some particulate debris in the glass... Featuring Galaxy, El Dorado, and Columbus hops, and dry-hopping with Galaxy and El Dorado, this brew delivers a complex mix of citrus and tropical impressions, elevated by the use of pinot gris juice. some aspects are wine-like, some are grassy and earthy, with an overall delivery of a citrusy, earthy, elegant product... Medium-light feel, mild bitterness, moderate sweetness, ample carbonation... A juicy, fruity wine of a beer... There's no way a sane BA passes this up..."
"Love the idea of adding grape must to the beer, as long as it blends nicely. I loved the last one, so hopefully this is just as good. Canned 10/06/17"
Canned in April. Drank in September 19th after 100 days stuck in customs.
"From can. Deep cloudy orange appearance. Interesting with pinot gris juice added. Definitely noticeable in the taste, especially at the end. Fruity and very sweet (a bit too sweet for me)."
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. Thanks Ryan for the hookup.
"Tasted from can. Pours a murky orange with white head. Aroma is white wine with some tropical fruits. Moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of mango, papaya, orange, wine grapes and a little resin. Very well done IPA"
"P- Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City spiegelau.Canned on 02-AUG-17."
Delicious beer! Love the Pinot Gris juice. Gives the beer a dynamic tart finish similar to 7 digits. Digging what these guys do
"Hazy golden, medium head, lacing isn't great. Aromas of citrus, pineapple and grape must. Juicy, orange, grapefruit, pineapple and vineous unsweetened fruit. Medium body, dry as hell on the finish. Amazing IPA."
"Consumed two weeks after canning. Overall, I really enjoy the unique Dialed In series as the interplay of white wine notes works well with the hoppy bitterness."
"16 oz. can. Very hazy orange. Small white head. El Dorado aroma is strong. Woodsy, limey, bright citrus, white wine and grape juice. A little boozy. Tastes of mostly citrus. A little less dynamic than the nose. Grape juice flavor in the back end. A little sweet. Boozy and a bit astringent. Dries out in the finish. Medium body. Tasty, but big."
This is my favorite variation of Dialed In easily. The Galaxy hops stand out quite well and complement perfectly with that white wine that Dialed In includes.
"White wine, grassy hops, moderate bitterness and carbonation. Soft mouth feel with dry finish and lingering taste of grapefruit, peach, and hops."
Really enjoyed this version of dialed in ! Hazier and juicier than the standard version... Nice hops bite and a whole lot of citrus on the nose and on the palate.
"Citrus-hops, incredibly juicy, white grapes...this beer is something else. The term juicy gets thrown around often to describe fruit-forward IPAs, most notably the self-described NE IPA style. This beer certainly is fruit-forward (it's all tropical fruits, pungent fauna and fresh cut citrus) but it's juicy in a way that I've rarely experienced in an IPA, and that's thanks to the pino gris juice. Far from a gimmick, the addition adds a complex layer of sweet and musty flavor to the hop-driven profile; it complements rather than detracts. What results is a citrusy, slightly acidic, sweet and slightly tart explosion of flavor. The malt must be hanging on for dear life as it hoists up the hops and allows them to shine, but you won't be picking up any cracker or biscuit flavors here. This is all hops with a twist."
My final dive into the Dialed In series completed the three-peat of love! So different and so enjoyable. Was bought for me by a coworker and Im so sad that I only got 1. 8.5 ABV but holy cow youd never know. Love the Galaxy hops (has become my go to hop when trying new beers. This beer is so unique. I could drink it forever!
"Can poured to tall tulip. Super hazy dirty-orange color with a finger of white frothy head, that leaves a little lace but dwindles down to nothing fairly quickly. Smells of mango and orange juice. Taste is very nice, with tropical fruits and just a hint of white grape juice. Mouth feel is great - medium-full, creamy, fairly sweet. Overall, a very solid DIPA."
"The beer pours a cloudy, yellow haze with good white head that has decent retention. The head resembles champagne."
Can from brewery.
"16oz. can served in my Dialed In tulip. Pours a hazy orange with a loose, off-white head that quickly dissipates towards the edges, leaving an oily slick across the surface. Nose expresses bright citrus notes, as well as hints of grape must and an earthy/herbal character. Taste consistent with nose - no surprises here. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant carbonation just shy of lively and a mild acidity. Overall, solid - but doesn't really stand out from the pack of Trillium hazy IPAs."
Poured from the can into a snifter.
16oz can poured into a tulip
Poured from a 16 oz can (canned on ) into a RAR teku. 
"Opaque peach color with off-white head. Aroma is really dank and oniony with a hint of overripe grapes. Taste follows with the dank hops, sweet onion, really hoppy and juicy. Light bitterness on the finish, lingering fruity aftertaste. Medium body and carbonation, quite crisp for the style. Overall it's a really good NE IPA. I don't really get obvious grape flavors but it's still awesome."
"Pour is a straw yellow, semi hazy hue. Not as cloudy as some trillium IPA's, but still nice looking. Aroma had plenty of citrus zest, orange peels and lemons. Definitely getting a dose of that Pinot Gris grape addition. A splash of topical fruit, nice kiwi and melon. Taste has that notch of citrus upfront, plenty of lime. Mixed with a subtle amount of grapes and melons. The back end has a splash of the el dorado hops showcasing some grassiness. Mouthfeel finishes very dry, and pretty light bodied."
"Pours a haze straw yellow. Nose is bursting with pineapple, mango, and citrus. Taste follows the nose....followed by some strong wine notes. The white grape and a touch of oak really compliment the hop profile. Feel is medium heavy for the style with moderately low carbs. Terrific beer and and excellent twist on the style."
Poured into a Duvel tulip. No readable freshness date.
16oz can dated 1/16/17.
Turbid light orange with a finger of white foam that kicks back to a nice skim and lasting ring. Slow sliding lacicles remain on glass after a swirl.
"Like a lot of NE IPAs, this one is cloudy like pulpy orange juice. The nose is more muted than the other two Dialed In brews, but still displays a little of the grape juice notes that you would expect. Taste is complex - dry grapes, solid hop presence, tropical fruits - just delicious. Dry mouthfeel, not unexpected considering everything above."
"Typical golden hazy body. Aroma is full of juicy, tropical hop notes with a big grape presence as well. Flavor is a bid juicy IPA first, with a nice grape juice presence blended in. Feel is smooth, medium bodied, medium carb. Really awesome beer."
Phenomenal. IF they had it in every restaurant in America wine wouldn't exist here.
"hoppy and with a pop up front, very mellow and dry to finish"
"A- The tallboy drops a very hazy, cloudy yellow beer into a tulip. Atop the uber pale brew a thick and frothy white cap forms falling fairly quickly to a belt at the edges. Lace is left behind with small sheets and spots forming."
Thank you Doug537 for this
"Poured from a tall boy into a shaker pint, the beer is an opaque, orange coloring, like orange juice, with a low profile, foamy, white head. Aromas of tart and sweet pinot gris, sweet peaches and orange, guava, and tangerines. All juice. Flavors are very juicy forward, heavy on sweet orange, mango, and peach, with the dry and sweet pinto gris characteristics coming in later on the palate. Subtle grassy notes impart some slight bitterness, which helps to balance the sweet juice notes and building acidity. Smooth, slick body, with a sweet fruit juice aftertaste. Slightly dry edge to the slick, smooth finish. Tasty beer."
"Overall, one of my favorite. the first two cans I had on the day of canning, while the second two cans I had about two weeks later. Normally, not a big deal, but there was definitely a difference with letting it sit. The fresher cans were amazing - very mild and you could taste the pinot gris up front, with the typical tropical notes as well as grape notes, similar to the nelson hops. The beer followed the refreshing fruit/citrus/grape notes with mild hops on the finish. The nose was almost all pinot gris but drank very refreshing. However, the ""aged"" cans were more acidic and lost most of the pinot gris juice both on the nose and drinking. It was more alcohol-heavy and certainly drank like a 8.5% compared to the fresh stuff that tasted like grape juice."
This one nearly got 5's across the board which I have only done twice before. I love Trillium's brews and this is my favorite. It won't blow you away with that Treehouse Juice Bomb flavor but its so amazingly balanced and smooth and with such incredible flavor. Its one of those that you love at first but appreciate even more with each can. All I can say is Wow ! Terrific brew
"Opaque orange-yellow with a fizzy, half-finger off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly to a sparsely bubbled blanket."
16 oz can was poured into a Spiegelau glass. 
Look: Hazy opaque yellow-orange with a thick white head. Mild activity. 
"Hazy straw color, with a foamy bubbly head that dissipates after a couple minutes. Nice typical Trillium nose with lots of citrus and even some wine. Taste follows the nose, with the addition of a nice wood barrel flavor. A bit more tart than Trillium's prior Dialed In with Sauv and Chard, and probably my favorite of the three thus far."
L - a soft white head floats on a mellow-yellow colored body. Its hazy but not as saturated as some of their other pours. Its a beautiful yellow color that reminds me of a lemon drop
Sampled at Canton location.
"I get orange juice and white wine for the nose. White grape dominates taste with a little pineapple, a little citrus with a slight and short lived bitter hop kick at the end. Carbonation buzzes the tongue up front and then gives way to a fresh, clean palette. Another winner from Trillium. This was my first Dialed-In - it won't be my last."
"From a growler. Pours hazy, light gold in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is mango and pear with a touch of grapefruit rind and white wine bitterness. Medium-light bodied, slightly bitter, more wine like than juicy but oh soooo smooth. A real treat. Glad I found this."
"pale yellow in color. Hazy in appearance. Lemon, papaya, pineapple and apple. Cracker malt. Some piney, dank bitterness balanced out by the sweetness. Finishes fairly dry. Real good."
"Pretty much everything that Trillium makes is killer, this beer is no different. Has all the qualities of great Trillium beer, the dry finish of this beer moves it near the top of the Trillium list for me."
L: Typical murky peach and apricot hues befitting a Trillium IPA with a frothy white head
Poured from a 16 oz can dated 10/10 into a can glass:
Fresh growler fill into a snifter
"Pours a thick golden hue. Despite a vigorous pour, it seems very flat. There's a tremendous grapefruit citrus aroma and that carries through in the flavor along with some white grape. There isn't a ton of sweetness and I do get some of the chalky bitterness I get in Congress St and Sleeper St. It's soft and has some complexity, but I'm not in love with it. I do like it though."
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"Picked up a four-pack of cans at the Fort Point location. Picked up (and canned) on Monday 10/10, and drank on 10/13."
"Pours hazy golden, minimal head and lacing. Smells like citrus and (surprise surprise) wine. Very interesting flavor - you get more beer and citrus up front, but tart, dry grape on the end. Leaves a creamy, orange/wine/vanilla coating after you swallow. Light body, mild carbonation. Glad I picked this one up!"
Canned 10/10/16. Consumed 10/12/16.
"massive thank you to my main man rowmark for being in mass at the right time and sharing the wealth (as always). canned yesterday. I have always loved dialed in and the offshoots, but this beer is something special. happy to have a handful of these...and I was planning to trade some, but that plan has changed now that I tried this...let's call it a...masterpiece."
"Pours a super hazy pale golden straw in color with a half finger of frothy white head that quickly dissipated to nothing. Aroma is super inviting; lots of pineapple, mango, passion fruit, pear, and white wine notes. Great taste, super smooth with pineapple, some lime, and a good amount of white wine. Great mouthfeel, medium-ish body and carbonation yield a creamy mouthfeel. Overall a great beer, just super drinkable with tons of great tropical flavors and aromas that meld incredibly well with the added pino gris. Another great Dialed-In variant."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Beautiful beer, smooth and soft. Wine isn't overpowering, neither are the hops. Crazy to think it's 8.5%... maybe the most balanced Double IPA I've ever been fortunate enough to try. Tops the Monkish collab easily."
16 oz. can dated 10/10/16
"All Citra DIPA that is an overwhelmingly awesome sensory experience. Radiant orange color with plenty of head. Completely overflowing with tropical and citrusy hop flavor. Nicely carbonated, exceptionally well balanced, and very clean and dry on the finish. As good as their other top DIPAs. [5/3/18 can into Becher glass]"
"love this beer. it is an exceptional beer that gets me excited to drink it every time! New England Brewing Co. is still cranking out delicious beer, but they are sadly being overshadowed some by newer breweries! that's fine! more beer for me! hahah but really keep up the good work NEBCO! love me some double fuzzy!"
L - Hazy golden orange with a finger of white head
"Growler from the brewery in mid-December, 2017. I drank a can of Fuzzy Baby Ducks before this and it was a wonderful follow-up. FBD was bonkers and this is another level. A stupidly drinkable, massively Citra-hopped version of ultra hop juice that they must technically call beer by law. It's hard to write about how good this is. Though I'm mad that I wanna write that it's on the level of Hill Farmstead...because this should be their own stuff. They created it independent of the trends and nonsense of the craft beer movement. Anyway, such an enjoyable few pints."
"Poured on tap at the brewery, then out of growler, then out of can. Appearance is golden, slightest of orange tints, hazy but not full on creamy looking haze, off white foamy head lasts a while and settles into a whispy cap. Leaves clingy lacing stuck on the side of the glass."
"great looking beer. dank, citric, herbal, smooth, some sweeter malts to provide balance, hit of pine on the finish ties everything together. nice, flavorful and balanced beer. nothing insane but definitely a well crafted brew."
First time with this one.
Excellent
My pops whomlives in CT hooked me up with this. Is was super good and on par with the other big dog DIPAs out there. Wish he sent me more!
A: orange marmalade color woth a strong head that retained for a few mins
A: slight haze; deep gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a wispy cap; very nice lacing;
"Moderate pour yields a nice, white, one inch head over a golden yellow body with nice lacing. Nose of tropical fruit for days. Taste follows, but bitterness comes through and fights the fruit for your palates attention Bitterness wins. A nice feel and overall a fine brew! Thanks to Michael for the hook up!"
"Just happened to be at Yarde Tavern Enfield, Ct when they tapped this. I got the first pour into a tulip glass. Very hazy yellow gold with a nice head, decent retention and nice sticky lacing. I drink a lot of Tree House and Trillium and this was right in the ballpark. Creamy juice bomb but with enough balancing bitterness to keep the palate fresh. Liked it so much, I had two more. The alcohol is well-hidden but will sneak up on you. Overall very nice beer. My only caveat is that I had the first one immediately after Alpine Pure Hoppiness, another delicious but distinctly hoppy beer. That may have accentuated the creamy feel and fruitiness of this one."
Poured from 32 oz growler 1/26/2017. 
A big thanks to a co-worker for scoring this one for me. 64oz. growler into a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303. 
"Golden yellow in color. Very hazy in appearance. This is ok. Getting citrus and maybe some pine. Grapefruit pith bitterness. For me, this is missing some sweetness to accentuate the flavors. Very dry. It's good, but probably not worth the hype. Really interested to try regular fbd. Dose blows this out of the water. Pun intended."
"32oz growler from the brewery. Pours a turbid pale orange color with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Huge nose of tropical fruits. Mango, papaya, lime, pineapple, tangerine, and grapefruit. Some grassy and floral notes as well. The taste is the tropical fruits but with some pine this time around. Lots of lime, peach, and tangerine towards the end. Toasted malts and bitter grapefruit finish. Bitter, but very drinkable with only a mild alcohol presence. Oily mouthfeel and lightly carbonated. Add this to the ever growing long list of great NebCo IPAs/Imperial IPAs."
Poured from a 32 oz growler filled at the brewery.
"On tap at Ordinary in New Haven, CT."
"Drank on tap at Tip Tap Room, Boston, MA"
Growler to glass. Fresh cut spring grass with a sweet and balanced backdrop.
"Growler to tulip. Golden in color and very clear. Little to no head, not much lacing. Lots of fruit in the aroma, with a little toasty malt shining through. Similar flavors. Very well balanced. Overall, it's a very nice DIPA."
"Strange that I have never been able to track down standard FBD, but I stumbled across the imperial version completely by accident. "
"poured into mason jar on tap at restaurant. nice golden yellow, aromas of arrange, grapefruit and lime hit the nose. nice mouthfeel, taste has a nice citrus bite with a smooth malty backbone finish. AS hyped, this is a super good DIPA from NEBCO"
Poured from a 64oz growler - big thank you to MS22 for the opportunity. My first growler from a different trade on a different site never made it to me and got lost in the mail. Traders on BA are a cut above.
"Fresh growler poured into a G-Bot snifter. Pours a golden orange color with a little over one-finger white head. The aromas have citrus fruits for sure with some pine included. The flavors are definitely heavy on the citrus fruits such as grapefruit, orange, etc. with not as much pine as the nose detected. There is more maltiness and bitterness versus the regular Fuzzy Baby Ducks. The mouthfeel is definitely smooth and ABV isn't too noticeable. As many anticipated, it is a bigger (possibly better) version of Fuzzy. Overall, this is a very drinkable DIPA and worth seeking out IMO. Cheers!"
Had this from a 32 ounce growler fresh from the brewery. 
L - dark and dank golden orangey brown. Looks like some serious shit. Thin boozy head remains.
"Had at Walrus + Carpenter last night in Bridgeport, place was jammin' due to the BFD release. Poured into a tulip glass a lovely orange color with moderate clarity and a fluffy two finger white head that left nice lacing."
"Steve provided this and was much enjoyed... Pours slightly hazy orange.. Tangerine and orange zest with a big boned maltiness that magnifies the fruity citrus hops and almost makes it cloying for my palate.. that said, I am sure the brewers nailed what they were shooting for.... Huge fruity hops and bigger sweetness that makes them bloom, not quite enough bitterness to balance."
"This truly is a bigger version of fuzzy baby ducks. Color is a non-hazy opaque orange. The nose is crisp citrus hops. The taste is a big hops with a strong bitter balance, a lot more hop bitter and less sweetness than regular baby ducks. The taste is crisp and clean while hiding the bigger abv, with some bitterness on the back-end. Overall a solid beer, but I think I prefer regular fuzzy baby ducks better."
"Had it fresh out of a growler purchased the pervious day at NEBCO. From the first to the last taste--superb! Scary drinkability, smooth, and extremely dangerous to drink at this ABV. Big citra flavor and a bitter finish. Can't ask for more. Fantastic!!"
Pours a hazy golden yellowish color with a one finger head. Nose is pure citra. Taste is citrus orange and very smooth. Has a nice balance between the malts and the hops but has a nice bitter finish. Not a strong alcohol taste. Wonderful beer
Lots of citra coming through on the taste. Nice dark golden color. Smoother finish that I anticipated. Still behind Tree House and Trillium IPA and DIPA offerings.
"Solid beer, look is amazing, taste also very good, goes down way to smooth."
"This is based on the first batch will I think was the best......and maybe the best beer that I have ever had. It looked beautiful (unfiltered) in my tulip, tasted amazing going down and felt wonderful. The smell could make you drool. Batches since have not met this standard but have still been damn good!"
I like this better than fuzzy baby ducks. Somehow it is more smooth and not as bitter. Tons of citra hops also which is one of my favorite. Hides the alcohol well.
"looks like a golden lantern in my stemless tulip. beautiful lacing, not much head. smell is something I've never experienced in a beer: smooth orange and peach, almost like a vanilla twist without the vanilla flavor if that makes sense. taste starts off with this oddly amazing note, then leads way to lots of citra: orange, citrus, and peaches, and a nice supportive malt ending. feel could be a little fuzzier, but it is not bad or off whatsoever. kick ass brew from NEB, better than regular FBD."
"NEBCO kills it again with the older brother to the Baby Ducks. Hazy with a hint of juice, dry, long finish. More defined than SOS."
"Pours a semi-hazy golden orange with a solid finger of foamy head. The nose is an explosion of citrus fruits, orange most dominantly. Some resinous pine qualities at the back end. Taste follows the nose with great consistently: heavy on the citrus, lighter on the pine. Very oily and a little sweet during the very long finish. Much more bitterness than in the single Fuzzy, but it's complemented nicely by a sweeter malt backbone. Incredibly full and smooth mouthfeel - just as smooth as the original but with some added bitterness. Definitely feels like an amped up version of Fuzzy Baby Ducks, while retaining its high level of drinkability. Excellent, excellent stuff and perhaps my favorite NEBCO beer yet. Hope it doesn't end up being a one-off!"
Somewhat hazy with a nice citrus nose. Nebco hit their mark again with this one. Much like FBD but it packs a bigger bite with a slightly drier finish. The 8% is well hidden and felt it drank close to a single. Citra hops arent my favorite but for those that crave them this is a must. Cheers
Hazy juicy double IPA. Really liked it. Well worth the wait in line. Another great Beer from NEBCO.
Opaque pale corn milk yellow-tan with a massive off-white airy foam that settles in fits and starts.
"This one pours a very hazy and creamy looking light yellow color, with a small head, and tons of lacing."
"Tangerine, perfect balanced bitterness, very light sweet malt, guava, light mango, pineapple, yeast, bubblegumvery well hidden drinks more like a 6%-7% IPA"
"On tap at Cugino’s. Pours a hazy golden color with a good head and some lacing. Aroma of grapefruit, bit of pine and malt sweetness. Taste of orange, bit of citrus and nice touch of malt. Nice bitterness with a bit of orange in the finish. Medium body, very flavorful and nicely crafted. Enjoyable beer."
Canned 4/26/18; drank 5/1/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"I received this in @swenny916's BIF box. Poured from 16 oz. can into Narrow Gauge pint glass. It pours a cloudy, muddy-tangerine color with almost a finger of fluffy, bright white head, and lots of soapy lacing. It has as fruity a nose as I've encountered: orange, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, ripe honeydew melon, vanilla, and subdued but fragrant hops. From the time I popped the can you can smell it. The taste is fantastic! It opens with vanilla/lactose and sweet orange, tart lemon and grapefruit, and a flavorful blend of Citra, Galaxy, and Amarillo hops that begins fruity but quickly turns bitter and finishes with a peppery bite. There's a touch of astringent burn at the finish (in a good way!) This ale is rich and creamy with lively carbonation, and the 8.6% ABV gives it a really nice kick. This is a fun beer to drink! Overall, this is absolutely first rate and given its rarity on the East Coast I'm grateful to have tried it."
"Cloudy appearance, but get ready for full on flavor. Not too bitter, tangy with plenty of citrus tones. Slight amount of sweetness, with a really nice mouth feel. Buy!"
look is hazy 
"Reviewed from a 32oz growler, served in a stemmed glass. Pours a hazy and cloudy straw yellow body. One finger white head, with a smell of citrus and oranges permeating the room. Wonderful nose, very citrus-forward. Flavour is heavier on the pulpy orange, citrus, with a zesty bitterness. Mild caramel contributes a bit of sweetness to it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, perfect and dangerous- no way to tell the alcohol here, which is of course the best way to have it."
32 oz crowler
"Pours a yellow-orange with a turbid haze to it. A finger and half of white head fizzing on top with fair retention and lacing. Aroma is huge notes of citrus, and orange. Flavor profile follows up per the name with oranges, oranges, and oranges. There is a zesty finish that breaks the otherwise sugary sweet flavor profile. Mouth feel is velvety with just a tiny bit of graininess to it. Overall, an incredibly easy to drink, juicy beer. The 8.6% ABV is hidden, so be careful. "
Crowler. White head. Lace. Hazy burnt sunset gold color.
Crowler from Narrow Gauge
Big thanks to bstyle for this
"My favorite hoppy beer in Missouri. I have had this side by side against NE ipas. Not quite treehouse level but I liked it better than many Trillium IPAs. One downside to note, I have seen them (pint cans) turn brown after a month or two. NE IPAs will fade a bit, but these completely turned."
"Pours a wonderfully hazy dark yellow with a creamy half inch of head. It leaves a bit of lacing on the glass as it quickly recedes. It smells of citrus, in particular, orange and pineapple. The taste is more grapefruit and lemon peel and left with a desire for just a touch more sweetness. The finish is pretty nice as it leaves you with an floral hops, orange, and quenches any thirst you had. "
"Straw yellow and very hazy in complexion. There's a fingernail off eggshell white around the rim. Heavy lacing. I'm really struggling to get any aroma, but there's some faint citrus. I'm tasting plenty of citrus hops and some light malt. The mouth is sticky and chewy."
Draft pour from the source. Well named DIPA. Hazy and turbid yellow body. Very citrusy orange forward hops in aroma and taste. Low bitterness from the hops with huge hops flavors. OJ run is my first taste of Narrow Gauge and I am very impressed. This beer reminds me exactly of Julius from Treehouse almost to a tee. Pretty excited to see the New England hops being made in the midwest. Especially when they are of this high of quality.
"Great double IPA. very juicy taste but not overly hopped. sneaks up on your for sure, hard to believe this beer is over 8%! Literally looks like a glass of orange juice when served."
An NE IPA in St. Louis!
"L: opaque, super cloudy with a finger of white fluffy head."
"Pours a hazy pale orange with very little head. Smell is a citrus blast....heavy orange, pineapple, with hints of stonefruit. Taste is citrus heavy with the mosaic bringing notes of dank blueberry. This DIPA drinks like the abv is closer to the 4-5% range......drinkability is off the charts. Feel is medium heavy for the style with moderately low carbonation. Another world class hop juice from narrow gauge."
Hazy pale yellow in color with a nice lingering head. Looks thick.
Growler picked up at the brewery yesterday. 
On-tap at New England Brewing Co.
"Excellent DIPA. Maybe overhyped, but very good nonetheless. Hoppy, little juice, no boozy taste for 8.8%. Highly recommend."
BOOM!
"Tried this at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Half a finger head with decent lacing. Piney hoppy aroma. Hoppy taste with pineapple notes. Good local beer."
"Finally got my hands on the elusive G-Bot! I've wanted to try this since the beginning of my BA days and even though they're the next state over, I never made the trip down to the New Haven area. Got a growler at the brewery for Christmas leave, along with many others from NEBCo. I let this sucker get to a proper room temperature."
"Truly wonderful, basically perfect DIPA. Radiant orange-gold color. Intense flavors of fresh strawberry, peach, and spearmint. Medium-bodied and quite resinous with a finish that just does not stop. This beer easily separates itself from the hoards of DIPAs being brewed right now. [on tap at the brewery]"
What can I say this beer is fantastic. If you have to choose between this or a Sip of Sunshine this is by far the better choice.
Look: Translucent golden orange with a thin eggshell head.mild activity. 
"Sorry, I'm a little late to the party. I hate to admit, but I hadn't even heard of G-bot until (maybe) 6 months ago, even though it's existed for years....that's what happens when you live in Massachusetts...very few of my friends know anything about Connecticut's best kept beer secret."
"great looking brew, golden orange slightly haze with a nice bright white head. aromas and flavors of orange, grapefruit, honey malts, breadyness, mango, herbal greenness, hint of mango, a bit of piney danks. reminded me of heady topper and sip of sunshine, which is a good sign. cheers!"
"Pours deep orange. Nice head with light lacing. Aroma is very earthy with peach. Taste is earthy,grass, pine, peach light citrus finish. Alcohol is well hidden. Excellent dipa. Look forward to more from them."
"Finally got to try one of these this weekend. While a decent/solid brew it did not live up to the Hype IMO. Poured light - very little aroma. Easy and drinkable but not a lot going on flavor wise. Would I drink it again - sure. Will I seek it out, not with all the tasty brews I can get locally."
Have had this beer before but never reviewed. It's actually one of the first beers that got me into drinking IPA! Drank out of a Teku.
On Draft at Widow Browns
Look: I poured it gently and there was a large amount of head to it. After that settled the rest of it was a solid yellow.
"A unique and amazingly smooth double IPA. At first the taste is somewhat floral. However, this soon shifts to a mellow hop and delicate honey and ultimately fades on your taste buds maintaining this most pleasant impression. Zero bitterness here (not you regular ipa). Kept under the counter when available at my local, CT liquor store. Well worth the asking for!"
Whenever this beer is available I always buy it. I've had this beer many ways but for me the best taste and smell is when it is served in a chilled glass and ice cold. The flavor will become enhanced and much easier to drink. There is almost a hint of citrus hop that is not too overpowering. There's really nothing I can compare it to but I will update this review if I find something. The hops does linger on the tongue which I find pleasing. This beer can be paired with hot wings or any sweet flavored wing sauce. I would not recommend to a new IPA drinker. This is a beer that needs to be tried when all others fail to excited. I am a lover of this beer and would recommend to those willing to try flavorful beers.
"A: Golden color, white head, strong lacing on the glass"
"Ridiculous beer honestly. Not much else to say, drink it."
"Pours a golden hue. An herbally charged fragrance. There's nice flavors of honey dew followed by spicyness and pine. The progression from sweet to bitter provides a nice layer of complexity not found in most of today's juice bombs. That's what makes this a very good IPA. While it wouldn't be my top choice in a line up of New England's best DIPAs, it'd certainly be in the line up."
"Pours a big white, frothy head that settles in under a nearly solid curtain of lacing. Body is pretty much yellow only with just a hint of haze. "
"You know you've had too much beer when you can't quite recall when you traded for a can that's one of many in your basement. Sure enough, this was one of those beers and although I never heard of this or New England Brewing before, I enjoyed this enough that I'd want to see what else is available from them, if only to see if this was an anomaly or not."
"I find it difficult to buy into the hype of this beer. For the demand this brew has, it is very much an average tasting DIPA. The color is not as bright and lively as better unfiltered New England IPA's, the flavor is quite malty and bitter that is more akin to an English IPA than an American one. The piney notes that I read about are really not all that apparent, again, in comparison to other New England style IPA's. This is still a good beer, but there are plenty off the shelf beers throughout the region that are just as good, if not better."
One of the best beers I've ever had
"A: Clear golden ale with tight, ample carbonation."
"Great look, smell and taste. Pine resin, caramel malty east coast IPA. Slick finish, a little bit sticky feeling lingers. A classic and a favorite. Really good beer."
"L: light color, with an inch of foam in a Goblet glass on tap"
GHANDI BOT!!!! I had Ghandi Bot for the first time back before BA really imploded user wise.
Sampled pour from a 4 week old can. Pours a slightly cloudy brassy orange color with a massive tight white head. Nose is grapefruit and juniper. Citrus sweetness dominate the taste initially but the piney bitterness quickly takes over. If you're looking for juicy fruit flavors or balance this isn't your IPA - but if you really want to enjoy the hops dive in! Mouth feel is very creamy with a bit of tongue scraping finish.
Appearance - cloudy golden color with white head
"I believe the first time I had this, it was Gandhi Bot and was ranked #1. Boy how times have changed! Though not as highly ranked anymore, every time I have it, I cant help but say man this is a damn good beer. Would drink anytime!"
Nice IPA hard to find. Worth the hunt. Have the cans and had on tap tonight at Wilsons in Collinsville.
"Appearance: Medium off-white head, fine to medium bubbles – slightly clouded amber – head dissipates quickly"
"If I am being honest, this beer was a disappointment for me. It had a good look and smell, but the taste was floral. I didn't get any of the flavors people talked about and the mouthfeel was bland. My buddy says this fresh is amazing and granted the cans weren't old, a month or two old, but again, it was very generic."
L - Hazy light orange with a beautiful two fingers of fluffy white head.
pours dark orange with nice one finger head. nose is strong citrus fruits with lots of floral in there as well. really nice . get that dankness. mouthfeel is medium seems a bit overcarbonated. at first this beer seemed a little underwhelming but as it warms the mouthfeel becomes less thin and flavor really starts to cone through. i seem to get some floral with tropical fruits minglinh tograther. finished dry for me. overall a good beer but better when i had it off the tap. the flavors out of the can were not as potent and prevelant tjroughout the entire palate as they were off the tap. nebco does great work though and they have better beers than this.
Great offering from NE! This hoppy DIPA pours a hazy orange and has a wonderful aroma of mandarin orange with a hint of fresh cut grass. Each sip leaves a thin layer of lacing on the glass and slams your palate with bitterness and carbonation that hits you right at the back of your tongue. I detect a lot of dank resinous hops with some citrus breaking through on the finish with a strong backbone of biscuity malts. There is no date stamp on the can so its hard for me to determine the age of this particular brew. Overall I liked it very much and if it came into regular distribution in my area I'd definitely drink more of it!
"Dark golden, moderate lacing"
"Great offering out of CT. Nice sweet tropical notes with a little bite at the end. People at the brewery are friendly and accommodating. Glad I got the chance to finally try it, also picked up a 32 ounce growler."
Can of indeterminate age (trade) poured into Belgian ale glass.
Poured from a 32 oz growler filled at the brewery. 
Appearance: Pours a clear light orange with a large pillowy off-white head.
This is the East Coast's answer to Pliny. This beer should have just as much recognition and accolades as its West coast counter parts. Maybe limited quantities has hurt the brand?
This is an amazing beer. 
I had this on tap after a pint of Lawson's SOS. Sip was better but this is really close.
Poured In to a Luminarc 16oz IPA glass. Very nice deep golden color. Nice citrus haze settled on bottom. Good strong aroma of hops and sweet citrus. Another DIPA that is so so smooth and easy to drink. Does not leave a lot of bitter on the mouth after each taste. Nice sweet citrus feel in mouth after each finish. Overall a very very solid beer. I will most certainly continue to hunt down while in CT. This is on my top list right now.
Really good beer. Not too bitter.
Can from trade (9/14/15)
"12 oz can. Pours hazy orange, thigh fluffy white head, great retention and spotty lace. Aroma is a balance of sweet malt and ripe tropical fruit. Tastes just like the aroma, caramel malty sweetness up front met by juicy hops with grapefruit. This balance carries through the entire sip and ends with a little piney resin and floral notes. Medium slick mouthfeel. This DIPA is full-flavored, leaning to the sweet side but very nicely balanced. Good stuff, glad I finally got to try this one. Thx to @hebegiant for the hook up."
"Canned on 9/24/15. Overall, slightly disappointed because it was not what I was expecting. Unlike many of the NE turbid juicy IPA's, this is a clear, sweeter, malt forward IPA. Still very flavor fully hopped (tropical and juicy), its just not quite what I was hoping for....."
"Canned on 9/24/15. I was slightly disappointed, but only because my expectations were so high. This is still a great DIPA and I would definitely have it again (and again and again). Incredible hop aroma, but a little too much lingering bitterness in the taste."
"9.28.15 draft @ plan B West Hartford, CT"
"Pours hazey dark orange. Taste matches the nose. Packs a big, deep, malty dank mouth full of hoppy goodness. Smooth and crisp, but bold. Layers of flavor. Really awesome DIPA! Loving it."
"Pours golden and cloudy with a one finger head. Smells of slightly sweet chewy earthy citrus. Taste is sharp bitter dry hops with some light citrus. Slightly sweet malts and some cracker bread-like malts on the back. Peppery mouth-feel. Overall this is a really nice double IPA. Great hoppy dry flavor. I'm happy to have received one of the last cans under it's original name. Hopefully the renaming and recanning process won't take too long, cause this DIPA should be sought-after."
"Good beer, pine,resin with tropical fruity notes. 2 finger creamy head that leave an attractive lacing on the glass. Great goto beer....."
Served in a snifter from a 12 ounce can.
"one of the best beers available in CT, sad that it has to change cans and name but glad it will be the same beer. when poured in a snifter, it's a beautiful hazy orange/yellow color with zero chunks of sediment, looks phenomenal under a light. decent foamy head that dissipates quickly, but leaves slight lacing on the glass after every sip. you can see the carbonation sticking to the sides of the glass as well, all the way until your last sip. the smell is grapefruit, orange, and pine with a very slight hint of some sort of herbal smell. taste follows the smell pretty well, tons of grapefruit, orange, and other citrus, all brought together by pine and whatever malt bill they use. no oversweetness from the malt and the hops arent a pungent bitter like they can be when a company messes up a west coast style DIPA. showcases the hop bill very very well but doesnt leave the entire taste up to the hops. ill say it again: one of the best beers available in CT. feel bad for people who don't live here or have a plug for them. cannot wait to see the new name/can!"
"Typical hazy appearance of the NE hops. Aroma is juicy with a hint of pine. Taste follows nose with a strong bitterness that adds to the experience - very pleasant. It seems almost more ""west coasty"" than some of the other NE hops I've tried with the pine kick on top of the typical tropical fruit flavors. Delicious."
"I would review this beer seriously if it wasn't so overly hyped. Completely let down by my Ghandibot experience and I am reviewing three day old cans. This is not a ""juicy"" and I want anyone dying to try it to understand that this beer is not worth the wait it is merely a stepping stone ans you will forget it as soon as you are finished drinking it. Why NEBco why."
Look is somewhat dark. Smell is alittle malty. Taste is sort of the same way but you can definitely taste the hops. Pretty damn bitter but alright
"Off the hook delicious. Recently a convert to the new England IPAs and DIPAs and WOW this is good. As I return to my normally available brews, not sure how they will rate...."
"A: Hazy orange, thin white soapy head."
"Pours a completely hazed orange color, with a gigantic, stable white head."
"Had out of a growler on 7/19/2015. Burnt orange color, smells and tastes very clean with a lot of classic orange and grapefruit notes. Pretty good stuff for the style, but there are plenty of comparable local beers."
This is a great beer! Pours a golden yellow almost peach. Medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation bubbling up the sides of the glass. Really dank and has a lot of hop bitterness.
Awesome IPA. Very well rounded and was insanely drinkable. With so many top notch IPA's out there now I can safely say that this is definitely top 10.
7/5/15 DE bar
Some taste not overpowering alcohol taste
"L: Hazy orange, head fades fast."
"This is a good, solid DIPA, but not 98 worthy. I think the hype around this beer adds at least 5 points to the BA rating. "
"This beer is awesome! just a solid, kick butt DIPA that has you seeking more. A classic rendition of the style, love it!"
"This pours a nice clear orange with a decent head. A solid DIPA but not in the same league as some of the top VT and MA IPA's I have had. It has an OK nose, and is drinkable for sure. But not a 98 IMO"
Took forever to get a can but loved it once I got my hands on one
This is exactly what I hoped it would be. A great DIPA.
not at all worth the hype ><
12 ounce can poured into a pint glass.
"Purchased at local liquor store and poured into proper Gandhi Bot glassware (obtained from NEBCO before they sold out). Pours a nice hazy orange color with hints of tropical fruit, grapefruit and peach. As with most double IPAs, the taste is dank, bitter (floral and piney) hoppiness with medium carbonation. NEBCO has made this beer very drinkable; so before you know it, you are a few cans in. Definitely worth seeking out this refreshing double IPA!"
Not exactly what I'm looking for in a DIPA but tasty nonetheless
12oz can (thanks Joe!) poured into a Russian River pint glass
"WOW, really well done, thought it lived up to the hype!"
This beer is damn near perfect. Good luck finding it.
Textbook dipa with a great hop backbone and enough malt and carbonation took keep you going through the next pour
"On tap multiple times at the New England Brewing Company in Woodbridge, CT."
Hands down TOP FIVE DPA
Acquired in a trade from @Shanem12. Canned 2/23/15 and poured into a Parish Brewing goblet. 
NEBCO never fails to produce anything but excellence and this proves it. My overall favorite DIPA.
"no carbonation.... dull dark-urine color.... juicy tones of aroma.... and the flavor follows suit! nice flavor. nice abv. nice brew. admittedly, dull-looking brew off the pour; and i'm sure this must be better on draught..... great color of the can to augment its tangerine-ish qualities..... but this beer has probably seen better days before it was packaged in a box and sent cross-country to my house..... still a great brew though! awesome grapefruit rind at the finish, and VERY lingering, I will add. very nice brew."
Very good beer but overhyped due to its name.
This beer is why I am proud to be from Connecticut.
Absolutely worth chasing this beer!
Aroma is mango/pineapple. Light to medium body mouthfeel. Aftertaste is of dry tart grapefruit. Finally got to taste this son of a bitch!
Thanks to ‘Mikefriedman90’ for hooking me up with this. Pours cloudy dark copper amber color that leans towards mahogany brownish color with a huge thick foamy 2 finger beige head that faded very slowly and left great foamy lacing and rings as it went down; bubbles could be seen racing up the brew like champagne. 
"Very much over hyped and because of that, expensive. It's a pretty solid IPA. Doesn't touch Heady Topper but comes close with that can feel. Nice mouth feel and buzz."
hazy orange color with big juicy notes of heavy grapefruit and melon. Awesome taste and very crushable. One of my favorite double ipas to consume. Will be unfortunatly be re-named :(
It does not get any better than this fokes! Perfectly balanced double IPA!
"Great IPA, just a little too much to the malt side for my taste. Would definitely seek out again despite that East Coast lean."
I liked it a lot. I 
"A solid DIPA but vastly over-rated and the price gouging that goes on whenever it is released makes me want to give it a 2. But since that is not the brewers fault... it is a good beer. But in the same league with heady,haze and sunshine? i think not."
"Just one of my all-time favorite beers. When I lived in CT I could pick this up pretty regularly but in MA now, so it's been a while. I'll have to re-rate the next time I get lucky enough to find it."
4/4/4.25/4.5/4.25
Not nearly as smooth as I had hoped for. Hop bitterness takes away from the enjoyment of this brew. Not horrible but for the hype I had hoped for more. Sea Hag is more enjoyable IMO.
"This beer has been on my Want list for a while. Always have heard such great things about this brew and was so happy to finally get my hands on it. As I sit here drinking this, I'm definitely feeling a let down. The look is great, and the nose is fantastic--tropical fruits everywhere. But the taste? Simply doesn't follow the nose as I'd hope. Compared to SOS, HT, and other DIPAs in the 8% range this beer lacks the flavor complexity. I almost feel like I'm drinking a Stone IPA. Bitterness prevents me from tasting the tropical fruits I was hoping for. I will try again, but definitely won't go out of my way to get this one. Big let down."
"Great beer, expected more from the hype but still very good!!"
Poured from a 12 oz can into my DFH IPA Glass
L: Hazy amber body that is topped with a lovely thick white head. Very nice lacing left behind.
"Glad to try this recently controversial IPA. Canned 12/29. Pours a nice golden straw color and reeks of hops. This is a bitter ipa, and as the carbonation in the mouth subsides the hops take over even more lingering around. For 8.8% abv it is a smooth drinker but a bit too harsh all around. Id definitely drink again but wouldn't search to hard to get."
"A welcome addition to the NE ale line-up... my favorites have that cloudy apricot color, where this is lighter and a little clearer.... nice nose and hoppy flavors but falls a little short on the citrus end and a little more bitter than need be... overall, a solid drinking beer and though not as good as heady, dinner, or HF offerings, is very tasty!!"
"If I define Heady as 5.0, and I've had none better, then 4.25 is where I rate this. Nowhere near the creaminess, nose, or taste of Heady. I find it to be a touch bitter for the style, ""Not that that's a bad thing"" A little more malt forward, and less citrus, less oomph. Glad to see Connecticut entering the big leagues, but I'd rather have Sip o Sunshine, Edward, Heady, Wormtown, or Baxter's Bootleg over this. "
One of the best IPA ' S out there highly elusive.
"This is freaking delicious. I lucked out and walked in when they were unpacking it off the truck. Tough to come by, but worth every penny."
"Intensely floral, with one of the best noses to date. It literally beckons you to consume. I thought it was extremely balanced, and I appreciated the citrus notes as it warmed, especially on the finish. Carbonation was spot on. Head was massive and barely dissipated. I've enjoyed this numerous times, but never like this. Canned on 12/29. Just wow."
it was very very solid IIPA... not as good as I hoped though
Well deserved hype. The smell alone is worth the pour. Tried my first HT on NYE... The Bot is where it's at.
"Very rare, very hoppy, very good"
"Vermont has Heady Topper, Connecticut has Gandhi Bot. Not quite comparable because HT gets the solid 5.0 in my book but good enough to not have to travel 3 hours north to get it. A very full flavored dbl. IPA and slowly starting to make it's way around a good part of CT."
"Finally got to taste it on tap. Beautiful aroma, nice malty balance for the hops. Great mouth feel and flavor. The bitterness hangs on the back of your tongue a bit longer than I would prefer but it kept me coming back for more. Excellent beer."
Best IPA I've ever had. Love the floral and citrus notes on the finish. That's what sets this beer apart from so many others.
"Thank you to Chris N. for sending this to me! Poured into Tulip glass, a hazy orange copper color. Smells of grapefruit, tropical notes, and nice caramel malt in the background. Taste is wonderful. Nice juicy tropical, citrus hop notes. A balanced malt background is there, but the hops still shine through. Medium mouthfeel, nice and creamy. Overall a great Double IPA, and I'm really glad I got to try it."
"Juicy, fruity, boozy....what's not to like? Easily one of the best breweries in the country. All their offerings are spot-on. Great people as well. All hail NEBCO!!!"
Very nice! Its a real shame that it isnt available on a regular basis. I only got it because a friend owns a liquor store.
The best...
Date: 11/5/14
"This beer is definitely the best DIPA that I have had, in my opinion. It has a great fruity aroma that is experienced further in its taste. Excellently crafted and is definitely what I would envision to be a perfect DIPA."
"Beautiful beer, appearance is a slightly hazy orange ,pours a finger and a half of white, creamy head that retains very well, large, pronounced bubbles rise to the surface of the beer reinforcing the head. Aroma is FUll of spectacular hop notes. Tropical fruit notes off the hook. lots if Mango, pineapple, tangerines, slightest bit of floral character in the finish. "
Can poured into snifter.
A: Nice shade of burnt orange light white head good lacing on the glass
"Epic IPA, always on the search for this stuff."
Growler poured into a antique bier glass
"Overall this is a great easy to drink dipa, the aroma is out of the world citrus and fruit. Smooth bitterness with loads of fruit. My only complaint is that it finishes a little thin, the flavor kinda of just stops and doesn't follow through to the finish. def not a heady topper but I don't think it's trying to be. Way different profile. But still good. I like it"
"The nose on this is faint at best for me. Not sure of the exact canning date on this one but I do know it has some age. The taste however is very present. Lots of sweet, citrusy hops. Enough malt presence to stand up to the bold hop profile but it definitely doesn't take over. "
"Hazy peach and apricot color, pillowy white head, and big sticky lace. Big aromas of grapefruit, peach and mango. Taste follows through. Grapefruit dominant, slight malty sweetness up front merges with peach and mango flavors through the middle and a grapefruit bitter finish. Nice medium mouthfeel, carbonation breaks toward smooth at the finish where it gets crisp and semi dry. Honestly, one of the best beers I've ever had. Big hop flavors, great look and feel and a to die for aroma."
Rating with review in honor of the first G-Bot can shipment.
"Drank this after Heady Topper for the first time, so my rating may be affected by that. I felt that this beer was malty and overly bitter compared to other world class DIPAs"
Certainly one of the top IPA's. Not quite Heady Topper but would definitely be pumped to come across some again.
Very smooth for a double IPA
"Fresh Ghandi bot is essentially the perfect DIPA. Smell is floral, fruity, and citrusy. The taste is guava, papaya, mango with balanced malts and a bitter clean finish. Perfect."
this beer is the 2nd best beer I've had next to heady topper(excluding my brother's homebrews)
"A fantastic east coast dipa. Deserving of the hype it gets, the only complaint I can come up with is that NEBCo withholds cases of the stuff to sell at their brewery rather than sending it out to package stores. "
"Got a fresh growler from the brewery And enjoyed it two days later back in PA. This beer has a unique style and taste and it's basically perfect. Beautiful hazy yellow pour, and a taste than more than matches the nose. I guess there are not enough reviews to make this a top 250 beer but imo it's an absolute top tier dipa. Beer should be rated 100. Also very cool vibe at the brewery."
"Today 3 of us did a comparison tasting of 5 IPA/IIPA's brews: The brews were New Glarus Scream, Revolution Anti Hero, New England Gandhi-Bot, and Fiddlehead Second Fiddle and Mastermind. Second Fiddle came out on top with a rating of 5.0. Two of us feel it is the best IPA out there. Scream came in a solid second at 4.5. It was a surprise to all three of us because we had not had it before. Great nose, nice color, great taste. Very Solid. Anti-Hero was well liked by all three of us and came in at 4.25. Gandhi-Bot also came in at 4.25, however it did not have the WOW factor. But Fiddleheads second offering Mastermind did not quite live up to our hopes; a little weak."
"On tap at Blue Tusk. Hazy golden pour. Citrus and floral hop aromas, sweet on the nose. Big hop flavors up front rounded by a semi-sweet malt profile that comes off as soft yet clean and easy drinking. A hint of honey. The hop profile is dominated by grass, orange peel and floral notes and finishes with a big bitter grapefruit pith finish. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Overall it's an outstanding IPA although it's a little sweet and a little too bitter on the finish for my taste."
"This beer used to be a star, but recent iterations of this DIPA have been nothing but disappointing. Past versions of this beer tasted like a very good West Coast IPA...newer versions have been forgettable."
12oz can poured into a teku
About time I get around to properly reviewing this! Still have an old single number rating from the old Beer Advocate days. Now it's G-Bot so I better get my review in before anything else changes!
I can't give this a perfect score because there may be something else in the pipeline from these guys. 
12oz can served in a pint glass
"Rarely do I think a beer lives up to the hype but the Bot is nearly perfect. It lacks a bit in the aroma department but only when compared to super melony beers like Lunch and Heady. The taste is all citrus and a hint of bitter with lots of bubbles and crispness. Overall, I wish I could get this daily."
A: Melange of the orange hues on the can. Excellent cream colored head. Superb retention. 
I have to thank jdhowe for providing me and a friend an awesome 12oz can of this during a tasting the other evening. Poured into a tulip glass - this canned about 2 weeks ago.
Poured from a can into a Pipeworks snifter.
"Serve nice and cold, after a good sweat from working in the yard. "
"A: Deep yellow; creamy, white, pillowy head that lingers; lots of lacing;"
"A: deep golden ale body, hazy; ivory head a few fingers high that leaves messy lace down the sides of the glass"
WOOO!
Pours a clear amber orange with 2 finger head and some lacing. Strong fruity and citrus hop smell. Perfect balance of tropical fruits and piney hops on the tongue. Light malt backbone. Perfectly carbonated. I would keep G-bot in my fridge at all times if it were easy to get.
A- A beautiful golden color and it is not filtered so it’s dirty...in a good way. 
"Simply the absolute best IPA for me. Perfect malt to hop balance. JUST dry enough of a finish to make me want another sip, with enough flavor to linger for a minute. ""Love"" in a can. "
A great DIPA! I've been making regular trips to the brewery to fill growlers of this.
"Double IPA's are everywhere now and this has remained one of my favorites for years now for a reason. The appearance was a nice yellow, but the smell took me back when I gave it a sniff. Lots of grapefruit, mint, and orange peel came through. The taste was a great amount of bitterness paired with a semi-sweet finish that made for a nice refreshing taste but kept a nice aftertaste. Intense but not abrasive. Would definitely recommend for hop heads and IPA lovers."
"A- Poured straight down into the glass and a huge, pillowy, three finger head was the result. Murky, caramel-like golden color. Tons of lacing on the glass as the head dissipates."
"12 oz. can poured into tulip glass; acquired a four-pack via trade -- Thanks, Dan!"
can into a snifter.
Best DIPA ive ever had...plain and simple. Aroma is extremely tropical with beautiful pineyness. Pours a sticky white lacey head with dark tangerine color. Basically flawless beer in my opinion I just wish they would produce more of this beer in CT!!! Today I filled up two growlers and every time I am simply amazed
This poured as expected for an IPA with a thick amber hue and an ivory head of dense foam.
A-Pours an impressive hazy amber/orange color with no clarity. Head is a tad off-white with an inch of head that has little retention. 
Poured from the can into a snifter glass.
Poured in a tree house tulip on 3-21-14 from a fresh can.
You had this beer. 
Appearance- Golden/orange color and hazy as can be. Pours a one finger foamy head.
Appearance: Pours unfiltered straw yellow with a 1/2 finger of white head. This is so cloudy it almost looks like grapefruit juice.
01/08/15
Thanks to Zach for this awesome beer...trying the famous Gandhi-Bot. 
Ghandi-Bot. I loved that movie.
"Poured from a 12oz can, no #freshbeer info."
"Picked up a growler from the brewery on my way up north. Pours a nice hazy orange/yellow, very nice citrus & pine notes. Bits and pieces reminded me of Heady Topper, fantastic DIPA, wish it was more readily available in Southern CT and NYC metro area."
"Poured from the 12 oz, can into a stemmed tulip glass."
"Very nice beer - should be Heady Topper, Pliny, Stone Ruination category."
"This guy was introduced to me a few months back. To say I'm hooked is an understatement. I've had many ""proclaimed"" great dbl's and The Bot still stands alone. Murky appearance? Forget about it! This is a great beer and I feel spoiled living in CT w/ this great little gem of a brewery being so close. This is my go to ""premium"" beer and always will be. Cheers!"
Finally got my hand on a 4 pack of this last night while traveling through CT. Drank one last night. Amazing. Time for my review of the second one.
Poured out of a can into a snifter.
I got this as a random choice. I've never had a beer that you remember so vividly until now. 
Thanks to Brian for bringing 2 cans of this to me in CA from his CT home. 
Poured a hazy copper hue with a one finger frothy white head. There was very good retention and lacing. 
"Thanks CTJman for this one. Resinous, sticky pine and papaya on the nose. Juicy hop load as you would expect of a better DIPA: Sourdough, pineapple notes sink into an oozy malt. A clean bite of hops power washes your tongue for the finish and prepares you for the next sip. This is a very good DIPA."
Thanks to mjord23 for picking this up. Tulip glass.
The beer comes in a slight hazy vibrant amber color. A deep rich sunset orange.
"Poured into a tulip glass, leaves a nice two finger head that stuck around for a while,bright orange, nice lacing. Not a bad looking dipa. Smell is not over powering. Getting some pine and maybe lemon, with some slight caramel. Light carbonation and very creamy on the first sip. Definitely pine and grass up front, a little bit of citrus to follow. Aftertaste of pine and lemon, very nice. Nicely balanced with a nice little hop bite at the end that sticks around on the tongue for a while. For whatever reason I was expecting a hop bomb, probably random comparisons to heady topper I've seen on here, not the case, but still worth seeking out."
"12oz orange and red can with a really creepy gun metal Gandhi robot with a hop vine next to him. The back of the can contains all the mandatory US info, a quick description of the beer, and printed signatures of the owners or brewers (?). A stamped canned date or a best before date on the bottom would have been nice. "
Poured into a Dogfish Head Spiegelau IPA glass.
"A - Three fingers of thick, frothy head. Dark amber in color, and a bit hazy."
"Can share at Proof courtesy of Matt Masterson. Pours a pale slightly hazy yellow. Good bubbly white head that lasted almost a minute. Thin collar. Nice spicy, piney hop aroma with a fair amount of malt sweetness noticeable. Taste is the same. Great. Again, not a piney hop fan, but when it's done well, it really works. High carbonation and medium body."
"This beer gets everything right, including being strong, and provocatively packaged."
Appearance is an orange hazy color with a massive three finger white foamy head.
"A- poured into a snifter. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a foamy white head, good retention leaving a small sudsy layer. Some small resinous particles floating all around "
A: Poured the entire can so that may explain the slight haziness. A golden-straw color with a light white head maintaining about 1/8th inch above the body of the beer.
Poured this from the 12 oz. can into a snifter.
"Bought many cans of this from Harvest Wine & Spirits in Hartford, CT. Poured into a Waterford snifter. It's a beautiful orangy DIPA with a thick white head and lots of hops/exotic fruit coming off the nose. The part that just doesn't hold up for me in this brew is as it warms... the hops get really abrasive. Other DIPAs I've had are definitely better on the back end. In fact, I've drain-poured because of the aftertaste -- it can be amazingly harsh/bad sometimes. Otherwise, it's still an amazing brew for the first three quarters. I would definitely be willing to trade if anyone is searching for it."
"damn near perfect in my book! great taste, mouthfeel, etc..never had lawsons... I could drink this every day of my life if nebco distributed to NJ!! Good Carbonation, head, lacing, very heavy citrus on the after taste, if I could have a growler 2x a week I would need a CT mule... Do not hesitate to try this. will stand up to any 2ipa in the country..no shit!"
"A-Cloudy bright yellow orange, nice carbonation, one finger head, tries to leave some lacing."
Poured from a can into a pint glass.
This poured a unique melon color orange with a thick head of soft white cottony foam that fell in rings and patches and finally left a thin layer on top. This had large white floaties in it and some sediment that detracted from the appearance. In a certain light it appears to have a muddied color brown in it but against the natural outdoor light it is pastel orange with light hues. This one is murky.
Appearance :Golden and cloudy in color. A lot of lacing on the glass. One finger head.
"The beer pours a pale orange color with notes of amber. The beer forms a big, beautiful head of creamy white bubbles that last at about a finger’s width above the glass. In body, the beer is clean of particles, but very hazy and nearly opaque. On the nose, this beer is big and beautiful. Pine needles, pinecones and sweet mango juice mingle with dank and spicy weed, grapefruit rind, and soft alcohol notes. From the can, the nose is just about the same with just a touch more roundness coming from the citric scents and less of the alcohol burning the nostrils. On the tongue, the beer tastes hugely and properly bitter with resinous pine sap sticking to the tongue. Sweet hops, alcohol, and light bread malt mingle with citric acidity to make up the side show. The finish is dry with only slight sticky sweetness lingering. On the tongue, the beer is medium bodied, with fluffy carbonation that gives velvet softness to the mouthfeel. The mouth is left sticky with resin and bitter tingling, the palate is wrecked. From the can, the beer feels slightly crisper. In flavor, the beer tastes of resinous pine, sweet mango, light pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot. Distinct fresh hop flavors bubble on the tongue and feel sticky and very resinous. The taste has a strong backbone of medicinal bitters. Mmm. A bit sickly sweet, but not too much so. The cloying alcohol seems most present in the finish which also features dry cracker malts at the very base of my senses and strong piney hops. Overall, this is a damn good double IPA. It would be excellent on a late summer afternoon. Great bitters, great hop character, and a great effect on the tongue. The alcohol is just a tad too much, but other than that I like this beer a lot."
"Huge thanks to TheSevenDuffs for including this in the fall Canbif, huge want."
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a tulip. Not sure on the date of this can, but my guess is about a month."
12oz can poured into an English pint glass. Big thanks to MarkJC1018 for hooking me up with a long-time want of mine.
"A: Poured from a can into a pint glass. Opaque with haziness and a light brownish color that looks like hay. A thin, white ring of head with some wispy lacing."
Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a loose full finger collar with reasonable hang time. Leaves an average amount of lacing. Visibly effervescent with tons of tiny bubbles clinging to the sides and keeping the head alive.
Poured into a stemmed wineglass from the 12 oz. can(drove to the northernmost packie on 395 in CT that carries this in Putnam Ct to get this.
Date: 09/18/2013
A: Hazy tangerine orange body. Beige pillowy huge head. Good lacing.
"Can poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours a hazy light orange color, with a finger and a half of off white foam of tiny bubbles. Good lacing as the head dissipates to half a finger, fueled by a large amount of carbonation streaming up from the beer."
"Thick, opaque orange DIPA that almost looks pulpy. Solid 1+ finger white head, nice retention, good lacing."
"Straight out golden straw color. Large, slightly off-white head stays for awhile. Thick rings of lace. Looks like a great example of the style."
Big thanks to Mersh for a trade on this one. Can poured into snifter. 
Can poured into Heady Topper glass
12oz can poured into a snifter. 
Pours a hazy tangerine orange. Nice frothy white head. Decent retention and really good lacing. 
"Thank youse are in order to tectactoe, who knocked down this long-time want as an extra in a box that arrived last week. 12 oz. can with nice, bizarre art. I often think brewers do more than just...beer."
"Pours a dark golden in color with nice two finger white head. OK retention with nice lacing. Strong pine aroma with lots of grapefruit and some tropical fruit. Lots of pine and citrus on the tongue with some dank. Finishes dry and bitter. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Extremely smooth. Overall, an easy drinking, complex DIPA! I'll be seeking this one out again soon."
"Thanks to Ultra-Plinian for the big NEBCo hook-up. DIPA from a can, yes sir! Orange haze, all in my brain. There's really not a better way to describe the look of this one. The slightly gray tinted, mostly white head waxes and wanes down to a thin, thin skin that never completely leaves the top of the beer bare, and lasts for quite a long time."
Super delicious local DIPA. Pour from the can is a nice orange amber. Not much head. 
"This beer always makes me very happy. I would give it a perfect rating, but I have had the Peekskill Double Standard on several occasions, and I have yet to try those fabled IPAs from northern Vermont. It is just as good out of the can as it is on tap. Hopefully their new canning machine will not change that."
Can (2013)
"A: A moderately hazy, unfiltered looking dark golden beer that produces a good head stand when poured. The two finger of off white head is made of rocky foam with very good retention. "
Thanks to ChadMc3 for this one. Poured into 10oz goblet. Poured a hazy orange-gold color with about 1/2 inch of off-white head that had good retention and better than moderate lacing.
"This is truly the best beer I've ever had...Had it uber fresh....14 hours (or so I was told). The first thing that hit me was the grapefruit aroma explosion. The most incredible aromatic beer ever. Mouth feel was slick & smooth buit not overly syrupy. My only complaint is that my wife liked it too....Now I need to double down. If you ever have a chance to score some of this, do it without hesitation."
12oz can from the Potsdam NY IGA for $4
RE-REVIEW: NEBCo. Gandhi-Bot (6/30/2013)
Can poured into a mason jar.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner. And this ain't no phantom punch KO, this is a suplex that would make the Undertaker blush. "
No freshness info apparent on the can. Poured in to tulip.
"12oz can, no discernible date. Tasted 6.9.13"
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a big, big head and huge hop aroma! The taste follows suit, very juicy, with a fairly diverse hop profile. Maybe just a tad out of balance towards the hops, but I'm very forgiving in that regard! Mouthfeel was very good, it has some body and is well carbonated. Overall, this is a very, very good DIPA that belongs high on any hop head's list. It actually tastes and smells similar to Heady Topper. I will snatch this one up any time I see it in the store!"
Served in a glass from a fresh growler picked up at the brewery.
A- Deep gold body with a frothy and sticky white head.
12oz can without a canning date but is at least a few weeks old; poured into a Bell's snifter and quaffed today 5/28/13.
Can: Poured a cloudy amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of strong grassy hops notes with light residual sugar notes. Taste is dominated by powerful floral grassy hops with light citrus notes and semi-sweet malt non-descript malt base. Body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very enjoyable IIPA which is focus more on floral hops notes with limited bitterness.
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden orange color with a frothy white head that slowly settles into a thick lasting ring. Sweet citrus hop aroma with plenty of earthy notes and a subtle malt presence. There’s some grassy pine needle and dank hop oils but the tropical/citrus fruits are most prominent in the nose. Lots of mango, grapefruit and citrus rind along with subtle biscuit in the flavors. Medium bodied with a complex, flavorful hop profile that is nicely balanced by a sweet malt backbone. Bitter and sweet notes play off of each other with hints of dry and bitter pine countered by notes of grapefruit and orange. The malt backbone adds sweetness with notes of caramel, toffee and biscuit without getting in the way of the hops. Overall, a well-balanced brew and very flavorful with a well-masked ABV making it dangerously drinkable."
"12oz can poured into a stemless wine glass, many thanks to Treebs for the fresh can."
Pours a dirty golden color with a soapy off white head that settled into a sparse cap. 
New England Brewing Co. - Gandhi-Bot Double IPA - 12fl oz can
First had: on tap at NEBCO
"Ahh, the long awaited Ghand-Bot finally in hand! Props to J.T. & Drew @ Westmere Beverage on the outskirts of Albany,NY for the Heady Topper/Ghandi-Bot swap. Ghandi-Bot tends to disappear quickly from the shelves, and now I understand why. The artwork on the can is bizarre and likeable all at once, yet builds intrigue."
"10 oz pour on tap at the Madison Pour House in Albany, NY. Have had cans many times before, this is the first time I've experienced this classic IPA on tap."
12oz can poured into an oversized stemmed tulip
"Picked up a growler of Gandhi just this afternoon at NEBCO. At $15 a growler, it better be good."
Big thanks to cosmicevan for sending a few cans of this my way. Served in a Funkwerks snifter.
Hands Down the Best Beer in Connecticut!!!
A big thanks to ManMoosePig for this beer. in his FIRST trade. i suspect there will be many more.
12oz can poured into my CBS snifter
Thanks to ThePorterSorter for this one.
"Lucky enough to have a brother in the Connecticut area, as this is really hard to get ahold of. This can is about 2 wks fresh, served out of a 12 oz can and into a Bell's Tulip glass. Thanks BostonRyan"
"Had this beer twice over the weekend. Shared pours in tulips, then had one straight from the can. The scent is heavy grapefruit. So much hop action on the nose. Bright and pungent. The taste went from 3.75 to 4.5 for me from poured to can. I pour all my beers, but this was so much better from the can. The taste is more balanced from the can. Everything you could want from a IIPA."
"A - Thick haze. Shade flat, but what's there lightly off-white. Deep white peach body."
"one of the most drinkable double ipas ive ever encountered. thanks to a wonderful trade with thebrewo, I got to enjoy two cans of this bad boy. the pour on it is tinted red, orange, and bronze, with some small yeast floaters and an amazing bone white head that rises three inches high and holds up well above the rim of my glass. the nose is fresh oily hops, high alpha, fruity and juicy, citrus and pine both, only mildly bitter. there is a decent coppery malt balance, but hops are of course the star of this beer. the taste is a lot like the nose, with a very fruity and complex hop arrangement. I would love to know which varietals are used, but I can say that there is a hefty tropical fruit element, its pineapple or tartish passion fruit. a little bitterness creeps into the finish, but not enough to slow down its drinkability at all. love the feel too, fuller bodied but kept swift by its lively carbonation. super creamy, and less sticky and filling than many other beers of this style. I had two cans back to back, and was only done because I didn't have any more. im not sure if this comes in 4s or 6s or what, but I could drink these forever. its amazingly fresh and refreshing at the same time, unlike a lot of big india pale ales. thanks to thebrewo for hooking this up, its one ive been hunting for some time now, and it surpasses even its hype. bomb!"
"On tap at the Tap and Tea Room in Albany, NY."
"A: Pours a hazy golden peach/apricot in color with some moderate amounts of fine visible yeast sediment in suspension at the bottom of the glass, light amounts of visible carbonation, and some orange + golden yellow highlights. The beer has a finger tall foamy light beige head that slowly reduces to a couple of medium sized thin patches, a thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer, and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate to significant amounts of lacing are observed."
"poured an orange hue (a bit hazy) with 2 fingers of white foamy head and excellent lacing left behind. HUGE floral hop bouquet in the nose, very sweet, floral, citrusy, pineapple, grapefruit. an excellent balnce of hop profiles.. west coast piney meets the citrusy grapefruit, with a pile on of northeast floral ipa style.. backed by a heavy sweet malt profile. this is up there with pliny, flower power, and heady. a resinous bitterness lingers for quite some time. the medium body pour is easy to drink due to the hops overpowering the booze flavor. low carbonation and a sticky feeling left behind, this is one of the better dipas i've had. nice and bitter."
"We crack the tabs and pour a brew of murky pumpkin orange. It puts up a two finger head of tight, cake-batter bubbles. This retains well, leaving patterns of spots all down the glass. There is a serious chill haze, with generous sediment suspended throughout. Carbonation appears to be moderate. The aroma is equally bright with malts as it is hops. On the one side we get spicy, herbal, floral, and nectary hops, while on the other we get big bready malts, with light oat and cereal grain beside the classic pales and light caramels. There are additional notes of baker’s yeast, sweetly stinging booze, mild medicinal phenols, and Juicy Fruit gumminess mixing in. With warmth these all blend beautifully, making it harder to pick apart the individuals from the final whole. Our first impression is that the flavoring is nicely fruity, and the hops are dirty, earthy, and fully flavorful, but without making the bitterness overly intense. As we sip, juicy pineapple and nectarine sugars, herbal hops, gritty earthiness, and mineral start things off. Moving to the peak is the bite of ethanol, with a sweetening of the hops into more floral, and heavily syrupy nectary hops. The malts, phenols, and bubblegum esters take over, pulling us to a nicely balanced, but more bittered, finish with booze, dill weed, and those herbal, mineral and metallic earthy hops. There is a final wash of apricot and tropical fruit sweetness to the last drop. The aftertaste breathes of toasted pales and lightly wheaty malts, chalky yeast, fusel booziness, and bitterly earthy and herbal, but sweetly nectary hops. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium. Each sip gives nice slurp, sip, cream, and froth, but with a little thinness on the finishing pop. The mouth is briefly cooled and coated, but as the alcohol burns off it is warmed and astringently dried. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks quite nicely."
Poured from a 12 oz can into a FFF teku.
12 oz. Can
Finally getting the chance to have a Ghandi bot! I have wanted to try this for the longest time
"A- Pours a murky, mucky deep gold with an inch of bright white foam. Thousands of little islands of sticky lacing grabbing and gripping the glass. "
"Numerical code on the side of the can says 3 01 09 A 2 BE - so I'm guessing this was born on January 9, 2013. Consumed on March 20, 2013. "

From a can to a Duvel tulip glass
An extra from Bigedct. Thanks for the beer! No freshness date.
"Thanks to GuisseppeFranco for sending this over as a bonus! This poured out as a murky golden color with some flakes floating around in it. The head was white and held a good retention and lacing. The smell of the beer gave off a very nice floral and citrus aroma from the hops. The taste of the beer was really quite nice as well. Again more floral fruity notes with some bitter pine in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is nicely carbonated, it's smooth and very drinkable. Overall it was a damn good DIPA. I would drink again if I came across more."
"12oz can: Finally got a hold of one of these. This one pours a orange-tinged hazy darker golden color. There was a very small white head on it that doesn’t linger or leave much lacing. Tons of hops in the nose of this one. Lots of resinous pine, and some citrus. Not much else making it past. Taste is very good. Bitter, but some residual sweetness bubbling up. Pine, biscuit, citrus, some caramel malts. Just a touch over medium bodied. Very Nice!"
12oz can poured into a NEBCO tulip.
Poured from a can into a tulip. Pours a nice burnt orange w a thin white head. Sticky lacing w each sip. The aroma is really nice orange grapefruit citrus and pine heavy w a little bit of sweet malt and maybe a bready note in there too. Taste is hopforward piney minty orange citrus grapefruit bitter nice light malt backbone but sweet caramelly and then hop closed w a lingering piney bitter finish. Mouthfeel is pretty light w good carbonation. Goes down smooth for a DIPA. Overall I am very glad to have found the last 4-pack in town of this baby and drinking it right now. This is a hop showcase IIPA. Really diggin the Gandhi-Bot.
Gandhi has been my go to for the last 5 years or so. Well before the new age cans came into play
Thanks Scott (heliosphann)!!!
Big-time thanks to wittyname for supplying me a generous box!

"12oz can, no date. Bought a four pack while driving through Connecticut. "
Drank from the can (gasp). Did pour a bit into a cup for a look - hazy orange/gold. Pretty standard looking DIPA.
Got this from a trade from JCrandall.
A: poured golden orange in color with yellow highlights and a nice half finger of bubbly head that left some good spotted lacing sticking to the glass.
"Poured from a growler purchased same day at NEBCO. Thanks Rob. Nice orange coloring, 1 finger white head, nice lacing on glass. Aroma of oranges and pineapple with piney notes and some slight hints of grapefruit. Hop aroma definitely noticeable. Taste is terrific--hop forward, slightly bitter, but easy to drink. Initial taste of orange and pineapple with slight notes of grapefruit along with caramel malt. Finish is a slightly bitter and enjoyable. Medium body with very good carbonation. Very enjoyable and dangerously easy to drink. Highly recommended."
A: Pours a slightly hazy gold with a finger of white head that recedes into a thin ring with a little lacing.
"Cloudy yellow with lots of bubbles and a dense, creamy white head. Aroma is strong piney, citrusy and resiny. The beer is bracingly bitter, but there's not a lot of flavor contribution from the hops. A real tongue scraper. Good carbonation and medium body. Pretty nice, but I'd like to see a bigger hop flavor contribution."
Presentation: 12 oz. can served chilled and poured into a pint glass. Big thanks to Centennial getting me this really fresh can. Really excited to give this a try.

Poured from can into snifter glass.
A: Golden color. Slightly hazy. Small head.
"Reviewing the Ghandi Bot from New England Brewing Company out of Massachussets. I have hear really excellent things about this beer and this brewery, and I am extremely excited to try my first beer from them. I have a Wet Willy Scotch Ale and Imperial Stout Trooper (thanks ProperHops!) in the cellar too. This beer used to be in 16 oz cans, but it now comes in 12 oz servings."
"Thanks to woosterbill for this one, picked up essentially right off the canning line and about 10 days old at this point. Poured into a tulip."
"Poured can into a 13 oz tulip glass, not sure how to read freshness code. Pours a murky orange yellow with some floaties. Has a one inch sticky white that leaves some nice lacing. Smell is tangerine, mango, grapefruit, pine, grass, and hints of garlic. Taste is citrus up front, with a nice big grapefruit finish that lingers on the tongue awhile. Body is medium, a little dry which isn't a problem, plenty of life, and very drinkable. This is a awesome hop experience and definitely one of the best I have had."
Got this one from a friend during his recent visit from Boston. Really looking forward to it after digging another New England IPA from a can - Heady Topper.
"Big thanks to blanco, who extra'd me this one! "
"A- Pours a hazy amber orange with chunks and floaties( I HATE that), topped with a 1-1/2 finger off white head. Light lacing throughout."
Growler poured into a pint
"Happy to find this at Pies & Pints in Middlebury, CT, this favorite DIPA shows a bright amber color with a very modest white head and decent lacing. The aroma speaks of lemon-grapefruit and a pleasant caramel base. Very nice. The flavor brings lots more citrus bite and cramel sweetness. This approaches being cloying with a medium-heavy body and somewhat viscous feel. The hops are the theme here but it does carry some hints of cereal grain with the caramel sweetness. But let’s just call a spade a spade, it’s just a hop lovers retreat. Love it, tap or can, one of my favorites for a hop fix."
12 oz bottle was poured into a tulip glass.
"12 oz. can poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. Looks ok, pale yellow, you can actyually see right through it even thought there's a good amount of particles floating arounf, but larger particals than you normally see, almost looks like fish food. Lighter than expected, but kinda makes up for it with a white head with small bubbles, decent amount of lacing to it. "
Pours a hazy orange color with a 1cm white bubbly head. Fairly low retention but fairly solid lacing. 
"This is a truly extraordinary IPA. Its my current favorite, hands down. Its an extremely well-balanced, heavily hopped, smooth, aromatic, double IPA. If you're only having one, save it for last. Once you have one, the next beer is bound to be a disappointment, unless its an even heavier beer, like a DFH 90."
12 ounce can poured into tulip glass. Been wanting to try this for a long time. No canned on date.
Drank from the can.
"12oz can, according to beer guy mad fresh. One of the few singles I've ever bought, quite the treat. "
Thanks to Woosterbill for the trade.
Appearance: A nice head on this one. About a fingers worth and impressive residual strength. The color is an orange that falls just beyond amber. About 12 SRM.
Poured from a fresh can (2/12/12) into a snifter.
"My man Sandman3479 hooked up a 4-pack, thanks man! Poured from undated can, though was sent ""fresh"", to a pint glass. The beer pours a light copper amber with a slight haze, nice 2 finger head with some retention and nice lacing. Awesome can, lol. The hops dominate the nose with citrus and earthy character with a faint pale malt backbone, no hint of the alcohol. Really enjoyable flavor with the hops immediately on your pallete. Hints of citrus: tangerine, orange, grapefruit, pine, and earthy. Medium bitterness and hoppy. Crisp and clean. Hides the alcohol very well. Medium to full bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a very good DIPA. It was a treat!!"
"Live tasting, can into Duvel tulip, a very generous extra thanks to fubofnic.. Thanks Ryan!! "
"A- a fairly orange pour with a finger of white head, some lace."
A- Nice light copper color. Haze. One finger head quickly becomes thin layer that holds on. Spotty lacing. Really nice looking beer.

Thanks to rowingbrewer for the great extra.
A big thanks to caguiar for this awesome extra! Cheers!
12 oz can poured into a pint glass
"This is a complex IPA. The malt and hops both express themselves in balance. At first you taste some sweetness from the malt and then the bitterness takes over. The carbonation and look of the beer is fantastic. I think this beer reminds meet of Dogfish 90, but beats in by not being overly sweet with a cleaner, dryer finish. This is not the hoppiest IPA I have ever had, but certainly the most interesting one. Fantastic beer!"
Picked up a four pack last night that was bottled recently that was the latest batch (I think it was canned the end of last week or the beginning of this week according to the NEBCO facebook page). 12 oz can into my Russian river pint glass.
"Picked up a 4-pack of this recently, looking forward to having it after hearing so many good things. Right after I poured there was a huge hop aroma filling the room. I was a little disappointed that it wasn't as hoppy as it smelled. Nice and crisp, not a lot of malt, and pretty good overall but nothing exceptional."
Poured into my founders tulip. Received from angrybabboon in the noob bif round 6.
Big thanks to Joey for the hookup on this one...
A- Poured from a can into a laser etched chalice... starts with a light white head that mostly disappears except for the small amount promoted by the laser etching. What little amount of head was there left behind some nice strings of lacing stuck to the glass. Beer is a cloudy amber color with a some sediment floating

Review adapted from notes taken 3/3/11
"Many thanks to Beenitty for the chance to taste this one. He said that there was quite a buzz about this beer, and I see what the fuss is about!"
"Somewhat cloudy orange that once it settled became a fairly clear, deep golden color. No real head to speak of but definate carbonation. Big citrusy, resiny and line aroma. Malty presence with a tongue stripping hop bitterness. Long, lingering sticky, pine like flavor. Decent mouthfeel, there is a residual, somewhat gummy sweetness. A real good double IPA. Personally I like more hop flavor then the bitter blast so too many might be a bit overwhelming. Still a damn fine brew."
A: Pours grapefruit colored with a finger of white head that sticks around.
Note's from Captain Lawrence Rosso Batch 3 release / tasting:

"Poured into a sniffer, thanks to Jdiddy for hooking me up with this one"
I have a final due. So I'm drinking a Gandhi-Bot and reviewing it. You know - that totally makes sense.
Poured from a 12-ounce can picked up from xanok. Into a snifter it goes. 
"12oz can pours a thick, hazy burnt orange with minimal head and almost no lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, grass, pine, and slightly yeasty. I pick up lemons and orange peel, with some hint of spices. Mouthfeel is dry, and heavy. Taste throws at you a really dry mix of everything you smell. This is in my top 5 IPAs. It may be a contender for #1."
Thanks to Brez07 for sending a 4 pk out to me. Poured a 12oz can into a Stone Specialty 16oz IPA glass. No freshness date on the can. 
Thanks to Andrew for providing me with this beer. It was excellent.

12 oz. can poured into a pint glass.
"Massive thanks goes out to my boy Jefe73 sending me this one as an extra in a recent trade! Served from can into a Green Man snifter. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a half finger bone white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, sweet alcohol, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a damn tasty brew. Very well balanced flavor going on here with a great aroma as well. The CAN really delivered on this one! Maybe this is why Woody is on the CAN Quest... Only thing this brew is lacking is appearance, but who cares when it tastes and smells that good (and no, that's not a 'that's what she said' joke)... Get your hands on this one! You will not regret doing so. Thanks again for the chance to try this one Jeff!"
"On tap at Mikro with R Moe Nay, Pustevlaho, Andrea, and Jlynn. Looks like the yellow brick road... clear, golden, and carbonated. Smells of grapefruit, citrus, and HOPS! So hoppy and such a fruity sweetness to balance it out. This DIPA fresh is tough to beat. Pliny and Topper are the only beers off hand that I can think of that rival it. I absolutely love the hop profile of this beer. The alcohol is completely hidden and a clean smooth feel would be an understatement. Love having this brewery in my state. The only thing I can think of that distinguishes this beer on tap from the can is the ever so slight freshness of the hops and carbonation is dead on. The score if the same for the can because I can give the taste a 4.7 for the bottle and 4.6 for the can respectively."
from notes
"Pours a hazy orange/yellow/gold with a nice white head. Fades quick. I smell pine, grapefruit, resin and maybe some bready malt. Smells like a good DIPA. Taste is like the nose, piney hops with some citrus and a bready malt back. Bitter, but not obnoxiously so. Pretty balanced. Good carbonation and a nice, medium mouthfeel with some sweetness, but not too much. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer."
"Got this in the ""tell me a story BIF."""
Picked up a 4 pack at my local CT spot. (finally reviewing this)
Thanks to naloxone for sending this East Coast DIPA goodness my way!

Reviewed from notes:
From a 12oz can to a pint glass. Pours a very hazy golden with minimal head. But has good lacing and carbonation throughout. 
"Love the design of this can, love double IPAs, love double IPAs in a can. And I dig this part of the can's text: ""fully vegetarian."" So, are there still tons of beers made using isinglass? Huh. Anyway, thanks to msubulldog25 for this one!"
Thanks to monsterzerp for this 12 oz can. Poured into my Duvel mini tulip.
Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to stakem for this.
"Re-review (Different serving type). My first review of this was on cask and it was spectacular, let's see if the regular, canned version lives up to the sheer awesomeness of the cask version. No freshness date but I believe this is the most recent batch (early/mid February?)"
"A - Pours a very bright cloudy orange-yellow color with a finger of off-white head. The head fades fairly quickly to a ring, lacing nicely around the glass."
Quite excited for this one. Robots.
Beer Karma at work. About a week ago I saw a picture of this beer and thought it looked interesting. A few days later I found this in a box as an extra send to me by naloxone. Thanks Evan.
As a rule I do not generally like IPA. I must admit I've had a few more recently that have impressed me but it's still not my favorite type.
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ yellow, with an off white head. In the aroma, orange citrus hops. In the taste, a sweet to dry slight orange citrus and a faint hop taste. A citrus hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry orange citrus aftertaste. The flavor is lighter than the nose, hides the alcohol, nice hop presence and really dig it."
240th review on BA
"With the gimick of the robot behind me, I can appreciate the flavors in the can. This is a serious Imperial IPA with both balance and hop dominance that begins to somehow make sense with the very first sip."
"reviewed from notes. from a snifter glass. golden almost orange in color. minimal head and lacing. smell is hops, more specifically citrus/orangy and floral. very forward hop presence. fairly strongly carbonated. incredibly drinkable, and I would love to get my hands on more as soon as possible. very well put together, as all the flavors meld together very well."
"Fairly thick blonde head takes an average amount of time to fall to a speckled film, but still thick around the edges. Very thickly clouded, almost milky pale yellow. A few flakes of brownish sediment very slowly drop towards the bottom. Sort of a strange appearance, not exactly pretty, but I'm quite intrigued."
Nice extra from arvjunk- into my Stone IPA glass
"First off, big thanks to mob2332 for the can. Cheers!"
Another CT brew!
"12 ounce can courtesy of both pwoody11 and guzzle211, thanks again guys!"
Sampled on 11-13-10
"I received this beer as an extra from Shaggy9356, thanks Matt! Before pouring it into my snifter I had to take a swig from the can to know what I was getting into. Needless to say, I already want more. It poured a murky burnt orange with a one finger creme colored head. It smells of floral, bitter hops and I love it. This is the most floral beer I've had in awhile. The flavor is very dry and bitter and finishes with a sweet citrus like flavor that goes into the drier hop ridden aftertaste. This gets big points from me. It drinks impressively smooth and crisp simultaneously. What an awesome beer, and from a can?!?! This beer lives up to the hype and is exceptionally drinkable."
Big thanks goes out to ubufan2112 for this can (1 of 4!). 12oz into a NB Globe. 
Appearance: clear yellow with a lot of head that dies back a bit. Lots of lacing on the glass
Received on a trade.
"Got as an extra from ngeunit1, thanks man!"
"poured into a snifter. very cloudy with an orange color. head is not as big as I would like, but pour was also semi-passive so maybe that's it. the smell is of tropical fruits and strong. Very much like a Sculpin in that way. Taste is similar, with a powerful hop presence although bitterness is minimal. mouthfeel is on the thicker side for a DIPA, but pleasant. Drinkability is incredibly good. This is one of the few East Coast IPAs that seems to draw inspiration from San Diego breweries. Excellent beer."
12oz can from a 4-pack (Christmas gift!) - served in a standard pint glass
"12oz can - an extra from a generous trader. Thanks, you know who you are!! Poured into a snifter."
Served in a pint glass
"Poured from the can into a Tulip glass...this allowed for the citrus and hops to shine through. Came off piney and sweet at the dame time. The beer poured golden and hazy, with not much in terms of head or lacing for me. Taste was hops of front to me backed by the citrus behind. Agree with some others that it comes off West Coast, but that does not downgrade it in the least. fantastic brew, extremely drinkable, and with the ABV being so well hidden, I could definitely see myself waking up under a table somewhere with a bunch of cans beside me."
"Pours a dark, hazy golden color. Not much head or retention."
had this beer at a recent tasting
"Acquired from Jayli, so a big ""Thank You"" goes out to her. Poured from a 12oz can into a US tumbler pint glass."
Poured from the can into my sam's perfect pint glass
"Thanks to steve8robin for this one. I poured from a 12 ounce can into a sa perfect pint glass. Deep yellow/orange pour, 2 inch sticky head. The aroma is wonderful, pineapple, oranges and tropical fruit. A big rush of juicy tropical fruit up front, followed by sweet citrus. It has a drying finish, sweeter than I expected. It has a medium/full body, nicely carbonated. A great DIPA, luckily I have another can to enjoy."
"12oz can shared by sstackho, thanks! Pours a nice vibrant orange with a finger of bubbly head. Nose is filled with tropical fruits and citrus rinds - pineapple, grapefruit, mango. Long lasting bitterness, real pithy finish, hint of leafy hops, some pine. Balanced by a biscuity caramel malt body, not too sweet. Hides the ABV real well, nice dry long bitter finish - this is a top notch DIPA and being in a can is a double bonus. Wish we had something like this available here."
Big thanks to Shawn for bringing over one of the best-named and best-looking cans I've ever seen.
Appearance: Cloudy golden amber; some decent head and lacing
Shared as an extra from COBeerBuff. Thanks again! Poured into a tulip. 
"Thanks to JoeyBeerBelly for the opportunity to try this one! Pours a super hazy golden orange color with lots of yeast chunkies floating around with a small head and no lacing. Not sure I like all this sediment in my IPAs... Nice, tropical fruit aroma, mostly pineapple and orange, light grapefruit, and a mustiness from the yeast. Taste is very nice, not overly bitter. Good dose of citrus, pale malts give a cracker-like quality, lightly sweet, and again, yeasty. Flavor seems to be a bit light for a double IPA, but I'm glad it's not ridiculously bitter. Body is below medium, and carbonation is very light. Overall, it's well balanced and pretty drinkable, just wish I had known there was this much sediment in the bottom so I could have kept it out of my glass. This might be the one setback of craft beer and cans... Makes it difficult to decant properly. But overall, a tasty brew!"
"A: Poured a cloudy yellowish gold color with good carbonation, nice white head leaving plenty of lacing"
"Appearance: 1 inch head, cloudy, orange/yellow in color"
Big time thanks to smutty33 for a fresh 4 pack the highly acclaimed Ghandi-Bot! Sweet 12 oz. orange and black can poured into my DFH signature glass. 
Reviewed from a growler filled at the brewery this afternoon. Pours a cloudy light orange color with a fine head that leaves beautiful thick lacing on the glass. 
"This is the second time I've gotten to try this great brew, both times courtesy of number1bum. A huge thanks, Josh!"
I've been luck enough on my last 2 trips to the brewery that they've had this on tap. I think they kept a keg back for Thanksgiving. Thanks Rob.
"Poured from a 12 oz. can into my Sierra Nevada XXX Anniversary tulip. Received in a trade with GoGriz; thanks Cody, it was a big want!"
blew through three cans of this stuff faster than I would have liked. 12oz can into newport Storm tulip.
"A 12 oz. can from a 4-pack most graciously offered by fine BA charliedvrs (then an extra arrived via BanditBrewingCo days later...too much). Poured to a pint glass on a dreary, blustery fall evening while listening to some Blind Pilot and others on Pandora..."
12oz can poured into Gulden Draak tulip. Big thanks to SneezyAchew for sending me a couple of these.
"Chilled can into a glass. Courtesy of portia99. Thanks, Bill!"
Can shared by Grant - much obliged!
"Many thanks to my fellow CANQuester (TM), IndiaPaleAle, for this gem. I reached a soft milestone earlier today with The CANQuest's 390th beer plus 10 N2 CANs for a soft total of 400. I am now tracking upward to 400 actual CANs. "
Thanks tonumber1bum for hooking me up with a growler of this one. I had been hoping to give this one a try for quite some time.
A- Cloudy light yellow with a white head. Decent retention and a small amount of lace.
Poured from a can into a pint glass.
Thanks to Deuane for sharing a growler on 11/11/10. 
Picked up a growler at the brewery and had a nice little taste of Wet Willy out of the bright tank to go with it. Poured into a snifter with a cloudy orange and peach look. A bit pumpkin hued and like the setting sun. An eggshell white inch of head forms and fades quickly.
09/20/10- Had a can of this courtesy of pabs311.
Light yellow/orange in color. light white head. Slight lacing.
"Pours a mildly hazy, golden orange with almost a finger of thick, off-white foam."
"Good light yellow appearance, average head, not much lace and cling. Aroma very nice, floral hop feel. Light tropical citrus hop aroma. "
12 fl oz can poured into my pint glass
A: I love the look of this beer. Completely opaque like a good hefeweizen with the same golden hue. Nice head and great lacing.
Poured from a 12oz. can into a Whole Foods 30th Anniversary glass.
Hazy pinkish yellow color resembling a lighter shade of grapefruit juice. Good head retention with sticky lacing. 
Can shared by westcoastbeerlvr. Thanks.
Huge thanks to SneezyAchew for the extra!!
Tried this several times before this review and have loved it. Decided to make it official with a review. 12oz can...
A: Hazy dull gold-yellow in color. Forms a sizable white head that reduces to a thick ring around edge while leaving sheets of lacing on the way down
First tried this beer at a tasting. It was oak aged. I couldn't get enough. Unfortunately that was my first and last time to see the oak aged. 
I got this beer from thebestever. Thanks Allie!
I've been waiting a long time to try this NEBCO beer. Picked up a four pack of 12 oz. cans today and I'm on Gandhi-Bot #2 of the afternoon.
12oz can from a 4-pack poured into a chalice
Thanks to LarryG for this one! Poured from 12oz can into a snifter.
"12oz can poured into a New Belgium Globe. There was some dirt or mold or something on the top of the can. I'm not sure whether to fault the brewers, distributors, or retailers for this, but the product should not be sold in this condition."
Can received as an extra in a trade with a generous BA thanks!
A- Hazy golden wheat in a 12 oz pour with a UBH head.
"Received a 4pack from Knifestyles, thanks Chris. Poured the little peace loving robot into a pint glass:"
12 oz can poured into tulip glass - thanks to phyfe99
Pours a hazy gold with orange tint and a short and disappearing white head. 
"Can shared by Mike, thanks. Beer is yellow and really hazy, almost a wit level of haziness. Head is decent in thickness and made up of medium and small bubbles that leaves some lacing on the glass. I love the logo too, extra points. Head leaves some lacing on the glass."
"Poured from a 12oz can into my pint glass. Sweet. The body is hazy golden color with lots of lively looking carbonation and about a centimeter of creamy white head that leaves sticky lace. The aroma is full of citrus, namely pineapples and orange and a bitter hop aroma to finish. Notes of caramel linger in the behind the citrus and hop aroma. Not quite as juicy as I had pictured this one to be. Actually, relatively dry. I feel misled by the aroma. However, this still taste pretty good. Bitter pine hops bombard my pallet and finish nicely with a decent malt profile and citrus finish. Again, just not what I expected. The mouthfeel is heavy and a bit dry, finishes bitter and slightly syrupy. And as with other recent double IPA experiences, this one hides the alcohol very well. This is one that I truly love, drinkable to no end for me. I'll snag this anytime I see it."
Poured into a tulip. Nice golden hazy color. Monster head on this one as well and leaves behind very sticky lacing. Nice.
"Consumed 10/18/10 received in a trade from zoolzoo, thanks Kevin, been waiting to try this!"
"Poured from a 12 oz can received in a package from kbanks13. Didn't know about this beer before hand, but if I did, it probably would have been a want. "
Big thanks to Masterhomebrewer for this extra!
"Deep, bready, great effervescent mouth feel. Maybe too drinkable for its own good Some piney and floral notes. "
Thanks Allie! This is one of the many beers I received in the Secret Halloween package. I'm really excited to try a DIPA in a can! Poured into my favorite snifter.
Big thanks to BigBalls for the extra. Cheers!
Poured from the can into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Got this in an awesome trade with portia99. Thanks!
Can...extra in a trade but don't remember from who. 
"Generous extra courtesy of jpmclaug. Thank you, Jason."
Hazed amber orange colored with a sizzling white head that settles down to a quarter inch high firm cap. Particulate matter floats around.
On tap at the Alehouse in Amesbury Ma. 
"12oz can into a tulip...Dark gold pout with lots of head that has incredible retention but no lacing at all. the beer itself is not appealing, not drinkable looking...The aroma is light for a dipa but really nice. The almost perfect amount of pine hops and alcohol, not at all strong but gives off what you are looking for in a dipa. Not a ton going on complexity wise, but wets my palate...The taste is a touch down, the hops aren't as smooth comes off a little more harsh. again its a little bit of a one noter. Wish more was going on...The feel is pretty nice very sticky and this is an easy drinker."
Gandhi-Bot Double IPA
"Kegatron sent me more awesome beer, somebody needs to stop him as I am finding it difficult to keep up."
Poured in to my Portsmouth tulip
Poured from a can.
Poured from a can into a DFH snifter glass
"The beer pours out a hazy orangery gold color with a nice head that hung around for a while with good lacing . The nose was excellent. From the moment I poured grapefruit and tropical notes were apparent, some melon notes were mixed in as well. The taste is full of tropical and citrus notes with a clean delicate tropical piney resin on the finish. The malts balance is perfect. Carbonation levels are good. Overall, this is an excellent beer and now my favorite east-coast DIPA over Smutty Big A(still need to make a trek up north to the Alchemist). "
Appearance: Pours a cloudy amber color with a decent head that leaves a few strands behind
Notes from 09/21/10
"Fresh growler from the brewery. Wanted to save and share in a week or two but it tipped over in the car and bumped the door and started spouting foam everywhere, so I didn't want to risk sitting on it and finding it flat. Awesome. Oh well, I'll just have to bear the burden myself."
The new 12 oz. orange can. (I prefer the look of the older silver version though!)
"64oz growler poured into a tumbler. Picked this up at the brewery about an hour ago, so it's about as fresh as it can be!"
Ghandi-Bot may be the best canned beer I've ever had.
Thanks to Knifestyles for this trade. 12oz can poured into Midnight Sun tulip. From notes.
"12oz can, purchased from Grand Vin Wine & Spirits, online."
The new 12oz red can instead of the previous releases plain silver pint can with applied (yet more colorful) sticker.
12 oz can into a tulip glass. Thanks go to Stakem for hooking me up with a 4-pack of these. You da' man Adam! 
"I was pleased that Stakem decided to share this, yet again a beautiful hoppy canned beer -thanks!"
"12 ounce can purchase in a 4 pack, in Cheshire, CT. No canning date/freshness info offered."
"Pours a nice hazy golden carmel orange. Nice one finger head that fades to spotty lacing. Huge hop aroma, piney and citrus. Tastes of carmel then grapefruit, lots of creaminess then a nice hop pucker at the end. Kind of easy drinker for this high ABV. I'd get this again."
Pours an orange/gold color with a slight haze. Ample white head with good lacing on the glass.
"A - this DIPA pours a hazy golden brown/tan, some might call it tawny, the glass is crowned with a thin white that rings the glass, plenty of active carbonation"
"Sampling a growler split with my brother Brian during a recent visit. The beer has been in the growler for a few weeks in the fridge, but still has some pop when opening the swingtop lid."
"Had to call around to several of the best beer stores in the state to track this bad boy down after nearly 2 weeks of searching. And it was worth the wait, for sure. "
My second variety from NEBCO. Poured into a Hoffbrau mug.
Taken from notes.
"A- Pours a hazy, golden orange color with a creamy off white head. Head has good retention and left a good amount of layered lacing. "
"S: Just bought this from Liquor Depot in New Britain,CT. on recommendation from beer guru Brian. Great call! Not much of a can enthusiast, but all I have to say is bravo! "
"12oz can. Pours a hazy orange color with a thin head. Aroma is sweet. Hops, citrus, grapefruit and a fair amount of pine. Taste is somewhat sweet with a bitter aftertaste. More pine with some citrus. The 8.8% ABV is hidden well. I miss drinking an Imperial IPA out of the Tall Boy can but, oh well. Finally it pays to live on the East Coast."
Pours a cloudy pale orange out of the can. Only beer I have poured out of a can with a big bright-white head like this one. Similarity to most canned beers ends here.
A- Pours a hazy orange color with a good amount of white head considering its a growler.
Thank you to JAHMUR for this beer (even if it was dented).
"1st growler from nebco, those guys are alright. Super pumped on this beer. Pours a real lovely opaque golden orange with a nice two finger puffy white head that leaves lots of lacing for a x2ipa. Aroma is just what I was hoping for, tones of hops. Piney, citrusy, and oh man sooo fresh. I'm getting some stone fruit too like apricot. Flavor is first big grapefruit, little apricot, bunch more citrus and then the piney bittering hops take hold of you. Great hop show case. Nice mouthfeel, dense but not overly carbed. Other than the higher abv on this I could drink alot of it."
"THE BOT!!! Would not have thunk soemone could put this much hoppy goodness in a can, but NEB KILLED this. The flavors of wweet floral hops are intense and NOT OVERPOWERED by a dry, almost delicate malt backbone. The nose matches, with all sorts of dankness."
Thanks to Exiled for sharing this beer.
Got this in a box from robwestcott - thanks!
A: Pours a hazy copper color with orange tones. Big frothy head that fades slowly and leaves big clumpy lacing down the glass. 
Thanks goes out to GoGriz for this brew.
Got this from TMoney2591 in the Mathmagic BIF. Thanks!
Big thanks to airohead2001 for hooking me up with this one. How's the slicing and dicing going buddy? Poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter. One of the coolest beer cans I have ever seen.
Sampled from a 16oz can in a standard pint glass. Thanks to LarryG for the trade!
16oz can poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint...
"This is the release I've been waiting for! I'm really loving these big hoppy beers that come in cans. Served this chilled, in an Imperial Pint glass, from a sixteen ounce can. Great label as well. "
"I feel kind of bad. Living literally within a mile of the brewery, we blew through 3 or 4 four-packs of this stuff before we realized what a hot commodity they would become. Ahh well, next time I guess."
"Another canned beer I was excited to try. Loving this new trend. Pours a nice golden, orange-amber color, with a good inch or so of ecru foam. Nice aromas of orange rind, grapefruit and caramel. On the palate, the hop brightness is not quite as pronounced, although it is quite evident in the bitter finish. Not a great DIPA (at least not by west coast standards) but a good one."
a huge thanks goes out to RCL for sending this tallboy of DIPA my way in a recent trade. a seriously top notch extra.
Poura an Orange Marigold color with a light dusting of microscopic white bubbles.
Served in a Dogfish Head snifter.
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass.
"Thanks to Knifestyles for this one. A 16 ounce can poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a hazed honey amber color with about two fingers of off white foam. Nose and flavors consist of white and red grapefruit juice, pith, and peel, bitter lemon and orange, pine, sweet caramel and melon rind aromas, floral pineapple. Amply carbonated with a medium to full body. Finish is dry and bitter with very little alcohol heat. Thanks again Chris!"
16 oz bottle poured into nonic glass. 
Poured from a 16oz can into a 20oz imperial pint. Thanks to Ineedabeerhere for this from our most recent trade!
Thanks to portia99 for this extra!
Pours a beautifully hazy/cloudy light amber color with just a small amount of white foamy head that disappears quickly but leaves behind some nice sticky lacing on the glass.
"Good color, orange, copper with a light brown, dense, one inch head."
"Pinkish, orange color and very cloudy. Thick, tight head which settles very slowly."
"I grabbed the only visible 4 pack out of the cooler of Southington Wine and Spirits. 16 oz. tall boy can with some some weird graphics of a robot Gandhi, I'm sure this is what he would look like if he were a character in Spaceballs. Bootleg label probably won't get my $.05 deposit back..."
Poured from a 16-ounce can into a tulip-shaped Duvel glass.
Poured a cool looking 16oz can into my 20oz glass
Received this brew from BeerTruth not long ago in a trade. Gotta love these 16oz cans that keep everything nice and fresh. Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale flute.
"Another new one for me. I really did not even have this one on my radar, but thanks to a generous trader I was able to enjoy this with dinner last night. Served cold and poured into a pint glass, this one was consumed on 05/14/2010."
pours a slightly hazy orange with a big-bubbled white head that leaves quickly but leaves remnants on the glass.
Thanks to Clownshoesdreams for providing this DPA.
A - A dark brownish gold with a fairly big head that left some scattered lacing after dissipation and throughout the drink.
"Poured from the 16 oz can into a Sam perfect pint. Pours a hazy dark orange with a thin white head. Lots of nice lacing. Lots of citrus on the nose. Really refreshing smell. Taste is clean and bitter. Lots of fruit- orange, grapefruit even a bit of pineapple. Biting, bubbly mouthfeel gives a orange soda feel to it. Nice beer."
Big fan of the 16oz cans. Traditional golden grain color with hues of orange. Thick bubbly head hangs on throught drink. Great artwork on the lable too.
Hazy and dark copper-amber in color with a thick cream colored head of super tightly laced foam that left great lacing at it receded at a slow but steady rate; the head reminds me of an improperly baked cake very slowly losing its leavening. The smell has big notes of grapefruit and citrusy hops. 
Tallboy courtesy of zoolzoo poured into a tulip.
16oz can (first can I've ever encountered with a sticker for the label) poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass.
Thanks to Arenbeer for a great hook-up!
Poured from 16oz can....thanks Luke like usual. Review from notes.
"Great to see more breweries jumping on the 16oz tallboy bandwagon. It's such a great serving size, and I love the convenience afforded when lugging them around. Thanks to thorpe429 for sending this my way."
Poured from a can into a tulip. Huge thanks to 6DaysBottomOcean for possibly my favorite beer label ever.
"I was lucky to stumble across this at a local shop, and decided to give it a try, I found it very interesting that it comes in a can, and an interesting can at that, looks sort of like an energy drink. My first craft beer to be found in a can as opposed to a bottle. Interesting start."
Thanks to woosterbill for sharing a growler of this at DLD and sending me off with some cans for further enjoyment.
"got a growler back in october and was blown away, just picked up a 4 pack of 16 oz cans and once again, am blown away.."
"Gandhi-Bot pours a nice burnt orange color, with a white crown that's small but persistent. It smells incredible, a very nice blend between pine and citrus hops. The taste is a bit of a letdown though, as there's a bit too much generic hop bitterness as opposed to specific hop flavors. The malt is noticeable, but just barely. The beer is adequately carbonated, without being particularly impressive either. I wanted to give drinkability a 3 because of the overly present bitterness to the taste, but NEBC did a great job of hiding the alcohol here so I'll kick it up a little bit. I'm glad I tried it, and both the name and can design are awesome, but there are plenty of IPAs I enjoy more."
Gandhi-Bot pours an opaque copper with a small frothy white head on top. As the foam dissolves a netted pattern of lace clings to the glass.
Got a growler from the brewery.
Got lucky and grabbed a 4 pack before they all sold out in the area. 16oz can poured into my Stone Levitation glass.
"Pours very dark orange. White head starts big but quickly fizzes to pink size, turning to a ring fast as well. A bit soapy looking. Leaves some lacing. Smell is pretty fragrant, lots of earthy hops and pine. Taste is also full of earthy and piny hops, very dank. Some caramel and citrus and warm biscuit in the aftertaste. At first, and take this as you will, it reminds me of Gubna, except much less intense and more drinkable. But some very nice tropical fruit notes seem to take over towards the middle and really gives the taste a huge boost. Nice bitterness too, the 85 IBU's are definitely noticeable. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is high and alcohol is very nicely hidden. Overall a very solid DIPA. I loved the cycle of flavors. I like the 16 oz can too, good serving size for this beer."
"Thanks to the staff at Berman's for putting the last four pack they had of this to the side for me. Color is a dark shade of orange, and has a finger of white heading. The hoppy aroma, is somewhat musty, but with some pineapple and pine in there as well. Taste is all of dank, resiny pine like hops. It also feels like much more than 85 IBUs, but I am not going to complain or judge. Mouthfeel is medium, juicy at first, and ends on a bitter earth note. I will have no trouble finishing off the four pack, so drinkability is good for me. Final thoughts are that this is a hop lovers kind if beer. It drinks like a straight up IPA, with the ABV behind it to make it imperial. This, as well as Wachusett Larry are welcome additions to the New England beer world's list of India Pale Ales."
"16oz. can served at 50 degrees in my DT tulip. Poured a semi-translucent burnt orange with a one inch, creamy white head. Head eventually dissipates into a fairly consistent skim of a cap that coalesces around the shoulders. Delicate, concentric rings of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose expresses sweet grapefruit initially, with a hint of medicinal hoppiness at the back - perhaps a toasted quality in the mix as well. Taste reveals a citrus quality, without the sweetness. Some herbal/medicinal hops bitterness comes out right after the start and carries through to the latter half. Toasted quality also carries over from the nose, with the addition of a hint of caramel, before finally culminating in a lightly lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with an assertive carbonation that falls just shy of prickly and finishes fairly dry. Ghandi-Bot is an exceptional DIPA with a well-hidden abv. My preference for the style tends to migrate more towards the sweeter end of the spectrum, but this is a solid brew. You won't be disappointed."
16oz can into a wine glass. 
"A: Pours a hazy orange with some rising carbonation. Huge head on this one, but the lacing did not stick. Head retention was good."
Big thanks to the guy at New England Beverage who gave me his own can from the fridge when they had none left for sale! 
"Purchased from Redstone Liquors in Stoneham, MA on 4/29/10."
Growler from last weekend. Poured into a pint glass
New England Brewing: Ghandi Bot DIPA (Growler filled 04/24/10) (Tasted 04/26/10)
L: Pours a nice clear orange yellow with a tall and thick off-white colored head that laces the glass a lot as it fades slowly down the glass.
Had this on tap at BA IST and picked up a 4-pack of the 16 oz. cans (best label art on a can).
On tap at BA IST release and at Delaney's
"Pours a hazy golden to copper with orange hues and a thin off white head that quickly subsides but does leave a thin layer atop the beer with thin, yet sticky lacing clinging to the glass."
Poured 16oz can into 21oz snifter. Perfect Fit!
"Pour - light amber or dark golden in color. Thick resiny, sticky foamy head on top that sticks inside the glass like honey on a bear's nose. Looks delicious and the smell that comes from that pour is heavenly."
Picked up two growlers yesterday. 
Got a growler of this from woosterbill. Thanks.
Growler - big thanks to tony (hopstoopid120) for this one.
Growler into a Duvel tulip.
"Picked up a growler at NEBC the other day, and recommend whoever is reading this do the same. This beer is scary good."
A hazy amber with a small ring collar. ( I'm reviewing the appearance from a plastic cup..probably a lot better in glass) 
Had this on cask at Prime 16 tonight. I loved NEBCO's East Coast IPA in the fall and was super excited about the release of this DIPA. Matt from the brewery said he was aiming for a more 'west coast style' dipa and man he wasn't kidding.
"pours out a murky pale yellow-orange color with a pretty dense white head, nice lacing left behind. supppper aromatic, on nose i get peaches, mango, honey, powdered sugar, danky danks, grapefruit, orange, passionfruit lemon, doughy and sweet malts. this is largely followed on palate, huge blast of tropical and herbaceous character, ripe mango, creamy peaches, orange, hint of that bubblegum note, plastic dankness, slightly spicy earthy hops, peppery vegetal thing, some doughy and sweet almost caramel malts, finishes with a mild piney bite. super ripe and fruity, but not one note in the way that some other juicy IPAs are. there is a bit of balance with the green and herbaceous danky quality, blending beautifully with bready malts and fruit smoothie. mouthfeel is medium bodied and has some very fluffy texture to it. HOT DAYUM THIS BEER IS LEGIT AF!!!"
"Pours a super hazy medium pale orange color with a huge frothy head that leaves lacing for days. ARoma is floral and bitter, mild tropical notes - seems like Citra. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with minor bite at the end, nice floral taste. Up and coming brewery!"
"WOW,WOW,WOW!"
"I had this at the brewery on release day so couldn't be fresher. It pours a cloudy orange-copper color with an extensive milk-white head and extensive lacing. It's a really elegant pour. The nose features a plethora of fruit: lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, and ripe melon, along with pine needles and floral hops. The taste is exquisite: the fruit is abundant but there is also a vanilla/caramel sweetness just before the burst of hops at the finish. Everything blends beautifully. This is a nicely carbonated ale and the 8.5% ABV is just right. It's easy to drink but not overwhelming. Overall, this is a delightful and delicious DIPA. I'm really imprssed."
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery into a teku.
S: Mango. Pineapple. Papaya. Bright juicy oranges. Slight stonefruit. Grapefruit pith. Dank nugs. Resin.
This triple dry hopped DIPA delivers one of the best beer experiences I've ever had. Drank it slowly to enjoy the hop partials falling to the bottom of my glass. Monkish strives for perfection with their IPAs. This is proof.
On tap at Omnipollos Hatt in Stockholm.
"Beautiful peach sorbet (albeit a little murky) with small white head. Awesome aroma of mango, pineapple, guava, and citrus. Flavor follows with the addition of a bit of green hop character, grapefruit pith, dank, and a nice bitterness. Great beer."
"A: Pours out murky, turbid, hazy--bright orange driving on lemonade yellow with just the faintest hint of a head. A few tiny bubbles persist to form a ring around the edge of the glass, but whatever semblance of a head formed on the moderately gentle pour dissipates in a matter of moments."
Canned 6/13/17; drank 6/19/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"On tap at Willibrew. Pours a hazy brownish orange with very little head. The nose is a blend of fruits with some dank hops. Passionfruit, guava and some mint. The taste is a good amount of berries along with dank hops and some resin. Resinous finish with a chewy mouthfeel. Medium body with a moderate alcohol presence."
"Incredible beer. Up there with the very best few brews that you can find ANYWHERE in New England. Smells like passion fruit and grapefruit. Incredibly well balanced. There is nothing at all ""off"" in this beer - not too much or too little of anything. It manages to straddle a line between NE Juice Bomb IPA and more (new) traditional piney brews from the likes of NEBCO - not surprising given the head brewer. This is one of the very few beers that I prefer over Tree House beers. I always drink it from a tall pilsner glass because I seem to get more captured in the smell that way. You can read about the color and opacity and head in all the other reviews here. But the bottom line is that this is a masterpiece."
"I really liked this one on tap, reminded me of Locust Reign from NEBCO. Not a juicy or tropical IPA but more dank, resinous, floral, balanced, tons of pith and lupulin. Very interesting beer and I'm glad I got to try it."
tremendous beer. I have had the fortune of tasting all of Counterweights brews and this one surpasses them all to include Space Coyote. This is a delicious beer with a nice amount of alcohol but still very drinkable. The tropics are felt in both the smell and taste. Very well done.
"New England meets the West Coast. Pine, dank, fruity and juicy. Excellent DIPA."
Fantastic new DIPA from Counter Weight brewing. 
L: Copper orange body with very slight bit of chill haze. Full white head with a nice lacing.
"This pours a tan gold. There’s a sticky sweet aroma with tangerine and citrus notes. The beer itself comes off as surprisingly light and approachable, given its strength. I get lots of citrus and some resin. It’s strong but hides it and plays well with others."
"Draft @ Ale Arsenal on 1/9/15. Pours a yellow to amber color with 1 finger of head. Slight lacing. Aroma of pine, resin, citrus, and tropical fruits. Taste is quite dank with plenty of resinous goodness, but also nice balance with notes of citrus and tropical fruits with some malty character and alcohol present. Well balanced and not too boozy for a triple IPA. Solid and very drinkable."
Served in a small glass at the brewery. From notes. Reviewed 20 April 2014.
"A: 4.5 Clear, golden-yellow with a touch of red. Smallish off-white head that lasts about a minute."
"Ok, this is awesome. It pours bright yellowish, amberish orange color. Fairly pale for a DIPA of this strength. Quite cloudy. Medium-small white head. Quite good retention/lacing, which is a bit surprising since this is a big beer poured from a growler. The aroma is simply wonderful. It smells like a tropical fruit salad. Huge, juicy, sweet hoppiness. Very big on pineapple juice, sweet citrus, candied lemon rinds, tangerines, mango, papaya, grapes, strawberry jam, sweet pine. It's just bursting with hops. Little malt character, just some simple pale malt, I guess. Fairly dank, though I'd call it more tropical than dank. No booziness, which is an all too common affliction among &gt;10% abv DIPAs. Taste is similarly great, maybe even better. It's like a mouthful of candied tropical fruit hops. Bitterness is light. Fairly sweet, but it's all hop flavor. Moderate bitterness in the finish. Normally, I'd want a bit more of a bite in the finish to clean things up, but this beer is so rich with hop flavor that it's not necessary. Mild alcohol - considering it's &gt;10% abv, it's impressively subdued. Mouthfeel is light but oily with hop flavor. Ridiculously easy to drink for a beer of this strength. I'm having to force myself to go slowly through the liter. This is the best new DIPA that I've had in a long time."
"Growler from Trey. Thanks, broseph."
64oz growler poured into Duvel tulip. (Triple IPA) 10.8% abv.
Poured from growler into Magnolia Strong Beer Month snifter
"Pours a bright orange with some amber notes, slightly off white head. Nose is all dank hops, big pine and tropical citrus notes as I have come to expect from Cellarmaker. Taste follows the nose with dank, resinous, hoppy, oily goodness coating the mouth. Mouth feel and malt backbone as expected for a triple IPA of this strength. Exceptionally smooth with no perceived boozyness. Right up there with Younger and Hopocalypse except anybody can just mozy into Cellarmaker and grab a goblet of this monster. The best triple IPA. No contest."
S- 1L Growler poured in a pint glass
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazy vibrant orange color with an inch of head. Tons of lacing. Lots of Mosaic in the nose with some light floral and grassy hop notes. The taste is a mix of berries, grapefruit and some dank hops. Slightly floral towards the end with doughy malts and more berries. Maybe a hint of pineapple. Dank finish. Heavy mouthfeel with a dry mouthfeel. Moderate alcohol burn. Supernaut is a great beer and this one only improves it."
a; slight haze; deep gold in color; 1+ finger off white head that receded to a wispy cap; nice lacing;
"Tried this at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Nice light lacing with about one finger of head. Very stong pine and grapefruit aroma with some lemon notes. Taste is the same with some stonefruit. Overall great dipa."
Fantastic! I am a mosaic fan and love Supernaut. This beer is exceptional in every way. Easy to drink with a great nose and super taste. NEBCO always does a great job and this is no exception.
Draft Pour
"A top 3 offering from NEBCO. Perfect integration of the Mosaic hop, combined with an ideal malt presence and tropical flavors. The transition to DIPA went well for Super Supernaut."
Growler poured into fluted snifter.
"A very very clear gold by today's NE IPA standards. A few specks in suspension add some glitter. Holiday berries, winter citrus, and pine aroma...mostly tart with a nuanced sweetness."
A: slightly hazed with powdered top / visible carbonation
Golden orange in color. Fairly hazy. Dank. Citrus for days. Grapefruit pith. Fresh squeezed tangerine. Lime. Nice tingling bitterness. Bright. Dry finish. Superb.
Great beer
Incredible! Was mad it took me over a week to get to it but it was worth the wait! Very similar to Supernaut but the Mosaic hops really punch you much more. Fantastic creation from NEBCO!
"Pours a hazy, deep golden orange color with a large bubbly white head. The head leaves in a hurry but settles into a nice white halo around the top of the beer, leaving just a bit of lacing as it goes."
"here it is... the best beer I have ever had from NEBCO. better than fuzzy.... better than double fuzzy.... they perfectly imperialized Supernaut. cloudy as hell (but not hazy), golden orange. same smell and taste profile as Supernaut, but way bigger. so much mosaic without getting into the onion-zone, this is the perfect example of a single hop mosaic beer. I hope they brew this often, grab it while you can."
"appearance- Orange amber in color, cloudy, and pours a one inch head."
Shimmering Jurassic Park amber with an airy white foam settling to a creamy white ring.
"Had a couple of pints of this at the local pub. Yellowish orange in color with very good clarity. Poured with a thin, bright white, soapy foam with low medium retention. Medium high citrus and orange hop aromas with reinous and fresh floral notes. Medium light malt aroma. Medium bodied and smooth with pleasant warmth from the middle to the end. Medium high citrus and floral hop flavors with earthy, resinous notes up front followed by assertive hop bitterness through the middle. Malt and caramel malt flavors manage to peek through on the back end. Finished with pleasant warmth and pine hop bitterness that didn't linger. Despite the assertive bitterness this was very drinkable. Still a bit of a sipper but it didn't annihilate the palate."
Poured from a growler (keg kicked while filling) into a pint glass
It's good. But honestly head hunter is still better.
"got it in a trade. very good and rounded DIPA but for me it was too sharp and sweet. however, i would order it again if i saw it!"
From a growler 
Had on Tab at the brewery. I love aggressive IPAs and this is one. Great color and aroma. A great sipper to enjoy all the complex flavors and happiness this brew has to offer.
Ibusive
More floral than I remember last year
This beer makes me respect bitter beers.
"Description: Golden and mostly clear with maybe a touch of cloudiness. Only about half a finger of head, but for and IPA it should surprising head retention. Smell was fruity up front, with mango, orange and pineapple with a little bit of pine on the back. Taste was similar to the smell but...MORE. Tropical fruit on the front with a clean, bitter, pine finish. Everything was very nicely balanced. Feel was standard IPA medium body and medium carbonation."
"Draft at Lackman in Cincinatti, OH."
"Pours a copper gold without much of a head. Smell is pretty sweet & tropical - lots of citra - and reminded me a bit of Hop JuJu. Taste is what you'd imagine - grapefruit juice, some pine & a little burnt sugar - but it wasn't too abrasive with the bitterness. It struggles to stand out - even against fat head's other impressive IPAs - but it's still a very good beer."
"On tap at Wine Spot, Cleveland Heights. $18 for a 64oz growler; $1 more then the brewery price."
On tap
"IPA pine water. Lots of grapefruit, biscuity sweetness, medium bitterness. Leans a bit juicy, some herbs and chive. Smooth brew for sure, although not as strong as some of the other IPAs I had at the brewery."
"Went to the PDX taproom looking for a growler of Semper FiPA, or Head Hunter as a 2nd choice....neither one of 'em available, and not even in the 'on deck' list. Seriously ?! Ended up getting this...."
Fat Head’s IBUsive
On tap at the Portland brewpub. 
"Poured into an IPA glass from a day old growler. Appears a dark orange color with a fluffy off white head that has good staying power. The nose is absolutely awesome here. Loads of pine, citrus, tropical fruit and is beautifully complex. The taste follows suit with just the right amount of malt to support the load of hops. Again, the grapefruit, orange, resinous pine. Overall, it's a great DIPA that I wish I had more access to."
"While a pretty tasty beer, I thought a bit more citrus to counter the pine and dry tropical (on the nose and palate) would ne nice. Also, while this was a very nice IPA/DIPA, it seemed very similar to head shrinker, head hunter, and some of the other FH IPA's/DIPA's I've had. While not a bad thing, it would nice if they mixed things up a bit (IMHO)."
On tap at Fat Head's in PDX. Piney grapefruity goodness. Incredibly well balanced with hops taking the front seat. I wish all DIPAs tasted like this. Beautiful.
"Pint at Portland OR location... A killer IPA, great to see them throw down in Portland."
On tap at Belmont Station. 
My first full 5 review! An outstanding beer.
Appearance: A clear golden Orange color with a finger of off white head
"Fresh growler in the mail today from Joe. Thanks buddy. Pours beautiful clear golden colored with a big creamy white head. Lots of citrus on the aroma, some onionyness, pine, just fresh hop leaves all around, and some sweet honey maltiness. Very aromatic. Flavor follows closely with the aroma with lots of citrus and pine, floral notes, some onion notes, lemon peel, dry bitter finish. Really nice. A lot of flavor coming from this at only 7.5%. Medium bodied, very slick and dank, with a dry finish. Good stuff. These guys know how to do their hops."
One of top 2 favorites. 
"Growler from the source, which I brought to share at Pin's. Thanks to Tony for the hook-up!"
Grabbed a growler of this while picking up a couple 4-packs of JuJu. Both are great. Trying to decide which one is better. 
"Catching up on reviews from September. This was freshly released at the Pitt location, served on tap in a snifter. The brew appears a polished clear golden orange with a white cap. Some stringy lace sticks to the glass."
"On draft at Three Floyds, served in a tulip."
Thanks to Wowcoolman/AndrewK/drewone for sharing this one at GRG1313's tasting. 
"Pours a perfectly clear, bright copper color. Smells like citrus and other tropical fruits like mango and papaya. In the taste, citrus and pine and a honeyed malt character. Medium bodied ale with a good level of carbonation. Overall this is a damn fine IPA. I would love to get this in six packs."
"On-tap at Fat Head's in N. Olmsted, Ohio"
"On-tap at the Fat Head's Pittsburgh location, served in a typical British-style pint glass, drank 4/9/13 over one hour."
"On Tap at North Olmsted Fat Heads., 7.5% ABV 90 IBU:"
"Nice, slightly bitter taste. Grapefruit rind is close approximation of the flavor. Not much smell, but I'll take taste over smell any day. Surprisingly light (not filling) for a DIPA."
Canned 10/31/18
"Picked-up 6 cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton this past Saturday. Canned-on date of 10/31/18. My 24th brew reviewed from these guys. Very solid, not mind-blowing, middle of the pack of TH for me."
16-oz can 10/31/18 poured slowly into a 20-oz. mug produced a finger sized fizzy and foamy white head with short retention and minimal lacing.
Solid beer. Pour is hazy orange. Taste is combination of both bitter and sweet. Citrus smell with pleasant mustiness. Overall very smooth with solid balance and feel.
Bright pours a murky dark golden color with a thick and foamy complex head. The smell is dank with a grassy note and over ripened fruit. Big citrus flavors including grapefruit and tangerine with a floral component. The taste hits with a bitter hoppiness but quickly balanced out with sweet fruits such as grapefruit and pineapple coupled with a light malt bill. Overall it's a solid DIPA with a medium body and big resinous mouth feeel.
Canned 1/30/18 - Opened 9/18/18 & 10/18
Pour a nice hazy yellow. Very nice lookin beer. 
"Hazy, pale orange color with a finger of foamy head. Smells dank with weedy, grassy, overripe papaya, and citrus rind aromas. Flavors of bitter grapefruit rind, papaya, citrus juice, and subtle spice with just the right amount of hop bitterness. Has a medium body feel with nice carbonation. A little heat lingers in the finish."
"Pours translucent gold minimal head to a nonic, from a dated 8/13/18"
Poured from a 16 ounce can into an IPA glass. Purchased 3 weeks ago at the brewery.
Canned 7/31/18
"Nice IPS from Tree House. I picked up two cans and enjoyed the first one and will drink the second this weekend. Nice citrus flavor, gray aroma. Not as good as Hazy which I got at the same time but still fantastic."
"Don't love the base version of this beer. Maybe it's because I don't love Mosaic hops. However, the versions I have had have not been dense, juicy, hazy, or anything that resembles a NE style IPA. I've heard the variants are good, but don't like this one. Tried multiple times."
L: silver can
"this is really great beer, one of the better hazy ipa types i have ever had really, and honestly the difference isnt really the hops, everyone can dry hop a beer with some sexy variety or two and make it smell and taste good, thats not unique to tree house at all, its the grain that sets this apart for me, its not just starchy and heavy for the sake of being cloudy which sometimes feels like is the case with these, its soft and round and fluffy and so smooth, almost creamy, an incredible texture for a hoppy beer, wheaty and oaty probably, proteins and richness without sweetness or heaviness, its really just right for the fruity hops, they arent just in the finish, its like the grain lets the hops go deeper, start earlier, and last longer. white grape, pineapple, melon, and grapefruit notes to this, super fresh, and with just enough bitterness to balance the sweet oiliness of the hops too. carbonation is magnificent, lifting up the fuller body and making sure this never seems heavy. i know there is a ton of hype with the tree house beers, but i can see why after this one, its brilliantly put together and so much more refined and high quality to me than almost anything else out there in this style!"
"A: The beer is slightly hazy yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high bright white head that gradually died down, leaving a thick layer of bubbles covering the surface, a narrow collar around the edge, and some lacing down the sides of the glass."
Can date 5/22/18
Low rating cause I had a weird reaction to Bright. Heartburn issues. Ill have to get another and re try.
"The base beers that treehouse makes are obviously superior, because this offering on it's own is phenomenal. I rate beers on the experience, this beer provides an exceptional experience, deep layered flavors, soft creamy mouthfeel, it's not my go to treehouse, still somehow....a taste bud shattering beer. WOW."
Mmmm crisp and hop happiness
"Pours light amber, minimal white head. Lots of bitter citrus aroma: lemon, grapefruit, pineapple. Loads of lemon zest up front, semi sweet, not enough malt for my liking. Hoppy bitter finish."
"Read the description before actually taking a sip and got a bit worried as I am not a huge Mosaic fan and feel it can be overpowering. However, this is wonderfully balanced. Absolutely one of the best doubles out there."
"A: A beautiful yellow gold with 1/2 inch foam head. As expected, cloudy."
I keep going back to this one and it is becoming one of my favorite Tree House beers. Very hoppy forward mosaic hops with a smooth finish. Can’t stop smelling it though!
Canned on 1/09/18. Consumed on 2/19/18. Blitz for Six!
"Bright is a beer that I haven't attempted to trade for, simply because it doesn't come up in conversation like Julius, Green, or Alter Ego, etc. But I found myself drinking one last night, and I surely was not disappointed."
"Such a clean DIPA without the haze craze. Hoppy, citrusy with tangerine, grapefruit notes. Mellowing out to some mango notes but hoppy. Clear, nice white bready head. Must try!"
"Overall this is a very good beer from Tree House, just not what I was expecting given the hype. Pale in color, clear, and mostly thin given the big ABV. Good beer but I don't quite understand the demand for Bright."
Holy freaking mosaic.
"Pint can. 1/9/18 ""Blitz for six"" opened on 1/15/18"
"Golden and softly hazy, topped with 3 fingers of yellowish head. No visible carbonation. "
Serving: Can
Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.
"Pours... not particularly bright. God I am a moron. It's a darker yellow, super thick and hazy with a decent white head. "
4th can of six from one of the last releases.
"Pours clean golden yellow with a nice pillowy head and great lacing. The bottom of the can adds some swirly murky yeast. Not the prettiest-looking beer. Some alcohol heat is (surprisingly) detectable. Somewhat juicy but not nearly as good as other TH beers, IMO."
"NOT a NEIPA, but instead more like an unfiltered super juicy, super fruity, slightly bittered, nicely malted balanced heavy IPA/light DIPA at 7.8%. Really enjoyed this one."
"Nice color with minimum head, great nose citrus, pineapple and sweet orange.... great mouth feel, not heavy at all ...very smooth going down and almost no aftertaste .... as usual another great tree beer ...easily drink 6 of them"
"Double IPA, from the can...hazy golden straw with thick head. Citrusy smell. Dry and sweet taste with hints of grapefruit, orange and pine. A little more bitter on the end. Very good."
16oz can poured into a snifter.
Definitely tastes like orange juice. Not sure I get the fascination with juice over classic hop bitterness though.
16 oz can dated 9/12/17 (2 weeks old) gifted by a friend (thanks!)
16oz can dated 9/12/17.
"16Oz can stamped 9/12 purchased at the brewery and poured into a TH Tulip. Our first experience with a TH beer and we can't wait for the next one. A light orange color and citrus nose is followed by complex flavors that include orange, lemon and grapefruit. Extremely easy drinking, flavorful and refreshing with a touch of grapefruit bitterness on the finish making you want more."
Sampling a cold can poured into a snifter. Got in a trade a little bit ago.The beer pours a bright gold color and is fairly hazy in the glass. A firm eggshell white head of 2 cm foams up even with a gentle pour and several aspiring bubbles cling to the sides of my glass. The foam fades to a sturdy surface layer and leaves dense clingy lattice on the glass sides.
Mosaic all over. I can appreciate the bubblegummy flavor from the typical Tree House yeast. This rates a little lower than most of their offerings but it's still miles ahead of anything else in the market.
Can stamped 08/08/17
"Dank smell. Orange, tangerine, yellow peach and orange zest. Citrus forward. Cracker/biscuit malt. Light bodied. Creamy feel. Zesty. Nicely balanced. Good stuff."
Relatively one dimensional for a Tree House beer. Not super hazy really with a pretty nice classic mosaic hop aroma and yellowish color. Mouthfeel is not quite as thick as many TH beers. Overall still very nice.
"Bright, less hazy than other beers that I have had from them. Heavy citrus nose with a bit of tropical fruit and hops. Taste is citrusy grapefruit, lemon, and tangerine along with some papaya and pear. Feel is more carbonated than their other offerings and a touch thinner. Overall, a solid offering but lacks behind some of their other beers."
"Bottom of can say Dank Sauce and it lives up to the billing. As with all TH offerings, it has a background of peaches and perhaps some light mango. Dank beyond belief and truly an underrated tree house offering."
"Can, 8/8/17"
"Pours a hazy golden. Mango and sugar cane aroma on the nose. It's got a lot of raw sugar cane with a touch of unripe mango before giving way to some DANK SAUCE. It has a touch more bitterness than most Tree House beers, which tend to minimize that aspect all together. However, it's got enough of a rounded mouthfeel that gives it a bit of chewiness to go along with an overall more complex presentation of the well rounded DIPAs that the now Charlton brewery is known for. If you couldn't tell from my overall tone, I like Bright a lot."
"P- Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City spiegelau IPA glass.Date on the can is 08/08/17 DANK SAUCE."
"This one pours way less hazy than most Tree House slurry cans, it's almost fully clear, dark orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
Tree House - Bright DIPA
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 7/13/2017. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy medium golden/yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, biscuit, bread dough, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, biscuit, bread dough, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Minimal pine, herbal, grassy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, biscuit, bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Very slight dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol for 7.8%. Overall this is an amazing DIPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth, clean, and refreshing to drink for the ABV, with the very minimally bitter/drying finish. Super vibrant, juicy, and lightly dank hops; perfectly balanced malts, without being overly sweet/heavy feeling. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Canned 07/13/17, it pours cloudy gold color with a solid 2 finger bright white colored head that was full of bubbles, fading very, very slowly and leaving excellent foamy lacing and foam rings as it went down."
"Great, but nowhere near the quality of some of the other Tree House DIPAs (e.g. Haze and Doppelganger). The pour and nose are very akin to Haze, but the palate is more subdued, and the mouthfeel less thick. It's an NEIPA-light, but delicious nonetheless."
"My tastes diverge somewhat from the typical Tree House fan. Along with Alter Ego, Bright is viewed as a ""lesser"" beer in their amazing stable. I disagree. So smooth with fruity deliciousness, without a hint of the booziness that can creep into a double IPA. Of all the Tree House beers I've tasted, only Juice Machine stands head and shoulders above Bright."
"tangerine, pine, great carbonation, a bit of bitterness and malt on finish. Smooths out after a few sips when carbonation dissipates - great feel too."
Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine #120
"Received this from nephew in NH. This is what a NE style IPA is all about. Hazy, juicy yet very balanced for a double IPA. I loved this beer! Got 3 cans, drank 1 first night with wife, shared 2nd one with my local Taphouse guy, who really enjoyed it. Drinking #3 in 2 days with a real beer nerd."
"Sample from some generous soul at last nights meeting, thanks for the opportunity! Hazy deep yellow with a bubbly white head. Flavor and aroma are dominated by tropical fruity citrus and light earthy pine. Sweet bready malt plays a supporting role. Pretty tasty beer."
"The first 12 ounces out of the can into the glass pour a nearly clear (just a tinge of fog) yellow with a finger and a half of white foamy head. Pouring the final ounces of the can into the glass gives turns it into a hazy, orange glow. Head retention is good, with great lacing left behind. Aroma is a surprisingly delicate bouquet of hops - citrus, orange, lemongrass, and flower. Flavor profile is decidedly more robust, with notes of resin, citrus, lemongrass, and flower. Citrus and orange make an appearance when the final ounces of the can are poured into the glass. The resin hop quality really sticks to the palate, and refrains from being overly bitter or commanding. Mouth feel is smooth, with a fine, velvety texture. Bright has a medium thickness. Overall, a pleasant DIPA that doesn't just smack the tongue with hops, hops, and more hops. While it is hoppy, the hops remain well balanced and thought-out. There is a hint of bitterness, keeping it from being thrown down in a matter of minutes, which is perhaps for the best with a 7.8% ABV."
"Yet another wonderful offering from the good people of Treehouse. This can made its way all the way back to Oregon, and it was worth the trip."
"Canned 5/18/17Pours hazy orange with big fluffy white head that fades slowly. Awesome lacing. Aroma of grapefruit, mosaic and tangerine. Taste orange, mango, lemon zest, peach, mosaic, light honey with grassy citrus finish. Very strong dipa. Big fan of treehouse."
"easily one of the coolest labels in my opinion, but the beer is just super solid, nothing crazy, nothing special. lots of local breweries making beer of similar quality."
Beautiful color and feel. An explosion of citrus. Perfect for a day on the porch
"A: One of the ""Brighter"" colored / less hazy DIPA's from Tree House. three finger thick head, sticky lacing to boot and not as milky looking as some of the others out of this brewery. "
Another juicy - uber tasty DIPA from Treehouse. I feel lucky to be close enough to take the drive to the brewery every few months. So full of flavor and drinkable. Excellent beer
Bright and Bright with Citra perhaps TH most underrated beers. Not saying either is going to kick any of the big TH dogs off the porch but that sweet nose and soft mouthfeel is still an absolute treat. 
Pours a vibrant matte yellow. Completely opaque but mildly hazy in appearance. Frothy white head dissipates leaving lots of sticky white lacing but no residual head. 
"The beer pours like golden hazy lemonade with a thin head. Smell is OK, honey and light floral notes. Taste is an easy 10. Lemon rind with grapefruit and floral sweetness."
"Poured from a pint can dated 2/2/17 provided by the generous jzeilinger. The beers pours an opaque orangish-amber color with a small, thin white head the quickly dissipated and left some moderate lacing. The smell is incredible bright hops - orange, grapefruit, and some lemon. The taste follows with a nice, slightly bitter hoppiness that showcases citrus fruit, although slightly less than what I expected from the nose. The mouthfeel is medium carbonation and slightly thin and oily. Overall, this is excellent with great, bright hops. I'd love to try it at the source."
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass (1 month old). Appearance is hazy orange/light brown in color with one finger thick head. Smell is strong earthy hops with mostly grapefruit coming through. Taste follows the nose with relatively low sweetness (some honey) and low bitterness. Some wheat flavor is noticeable throughout. Mouthfeel is extremely soft and creamy with just enough carbonation. 
"Mosaic hops all up front, some dank fruit but no melon and not juicy. Light in the back of the tongue. Yummee"
"16oz can, served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Pours a overly clear golden orange body, with a yellow hue, one finger thick white head, good retention, bits of lacing stubbornly persist. Smell is a rich mosaic hop aroma; citrus, resin, grapefruit and a mild sweet estery aroma that is classic mosaic. Mild-moderate caramel sweetness sits in the back. Wonderful. Flavour follows; heavy mosaic character with more sweetness backing it up. Caramel and a little bit of grainy barley balances out the heavy grapefruit and pine resin character from the mosaic. Minerality, touch of sweet esters, moderate bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, creamy with a nice resinous pine on the backend, not too bitter and still honoring the New England hop style. Very damn tasty double IPA with a lot of resin and dank on it."
Date on this is 02/02/17
"Wow, what a beer. Mine was canned on 02/02/17 and drank on 02/16/2017, so REALLY fresh."
Canned 2/2/17; drank 2/10/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"First had 9/27/16 at home. Acquired on trade. Got a chance to stop in at the brewery on my trip to EBF. The beer is dry, soft, and pungent. Not my favorite by any means from them, but still a super solid offering."
Poured from a 16 oz can brewed on 1-5-17 into a tulip glass.
"The aroma is fantastic on this... smells like generic berry cereal if that makes any sense with some citrus notes. Taste and feel are clean and smooth, not what you'd expect from tree house due to the different yeast, but really well executed and a nice change of pace. Glad they have this in the rotation and that I was able to try it."
Poured from pint can into chilled pint glass.
Nice light golden color with a very citrus smell. Drinks very smooth with fruity upfront but some bitterness at the end. This beer is descent if somewhat unspectacular.
I thought this beer was very good. Not great. I thought it lacked the usual in your face floral and fruity aroma and taste of most other DIPAs. Also lacked the juiciness. Dont get me wrong its very good but not my favorite treehouse.
Gorgeous bright golden with a massive creamy head and a lace that trails to the last drop.
"Canned 2 weeks ago and poured into a tulip. This one is much clearer than most of the other TH brews. Big head and lots of citrus on the nose. The dank, citrus taste follows the nose. The mouthfeel is warm and solid. The finish is dry and slighter bitter, but is clean. This is well-made, but not a favorite when compared to other TH beers."
Not my favorite at all. 
Such a change of pace from the standard line up of IPAs from Tree House.
"Poured into a snifter. Canned 15 days ago. A moderately hazy golden color - not turbid like their other IPAs - and with a fluffy white head. Bright aromas out of the can on the pour: blueberries, oranges, and resin. The taste follows closely, with berries, citrus, dank earthy notes, and an understated bready malt. Clean finish. Moderately bitter. Another stellar beer."
Growler filled from a batch 1 day old. 
From a growler 2 days old
Much brighter than most TH hoppy offerings. Golden yellow with very light haze. Nice white head. Bursts with sweet citrus. Definite orange rind coming through. Bit of grapefruit and dankness.
"Might be my favorite Tree House brew. I've been lucky to have a few different batches. I find it overall the most balanced Tree House offering, with a clear hoppy backbone and fruity notes that I can pick out easily. Color is beautiful ambergold haze, subdued head, and invitingly clear citrus aroma. Taste is initially loud & clear soaking of juicy hop – I can more easily define the slight bitter underlayer from fruity top notes that pop out quickly. It's like there's less white-noise in the mix. Finish lingers in an enjoyable hopfruity blend. Overall super smooth and dignified, like an abstract painting you actually want to look at."
"Dark orange, big white head and beautiful lacing. Aromas are soft, some hoppy citrus notes. Notes of grapefruits run in a blender whole, dank, citrus salad. Medium body, crushable, clean and slightly dry. This is a good DIPA but not their best and I don't get the big hype on this."
16oz can in an IPA glass. Very fresh.
"This is one of the cleaner tree house beers. Golden in color. Light , Crisp and more lemony than there other offering. Bitter/Sweet finish. Not a very complex beer in comparison to there others but really good."
Poured from a 16oz can
The best mouthfeel in a DIPA I have ever encountered. Nails the candies orange and citrus rind flavor that I love so much. Drinking great even with nearly a month on it.
Cloudy golden orange in the glass but not as turbid as other brews. The smell is dank citrus with notes of orange and lemon. The taste is more melon and stone fruit than citrus. Kind of light in flavor. The feel is also a tad light but still pleasant. Overall a really good but not truly special like the other brews from this brewery.
"Pours a lightly hazy (wtf Tree House) golden color with 2 fingers of soapy white head. The head has excellent retention, leaving lacing for years as it settles into a creamy film. Beautiful looking beer."
"Ok, I really liked this one. I enjoyed it much more than Green. This is a citrusy slam dunk in my books and is one of my favorites alongside some of the greats. It is juicy, hoppy, sweet and bitter all at the same time. Some good shit."
"Slightly hazy golden color with white head, really different from the other Tree House IPAs. Aroma has a very classic profile, somewhere in the West Coast style. Solid malt base with some earthy, citrusy hops and a slight cooked vegetable note. Taste starts with a very balanced profile with a solid malt backbone and lots of earthy/resiny hops. Quite sweet at first but hops kick in towards the finish with a medium, earthy bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. An interesting departure from what I am used to get from Tree House."
Great all around DIPA. Had Julius last night and this is not as good. But still great. Nice head that stays. Grapefruit notes in the nose and a slightly bitter lingering aftertaste.
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Nonic glass. Can date illegibly stamped, but it was sometime in September 2016."
"Poured from the 750mL growler into a snifter glass last night, growler was purchased on 10/15 and kept in the fridge for 4 days. Comes out a bit hazy, but somewhat clear, golden liquid capped by a two finger solid head, some lacing spots."
Another great brew from Tree House.
"huge thanks to rowmark for the can kick down for the tick. canned 10/13, 3 days ago. fairly vegetal, very clean...has a juicy rind to it, somewhat earthy, esp for a tree house ipa. good brew but not a highlight from the tree house catalog. extremely drinkable."
Drank from a 1 pint can
"I've had a dozen Tree House PA/IPA/DIPAs and this one is by far the biggest departure from the norm. Not hazy, more clear or slightly cloudy amber appearance. The smell is of bitter citrus and grapefruit notes. Taste is clementines, pineapple and general dank citrus. Some resin is also noticeable. Taste is more bitter than usual TH beers also. Just very different (not bad)."
"An unexpected semi-clear gold, with a large foamy head and nice thin walls of lace. It does haze out a bit once you pour out the full can."
"Drop the mic. This is the most world class appearance i've ever seen in a beer. Want the head taller? Just keep pouring and watch that tower grow past the ridgeline. I got it looking like Fresh Prince meets a can of shaving cream. The opacity is glorious. 100%, but mango hues just conquer the whole thing. Again, drop the mic."
"I had this beer from a 2L growler after my visit to Treehouse. Really good DIPA. One of the top DIPAs I've had this year, but not exactly the best that I'll be craving in the near distance future."
"This beer was brewed to highlight the hop flavors of Mosaic. There is a lot of intense fruit, but an underlying bitterness not always evident in their other offerings. I actually like this beer more than several of their other beers. It's not quite as cloudy or dense looking, the head isn't as thick, and the mouthfeel is a little thinner. It could be a little more carbonated for my taste, but if I come across it again, I wouldn't mind having it."
"Finally got to try this. Poured a light orange with a thin head, even with an agro-pour. Less cloudy in appearance than other offerings from TH, like Haze. Not picking much up on aroma, but allergies are kicking. Tastes is stupendous. Mosaic flavor really shines through, dank and citrus. For a thin looking beer, the feel is refreshingly silky, tingly and smooth. Another outstanding DIPA."
"16oz can, poured into a Tree House Teku Glass. Enjoyed on 8.17.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
1 PINT can
Another very solid hoppy offering from Treehouse. Although this is tasty this isnt even close to their best work. I tried both the standard version and the Nelson version of this and although it as a refreshing crushable beer they and other local breweries make better.
"Pours clear, bright gold in color with one inch head. Taste is big lime, grass, lemon, and light sweet pineapple juice at the end. Sweeter and more subtle than most of the other Tree House IPAs I have had. Dank, medium bodied, and not as juicy as some of Tree House’s other beers. Still a real treat. I would put this behind only Haze, Julius, and Green of Tree House’s IPAs."
One of the best Double IPAs I have had. A great showcase for Mosaic hops.
Appearance: Pours a relatively clear honey color with a two finger head; squiggles of lacing abound
"Poured from a tallboy into a stemmed goblet, the beer is a hazed, golden orange coloring, with a filmy, clingy, white head. Beautiful. The nose is pepper spiced and dried grass overlaying juicy aromas of tropical fruit and citrus. Mouth watering nose. Holy hell. Flavors are slightly roasted forward, followed immediately by a blast of juicy, mouth watering tropical fruits, including mango, papaya, and melon, with some kiwi, grapefruit, and lemon zest. The hops profiles come strong next, heavy on dried grass, pine tassel, and pine pitch. Perfectly balanced on a full, juicy body. The aftertaste is a solid blend of the sticky and dank hops with the juicy tropical fruit salad. Slick, oily, dry, slightly astringent finish. Really, truly, amazing beer!"
6-23-16 on the bottom of the 16 oz can
"UPDATED: Canned 7/14, consumed 7/27."
TREE HOUSE BRIGHT 7/7/16
"Traded for this a while back in New York, so long ago that the date on the bottom of the can read 2/19. While I knew that this wasn't the freshest beer that I've had as of late, this didn't quite live up to the hype that many of the previous reviewers on here gave it. This was quite juicy and true to name but there was a wee bit too much of the citrus and sharpness here for me to fully enjoy. That being said, this still didn't last very long in my pint glass!"
Nice tropical fruit nose. Mango smoothie. Pineapple. Guava. Balanced profile as you get some of the fruit juice on the front end wit the finish being bitter and a tad boozy. Light body which could explain how the alcohol level is shining through despite only being 7.8%.
"Very bright orange body with only a slight haze, not the super-turbid body that most Tree House IPAs have. Sticky, soapy bone-white head sits on top. Aroma is citrusy and tropical; tangerine, mango, guava and some fresh grass. Flavor is very juicy with lots of citrus and fruity hops. Again, lots of tangerine, some mango, really fresh and juicy. Feel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, slightly sticky lingering aftertaste. Another world-class offering from Tree House, this one is a huge, juicy, amazing hoppy brew."
"I was able to just simply luck out on my first and only trip to TH. The had Bright and Jjjuliuss (released in cans for the first time) as well as Julius and Haze on draft. I have no idea how many geeks that they served at TH that afternoon but I was almost out the pond at the end of the line at 5:10. When I left at 6:30 the line was STILL out to the pond. Hill Farmstead is a different kind of place then TH and I've been to both now and have been blessed to say that I've enjoyed both experiencses and some amazing freekin' beer. Bright, Julius, Jjjulliuss, and Julius are about as enjoyable to drink as any beers I've ever had and that includes some amazing beers from some of my two home state breweries in Maine and Florida."
"Can dated June 23 obtained in MBC dinner line trade. Thanks, guy in the green sweatshirt! Shared and poured into ale glass that night. Unfortunately, this was after sharing 4 other beers, so ounces 33-40 when you're dead tired may result in a less than optimal review."
Two week old bright. Can into a Hill Farmstead stem
"This cannot be true. The beer is filtered and therefore crystal clear, showcasing a big, froth head."
"I found this beer to have the classic Treehouse taste but without the great mouthfeel and the heavy juiciness of their other classics. The taste I'm referring to is a sort of sweet, floral musk that I can best describe as being closest to the flavor of a very ripe banana. So far, of the many IPAs I've tried around the NorthEast, I find Treehouse and Astoria Queens brewers Single Cut Beersmiths to be the two producers that share this taste profile. I'm not sure what it is in the brewing process that achieves this, but it is a distinct flavor that is independent of the ""juiciness"" of the beer. It's also present in all of the Treehouse (and Single Cut IPAs) regardless of the different hop profiles of the beers, which leads me to believe that this flavor has more to do with the yeast, perhaps, or HOW and when the hops are added (dry hopped, late etc.) and not the actual type of hops being used. But I digress. "
"A:Very clear (for tree house standards) and brightly reflective, solid gold. Creamy off-white head. "
"This is unique for tree house! Crystal clear and very clean tasting. The nose is lacking but the taste is bright crisp and clean. Not as juicy as what you normally get from tree house but I'm impressed they were able to make a crisp, clean, but still juicy hop bomb. Mouth feel is nice, a little heavy on the carbonation but not overly so. Overall, this is a very enjoyable IPA"
"A very nice IPA from Tree House. Born on 6/9/16 (R.I.P. G.O.A.T.) and today is 6/13. Poured a cloudy, pale yellow producing a 2-finger bubbly (almost foamy) head that dissipates leaving nice lacing on the glass. Nose of all the citrus - lemon, grapefruit, orange - and some mild tropical notes. Initial taste is citrus with a malty punch that leaves a mildly bitter hoppy aftertaste. Well balanced mouthfeel starting light and mild. progressing through the middle of the palate into a great, hoppy feel."
"This beer pours a nice clear yellow with plenty of white fluffy head and lacing. The beer has plenty of citrus. Lemon, orange and some grapefruit. The taste is much of the same. Fruity citrus flavor with some orange and grapefruit and a touch of maltiness. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side but very nice for the type and flavor of this beer. Overall the was a very good beer. Not my favorite of the Tree House offerings but it is still better than many breweries IPAs."
"Consumed at a share on 6/5/16. Big thanks to Natalie for bringing some great Tree House beers! Pours a orange/yellow. Not too much citrus on the nose, but the taste is where this beer shines. Very citrus forward, very close to orange juice in my opinion. Finishes in typical DIPA fashion, with a bitter kiss. Great beer."
"This is definitely my least favorite TH Beer to date. It looks good and smells tropical with lemon and grapefruit. The taste is where it really misses for me. It starts with a little sweet malt and some mosaic tropical taste, but then it hits you with a very unpleasant bitterness with an edge that lingers in the aftertaste. My palette is just not liking it and I like bitter IPAs. Maybe I'm alone on this one, but I believe that if a noname brewery put this beer out, it would be quickly discarded as nothing special and not a 4.4 out of 5 which makes it world class. Really?"
A: Wow! A filtered IPA from TH...wasn't expecting that. Straw/pale gold with ample fluffy head. 
Not sure why it's considered a DIPA... But great flavors... Perfect haze... Just a flat out solid beer from an amazing brewery.
Can thanks to yourefragile. Thanks Michael.
"Fancy artwork on the can, paired this beer on my birthday with Seafood which I thought would have thrown the taste of the beer off but was still perfect. Not as hazy as most tree house beers, I tasted more lemon then the orange. In such a rush to try the beer It went to fast to notice the lacing or anything else"
"A - nice golden completely clear color at first which became hazy when I poured the rest of the can in, nice white head that leaves nice lacing"
"Masterful at big hoppy beer, Mad Tree brewers roll out with another massive hop taste- one that's radiant with citrus and sharply bitter for a taste that's nothing other than ""bright""."
"Thanks to one of the most generous local beer fellows I know, Buneulian, because evidently he has more kindness than sense. Big 16 oz. can with Woodstock label slapped on a silver can. "
Thanks to JLindros for sharing.
"Pours a big foamy creamy head that fades semi slowly tons of soapy lacing, semi hazy golden tan orange color."
"16oz can split last week, reviewed from brief notes. Thanks to Leah and Penny for the share."
"canned 0n 04/28 pours a slight hazy lemon color with a white head, smells of citrus ,floral hops , taste is superb low bitterness with a smooth assault of tropical and citrus hops, they are in charge a kiss of malts , smooth mouth feel low bitterness juicy hops, delicious, very little bitterness, very tasty."
Had from a two day old can obtained directly from TH Brewery
"From can. Pale, hazy orange. Thin head- that stays- with strong lacing. More malt on the nose than I would have guessed. Grapefruit taste. Hint of lemon maybe. Good feel- strong carb, citrus stick, and juicy."
"Some of the other reviews of this beer have nailed it. The typical Tree House IPA profile is a turbid juice bomb with very low perceived bitterness and a pillowy soft mouthfeel. This beer is a bit of a departure from that signature in a few different ways. While hazy it is far less so than beers like Julius, Green, Eureka and Strider. The head was still off white and as abundant as you care to pour it. Minimal lacing. Flavor wise the beer begins with a really substantial tropical fruit note. Lots of peach, tangerine, some grapefruit, and papaya. This gives way to a fairly sticky and dank malt base as the beer warms up and you acclimate to the hop punch. Not a malty beer per se, but I noticed it more than some of their other beers. Tasty! There is a more pronounced bitterness to the finish of this beer, again not calling it a massively bitter beer but compared to some of their others it does set this one apart. The mouthfeel is a little more crisp than others I've tried from them, but with the added malt character I felt it was balanced nicely. I'm glad Tree House is not a one trick pony, and this is absolutely worth seeking out."
"This is the most underrated of all the Treehouse offerings. All of the variations are great but the original is awesome! This is my wife's favorite and she will never let me trade them, which is fine because I love them too."
Gold/yellow in color with a small white head. 
"This is a very different TH beer. It's considerably less hazy than the rest of their IPAs. You can almost see through it! This reminds me of a much better version of Captain's Daughter with its general flavor profile, but it's much more complex and flavorful. The mosaic hops are pretty aggressive in this beer. I'm missing the soft feel other Tree House beers have, but I gotta admit, it's kind of a nice change of pace. Not used to this level of bitterness from them either, but it really flights well after drinking a softer sweeter beer. While this isn't my favorite beer for my pallet, it is still extremely good and worth trying. I also love to see some versatility from one of my favorite breweries."
"Bright-flavored beer. Mosaic profile with a bit more fruitiness, in classic Treehouse fashion. More lemon than orange citrus flavor. More of a mellow ride than I would expect; bitterness is muted. Crushable summer brew."
L - Hazy dark orange with two fingers of white head
"Possibly my least favorite hoppy offering from Tree House. Pours cloudy orange as all other Tree House beers. Smell is quite dank and ""smelly"". The aroma was a little off putting. Taste was similar...more dank and earthiness. Pretty solid. Mouthfeel was ""thick"" as per usual. Overall a solid offering. May have to try again to see if it grows on me."
2/12/2016 fresh can drank in a Treehouse chalice/snifter
Pour is an almost-clear bright orange. No haze or cloudiness (not as much) as the other tree house offerings. Doesn't make a difference to me though. Still has excellent lacing and nice finger white head. Looks more like a traditional IPA.
16oz tallboy can poured into a snifter glass.
"16 oz can. Hazy orange body with a creamy white head. Nice lacing and retention sticking around. Aromas of tropical fruit, bitter fruity hops, pungent and a little floral. Taste is bright and popping with clean bitter hops, tons of tropical and citrus fruit. Finishes with a slight lingering bitterness. This one is killer."
"Pours light, the nose is citrus and dank. "
"Canned on 4/7/16; drank on 4/9/16 in a tulip glass; a major shout-out to the kind gentleman from Maryland who was standing next to me in line at Trillium today and gave me a can of Bright he had procured in Monson the day before, Cheers!"
Can dated 3/17
16oz can poured into a tulip
"16 oz can. Pours hazy golden orange, thick white head fades slowly leaving gobs of lace. Aroma is mild, cracker malt and earthy notes with a touch of fruit. Earthy piney hop flavor with citru peel on the edges. There's some oniony spice in a dry finish. Medium soft mouthfeel. Overall good IPA, nice change up from their juice bombs."
Had in a tulip glass from a can dated on 3/17/2016. 
"Fairly clear for a TH beer, at least with a careful pour, although a good swirl and inclusion of the last couple ounces drops a cloud of haze into the beer. Kind of a bronze-ish color, decent bit of foam that hangs around nicely, leaving pleasant patches of lacing. Nose is big Mosaic. The wife said it smelled like ""stinky feet"". I found it a little sweaty, alongside some garlic/herbs, maybe a streak of overripe tropical fruit, but really dominated by that stanky herbal note. Palate is less pungent, the sweet malt coming through a bit more, still certainly Mosaic forward, a bit of alcohol burn in the finish alongside some mildly astringent bitterness. For all of its stank, there's something likeable about this brew, but in sum that feature is just a little too over the top and dominant. Single hopped Mosaic beers can be great (think Lone Pint Yellow Rose or Crux Half Hitch), but this one had me wishing for a little more diversity from some companion hops."
16 oz. can. Hazy orange with a big head. Smells like mosaic. Big garlic hop bite. Orange and tropical behind that. Tastes much more of tropical fruit and sweet pale malt. Light hop bite in the baack end. Medium body. Very tasty.
Had a slightly overly bitter finish.
One of my favorites.
"As expected with Tree House, the brew pours nearly opaque and cloudy, a pleasant light orange shot through with yellow. Head is light white and foamy, with decent retention and wide lacing."
appearance- Light orange/yellow in color and a little cloudy. Pours a two finger head.
"The appearance on this one isn't the hazy,murky usual but it doesn't seem to matter! smell of earthy pine tropical papaya and slight dank herb on the nose. small to medium mouthfeel with resiny tones and waves of waves of tropical hops. This is too good! Cheers!"
"Pours yellow-gold in color, it's relatively clear but still has a touch of haze. Awesome aroma, super dank with citrus and some resiny pine. Taste mirrors the aroma, super dank with a good amount of citrus and a solid bitterness. There is a slightly oniony undertone that isn't unpleasant and is a dead giveaway that Mosiac was used to hop this beer. Good mouthfeel, medium-ish body that leans towards the lighter side and has a moderate carbonation that yields an almost pillowy mouthfeel. This is a great beer, super tasty, and quite drinkable."
"I'm guessing this is filtered, which is cool. So many of TH's offerings are opaque!"
"This is an amazing, complex beer. It starts off with a very strong punch with a piney, hoppy kick, then smooths out to a peachy, malty finish. It's like a Heady Topper with a sweeter aftertaste. Very different from other Treehouse offerings. And it's a good different."
Pours a golden light Amber with some haziness. Aroma is juicy citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is citrusy and juicy with a great aftertaste of hops all the way through. Overall this is very enjoyable.
Look: uncharacteristicly clear for a TH beer. Nice big head of about two fingers that dissipates quicker than most of their beers.
pours light hazy orange. nose is some pine and citrus notes. normal wonderful mouthfeel as all treehouse has. taste is some orange and pineapple with papaya in there as well. get some spruce in there mingling with the citrus flavors. finishes pretty bitter. overall I was stoked to try this cause I love mosaic and ss 6 from farmstead is one of my fav. little underwhelming though as the citrus faded into more pine and bitterness than I would have liked. overall great but was hoping for a little different. edit ....few months later and this is really growing on me. so much better as it warms. no ill effects of age. really diggin this. edit.......... the more I drink this the more the tropical flavors that mosaic offers are present. this beer is jumping up my ranks. berry flavors. tropical fruit. light spruce. this beer is awsome
"Far more filtered, much unlike most of Tree House's IPAs, copper with a one finger head. Smells like caramel popcorn, candied fruits, earthy. Taste is hoppy, cereal malts/grains, spicy.. booze hidden up front, but comes through as it warms. Dry - much more of a traditional IPA than the Tree House standard. Overall, it's just fine. No reason to avoid it, but not very exciting, and I'd typically be looking for their other offerings."
"Look is slight haze, not as cloudy as other Tree House offerings that I've had. Not much head. The nose has honey, citrus, pine, and hops. Where this beer really shines is the taste and mouthfeel. Absolutely delicious."
Enjoyed this one much better from the can after a couple of weeks as opposed to fresh from the growler. Color was a little hazier and the taste and aroma wasn't as dank. Solid offering
"Look-light orange in color, not as cloudy as you expect from Treehouse. Pours a finger and a half of thick head that settles into a stubborn ring."
16 ounce can poured into a snifter. This is one of the more bitter IPA's Tree House has done recently. Not one of my favorites. Probably not one I would seek out again.
"Pours a yellowish orange color with mild turbidity. 1/2 inch head on this pour. Has a wonderful grapefruit smell. Nice balance between malt and the hops wit a resiny, piney taste. Nice carbonation. A wonderful DIPA."
"Loved the Mosaic in this one. Bright is an apt name- light and juicy with lots of tropical fruits and a clean, slightly soapy finish. Definitely worth the Tree House hype as usual."
"One of the few beers that impressed me from Tree House recently. Mosaic hops really shined in this one. Bright tropical, light lingering bitterness, light pungent Tree House yeast that isn't too over the top like their other hoppy stuff. Enjoyed it thoroughly."
Can into a teku. 
"A - Dark orange, hazy and a thick white lacing ring."
Nice and dank IPA while avoiding the over the top bitterness which many have. Only weakness is a very slight off odor on the nose. TH brings it even with the non-juice bombs!
White head. Lace. Golden orange color. Clear.
"Great beer. Slight ethanol after taste, which masks hop juicy flavor."
Pour from can dated 2/19/16 into a tulip. Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a finger of head that leaves a sticky coating of lacing throughout. Grapefruity citrus aroma.Taste of citrus and resinous pine. Goes down marvelously smooth as each sip of flavor fades from the palate. Exceptional.
Can purchased 2/20 poured into pint glass.
16oz. can (2.19.16) into a pint glass. 
"Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. Canned yesterday, purchased today at the brewery. "
"L: Classic TH look, brilliant orange colored body, white, frothy head that leaves nice lacing. Hazy/opaque."
Pours a nice golden color with a thick off white head that sticks around. Lots of lacing.
Look - A darker than normal (for TH) golden color. Hazy but not that fruit juice look that TH normally puts out. Still an awesome looking beer though.
"L: hazy, burnt orange"
"The beer comes in a medium to full hazy deep gold to pale amber, with a fluffy soft head. If memory serves, a touch darker than some of Tree House's other offerings."
L: Light amber hues with a healthy 1cm white foamy head and generous lacing throughout the session
"Clear orange color, surprising for tree house. The nose is a very piney hoppiness with a taste to match. Not too much bitterness, but son hearty-earth on the back end. The feel is normal, neither light and crisp not full an creamy. This is a clear departure from what tree house typically does and while good, nowhere near the level of their other fantastic beers."
750 growler into tulip. From 2/4/16
These folks just can't make a bad beer. This is one of my new favorites.
A delicious juice bomb featuring mosaic hops. No taste of alcohol.
"S: Sweet, candied smell. I have a feeling this is going to taste exactly how it smells. Absolutely incredible so far!!"
"I've been going to TH since the Monson days (before they became Disneyworld and morons were shelling out $45.00 for glassware on Ebay). This particular beer, along with the other (unneeded) 3-4 variations of this beer, were the first beers from TH that made me realize even the mightiest of the mighty can, and will strike out. Flavor is dry, don't expect a juice-bomb, its like a watered down version of Sip of Sunshine. Oddly enough they make this beer, or one of the variations more often that not, once or twice a week. I've met countless people in line @ TH who despise this beer, so it feels good to receive confirmation I'm not the odd man out. This brewery is capable of greatness, however it seems like their pretentious nature culminates into insisting on brewing this beer so often."
L - far out label duuuuude... gets a bump just for that. Solid dark orange. No gradient. Fluffy head. 
Peachy golden color with a slight haze. This batch hazier than the first one.
This poured out as a hazy looking golden color with a creamy white head on top. The smell of the beer is packed with hops. The taste has a bit of sweetness to it but then it's all kinds of hops right after that. The feel of the beer is smooth and creamy. Overall it's a solid IPA.
Type: 16-oz. can
"Second time having this beer, still fantastic. Beautiful color, almost peachy just like the taste and aroma. The whole experience with this beer is all about stone fruits and melon. Mouthfeel is nice, not thick and chewy like some hazy IPA's can be, more refreshing and easy to drink."
"Pulpy yellowish-orange brew, opaque in thicker glasses and hazily translucent in thinner glasses. Pours a big, frothy, snow white head with excellent retention and lacing."
"if you're ever in the norcal area, you must stop in and try moonraker. numerous good beers, Dojo is the best"
Received in a trade and shared with JLindros.
Thanks to rudzud
"Pours a turbid peach color with a frothy white head. Nose is of pale malts, tropical fruit and citrus pith. Taste of mellow mangos, grapefruit pith, light pinnaple and sticky malt. A bit of light grass/earthyness in there too. Medium creamy body with nice pungent citrus rine bitter finish."
Fresh 16oz can into tulip. 
HOLLLEEEE FUHHHH
"At the brewery, on tap..."
"incredible, mind blowing and delicious."
Hazy juice bomb!
"Originally reviewed in Aug '16, on tap @ location w/ a 4.08/5 score"
Can shared by jc1762. Thanks Jon.
"The beer comes in a bright light to medium gold color, medium plus haze."
"the aroma is of over ripe pungent peaches,pineapple...the taste is mango/peach juice with the most creamiest mouth feel, with a nice herbal/green basil Finnish."
"Delicious dipa. Foundation hotel, Detroit. July 2018"
"Very modest head production from a strong pour; retention is in a similar category. Body is a lovely bright golden hue, lively and completely transparent."
Delicious!
Working from memory...
"16 ounce prowler into tulip glass, filled on 11/4/2017. Pours fairly crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Nice appearance, despite lack of carbonation. Aromas of huge tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, white bread, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, white bread, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine, citrus peel, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Mild carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, grainy, sticky, and fairly resinous/rind balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is fairly well hidden, a mildly increasing warmth of 9.5% after the finish. Overall this is an amazing DIPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink for the ABV. Even with the lack of carbonation in this prowler, this was still a winner. Great mix of dank and vibrant hop complexity; with a really lightweight malt body for the ABV from the rice as expected. Just enough there to balance the fairly aggressive bitterness. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Poured in tap into a snifter. A slightly hazy golden color with a modest white head. Nice retention in the glass. Bright piney aroma with a hint of orange tastes like a well-crafted old-school IPA with heavy pine, bitter orange, and bready malt. A clean, dry finish. ABV is well hidden. Overall a great DIPA especially if you like piney and earthy notes."
"A: Bright, deep gold with a clean white head that's almost unnoticeably tinted. A nice cap remains on top and leaves some legs and webbing well down the glass."
"Very refreshing and crisp IPA. Had on tap at Mitten Bar in Lud on July 3. Oddly there's no head, sat in the snifter like a hard cider and was kinda reluctant to taste it, but I'd order again. Nice new taste for me."
"What happened to DRIPA? Those of you that have had it recently know what I am talking about. Did they change the recipe? Did the new brewery mess things up? This was once a west coast style IPA with a massive hoppy aroma, awesome citrus flavor with a clean finish. Now it tastes like a Belgian IPA. NONE of the strong hop aroma there once was. More like Simcoe Silly DRIPA. Sad. I need to find another go to."
On-draught @ One Mile House. 12oz for $7.00 USD. 9.5% ABV.
"This was quite a heavy, thick brew, and very tasty as well."
"Great Citrus, resins, some pine. Great IPA."
"This beer. Absolutely incredible. Tried on tap the first time I ever went to Kuhnhenn and sampled again at their XV Anniversary event last month. Kuhnhenn is a brewing company that, to me, is synonymous with big, malty styles, so it surprised me to find that their rice IPA series was one of the most unique innovations at the brewery. The mouthfeel if this beer is second to none among IPAs. The uncompromisingly crisp mouthfeel perfectly accentuates the bitter bite of the underlying West Cost-inspired hopping. Truly world-class."
"Served in a shaker pint at Art's Tavern in Glen Arbor. Gold in color, slightly hazy, with a thin white cap. Aroma is light pine, citrus, some sweet malt. Feel is amazingly refreshingand crisp , with a flavor that follows the aroma, along with some floral notes."
"Gold amber, with a slow to build large foam head that retains a soft blanket."
"Solid look to this beer with an inch and a half of light off white head. Body is bright vibrant gold in color. Nose is just a nice mix of fruity and grassy hop notes. With first sip hops are really the star here with nice sweetness and a gambit of hop variety. Fruit, citrus, pine and woodsy resin all play in the flavor profile. It gels so well together in terms of hops and malts. This is a perfect double IPA."
On tap at CBC 2016. Clear pale yellow with a white head. Citrus and tropical fruit on top of a subtle malt body.
F'yeah
Pretty solid. The use of rice makes for an interesting flavor. Lots of hoppy goodness and well balanced with a really nice dark color. Not too bitter and well balanced.
"From a growler into a snifter. Very clear strong gold color with great reflection, healthy carb and lacing. Mild hop nose, not too strong. Crisp fruity hop taste without lingering bitterness on the back end. Can't tell the high ABV by taste. Very balanced. Tasting it, I just think ""man, this is an exceptionally well made beer."""
"This beer pours a crystal clear bright golden color with a 2 finger frothy white head. Retention is excellent and there are some rings of lacing. Smell is grapefruit, orange, pine and some sweet malt. Taste is similar. Some bitterness that is quickly washed away by the sweet caramel malt. Very well balanced. Feel is medium and resinous with good carbonation. Overall this is a very solid offering. Would certainly have this again."
A very interesting IPA. The rice element puts a 'tough to put your finger on it' unique feel to this one. Almost a honey sweetness on the back end and a blend of fruity and floral hops. Complex notes of pineapple and mango with a slight resin note. Excellent. Despite the high abv this goes down nicely
"On tap at gypsy nickel, got a growler, delish"
Outstanding beer from Kuhnenns!!
Dang53 is on point with his review. Opened my first of two growlers that were poured in Grand Rapids on Saturday today in Saint Louis. For a 5 day old draft it was worth the wait. I first had this beer in September of 2013 and haven't had it since. Great balance across the board. I think the rice definitely curbs any sense of bitterness. The alcohol will creep up on you because this high abv beer is so tasty and smooth. Probably my favorite ipa.
Their signature beer. Nice balance. A must try
"Golden beer with a nice big white head drank from a (40oz?) Kuhnhenn mug while wearing a Kuhnhenn shirt. On the sweeter side of standard IPAs, but I'm not crazy about super bitter IPAs. The hop flavor still punches through, dank, citrucy, and sticky (in that order). Glad to dome a 32oz midday on a Monday. Thanks FEUO!"
"Appearance: A big, fluffy head over the clear golden liquid; a decent amount of lacing"
"32 oz. growler. Clear pale orange. A few bubbles. Citrus hop aroma. Interesting sugar smell. I guess that's the rice. Tastes much hoppier. Bright citrus. Sugar flavor is interesting here too. Light sweetness. Almost no bitterness. Low carbonation. Stupid plastic growler caps. Light body. I get that the rice makes it lighter and, apparently, taste less alcoholic. It's pretty dramatic. Unique flavor from the rice, though."
"From week old growler. Pours a translucent orange color. I agree with last reviewer. Smells like lemon cheese cake. Also get crisp, biscuity malt and pine. Taste is lemon lime citrus and more subtle than a grapefruit tropical fruit bomb. Malt is crisp delicious like a flaky croissant. The alcohol brings a little edge to the beer but it's not too boozy. The malt offers a vanilla caramel sweetness that brings that lemon cheese cake flavor when combined with the citrus flavors. Mouth feel is excellent. I get all my favorite aspects of an IPA. It is crisp, sticky, fluffy, and dry all at the same time. This is one that doesn't overpower you at any point, but it's a very refined, well-crafted IPA."
Growler provided by Kirkfrailey.
"Appearance - From the howler, the beer poured a golden orange color."
From a 3 day old 32 oz growler aquired via trade....pretty high ABV DIPA but drank surprisingly easy! Very nice citrus notes but a dry refreshing finish ! Would seek this one out again !
"The visual presentation of this one is sub par. Otherwise, this is fantastic and should be sought out. Nose, taste, mouthfeel, all wonderful."
"Interesting beer. From draft. Nose is typical DIPA. Again, typical DIPA flavors on the front of the tongue. However, the finish is what's really surprising... dry and subtly starchy. Wasn't sure what to expect, but it wasn't that. A very good DIPA that gets a few extra points for uniqueness."
"Wonderful brew! Exhibits hops, fruit and full IPA flavor. Smooth finish and disorienting effect."
"Served at brewery. Extremely clear light color. Smells of citrus, mango, pineapple. Taste is smooth and very hoppy. Balanced nicely as the drink continues. Ends with a little stickyness as the remnants sit on the palate. Tasty brew."
"32oz growler from IAmJacksHopTongue (thanks man, awesome surprise!). Served in a Barrel and Barley teku. "
Excellent beer. Was able to try on draft a few weeks ago at Kuhnhenn's. Very clear yellow/orange in appearance. Wonderful aroma. Taste was delicious also. Not my favorite DIPA but very solid. I wish KB would bottle this beer.
"If you haven't had it, it is a shame.World Class."
Hops seem to skew more floral to me than pine or citrus. The malt at play is also a unique backdrop. I'd love to side by side this with Bruery's Humulus Lager. The mouthfeel is what really stands out here - a bit of a lager / ale hybrid feel.
"Light citrus flavours, a bit tangy. Very light bodied for the abv. Delicate, if a beer if this strength can be so! A sweetness accompanies the bitter."
"Incredible beer that I just so happen to live within a twenty minute drive of, I sure wish they bottled this stuff. Smells very much like a west coast ipa with a nice malt finish and citrusy hops. One of the best double ipas I have ever had and honestly only Sip of Sunshine tops this. Heady Topper is not anywhere near this one. Incredible."
"I am slowly opening my mind to the ipa's. This along w ZD are really changing my tune to start seeking more out like this. I thought it was well balanced without being to floral smelling nor too bitter at the end. Again, newer to enjoying ipa style beers but I would strongly recommend this as it seems very balanced for all to enjoy. Great beer."
Finally nailed a personal whale. Amazing aroma and taste with a fairly thin mouth feel. Brewers Art really on display.
"Short Review, I've had this beer many times and I always enjoy it, pretty much every time I see it on tap I have one. I just love the hop profile and mouthfeel, it makes for a great and somewhat unique DIPA. While it may not be my favorite Kuhnhenn beer it is my most drank beer from them and I will continue to enjoy it. Nothings better than having DRIPA on tap at the source."
"Just wasnt for me. Very light, sweet like honey. Just kinda odd to me."
Simple amazing. One of my top-3 beers.
got a growler and had it the night of. so great..
Wow. This was great at the brewery. A little watery in the mouthfeel but otherwise fantastic.
"Good overall DRIPA, good fruity notes and nice taste. Currently only available from brewery no bottles yet."
Kuhnhenn has become a staple in the local bars across Southeast MI for me since DRIPA has been available. A double IPA done right. Clean finish that doesn't leave your mouth coated with too much pungency of over-flavoring. A well rounded hop balance reveals a connoisseur level of care from the brew-master followed by a citrus that helps mask the expected high ABV of a double India Pale Ale. My only downside is that I always am served a snifter and would prefer to go to Warren and pick up a growler!
simply amzing
"this tastes and feels like an enormous india pale lager, except where the doughy lager yeast usually kicks in, its a cleaner even righter crisper thing, odd for a starch to do that, but apparently it does, what a cool beer! average looking for an ipa, with some bronze shades to it and a real tall just off white head. its definitely a hop bomb, sturdy lemon notes and oily hops radiate from this beer, and i get grass and lime zest too, its not sharp at all, but it is indeed potent. the flavor has a similar hop profile as the nose, just with more bitterness built in, pushing the IBUs up a bit. the malt base is interesting, big enough on the pale front for the abv present, but the rice soothes it, sort of smoothing the whole thing out, bringing the hops to a realm they dont usually get to go. i dont ever taste rice i dont think, but its contribution to the beer is undeniable. one of the quickest finishing and cleanest finishing big hoppy beers i can remember. there really isnt anything else like this out there that i am aware of. so so good."
Perfection. This beer is heaven...if it exists
Growler sent to me and stillmatic2232 in a trade.
1807th review on BA
16oz. draft at Crunchy's in East Lansing.
Thanks to my cousin RWR3 for bringing a growler at my special request to our family reunion here in Asheville. Shared with cousins on the porch in the mts on a hot afternoon shower. 
Poured on tap a full 14 oz. into a Becher glass.
"Appropriately enough, Kuhnhenn DRIPA has a head like a rice cake. It is bigger and more sturdy than I previously thought possible for a rice beer - the first dispelled assumption of many. Indeed, as the ale's deep and radiant daisy yellow colour would indicate, this offering is full of character... "
"64oz growler poured into an imperial pint glass (20oz). Growler filled almost exactly one week ago, thanks Brian (brownbrian) for the longtime want."

"Served on-tap at One-Eyed Betty's in Ferndale, Michigan."
On tap at the brewery.
32oz growler picked up at beer city
"This beer was served from the tap at One-Eyed Betty’s in Ferndale, MI. It arrived in a generic tulip, glowing the bright, straw colored hue of gold bullion. It held a one finger head of tan bubbles, showing decent retention. No haze or sediment was noted, and carbonation appeared light. The aroma was palpably sticky and heavy with grapefruit hops, sweet honeys, and pineapple sugars. To match was chalky rice graininess, stark plastic and chemically phenols that took on polish remover with warmth, huge sting of booze, and crayon waxiness. The hops, too, changed with warmth, giving more bitter herbals and the high pitched scream of perfume-floral hops. Our first impression was that the flavoring was very juicy and sweet, with nice hop bitterness to balance. As we sipped, grapefruit and lemony hops crashed the palate, with a quick shift to musty herbs, honey sweetness, pale and toasty grain, plastic phenols, and vodka booziness to bring us to the peak. Here we met hollow booziness, sweet cherries, and freshly sliced pineapples. The continued herbal hop bitterness actual helped to dull the booziness a bit. We finished with more pale malts, coiny metallics, apricot sweetness, citric and herbal hoppiness, dill, and mashed basil. The aftertaste breathed of musk, peppery booze, burnt pale grain, grapefruit hop resin, fresh grassiness, and hugely spicy phenols. The body was medium, and the carbonation was medium. There was soft pop, nice slurp and smack to each sip. Froth and cream were lesser, but not noticeably negative. The mouth was left bone dry following an oily coating and coolness. The abv was big, but this sipper was easy."

Growler shared with daysinthewake. 
"Growler shared by GT2. Thanks man. The beer is light golden with a small white cap. The aroma offers fresh hops, tropical fruit. Smells great. The flavor follows suit, with notes of pineapple and mango. Light bodied with relatively low carbonation. Tasty!"
Big thanks to Scoot1969 for this one. Growler. Tulip glass.
at Kuhnhenn served in a 10 oz snifter
"Served in a snifter glass. Freshly poured into my growler, less than ten minutes ago."
"Had this at Kuhnhenn's on tap, than took a growler home to enjoy for a few days. "
"The first time I had this was actually on tap at the Park Bar in Detroit. It pours a golden amber color with quite a bit of haze, foamy white head that lasts for a while, at least halfway through. It was served in a translucent, plastic cup, but looking from the inside reveals that there is indeed some incredible lacing cascaded down the sides. "
"On tap at the brewpub for 2012 Winter Solstice, and many times over at other times."
Pours hazy gold color with a creamy 1 finger snow white head that faded slowly and left great lacing clinging to the sides of the glass. 
64oz growler out fo my Long Trail Brewmaster's glass.
On tap at j ryans
"Appearance: Deep golden - Just slightly darker than pilsner color. Deep golden yellow. Not much of a head, but incredible lacing. "
A - golden with beautiful long lasting lace on the sides of the glass and a thin head remaining throughout. 
"A good DIPA. Pours pretty and the nose is very fragrant and distinct. The flavor profile is very good, but I felt like it was a little bit too sweet at first, though that seems to mellow out as the beer goes on. The sweet tones combine with a bitter spicy hop tone. A bit too citrus toned, but it's still nice. A pretty easy drinking dipa. I was concerned when my growler seemed to be leaking, but this withstood the trip home. Whew. Lucky I am. A pleasure to drink. Are you jealous that I got a growler of this? I think you should be. Be extra jealous that I got a Kuhnhenn tulip."
Pours a golden straw color with a slight honey hue. The pure white head was short but dense.
"Poured at Michigan Brewer's Guild in Ypsi. Light golden color with small white head. Aroma of big citrus fruits and lots of sweet honey, some graininess, and pineapples. Flavor follows with a nice sweet citrus profile, some additional tropical fruits, and a nice crisp bitter finish. Slick mouthfeel but pretty light for a DIPA, medium carbonation. Overall I liked this a lot, but not nearly as much as others seem to. I'll have to revisit this some time."
Growler poured into a FFF Teku tulip
"On tap at Ashley’s in Ann Arbor, poured into a pint glass at cellar temperature."
Pours a deep honey amber orange hue with a nice 2 finger that sticks to the glass very nicely.
Picked up a 64oz growler of this locally a few hours ago. Enjoyed from a kuhnhenn tulip.

On-tap at Ginger Man NYC.
I had this on-tap at the brewpub. Poured into a sample glass.
"From 09/26/11 notes. Had on tap at The Ginger Man, served side by side with the Kuhnhenn Silly Simcoe."
Thanks Steve 
"Had a 9 oz. pour at the Stag's Head in Midtown. I enjoyed the lighter body and appreciated the mild rice taste (like a light toast or rice cake). However, the hops character didn't stand out in a crowded DIPA field. There's a balanced grapefruit and pine punch, which while tasty, doesn't have any distinct, stand-out notes. It's more drinkable for the style, but there's are better options for hop heads."
"Got this one in a deal with splax23, thanks Adam"
"The color poured out as a nice looking copper with a thin white head on it that leave a decent lacing down the glass. The Smell of hops flood out of the beer, not as strong as some DIPA's but it's got enough there to stand up against it's opponents. The taste of the beer has a nice pine like citrus hop kick that lingers nicely on the tongue. The mouthfeel is much thinner than expected. Found that to be a little strange, but like other have stated on here it must be from the rice. Overall pretty tasty stuff."
On tap at Rattle N Hum for their Kuhnhenn event.
Extremely clean looking double IPA . There is a white head and a heavy lacing from this one.
On Tap at Rattle and Hum for their event involving this brewery.
L:
Poured from the tap a slightly hazy golden brown with two fingers of rich off-white head.
"Reviewed on 6/19/2010. On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear orange with a thick white head. Aroma of sweat, grassy hops, and citrus. Flavor of hop oils, sweat, and lots of sweet malt and residual sugars. It was very sweet after awhile and some acetone notes came out as well. Hmm, just didn't like this one, much too sweet for me."
One of my favorites. 
A- a dark amber color with a solid creamy head. Looks delicious.
Reviewed from notes. On tap at the brewpub.
Growler from New Beer Distributors into my Spiegelau tulips.
"This review might be a bit under the influence, but I'm trusting my notes. Also, the booziness led to some extreme dancing on Vanderbilt, when I was drinking it I somehow was telling people it was 6.5% alcohol by volume... Oops (it's 10.5)."
"Thanks to Alex for picking this up for me; a growler into a Bells tulip...Pours a dark peach that is pretty clear, looks watery. Off white head with good carbonation for a week old growler, good lacing...The aroma is really boozy, distractingly so. Light grass show off some hops but after the alcohol I get tons of rye, this really comes off to me as rye not rice ipa...The taste is very similar to the aroma, way to much rye comes through to make this a really enjoyable ipa to me. A typically boozy Kuhnhenn ipa. Not there best, but passable to drink."
"I had this on tap at the brewpub. It struck me as a massive DIPA, high ABV like so many other Kuhnhenn brews."
From a growler from the brewery on 8-17-10
"Poured a dark golden body with a good head that left lace patches on the glass. Classic balanced aroma that has some sweet caramel malt as well as spicy, bitter leafy citric hops that are strong. Taste is more of same as the hops are everpresent w/ their leafy citric and somewhat spicy notes and there is some sweet malts tastes in there, but the rice helps create a little extra sweet and smoothness that I haven't had in a DIPA before. Medium body and chewey, this beer goes down easy and has a rather smooth finish that still works. Could drink this anytime."
Enjoyed on cask on 3/12/10.
I had this on cask - served in a ten ounce 1/2 pint tulip. My first real taste of Kuhnhenn so here goes:
"a: This was a deep, chestnut brown, clear for the most part. I was expecting something lighter in color because of the rice. It was served to me with a thin soapy head."
Served from a cask at the General Sutter. Wow! The Gotham Imbiber has done well.
Had this on tap at Kuhnhenn. It was a 10 oz. pour in a small tulip glass.
"On draft at Barcade, Brooklyn, NYC."
Had at Uptown Grille Commerce MI&gt; Holly shit these are good.
A- A slightly hazy golden/ copper liquid with a very thin white head that settles to a few splotches. Definitely looks thick and syrupy based upon how long it takes the carbonation to reach the surface.
MasterSki was nice enough to share this one. thanks alex!
Big thanks to MasterSki for lugging this one up from Kuhnhenn.
"A nice DIPA, at the 2009 Winter Solstice. The rice gives it an interesting drinkability and sweetness, without having to resort to much malting. There was sweetness, rice, vegatable, citrus all in the nose. Really bitter, really lacey, on a grapefruit body. Above average smooth mouthfeel."
"Picked this up on my LONG drive from Chicago to Toronto - shared with Viggo, Clockwerk, and others. Served in Unibroue tulip. The growler held up perfectly fine for a week and a half. This batch was in around 10% I think."
Growler shared by kp poured into a goblet.
Tap at brewpub.
Growler shared by my dear friend Steve Rose. It’s great to be back in Boston.
Draft at Trillium - Canton. 
"A killer looking beer. It’s deep orange, almost bronze-like with a very off-white head. The smell and taste is just all oranges and melon, even some mango. It’s pretty sweet, seemed more sweet than 32 or 45. The alcohol isn’t hidden has well, either. I think this could benefit from a 1% drop in ABV to help with sweetness. It’s very good, and I say keep these Perms coming, but I enjoyed 38 in regular IPA form more."
16 oz. canned on 06/20/18
"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a slight dark burnt orange almost brown color with a sly transparency about it. Carbonation runs up at a nice pace to fill a nice thin foamy white head. Little bit of messy thin lacing all around. The smell starts danky sweet onion with a menancing resin hop bittersweetness rolling in underneath, but then protrudes a big hop burn dankiness as it continues to warm. The flavor takes in a big danky sweet onion sticky hop burn with big sweet resinous tongue ripping stickiness. Sweet to bitter grassy edge. Combined sticky resinous ""green"" (fresh) to danky sweet oniony aftertaste charging into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a super sipping sticky feel hitting my tongue. Harshness of the hops hit pretty sharp and bitter. Big hop throat burn. Overall, wow, how old or how young is this? Though it kinda reminds of a day old SN Hoptimum, the hop throat burn is big on this one. Still, I liked it a lot as I believe that’s what the brewer intended."
"Had this at Mikro Beer Bar in CT. Sean Lawson came in and brought some beers you would not find in CT. This is a dangerously great beer. Color was darker than most DIPA almost red, great on the nose. Taste and feel are the stars. No way you are thinking 11% abv that's the dangerous part. Enjoy with restraint."
"Purchased by standing in line in a parking lot at Mad River. Poured half of this into a mason jar with a handle from Dan & Whit's in Norwich, VT. Enjoyed while watching Michigan throttle Penn State in football. Color is dark orange, minimal foam. Smell and taste are the best part of this beer, which is preferable, right? Specifically, it has that barn-like smell that little craft breweries seem to manufacture. It smells like people gathered around a campfire, with one guy's truck playing a live Phish show that no one's really listening to that closely, and everyone opening up their cooler to reveal their secret treasures of beer. It tastes like something that wouldn't be out of place coming from Hill Farmstead. It's not a huge flavor to me, but it tastes warmly pleasant. The alcohol does not overwhelm, even though there is an overwhelming amount of alcohol in this thing: 11.2%! Ah, well. I'd drink it again, if ever I could find it."
Bottle shared by Barry- thanks dude.
"First of all, this beer does not drink like a 11% IPA. It is amazing how hoppy and smooth it is, lacking that alcohol presence of Lawson's Triple IPA. I am blown away by the drinkability of this beer. It's a refreshing oily hop bomb!"
"I've been waiting to try this for a long time. Finally got my hands on some. Pours a very hazy, deep golden color with fluffy white head. Aroma is pretty powerful. Light citrus with lots of pine. I also smell some malt sweetness and a touch of alcohol which isn't surprising for an 11% beer. Taste is potent to say the least. Lots of pine and earthy dankness. The citrus is there, but the pine is the star. I can definitely taste alcohol though. This beer is ridiculously smooth for 11%, but the alcohol is not totally hidden. I think it's impossible to hide 11% ABV. "
"Pours an orange-gold with a half inch, bright white cap. Nose expresses citrus, pith and mango. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of tangerine and an earthy/herbal/piney bitterness. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an oily texture and an even carbonation. All and all, a solid DIPA - very piney with hints of tropical fruit."
22 oz. bottle purchased on 4/9/16 at Lawson's 8th Anniversary Sale. Poured into Lawson's tulip glass. 
"I can say nothing negative here. This is one amazing beer. High ABV, sweet smooth flavors, the right amount of hops. I'm in love."
"On tap, 1/21/16 at Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, VT. Served in a snifter, about at 11 oz. pour."
"Tropical nose, smooth drinking, boozy, hoppy..."
"had this on tap at pro pig in Waterbury VT. sexy pour, never seen this beer around before so im stoked to try it!! nose was surprisingly underwhelming, some floral and pine notes. taste is not underwhelming, big piney bitterness on the tongue! well balanced and great feel as well... ridiculously easy drinking for 11%. overall its not really my style of IPA as I prefer a bigger citrus presence, but its definitely an interesting one to try for anyone looking for a big piney IPA."
"Poured into a tulip. Dark golden color with fine white bubbly head. Bouquet is citrus and pine with overall aroma fairly subdued. Taste is of citrus and pine with perfect hoppiness for me. Compared to Lawson's Double Sunshine this has less of a citrus flavor but may be more well-crafted due to the ease in drinkability of this 11.1 % ABV beer. Mouthfeel is superb, have not personally found a strong IPA as tasty as this that is so easy to drink."
"The aroma has aggressive leafy hops, grapefruit, and green pine. There's a hint of sweetness and alcohol."
"22oz bomber from the most recent anniversary party. Thanks to Joe for generously hooking me up with this. Poured into a Lawson's snifter today, 5/1/2014."

"Bottle shared by cfrances33 at DLD, served in a mini snifter."
Short white head recedes to a cap and collar. Body itself is peach/dull orange color that's see-through near the edges.
"Tasted this DIPA on tap at Lawson's 5th anniversary celebration a few weeks back, but I had a chance to get 5 bombers so I thought Id post my rev since someone has been kind enough to add the brew to Lawson's list. The smell is more or less exactly what I would expect only a more complex nose in this bottle then I recall on tap- piney, juicy citrus, pineapple and mango make for an excellent nose combo. The bold hops dominate and I can tell that this DIPA is gonna be wonderfully bitter just based on the smell. The taste isnt at all far off from the smell- I certainly notice the strong bitterness at first, however the piney and almost puckery citrus balances the bitter hops out very well. The slightly sticky resinous hops linger for a moment, but this is no issue to me. Crazy hoppy, but the label indicates as much and that's what I came for. The thing I must mention is how remarkably well disguised the 11.2 ABV is- quite smooth all things considered but will smack the pallet in the best way possible. "

Served in a tulip with my awesome girlfriend. Big thanks to thezoobrew for sitting in line for this 10 day old masterpiece!
"This poured out as a hazy orange color with a white head on top. The retention is pretty good, the lacing is sticky. The smell of te beer is loaded with hoppy grapefruit aroma and sweet candy-like malt. The taste is malty and sweet with a blast of citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and sticky. Overall is boozy, citrusy, resiny, an piney. All in all, very good stuff. Thanks DaveHack for tossing this one my way!"

"Pours a hazed a floaty filled, straw color with a finger of eggshell colored head. Stellar lacing, insane haze, decent head retention "
"Even at over 6 months since bottling this beer is hoppy, and tasty like a fresh bottle of any DIPA out there, Amazing smooth mouthfeel and a fruity and piney aroma."
"The beer was a beauty to look at. And the smell had a lovely bouquet of hops and tropical fruits, especially pineapple and passionfruit. But the taste was so mellow and watered down compared to the taste. I love TG, but this one just wasn't for me I guess. Not that it isn't lovely and bright, but I found it being dry, bland, and over carbonated on the finish."
My old neighbor is sharing a bottle of this with me whilst I'm in town for son's hockey tournament. It poured a murky yellow with no head and no lace. The scent had bitter fruit hop. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with juicy fruit presence. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it's a solid beer.
"Very disappointing. I bought in a bomber, and I'm actually not looking forward to drinking the rest."
"this is really great stuff, cool to find it on tap. i like this better than some other beers from these guys in the same style, and dont really mind the haze here as much a i have in some of them. this smells insane, straight dry hopped glory, fresh cut pineapple, mango, and crushed white grape, it smells like white sangria straight up! of course there is some pae maltiness to support, as well as a vegetal hop bitterness thats rather obvious, but the aroma of this hop bill is amazing, goes right to the dome. its not quite as pronounced and unique to me in the flavor, but its not way off either, and i am introduced to some peach and apricot nectar character from the hops that i really like. some mosaic in here i think, but its hard to pick out what else. definite pineapple juice here along with some fresh citrus, so forward and good. i like that its also as bitter as it is, nice to have one of these juicy ones also pack a little punch at the finish, its not over the top or harsh, but it reminds you this is a double ipa. fuller body with the haze but not at all sweet, and a lot of carry for the hops. decent carbonation and a long, citrusy juicy orangey hop finish. great beer, worth the hype."
"Pours a super cloudy pale orange with a big white head that fades away quickly, very little lacing. Aroma of pineapple, grapefruit and some orange. Flavors match. Medium bodied, good carbonation. Hope I see this one again!"
"Big creamy head, murky hazy pale orange color"
"Pours to a hazy, murky yellowish tan appearance with a one finger head. Smells like a hop garden - spicy earth, dank onion, light citrus. Taste leans toward that spicy citrus, dank side with nice lingering bitterness on the finish. Great mouthfeel for a relatively low ABV beer. Another very good DIPA from TG though not near their best hoppy offering."
A bomber with a fuzzy date code that appears to read 02/21/18 poured in a 12oz. tulip.
Bottled 2 weeks ago.
"Akin to TG's most recent batch of FSM, this was a very welcome surprise. The last batch was a bit of a let down, but this one really takes the cake. Easily their best batch. Very tropical nose; pineapple, mango, some slight passion fruit. The taste follows suit with the nose; very tropical notes, pineapple on the forefront. Definitely worth picking up at least one."

Poured from a stupid 22 oz bomber into a teku glass.
"Pineapple, melon, tons of cryo hop powder, mango, light bitterness, hidden alcohol, hint of strawberry banana"
Bottled 2/13/18; drank 2/25/18 @ the Yarchives. 
Come on! Nearly $14.00 for a bomber of hazy Tang?? Completely and utterly overrated! Please don't sell me a meh DIPA that at 7.7% ABV is a rip-off. Done with Toppling Goliath. You now join 18th Street Brewery in the pantheon of fanboy over-priced beer!
"Really hazy peach color with off-white head. Aroma has milky yeast, juicy, overripe fruits, grassy hops and some vanilla sweetness. Taste follows with juicy fruit notes, milky yeast and grapefruit bitterness on the finish. Medium body and carbonation. A really nice ""New England meets West Coast"" DIPA."
"Pours a hazy orange, with thick, luscious head."
Appearance – one finger head over a very hazy deep yellow body. You can almost see the hop oils in there.
"This hazy DIPA differs from those NE ones. With a big tropical fruit presence, it delivers a good bitterness. The whole thing is balanced and refined all along. Some floral notes are present too. Juicy. Nice"
"As a glitch in the craft beer system has us seeing ""juicy"" this and ""hazy"" that, Toppling Goliath restores order with a bold and expressive IPA that brings all the tropical impressions from hops along with the teeth churning bitterness that draw hop heads near and far."
Type: 22-oz. bottle
"Arguably one of the worst dipas I've ever had. It smells fruity, zesty and slightly floral....Zero complaints there."
"Pineapple, papaya, mango, ripe peach, guava, melon and orange zest. Cracker malt profile. Fairly creamy feel. Large bitter bit, but not overwhelming. Saturates the mouth in delicious bitter hop juice."
"This was a hazy, dry hopped IPA with lots of pineapple and fruit, but more traditional, direct than a NE IPA with a boozy/bitter double-IPA punch. Kind of a refreshing break from pure juice bombs with more balance and bitter at 100 IBUs."
Bottle acquired from Tavour. Poured into a 5 oz taster globe.
"From a 6-week-old bomber, pours a completely hazy orange. A finger of foam."
"Buttery, soft, strong citrus and sweet fresh juice. The flavor repeats in a soft pattern and lingers. This just topped my favorite IPA. musical and friendly juice bomb."
Pours a hazy dark orange with minimal head.

crazy good! price is steep! Quality is high! Bring the price down please!
Hazy - totally opaque. Great aromas. Such an easy drink but this great beer creeps up on you - a 22oz bomber leaves it's mark! Awesome beer - go and get some!
"22oz, bottled on 06/14/17"
Poured from a 22oz bomber bottle into glass. Stamped bottling date looks like 09/21/17.
"Big fan of this beer. Tropical, cloudy style. Very fresh. Massive flavor. Might screw with you tomorrow."
"Smell on this is citric heavy. Tastes as good as it smells with heavy mango,tangerine taste. Good mouthful with just the right of bite on the back end. This one is good. King Sue and DDH PsuedoSue get much more praise from TG, but this one is right there in quality."
A little malty for my taste buds but it does have quite a bit of hops to round it out!
Look - homemade thick oj with frothy white head
Opaque orange juice with a thick white foam receding to nothing but a bubbly ring.
"Pours hazy orangish gold. Foamy, tall, white head that Fades slowly to a rocky head with light lacing."
8-18
"Tasted from bottle. Pours a murky gold with white head. Aroma is mango, pineapple and other tropical fruit notes. Flavors of tropical fruits with some dank resin notes. Pretty heavily bitter. Overall a solid bitter imperial IPA."
Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter. Thank Steve for the hookup.
"Poured out a slightly hazy, golden orange color with a small, white head of foam. It smelled of tropical fruits - pineapple and mango. It taste sweet with tropical fruits and a strong bitter presence."
"Looks like carbonated orange juice. Smells Amazing, citrus. Taste like a hopy screwdriver. Lots of good but no malty backbone. Feeling is a watered down carbonated orange juice. Overall it is tasty, but how is it a double IPA? Don't think it has any malt. More like a week pilsner flooded with hopy orange juice. Still good though."
"Cloudy almost completely opaque orange in color with an off-white head. Clearly a DDH beer just based on appearance. Smell is a rich pungent aroma of orange, mango, pine and pineapple. Nice middle of the road balance between the fruitier aromas and the piney bitterness on the nose. Taste is very smooth with notes of tangerine, orange, pineapple, mango initially giving way to more of a piney, sappy bitterness. Feel is perfect for the style - drinkable, but not too thin. Medium carbonation. Very smooth and integrated. Overall this is an outstanding DIPA from TG."
"650 mL bottle. Murky and hazy orange. Smells of citrus, sweet pale malt, some alcohol, and a little tropical fruit. Tastes less sweet than I expected. Orange and a little bit of mango and fruitiness. Dries out with an alcoholic finish. Medium body. Pretty boozy, but it's flavorful. I wasn't enthused at first, but I enjoyed it quite a bit in the end."
"My palate is in shambles. Damn this is a shitload of hops. As we've come to expect, pours like fresh OJ out of the bomber. Totally opaque/turbid/100% hazy...however you describe it. Thin, tightly packed white head rests atop the juice. Aroma is like the concussion from a bomb - it emanates from the bottle top and perfumes the air around it. Unreal. Tangerine, pineapple, orange and mango. Like a tropical fruit stand. Taste is pineapple, guava, mandarin orange, pine and herbal tea. Enormous flavor. Smooth throughout without any alcohol heat; it's higher on the acidity scale to me on account of the overwhelming citrus, but everyone's mileage will vary. What could be an absolute sloppy pig of a beer is actually cohesive, smooth and pleasantly bitter. It's not anywhere near subtle but it's well crafted, for sure."
"Cloudy almost tan color with strong foam and constant lacing. Smell is strong bitter and dank hops. Taste is crisp, mildly dank and citrusy, a barely there bitterness in the background. Interesting and tasty."
"Pours cloudy pale orange. There is a tall, foaming, white head. The aroma is musky, tropical, mango, guava, passion fruit, pineapple, and touch earthy pine. The taste follows the aromas, an absolute explosion of flavors, adding in some citrus, with a moderately bitter, somewhat piney finish. The aftertaste adds in grapefruit. The beer drinks smooth and soft."
Crazy Cloudy if your not use to it. Sweet Hops. Amazing Beer.
Pours an uber-hazy yellow color with a moderate foam head. Recedes after a bit leaving a good amount of lacing on the sides.
"light orange almost yellow hazy bomb for sure, aromas of melon and pineapple, some big grapefruit. Taste is not quite up too par compared to the nose, heavy grapefruit and slight hint of cantaloupe but the bitter ending is a bit abrasive. I can see why a lot of people really love this, I feel like it was at the very beginning cusps of the super hop-low ibu taste/mouthfeel. it delivers and I wish this was available locally because I would drink the heck out of it."
"Poured hazy golden yellow. Looks like a NE IPA. Smells of pineapple, citrus and subtle pine. Taste is pineapple up front, finishes kind of bitter but smooth. Drinks heavy...good carb and full mouthfeel for a DIPA. Overall, great beer. Glad I got to try!"
Cloudy straw appearance with significant white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a pleasant citrus with hoppy accent. Taste is a little weak citrus and hops. A little thin.
"Strong citrus, some pine. Good hoppy aroma. Short, yellowish/off-white head recedes before you know it to a thin rim with sparse lacing. Very cloudy, turbid burn orange color. Taste is as the aroma in the beginning - strong citrus and pine. The middle and finish is dominated by hops bittering, but not a mouth puckering bitter, just a nice IPA-like bitter. There is plenty of malt balance and the feel is not thick, but substantial. Nice zing on the tongue. Definitely in the west-coast style with the amount of pine and bitterness, and well balanced. The appearance is the major mediocrity in the beer for me. Turbidity is not in and of itself a positive, IMO, and the color of burnt orange is kind of middling. I don't downgrade for hazy/turbid appearance, but I don't give extra credit for it, either (unless it is critical to the overall style). So, if the overall appearance is mediocre, it is mediocre. Overall, and enjoyable west-coast influenced DIPA."
Bomber dated 6/19/17.
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 22 fl oz bottle on July 4, 2017. Smell is a very enticing and balanced blend of fruit flavors, bitter hops and sweet malt. Taste is complex and incredibly balanced. Feel is near perfect and smooth in the finish. One of my favorite double IPAs. Highly recommended."
Onion
"This fell in between a 4.25 and 4.5 overall for me, but ended up with giving it a 4.5 overall. I thought the smell lacked the flavor profile, the aroma was very minimal on comparison to the taste. "
An absolute smack to the face of glorious hoppiness
"This beer pours an opaque orange with a large head. The aroma is prickly, with pineapple, guava, mango, grapefruit, and a slight grassy onion quality. The flavor is boldly fruit, with guava, passionfruit, grapefruit flesh, mandarin orange, watermelon, and just a wisp of bitterness at the finish. The mouthfeel is broad and soft but with bright carbonation. Overall this is a really nice and vibrant juicy beer -maybe a little less bitter than I would prefer, but still very tasty."
"pours out hazy with a nice dense bright white head, some lacing. aromas are creamy orange, nectarines, grapefruit, sugary honey and gummy notes, as well as some greenness. palate follows mostly, big creamy orange and grapefruit up front, sweet doughy malts and finishes with mint, grassy earth, pine needles, spicy hop saturation. mouthfeel is on point, really really tasty and easy drinking."
"Pours a super hazy peach colored yellow with a massive white frothy head that eventually dissipates to a quarter inch cap that leaves great lacing. The aroma is pineapple and tangerines, and just a faint hint of pine. The flavor is the same with a sweetness up front and a nice bitter finish. Full thick feel. Overall a great beer. Just wish TG would put these great beers in a four or six pack format."
"Just poured a fresh bomber. The thick, tropical nose is incredible. Color and head are in line. Almost as good as Scorpius but the finish has more bite at the front and rear palate for longer. Thanks, TG, for continuing to represent the Midwest!"
"Murky deep gold - looks like pineapple juice with white foam that leaves solid ring and decent cap retention; good lacing. Candied citrus rind and pineapple nose; dank weedy notes follow. Bitter lemon rind and pineapple; fresh green hops; lite pine. Medium lite almost creamy feel; moderate carbonation. Overall, Excellent fresh green hops finish with bitter, dank grapefruit/pineapple linger; a top juicy DIPA with lite alcohol."
Pours Amber orange with fluffy white head.
"Very solid offering from TG. Not up there with the King or Sosus, but definitely a great beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Citrus forward, juicy with a nice bitterness, medium bodied...a solid DIPA from Toppling Goliath but a step below King Sue/Sosus."
"had this a few times with their past releases. This is a tropical juice bomb combined with some potent bitterness. It for sure is true to its name and this is one of my favorite TG IPAs. I wish they did it more. Semi hazy, but more comparable to a HF IPA that perfect the haze/bitter combo."
A: hazy; medium gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a thin collar; nice lacing;
A big thanks to Jeff for this one. 750ml capped bottle into a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303. 
"L (4.25) - Hazy dark orange coloration. Bright white, tight bubbles on top."
Another incredible DIPA from TG. I think this is second to only King Sue. Incredible juicy flavor that sticks around forever. Flavors of juicy citrus fruits and pineapple. I can't quite equate a single IPA from TG to this but I hope they come up with something!
Another great DIPA from TG. Super fruity and tropical with a nice bite of bitterness at the end. Goes down super easy for a big beer because it's juicy and hides it's ABV very well. I wish TG was in my distro.
Shared approx. 1 month after bottling out of TG Bomber
Poured from a 22oz bomber into a teku. 
"22 ounces of beer that begs for savaging if it doesn’t live up to its name. Split with my wife after an afternoon of BCS. No more stout, please. "
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an IPA glass.
Very fresh Bomber to glass. Pours a slight hazed golden yellow color with a fresh soapy whit head. Smell is tropical fruit fresh and juicy. Taste is right away juicy tropical fruit pineapple and mango at first some citrus with a fresh pine finish. mouth feel is very hoppy its dry and fruity with a great pine.tropic finish clean and crisp. Really liked this @IPA very east to finish bottle.
"While not possessing the ultimate hazy look that you tend to associate with a NE IPA, it's still dusty enough to give you that impression. Dank and citrusy in the nose and the taste, effervescent mouthfeel, and outstanding overall brew."
"Appearance: Slightly hazy yellow, huge head."
"How can I be finding all these incredible, fruity IPAs lately? A 22 oz bomber from Toppling Goliath. What more can I ask for?"
L: Light yellow/orange translucent hues with a healthy white foamy head - the lacing on my glass was incredible
"Finally! After being a bit underwhelmed by PseudoSue and Xhops, it's great to finally find a hoppy beer from TG that lives up to the hype. I realize Pseudo and X are APAs and this is a DIPA, but the flavor is so much better. I'm surprised more people are seeking this out."
Original score 4.44 from the first batch.
"Great beer here, got a pair of bombers in a recent trade and this was a real treat. I found it to be very ""east coast"" in style, great in every aspect and would certainly trade for again."
Soooo Tropical!!!
"Bomber. Pours murky yellow orange with a slight pink hue. Finger white head fades slowly, rings stick to the side. Big citrusy tropical fruit aroma. Taste follows, very juicy as expected with pineapple and orange, but then hits hard with bitter grapefruit peel that lasts the rest of the way through. Finish is palate scraping dry and bitter. Medium soft mouth. Of the big juicy DIPAs, this has been the most bitter yet, all 100 IBUs are present. Very good brew for a hop head."
"A: Soft, hazy, orange. Mimosa/OJ color and look. Great looking beer. All that needs to be said. "
Pour - golden with a nice crown of head
Poured into a tulip glass from a 22oz bomber. Great golden color with a decent amount of head. Very hoppy scent and taste. Absolutely amazing! Good balance of citrus and hops. I wish I lived closer to the brewery in order to get this every time the brew it.
Poured into a tulip glass.
Received in Trade
"World Class, in my opinion, the BEST TG IPA."
"It doesn't get much better than this, but then again, it's Toppling Goliath, so what else would you expect? It's like orange juice in a glass. Simply amazing. If you put a gun to my head and made me give a critique, it's SLIGHTLY boozy as it warms up. But if you criticize this beer, you're nitpicking. I'm thankful I was able to try it."
L: very hazy/cloudy darker gold. Gave a semi unagressive pour and would have expected more head.
"Fresh bottle right from the brewery. Poured into a snifter style glass. Color is straw and cloudy. Light head with good mouth feel, almost creamy mouth feel. The smell is the best part. It smells like you just cracked open a fresh papaya with some mango thrown in. The taste is smooth light alcohol taste but not the booze I would expect on a IIPA. As always TG does it again."
"Excellent DIPA. Tastes almost identical to Heady Topper with that same hoppy finish. Not as juicy as some others, but very very good."
Minimal head but a very attractive murky yellow. Smell and flavor are both intense tropical fruit although I don't get the pineapple specifically mentioned on the bottle. More bitter than a lot of their offerings.
22oz Bottle.
A - Cloudy yellow with moderate carbonation. Noticeable lacing on the glass.
poured 22oz bottle into snifter. Bottled about a week ago. 
"Very hazy, straw colored, and thin but lasting head. Very juicy like the finest TG IPA's. Orange, grapefruit, and other citrus notes. Absolutely fantastic beer. One TG's finest IPA's. I wish they brewed this more."
650ml bottle. Served in a TG snifter on 9/29/2015.
Dank Dank Dank. Herb like bitter then sweet fruit juicy zang. Nice and thick carbonation with a sweet finish and dank after taste. Lots of tastes going on from first sip to last.
"This is a crazy good, hoppy, explosive beer. The carbonation is crisp, the aroma is citrus and pine and the taste is magnificent. The mouth feel is fantastic on this beer, truly and awesome beer. I would buy this, store this, seek this out."
